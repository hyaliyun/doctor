Nonetheless, diagnosis in this context it is occasionally challenging. We sought to evaluate the kinetics and diagnostic accuracy of the new biomarker ? heart-type fatty acid-binding protein ? (h-FABP) in the early detection of myocardial injury in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, compared with classical biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted on 17 consecutive patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting during a 2 month period. Blood samples were drawn for measurement of myocardial ischemic injury biomarkers (h-FABP, troponin, creatine kinase [CK] and CK-MB), at baseline (T1), immediate post-coronary artery bypass grafting (T2), on ICU admission (T3), and after 4 (T4), 8 (T5), 24 (T6) and 48 h (T7). Perioperative ischemic complications, defined according to electrocardiographic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic criteria, were recorded. RESULTS Earlier biomarkers peak plasma values occurred at T4 with troponin (2.9  5.2 ng/mL), and at T5 with h-FABP (37.9  55.5 ng/mL). Maximum values of CK and CK-MB occurred later, both in T6 (741  779 and 37  51 U/L, respectively). The optimized cut-off obtained for h-FABP was 19 ng/mL, providing a sensitivity and specificity of 77 and 75%, respectively, for diagnosis of perioperative ischemic injury, with an area under the ROC curve for h-FABP of 0.83 (95% CI 0.6-1.0) vs. 0.63 (95% CI 0.33-0.83) for troponin. This cut-off value for h-FABP is reached on average at T2 (mean value of h-FABP at T2: 18.9  21.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSION This is the first study evaluating the kinetics of h-FABP biomarker in perioperative off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, and the cut-off value established could help to extend earlier detection of myocardial ischemia in this context.","output":"[Evaluation of postoperative myocardial injury by heart-type fatty acid-binding protein in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic posed a serious public health concern and started a race against time for researchers to discover an effective and safe therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.

Group A rotaviruses (RV-A) are the main etiological agent of acute viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. Understanding the extent and causes of biases in codon usage is essential to the understanding of viral evolution. However, the factors shaping synonymous codon usage bias and nucleotide composition in human RV-A are currently unknown. In order to gain insight into these matters, we analyzed the codon usage and base composition constraints on the two genes that codify the two outer capsid proteins (VP4 [VP8*] and VP7) of 58 P[4]G2 RV-A strains isolated in Brazil and investigated the possible key evolutionary determinants of codon usage bias. The results of these studies revealed that the frequencies of codon usage in both RV-A proteins studied are significantly different than the ones used by human cells. In order to observe if similar trends of codon usage are found when RV-A complete genomes are considered, we compare these results with results found using a dataset of 10 reference strains for whom the complete codes of the 11 segments are known. Similar results were obtained using capsid proteins or complete genomes. The general correlations found between the position of each sequence on the first axis generated by correspondence analysis and the relative dinucleotide abundances indicate that codon usage in RV-A can also be strongly influenced by underlying biases in dinucleotide frequencies. CpG and GpC containing codons are markedly suppressed. Thus, the results of this study suggest that RV-A genomic biases are the result of the evolution of genome composition in relation to host adaptation and the ability to escape antiviral cell responses.","output":"Analysis of human P[4]G2 rotavirus strains isolated in Brazil reveals codon usage bias and strong compositional constraints"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Haemorrhagic cholecystitis (HC) is a rare cause of cholecystitis that can be fatal if management is delayed.

Researchers around the world are dedicated to finding the treatment clues for COVID-19. Drug repositioning, as a rapid and cost-effective way for finding therapeutic options from available FDA-approved drugs, has been applied to drug discovery for COVID-19. In this study, we develop a novel drug repositioning method (VDA-KLMF) to prioritize possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs integrating virus sequences, drug chemical structures, known Virus-Drug Associations, and Logistic Matrix Factorization with Kernel diffusion. First, Gaussian kernels of viruses and drugs are built based on known VDAs and nearest neighbors. Second, sequence similarity kernel of viruses and chemical structure similarity kernel of drugs are constructed based on biological features and an identity matrix. Third, Gaussian kernel and similarity kernel are diffused. Forth, a logistic matrix factorization model with kernel diffusion is proposed to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Finally, molecular dockings between the inferred antiviral drugs and the junction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 interface are implemented to investigate the binding abilities between them. VDA-KLMF is compared with two state-of-the-art VDA prediction models (VDA-KATZ and VDA-RWR) and three classical association prediction methods (NGRHMDA, LRLSHMDA, and NRLMF) based on 5-fold cross validations on viruses, drugs, and VDAs on three datasets. It obtains the best recalls, AUCs, and AUPRs, significantly outperforming other five methods under the three different cross validations. We observe that four chemical agents coming together on any two datasets, that is, remdesivir, ribavirin, nitazoxanide, and emetine, may be the clues of treatment for COVID-19. The docking results suggest that the key residues K353 and G496 may affect the binding energies and dynamics between the inferred anti-SARS-CoV-2 chemical agents and the junction of the spike protein-ACE2 interface.

It also represents the main receptor for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syn-drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused a serious epidemic COVID-19. Available evi-dence indicates that at the cell membrane, ACE2 can form heteromeric complexes with other mem-brane proteins, including the amino acid transporter B0AT1 and G protein-coupled receptors (G-PCR). Objective: It is well known that during the formation of quaternary structures, the configuration of every single monomer is re-shaped by its interaction pattern in the macromolecular complex. There-fore, it can be hypothesized that the affinity of ACE2 to the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD), when in a heteromeric complex, may depend on the associated partner. Methods: By using established docking and molecular dynamics procedures, the reshaping of monomer was explored in silico to predict possible heterodimeric structures between ACE2 and GPCR, such as angiotensin and bradykinin receptors. The associated possible changes in the bind-ing affinity between the viral RBD and ACE2 when in the heteromeric complexes were also esti-mated. Results and Conclusion: The results provided support to the hypothesis that the heteromerization state of ACE2 may modulate its affinity to the viral RBD. If experimentally confirmed, ACE2 heteromerization may contribute to explain the observed differences in susceptibility to virus infec-tion among individuals and to devise new therapeutic opportunities.","output":"Heteromerization As a Mechanism Modulating the Affinity of the ACE2 Receptor to the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 infection has emerged as a rapidly spreading infection.

Monitoring the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic is of strategic importance and requires the use of sensitive tools for epidemiological surveillance, including consistent analyses that allow the recognition of areas with a greater propensity for increased severity throughout the cycle of the epidemic. This study aims to classify neighborhoods in the city of Fortaleza according to their propensity for a severe epidemic of COVID-19 in 2020. Methods: : We conducted an ecological study within the geographical area of the 119 neighborhoods located in the city of Fortaleza. To define the main transmission networks (infection chains), we assumed that the spatial diffusion of the COVID-19 epidemic was influenced by population mobility. To measure the propensity for a severe epidemic, we calculated the infectivity burden (I ty B), infection burden (I on B), and population epidemic vulnerability index (PEVI). The propensity score for a severe epidemic in the neighborhoods of the city of Fortaleza was estimated by combining the I on B and PEVI. Results: : The neighborhoods with the highest propensity for a severe COVID-19 epidemic were Aldeota, Cais do Porto, Centro, Edson Queiroz, Vicente Pinzon, Jose de Alencar, Presidente Kennedy, Papicu, Vila Velha, Antonio Bezerra, and Cambeba. Importantly, we found that the propensity for a COVID-19 epidemic was high in areas with differing socioeconomic profiles. These areas include a very poor neighborhood situated on the western border of the city (Vila Velha), neighborhoods characterized by a large number of subnormal agglomerates in the Cais do Porto region (Vicente Pinzon), and those located in the oldest central area of the city, where despite the wealth, low-income groups have remained (Aldeota and the adjacent Edson Queiroz).

To reduce leakage e.g. during exercise, a face mask was developed that is taped onto the face. The aim of this study was to investigate during a graded cycle ergometry test the effect of a taped mask on the perception of breathlessness, heart rate, lactate, and oxygen saturation when compared to a surgical mask and no mask. Methods: : Four trained and healthy males and females each (n=8 in total) performed incremental cycle ergometer tests until voluntary exhaustion under three conditions: (1) No mask/control, (2) surgical mask or (3) taped mask. During these tests, we measured perception of breathlessness, heart rate, the concentration of blood lactate and peripheral oxygen saturation and analysed the resultant data with one or two-way repeated measures ANOVAs.

Design/methodology/approach: A scoping review was conducted to examine the learning outcomes within and between online and face-to-face (F2F) university teaching programmes. Findings: Although previous research has supported a no significant difference position, the review of 91 comparative studies during 2000C2020 identified 37 (41%) which found online teaching was associated with better learning outcomes, 17 (18%) which favoured F2F and 37 (41%) reporting no significant difference. Purpose-developed online content which supports student-led enquiry and cognitive challenge were cited as factors supporting better learning outcomes. Research limitations/implications: This study adopts a pre-defined methodology in reviewing literature which ensures rigour in identifying relevant studies. The large sample of studies (n = 91) supported the comparison of discrete learning modes although high variability in key concepts and outcome variables made it difficult to directly compare some studies. A lack of methodological rigour was observed in some studies.

Following a series of important CTL decisions, a universal position of the senior judiciary, one supportive of government, is emerging: despite the case backlog resulting in defendants facing trial delays of unknown length, the exceptional circumstances of the pandemic which the executive faces, amounts to 'good cause' to extend CTLs. It will be argued that the correct approach for courts to follow is that that they must hear evidence that justifies why no court rooms are available before using that to mandate extensions.

Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D  3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19.

The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among university students during the period of the first lockdown in Germany, and the associations of possible risk and protective factors with all three outcome variables. METHODS: A total of 2.548 university students were included in the study. The study took place during the period of the first lockdown in Germany. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to explore the role of demographic variables, personality traits, psychological capital variables, mindfulness, COVID-19 related variables, and coping strategies on anxiety, depression and stress. RESULTS: Results showed on average mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and moderate perceived stress among the students. Alarmingly, 35.9% of the students showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 27.7% reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 25.1% perceived high stress. Mindfulness and optimism were the most relevant protective factors against depression, anxiety and stress, whereas COVID-related stressors (e.g., worries about study and financial problems, being stressed by the Corona-pandemic and media reporting, quarantine experience) as well as personal characteristics (e.g., neuroticism, older age, being female) were risk factors for increasing mental health issues and/ or stress. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of students.

Yet, the sequence of the entire virus genome from China in the current public database is very unevenly distributed with reference to time and place of collection. In particular, only one sequence was obtained in Henan province, adjacent to China's worst-case province, Hubei Province. Herein, we used high-throughput sequencing techniques to get 19 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 18 severe patients admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, a provincial designated hospital for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases in Henan province. The demographic, baseline, and clinical characteristics of these patients were described. To investigate the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 of the current COVID-19 outbreak in China, 729 genome sequences (including 19 sequences from this study) sampled from Mainland China were analyzed with state-of-the-art comprehensive methods, including likelihood-mapping, split network, ML phylogenetic, and Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analyses. We estimated that the evolutionary rate and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 from Mainland China were 9.25 x 10(-4) substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 6.75 x 10(-4) to 1.28 x 10(-3)) and October 1, 2019 (95% BCI: August 22, 2019 to November 6, 2019), respectively.

The Covid-19 outbreak has led to a lot of stress and anxiety among CHWs as they are expected to perform pandemic related tasks along with the delivery of essential healthcare services. In addition, movement restrictions, lockdowns, social distancing, and lack of protective gear have significantly affected CHWs routine workflow and performance. To optimize CHWs functioning, there is a renewed interest in supporting CHWs with digital technology to ensure an appropriate pandemic response. DISCUSSION: The current situation has necessitated the use of digital tools for the delivery of Covid-19 related tasks and other essential healthcare services at the community level. Evidence suggests that there has been a significant digital transformation to support CHWs in these critical times such as remote data collection and health assessments, the use of short message service and voice message for health education, use of digital megaphones for encouraging behavior change, and digital contract tracing. A few LMICs such as Uganda and Ethiopia have been successful in operationalizing digital tools to optimize CHWs functioning for Covid-19 tasks and other essential health services. CONCLUSION: Yet, in most LMICs, there are some challenges concerning the feasibility and acceptability of using digital tools for CHWs during the Covid-19 pandemic. In most cases, CHWs find it difficult to adopt and use digital health solutions due to lack of training on new digital tools, weak technical support, issues of internet connectivity, and other administrative related challenges. To address these challenges, engaging governments would be essential for training CHWs on user-friendly digital health solutions to improve routine workflow of CHWs during the Covid-19 pandemic.","output":"Equipping community health workers with digital tools for pandemic response in LMICs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel COVID-19 global pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern affecting 215 countries and territories around the globe.

Clinical manifestations and laboratory tests were compared, and univariate binary logistic regression and multivariate regression analyses were applied to assess potential risk factors. A total of 126 patients were recruited from January 23 to March 23, 2020. Ninety cases were identified as the common type and 36 as the severe type. The average age in the severe group was significantly older than that in the common group (P = .008). Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of dyspnea (P = .001), weakness (P = .023), and diarrhea (P = .046). Moreover, there were more patients with hypertension (P = .01) or coinfection (P = .001) in the severe group than in the common group. Additionally, severe COVID-19 was associated with increased neutrophil counts (P < .001), C-reactive protein (P < .001), procalcitonin (P = .024) and decreased lymphocyte counts (P = .001), hemoglobin (P < .001), total protein (TP) (P < .001), and albumin (ALB) (P < .001). Based on logistic regression analysis, dyspnea (P < .001), TP (P = .042), and ALB (P = .003) were independent risk factors for severe disease.

Interferon (IFN)- has noncytolytic antiviral potential; however, elimination of cccDNA could not be achieved. To enhance the regulatory effect, we comprehensively analyzed the host factors associated with cccDNA amplification and IFN- and IFN- effects using an in vitro HBV infection system exhibiting various transcription levels. METHODS Primary human hepatocytes were infected with HBV using genomic plasmids carrying the basic core promoter mutation A1762T/G1764A and/or the precore mutation G1896A and treated with IFN- and IFN-. Comprehensive and functional studies involving microarray and small interfering RNA analysis revealed the host factors related to cccDNA regulation. RESULTS The HBV infection system reproduced the HBV life cycle and exhibited various propagation levels. Microarray analysis revealed 53 genes correlated with the cccDNA levels. Of the 53 genes, expression of IFN-induced protein 44-like (IFI44L) was significantly upregulated by IFN- and IFN-. The anti-HBV effect of IFI44L exerts regardless of IFN- and IFN- by inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor kappa B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 pathways. CONCLUSIONS Using the in vitro HBV infection system, an IFN-inducible molecule, IFI44L, associated with cccDNA amplification, was identified.

One side recognizes the microbial antigen, and the other gives a call to arms to fight infection by recruiting immune cells and triggering inflammation. A balanced immune response must combine a potent neutralizing antibody and a swift disposal of the invading agent by innate immune cells with the least tissue damage possible. The longer the immune system takes to control the infection, the higher the possibility for a self-sustaining inflammatory process with potentially fatal consequences for the host. In addition to quantity, the quality of antibodies also matters, because posttranslational modifications altering the N-glycan composition in Fc fractions may help tilt the balance to the effector side, by modifying their affinity for Fc receptors in immune cells. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a wealth of data bolstering our understanding of the rules governing the production of protective and nonprotective antibodies. Also, it has broadened our understanding of the role of viruses in triggering autoimmunity and inflammation, and widened our knowledge of the different mechanisms that can be activated by viral infection and lead to autoantibody production, inflammation, and progressive tissue damage.

Subsequently, the molecular docking method was performed to select the active compounds with high binding affinity on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the key target of SARS-CoV-2 in entering target cells. The possible binding sites were also visualized by a three-dimensional graph. Results: Network pharmacology analysis showed that there were 106 active components and 160 targets of CLD. Additionally, 251 targets related to COVID-19 were identified, and 24 candidates of CLD on COVID-19 were selected. A total of 283 GO terms of CLD on COVID-19 were identified, and 181 pathways were screened based on GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. CLD might alleviate the inflammatory response and improve lung injury to treat COVID-19 through interleukin 17 signaling, T helper cell 17 differentiation, tumor necrosis factor signaling, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 signaling. Besides, molecular docking indicated that beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, and stigmasterol were the top three candidates in CLD with the highest affinity to SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. Conclusion: Our study identifies the potential mechanisms of CLD on COVID-19 and beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, and stigmasterol may be the key compounds that exert antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Network pharmacology studies on the effect of Chai-Ling decoction in coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is affecting people around the globe, is a respiratory disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that has reached the pandemic state. It is known that people who are vulnerable but who are not immunocompromised can still suffer from serious complications of COVID-19. The general nutritional status and food consumption patterns of each individual affect the functioning of his or her immune system. The effects of these patterns can occur at the level of physical barriers, the microbiome, the innate immune system, and the adaptive immune system. Immune system cells and mediators, which are essential to the inflammatory response, are in the structures of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates and act through vitamins and minerals. The combination of chronic infection and malnutrition disrupts the immune response, affects the amount of immune cells, and increases inflammatory mediators. Dietary fat (in terms of both amount and type) affects cytokine biology, making the former a key player in inflammatory disease; also having an important role as macronutrients, because of how they affect immune cells and function. This review explores the role of dietary fat in the immune response, highlighting the role in protecting the individual from COVID-19 and mitigating the cytokine storm in the infection phase.","output":"Effects of Dietary Fats on Immune System Response in Covid-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection of the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) significantly impacted human society. Recently, the synthetic pure glucocorticoid dexamethasone was identified as an effective compound for treatment of severe COVID-19. However, glucocorticoids are generally harmful for infectious diseases, such as bacterial sepsis and severe influenza pneumonia, which can develop respiratory failure and systemic inflammation similar to COVID-19. This apparent inconsistency suggests the presence of pathologic mechanism(s) unique to COVID-19 that renders this steroid effective. We review plausible mechanisms and advance the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection is accompanied by infected cell-specific glucocorticoid insensitivity as reported for some other viruses. This alteration in local glucocorticoid actions interferes with undesired glucocorticoid to facilitate viral replication but does not affect desired anti-inflammatory properties in non-infected organs/tissues. We postulate that the virus coincidentally causes glucocorticoid insensitivity in the process of modulating host cell activities for promoting its replication in infected cells. We explore this tenet focusing on SARS-CoV-2-encoding proteins and potential molecular mechanisms supporting this hypothetical glucocorticoid insensitivity unique to COVID-19 but not characteristic of other life-threatening viral diseases, probably due to a difference in specific virally-encoded molecules and host cell activities modulated by them.","output":"Dexamethasone for Severe COVID-19: How Does It Work at Cellular and Molecular Levels?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumen En la actualidad, la situacin de la lucha mundial contra COVID-19 es grave.

Currently, there are no effective therapies available for ARDS. We have recently reported that a novel small molecule AVR-25 derived from chitin molecule (a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine) showed anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs. The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of two chitin-derived compounds, AVR-25 and AVR-48, in multiple mouse models of ALI/ARDS. We further determined the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the lead compound AVR-48 in rats. METHODS: ALI in mice was induced by intratracheal instillation of a single dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 g) for 24 h or exposed to hyperoxia (100% oxygen) for 48 h or undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) procedure and observation for 10 days. RESULTS: Both chitin derivatives, AVR-25 and AVR-48, showed decreased neutrophil recruitment and reduced inflammation in the lungs of ALI mice. Further, AVR-25 and AVR-48 mediated diminished lung inflammation was associated with reduced expression of lung adhesion molecules with improvement in pulmonary endothelial barrier function, pulmonary edema, and lung injury. Consistent with these results, CLP-induced sepsis mice treated with AVR-48 showed a significant increase in survival of the mice (80%) and improved lung histopathology in the treated CLP group. AVR-48, the lead chitin derivative compound, demonstrated a good safety profile. CONCLUSION: Both AVR-25 and AVR-48 demonstrate the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents to treat ALI/ARDS.","output":"Small Immunomodulatory Molecules as Potential Therapeutics in Experimental Murine Models of Acute Lung Injury (ALI)/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the various strategies for the prevention of airborne transmission, engineering measures are placed high in the hierarchy of control. Modern hospitals in high-income countries have mechanical systems of building ventilation also called HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) but installation and maintenance of such systems is a challenging and resource-intensive task. Even when the state-of-the-art technology was used to build airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs), recommended standards were often not met in field studies. The current coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has highlighted the need to find cost-effective and less resource-intensive engineering solutions. Moreover, there is a need for the involvement of interdisciplinary teams to find innovative infection control solutions and doctors are frequently lacking in their understanding of building ventilation-related problems as well as their possible solutions. The current article describes building ventilation strategies (natural ventilation and hybrid ventilation) for hospitals where HVAC systems are either lacking or do not meet the recommended standards. Other measures like the use of portable air cleaning technologies and temporary negative-pressure rooms can be used as supplementary strategies in situations of demand surge. It can be easily understood that thermal comfort is compromised in buildings that are not mechanically fitted with HVAC systems, therefore the given building ventilation strategies are more helpful when climatic conditions are moderate or other measures are combined to maintain thermal comfort.

Mind-body interventions have improved concentration, emotional balance, and positive emotions, with an enhanced sense of productivity, and self-confidence. We therefore hypothesized that exposure to an online mind-body intervention, Inner Engineering Completion Online (IECO), would reduce stress and promote well-being. METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled participants registered for the IECO courses, which for the first time were delivered remotely, online. Participants learned a 21-min meditation practice called Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya during the course, which incorporates controlled breathing and mediation techniques. Each enrolled participant was asked to complete self-reported electronic surveys at three key time points: at the time of consent, immediately after completing IECO, and 6 weeks after IECO completion. Effects of IECO practice were assessed using four well-validated neuropsychological scales: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive Emotion/Relationship/Engagement Scale (PERMA) Profiler, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). A Signed Rank test was used to analyze the survey data and P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 375 participants interested in participation, 164 participants were eligible. Sixty-eight participants completed surveys at all time points and were identified as compliant participants. The baseline median score for PSS in compliant participants (n = 95) was 13.5 (IQR 9, 18); immediate post-IECO median PSS score was 12 (IQR 8, 16) demonstrating a 1.5 unit decrease in PSS scores (p-value = 0.0023). Similarly, comparing PSS scores in compliant participants (n = 68) for immediate Post IECO [11.5 (IQR 8, 15.5)] to PSS scores at six weeks [8 (IQR 4.5, 12.5)] showed a statistically significant 3.5-unit decrease, indicating a reduction in stress upon routine practice of the intervention (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Incorporating the remotely delivered mind-body intervention Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya into daily life via the IECO program over as few as 6 weeks produced a significant stress reduction, improvement in sleep quality and mindfulness.

METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 (as confirmed by RT-PCR) and renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Their clinical profiles and outcomes were analysed, vis--vis the changing disease severity. FINDINGS: A total of 483 patients were included, of whom 416 had end-stage renal disease and were on maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who were symptomatic at presentation had significantly higher levels of Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), higher degrees of lung involvement (p < 0.001) and required more respiratory support (p < 0.001). The overall mortality observed was 18.8%. In the late phases of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in disease severity without a statistically significant increase in mortality. Predictors of mortality on univariate analysis were age, diabetes mellitus, acute on chronic kidney disease, presence of symptoms on admission, NLR, CRP, LDH, computed tomography (CT) chest grades 3 and 4, and need for respiratory support; however, only age and the renal syndrome of acute on chronic kidney disease retained significance on multivariate analysis (p0.003 and p0.019, respectively).

To meet this need, several large new data consortia have developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands.

INTERVENTIONS: Analysis of semen quality and sperm DNA methylation patterns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Semen quality evaluated by semen analysis, and sperm DNA methylation patterns investigated using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform. RESULT(S): Men with varicocele displayed decreased semen quality. The sperm DNA methylation analysis showed that men with varicocele exhibit global hypomethylation in comparison with the control group. A total of 59 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified, most of them hypomethylated in the varicocele group. In regional analyses, 1,695 DNA regions were differentially methylated in men with varicocele. These regions show associations with gamete generation, meiotic and meiosis cell cycle, and semen quality based on gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSION(S): Gene ontology results suggest that changes in methylation may be associated with the low semen quality phenotype observed in some varicocele patients because the observed differentially methylated regions in varicocele patients are related to male reproductive pathways.

Thus, it offers a good complement in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) facing high costs of testing or social stigmatization, and it has a huge potential to monitor SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to curb the global COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this review is to systematize the current evidence about the application of the WBE approach in mass surveillance of COVID-19 infection in LMICs, as well as its future potential. Among other parameters, population size contributing the fecal input to wastewater is an important parameter for COVID-19 prevalence estimation. It is easier to back-calculate COVID-19 prevalence in the community with centralized wastewater systems, because there can be more accurate estimates about the size of contributing population in the catchment. However, centralized wastewater management systems are often of low quality (or even non-existent) in LMICs, which raises a major concern about the ability to implement the WBE approach. However, it is possible to mobilize the WBE approach, if large areas are divided into sub-areas, corresponding to the existing wastewater management systems. In addition, a strong coordination between stakeholders is required for estimating population size respective to wastewater management systems. Nevertheless, further international efforts should be leveraged to strengthen the sanitation infrastructures in LMICs, using the lessons gathered from the current COVID-19 pandemic to be prepared for future pandemics.","output":"Wastewater-Based Epidemiology for Cost-Effective Mass Surveillance of COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Challenges and Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented global turmoil and a halt on international tourism.

At baseline and afterwards, the eyes underwent ophthalmological examinations. RESULTS The study included seven patients (mean age:70.012.2 years (range: 54-86 years), with five patients receiving a single injection and two patients receiving two intravitreal injections in an interval of 4 weeks. Mean duration of follow-up was 9797 days (median:35 days; range: 7-240 days). Mean BCVA was lower at baseline than at study end (1.410.44 logMAR vs 0.970.12 logMAR; p=0.03).

This study aimed to examine the value and significance of avatars based on firsthand accounts from regular and problematic gamers, and to identify any potential links between avatar-related experiences and excessive gaming. METHODS: An online survey of 993 adult gamers yielded 3,972 text responses. Qualitative analysis of 59,059 words extracted 10 categories of avatar-related perspectives. RESULTS: Some problem and non-problem gamers employed sentimental language (e.g., dear friend, like a child, part of my soul) to refer to their avatar. However, most participants perceived avatars as a means of achieving in-game goals and enabling greater interactivity (e.g., socializing). When asked to reflect on hypothetically losing their avatar, participants generally anticipated feeling temporary frustration or annoyance due to lost time and effort invested into the avatar. Although some participants reported that their avatar mattered, avatars were often considered as superficial (just pixels) and peripheral to the primary reinforcement of achieving in-game rewards and objectives. Some broader psychological and identity issues such as gender dysphoria, rather than addiction, were cited as motivating persistent avatar-related interactions and attachment. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Participants reported diverse views on the psychological value and function of avatars, but the relationship between avatars and problematic gaming or GD was largely unclear or inconsistent, and refuted by some participants. Future research with clinical samples may lead to a better understanding of player-avatar processes, including whether avatar-stimuli facilitate the development of maladaptive gaming habits, particularly among psychologically vulnerable players. Future investigations should be mindful of overpathologizing avatar-related phenomena and recognize their important role in socializing, storytelling, and creative expression among gamers.","output":"Player-avatar interactions in habitual and problematic gaming: A qualitative investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exposure to air pollutants has been associated with respiratory viral infections.

Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. METHODS: This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with &#8805; 5 years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of &#8805; 10 (N = 1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04153864 .

Eight healthy and na?ve subjects performed wrist contractions during two degrees of freedom goal-oriented tasks, divided in three groups of type I, type II, and type III. The performance of these tasks, when the two different methods were used, was quantified by completion rate, completion time, throughput, efficiency, and overshoot. The traditional and the FDT method were compared in four runs, using combinations of normal or high muscle contraction level, and the traditional method or FDT. The results indicated that FDT had an advantage over traditional methods in the tested real-time myoelectric control tasks. FDT had a much better median completion rate of tasks (95%) compared to the traditional method (77.5%) among non-perfect runs, and the variability in FDT was strikingly smaller than the traditional method (p < 0.001). Moreover, the FDT method outperformed the traditional method in case of contraction-level variation between the training and online control phases (p = 0. 005 for throughput in type I tasks with normal contraction level, p = 0.006 for throughput in type II tasks, and p = 0.001 for efficiency with normal contraction level of all task types).

Univariate and multivariate logistic models were used to evaluate the trends, histological results, and the factors influencing use of pre-cryoablation biopsy. RESULTS: In total, 871 patients (median (IQR) age, 69 (14), 298 women) undergoing cryoablation were evaluated. The use of pre-cryoablation biopsy has significantly increased from 42% (65/156) in 2015 to 72% (88/122) in 2019 (p < 0.001). Patients treated for a benign histology are significantly more likely to have presented later in the trend, where pre-cryoablation biopsy is more prevalent (OR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.51C0.81, p < 0.001). Patients treated for undiagnosed histology are also significantly less likely to have presented in 2018 compared to 2016 (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10C0.97, p = 0.044). Patients aged 70+ are less likely to be biopsies pre-cryoablation (p < 0.05). R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score of 10+ and a Charlson Comorbidity Index > 1 are factors associated with lower likelihood to not have received a pre-cryoablation biopsy (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An increased use of pre-cryoablation biopsy was observed and cryoablation patients treated with a benign histology are more likely to have presented in periods where pre-cryoablation biopsy is not as prevalent. Comparative studies are needed to draw definitive conclusions on the effect of pre-cryoablation biopsy on SRM treatments. KEY POINTS: ?

We evaluated the utility of a combination orthogonal serological testing (COST) algorithm alongside RT-PCR to quantify prevalence with the aim of identifying candidate patient clusters to receive single and/or delayed vaccination. METHODS: We utilized 108,505 patients with suspected COVID-19 in a retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR vs. IgG-nucleocapsid (IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt;) antibody testing coverage in routine practice for the estimation of prevalence. Prospectively, an independent cohort of 21,388 subjects was simultaneously tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt; to determine the prevalence. We used 614 prospective study subjects to assess the utility of COST (IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt;, IgM-spike (IgM&lt;sub&gt;SP&lt;/sub&gt;), and IgG-spike (IgG&lt;sub&gt;SP&lt;/sub&gt;)) in establishing the infection proportion to identify a single-dose vaccination cohort. RESULTS: Retrospectively, we observed a 6.3% (6871/108,505) positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and only 2.3% (2533/108,505) of cases had paired IgG&lt;sub&gt;NC&lt;/sub&gt; serology performed.

Aim: This bibliometric analysis aimed to provide a first glimpse into the KP in MD, with a focus on GM research in this field, to guide future research and promote the development of this field. Methods: Publications relating to the KP in MD between the years 2000 and 2020 were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), and analyzed in CiteSpace (5.7 R5W), biblioshiny (using R-Studio), and VOSviewer (1.6.16). Results: In total, 1,064 and 948 documents were extracted from the Scopus and WoSCC databases, respectively. The publications have shown rapid growth since 2006, partly owing to the largest research hotspot appearing since then, quinolinic acid. All the top five most relevant journals were in the neuropsychiatry field, such as Brain Behavior and Immunity. The United States and Innsbruck Medical University were the most influential country and institute, respectively. Journal co-citation analysis showed a strong tendency toward co-citation of research in the psychiatry field. Reference co-citation analysis revealed that the top four most important research focuses were kynurenine pathway, psychoneuroimmunology, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, and proinflammatory cytokines, and the most recent focus was gut-brain axis, thus indicating the role of the KP in bridging the GM and the host immune system, and together reflecting the fields research foundations. Overlap analysis between the thematic map of keywords and the keyword burst analysis revealed that the topics Alzheimers disease, prefrontal cortex, and acid, were research frontiers.

It is an important grain after wheat, but little is known about its water requirements and, most importantly, how it responds to water stress. Determining when water stress sets in and how malt barley responds to water deficit during its growing season is crucial for improved management of crop water requirements. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the response of transpiration (T), stomatal conductance (SC), and leaf water potential (LWP) to water stress for different growth stages of malt barley and to characterise water stress to different levels (mild, moderate, and severe). This was achieved by monitoring the water stress indicators (soil- and plant based) under greenhouse conditions in well-watered and water-stressed lysimeters over two seasons. Water stress was characterised into different levels with the aid of soil water content 'breaking points' procedure. During the first season, at the end of tillering, flag leaf, and milk/dough growth stages, which represent severe water stress, plant available water (PAW) was below 35%, 56%, 14%, and 36%, respectively. LWP responded in accordance to depletion of soil water during the growing season, with the lowest recorded value to -5.5 MPa at the end of the milk/dough growth stage in the first season. Results also show that inducing water stress resulted in high variability of T and SC for both seasons. In the second season, plants severely stressed during the anthesis growth stage recorded the least total grains per pot (TGPP), with 29.86 g of grains. The study suggests that malt barley should be prevented from experiencing severe water stress during the anthesis and milk/dough stages for optimum malt barley production. Quantification of stress into different levels will enable the evaluation of the impact of different levels of stress on the development, growth, and yield of barley.","output":"Characterisation and Effects of Different Levels of Water Stress at Different Growth Stages in Malt Barley under Water-Limited Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to identify factors that affect potential travellers in the phase of gathering information and evaluating alternatives within the shopping model of consumer behaviour.

Several innovative implementations of HIVST have been developed and piloted among some HIV high-risk populations like men who have sex with men (MSM) to meet the global testing target. One innovative strategy is the secondary distribution of HIVST, in which individuals (defined as indexes) were given multiple testing kits for both self-use (i.e.self-testing) and distribution to other people in their MSM social network (defined as alters). Studies about secondary HIVST distribution have mainly concentrated on developing new intervention approaches to further increase the effectiveness of this relatively new strategy from the perspective of traditional public health discipline. There are many points of HIVST secondary distribution in which mathematical modelling can play an important role. In this study, we considered secondary HIVST kits distribution in a resource-constrained situation and proposed two data-driven integer linear programming models to maximize the overall economic benefits of secondary HIVST kits distribution based on our present implementation data from Chinese MSM. The objective function took expansion of normal alters and detection of positive and newly-tested 'alters' into account.

Here, we propose a simple and immediate clustering approach to categorize Italian regions working on the prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases prior to the start of phase two on 4 May 2020. Applying both hierarchical and k-means clustering, we identified three regional groups: regions in cluster 1 exhibited higher prevalence and the highest trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases; those classified into cluster 2 constituted an intermediate group; those in cluster 3 were regions with a lower prevalence and the lowest trend of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. At the provincial level, we used a similar approach but working on the prevalence and trend of the total SARS-CoV-2 cases. Notably, provinces in cluster 1 exhibited the highest prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Provinces in clusters 2 and 3, instead, showed a median prevalence of approximately 11 cases per 10,000 residents. However, provinces in cluster 3 were those with the lowest trend of cases. K-means clustering yielded to an alternative cluster solution in terms of the prevalence and trend of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Our study described a simple and immediate approach to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic at the regional and provincial level. These findings, at present, offered a snapshot of the epidemic, which could be helpful to outline the hierarchy of needs at the subnational level.

Recently, with progress in antibody or protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, various platforms for generating different types of BsAbs based on novel strategies, for various uses, have been established. More than 30 mature commercial technology platforms have been used to create and develop BsAbs based on the heterologous recombination of heavy chains and matching of light chains.

Little data is available about contingency protocols to minimize the spread of the virus in these centers. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the preventive and management measures adopted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) to minimize the risk of transmission of Covid-19. METHODS A team of specialists in Preventive and Internal Medicine established a protocol for active surveillance, identification of suspected and confirmed cases, and follow-up of contacts. Also, a Unit for the care of confirmed cases was created with personnel specifically trained in Covid-19, to achieve better patient care and optimize the available resources. Descriptive statistical measures have been used to analyze the data. RESULTS The prevalence of Covid-19 was 12.2%, with a cumulative incidence of 8.2%. After the protocol was established, control of the disease was achieved without hospital transmission after its application. Due to the alarm generated at the start of the pandemic, up to 45% of the requested RT-PCRs did not meet the criteria of the Ministry of Health, all of which were negative. The clinical characteristics of our patients differed slightly from those observed in other studies published in the general population, with cough and asthenia being the most frequent symptoms, present in 69.2% and 38.5%, respectively. 100% of the infected patients did not present complications that required assistance in the Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS With the application of preventive and organizational actions, we consider that we have presented a low incidence of those infected. The preparation of protocols and their supervision is essential for the rapid identification of cases and optimization of the tests requested.

We sought to predict the long-term impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmology surgical care delivery. Methods: This is a population-based study and a microsimulation model for predicting future outcomes. Provincial administrative data from January 2019 to November 2020 was used to estimate the decline in surgical volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the post-pandemic recovery phase, we estimated the resources required to clear the backlog of patients accumulated on the waitlist since the pandemic. Results: A total of 56,923 patients were on the waitlist in the province of Ontario awaiting non-emergency ophthalmic surgery as of March 15, 2020. The number of non-emergency surgeries performed in the province decreased by 45-98% between March to May 2020 compared to the same months in 2019. By 2 years and 3 years, the overall estimated number of patients awaiting surgery grew by 125% and 148%, respectively. The mean wait time for patients for all subspecialty surgeries increased to 198.49 days (SD 81.38) in March 2021 compared to 94.41 days (SD 97.42) in 2019. The provincial monthly additional resources required to clear the backlog by March 2023 was estimated to be 126% (3,538 additional surgeries).

Univariate analysis was done at first. All concerned factors about SARS infection were scanned by using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test one by one, and determined as to whether they were risk factors or protective factors according to odd ratio (OR) score. Then, multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to re-analyze the picked-out factors for finding out which factors played independent roles. RESULTS Twenty-two factors (nineteen protective factors and three risk factors), among the total fifty-six factors, were significantly associated with SARS infection. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression revealed that factors such as double exposure suits (OR=0.053), education (OR=0.072), gloves (OR=0.102), hands sterilized by iodine (OR=0.231), room air ventilation (OR=0.32), were significantly protective; conversely, tracheal intubation (OR=30.793) was a significant risk factor.

In order to meet this overwhelming and growing demand for mental health care, we must employ innovative approaches to significantly expand the capacity of mental healthcare delivery. While it is not feasible to increase the number of mental health care providers or the number of hours they work in the short term, improving their time efficiency may be a viable solution. Virtual and digital delivery of psychotherapy, which is shown to be efficient and clinically effective, might be a good candidate to address this growing demand. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research protocol is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of treating mental health issues started or aggravated by the stressors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic using an online, digital and asynchronous model of care. METHODS: This non-randomized control trial intervention will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants will be offered a 9-week online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) program tailored to address mental health problems in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This program will involve weekly self-guided educational material, providing an overview of behavioral skills, and completing related weekly homework. Participants (n = 80) will receive personalized feedback and weekly interaction with a therapist throughout the course of the program. The efficacy of the program will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires completed by participants at baseline, week 5 and post-treatment. Inclusion criteria includes the capacity to consent, a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and/or major depressive disorder with symptoms that have started or gotten worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to speak and read English, and having consistent and reliable access to the Internet. Exclusion criteria includes active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and/or active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: The study received funding in May 2020. Ethics approval was received in June 2020, and the recruitment of participants began in June 2020. Participant recruitment is being conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 58 participants have been recruited (35 in the intervention group and 23 in the control group). Data collection is expected to conclude by the end of 2020, and analyses are expected to be completed by February 2021 with linear regression analysis (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes) being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: If proven feasible, this method of care delivery could increase care capacity by up to four-folds.

Particularly, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells were proposed as a source of extracellular vesicles for cancer therapy because of their intrinsic properties: high in vitro self-renewal and proliferation, regenerative and immunomodulatory capacities, and secretion of extracellular vesicles that mediate most of their paracrine functions. Moreover, extracellular vesicles are static and safer in comparison with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, which can undergo genetic/epigenetic or phenotypic changes after their administration to patients.

Methods A systematic literature review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies using IC to guide energy delivery compared to a predictive equation in adult critically ill patients with the primary outcome (hospital mortality) or any of the secondary outcomes reported (including but not limited to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) and duration mechanical ventilation (MV). Risk of bias within studies was assessed using the Cochrane \\"Risk of Bias\\" 1 tool. Random-effect meta-analyses were used when heterogeneity between studies existed (I2 > 50%). Data are reported as median (interquartile range [IQR]), binomial outcomes as odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD). Results Of 4060 articles, 4 randomized controlled trials were identified with 396 patients included in analysis. Three studies were considered low risk of bias and 1 as high risk. Two studies reported hospital mortality (n = 130 and 40 participants, respectively). When combined, no association between IC-guided energy delivery and hospital mortality was found (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = [0.25, 2.67], P = 0.73, I2 = 52). No differences were reported with ICU mortality and hospital LOS between groups, but ICU LOS and duration of MV varied across all studies. According to the meta-analysis, no differences were observed in ICU LOS (MD = 1.39, 95% CI = [-5.01, 7.79], P = 0.67, I2 = 81%), although the duration of MV was increased when energy delivery was guided by IC (MD = 2.01, 95% CI = [0.45, 3.57], P = 0.01, I2 = 26%).

The psychological well-being is greatly influenced by stressful environment and the coping mechanism of an individual. The 2019 Coronavirus disease has caused unprecedented morbidity and mortality worldwide owing to its high infectivity and mortality. In addition to these physical manifestations, psychological impact has also been substantial. This study is a descriptive cross-sectional study done to find out the prevalence of anxiety disorder and its severity during the COVID-19 pandemic in school going adolescents of Kathmandu valley. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among adolescents from August 15 to September 30, 2020. Two private schools from each district in the Kathmandu valley i.e. Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur were included in the study using convenient sampling. Ethical clearance was obtained from Institutional Review Committee (reference no: 1208202007). All data were inserted on Microsoft Excel 2016 and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. RESULTS: Among 358 students, 165 (46.1%) at 95% Confidence Interval (40.8-51.2) were found to have anxiety. Out of these patients, 115 (69.7%) had mild, 39 (23.6%) had moderate and 11 (6.7%) had severe anxiety. The mean age was 16.171.57 years.

METHOD: Relevant literature was obtained from the Scopus database for the period from 2001C2020. Examples of keywords used in the query included college student, university student, and undergraduate student combined with keywords such as wellbeing, wellness, suicide, and anxiety. No language restriction was used. Only research articles were considered. The search query was validated. Bibliometric indicators and mappings such as active countries, institutions, authors, highly cited documents, and the most frequently encountered topics were identified and discussed to shed light on research gaps in the Arab region. Research gaps were also identified. The analysis was carried out on February 12, 2021. RESULTS: The search query returned 309 research articles published by authors from 17 different Arab countries. Less than one-third (n = 97, 31.4%) of the retrieved articles were carried out in collaboration with authors from 39 non-Arab countries, mainly from the United Kingdom and the United States. The overall contribution of researchers from the Arab region to global research in the field was 5.6%. In total, 1212 authors from 791 different institutions participated in publishing the retrieved research articles. At the country level, Saudi Arabia (n = 125, 40.5%) ranked first, followed by Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon. At the institutional level, The University of Jordan (n = 25, 8.1%) ranked first, followed by King Saud University, and Kuwait University.

The severity-associated increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody was dominated by IgG, with an IgG subclass ratio skewed towards elevated receptor binding domain (RBD)- and S1-specific IgG3.

Recent drug development has been in part guided by Lipinskis Rule of 5 (Ro5) even though many approved drugs do not comply to these rules. With Covid-19 vaccine development strategy dramatically accelerating drug development perhaps it is timely to question the generic drug development process itself to find a more efficient, cost effective, and successful approach. It is widely believed that drugs permeate cells via two methods: phospholipid bilayer diffusion and carrier mediated transporters. However, emerging evidence suggests that carrier mediated transport may be the primary mechanism of drug uptake and not diffusion as long believed. Computational biology increasingly assists drug design to achieve desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Perfecting drug entry into target cells as a prerequisite to intracellular drug action is a logical and compelling route and is expected to reduce drug attrition rates, particularly gaining favour amongst chronic lifelong therapeutics. Novel drug development is rapidly expanding from the utilisation of beyond the rule of five (bRo5) to pulsatile drug delivery systems and fragment based drug design. Utilising transporters as drug targets and advocating bRo5 molecules may be the solution to increasing drug specificity, reducing dosage and toxicity and thus revolutionising drug development.

This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which, unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases the risk of COVID19. Indeed,\\"being in close contact with COVID19 people\\"reduces the risk of COVID19. To avoid such potentially erroneous conclusions, any analysis of observational data must take account of the underlying causal structure including colliders and confounders. If analysts fail to do this explicitly then any conclusions they make about the effect of specific risk factors on COVID19 are likely to be flawed.","output":"A note on 'Collider bias undermines our

Virus bound to isolated membranes from susceptible mice, but not to membranes from resistant mice. F1 progeny of SJL/J X BALB/c mice had an intermediate level of virus-binding activity on their enterocyte and hepatocyte membranes. This correlated well with previous studies showing that susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is controlled by a single autosomal dominant gene (M. S. Smith, R. E. Click, and P. G. W.

Numerous factors, such as repeated patterns of homophobic bullying by classmates and others in school, have been a significant barrier to achieving this goal. In addition, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) adolescents encounter substantial inequality across a broad spectrum of wellbeing and education consequences. Compared with their heterosexual counterparts, LGBTQ adolescents experience more anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, antisocial behavior, poorer academic performance, less school attachment and protection, and a weaker desire to finish their studies. Such discrepancies based on gender and sexuality were linked to more maltreatment encountered by LGBTQ adolescents. It is crucial to recognize the backgrounds and expectations of LGBTQ adolescents to offer them the best resources. To overcome the inequality and obstacles faced by these LGBTQ adolescents, it is essential to examine tools and techniques that can be utilized. This study examined the literature that explains why society fails to provide enough support to LGBTQ students. Specifically, mechanisms explaining how LGBTQ adolescents interact with others in the learning environment and how such discrepancies arise will be examined. Following that, violence and prejudice, which are fundamental causes of psychological problems among LGBTQ adolescents, will be explored.

METHODS: A total of 62 subjects were included in our study (n=38 patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 and n=24 non-COVID-19 controls). We performed histopathologic assessment of autopsy cases, surface marker-based phenotyping of neutrophils and platelets, and functional assays for platelet, neutrophil functions, and coagulation tests, as well. RESULTS: We provide evidence that organ involvement and prothrombotic features in COVID-19 are linked by immunothrombosis. We show that, in COVID-19, inflammatory microvascular thrombi are present in the lung, kidney, and heart, containing neutrophil extracellular traps associated with platelets and fibrin. Patients with COVID-19 also present with neutrophil-platelet aggregates and a distinct neutrophil and platelet activation pattern in blood, which changes with disease severity. Whereas cases of intermediate severity show an exhausted platelet and hyporeactive neutrophil phenotype, patients severely affected with COVID-19 are characterized by excessive platelet and neutrophil activation in comparison with healthy controls and non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Dysregulated immunothrombosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 pneumonia is linked to both acute respiratory distress syndrome and systemic hypercoagulability.

Due to the central role of IL-6 in the immunological response, tocilizumab may improve DES efficacy. Thus, we conducted a PubMed systematic review using the MeSH terms tocilizumab, interleukin-6, kidney transplantation, and desensitization. Tocilizumab (TCZ) was first studied for DES as the second-line treatment after failure of a standard DES protocol (SP) (apheresis, rituximab +/? IVIg). Although TCZ (as a monotherapy) attenuated anti-HLA antibody rates, it did not permit transplantation. However, lymphocyte immuno-phenotyping has shown that TCZ hinders B-cell maturation and thus could improve the long-term efficacy of DES by limiting anti-HLA rebound and so avoid antibody-mediated rejection. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study where clazakizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6, was continued after kidney transplantation in association with an SP. Nine out of ten patients were then eligible for transplantation, and there were no donor-specific antibodies at 6 months post-transplantation. In association with an SP, tocilizumab does not seem to significantly improve kidney-allograft access (short-term efficacy) vs. a SP only. However, it could improve the long-term prognosis of HLA-incompatible transplantation by hindering B-cell maturation and, thereby, avoiding donor-specific antibody rebounds post-transplantation.","output":"Tocilizumab and Desensitization in Kidney Transplant Candidates: Personal Experience and Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author reflects on the value of slowness and rest to the library profession and library service in 2021 in light of the experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton's IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung's self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to examine the association between chronic diseases and serious outcomes following COVID-19 infection, and to explore its influence on peoples self-perception of risk for worse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: This study draws data from two databases: (1) the nationwide database of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Portugal, extracted on April 28, 2020 (n=20,293); and (2) the community-based COVID-19 Barometer survey, which contains data on health status, perceptions, and behaviors during the first wave of COVID-19 (n=171,087). We assessed the association between relevant chronic diseases (ie, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases; diabetes; and cancer) and death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission following COVID-19 infection. We identified determinants of self-perception of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases were associated with mortality and ICU admission among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98; OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.80-6.40; and OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.66-3.06, respectively). Diabetes and cancer were associated with serious outcomes only when considering the full sample of COVID-19Cinfected cases in the country (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64; and OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.89, respectively). Older age and male sex were both associated with mortality and ICU admission. The perception of risk for severe COVID-19 disease in the study population was 23.9% (n=40,890). This was markedly higher for older adults (n=5235, 46.4%), those with at least one chronic disease (n=17,647, 51.6%), or those in both of these categories (n=3212, 67.7%). All included diseases were associated with self-perceptions of high risk in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the association between some prevalent chronic diseases and increased risk of worse COVID-19 outcomes.

From the excess mortality in Sweden in 2019/20, we estimated the YLL attributed to COVID-19 using the life expectancy in different age groups. We adjusted this estimate for possible displacement using an auto-regressive model for the year-to-year variations in excess mortality.

METHODS: An ARDS-associated pulmonary fibrosis model was established in mice by an intratracheal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). At 1, 3, and 7 days after LPS-mediated injury, the lungs of mice treated with MSC MVs and untreated controls were carefully excised and fibrosis was assessed based on the extent of collagen deposition. In addition, the development of epithelialCmesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated based on loss of E-cadherin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) along with the acquisition of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and N-cadherin. Nuclear translocation and -catenin expression analyses were also used to evaluate activation of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. RESULTS: Blue-stained collagen fibers were evident as early as 7 days after LPS injection. Treatment with MSC MVs suppressed pathological progression to a significant extent. MSC MVs markedly reversed the upregulation of N-cadherin and -SMA and attenuated the downregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1. The expression and nuclear translocation of -catenin were clearly decreased on day 7 after MSC MV treatment. CONCLUSION: Analyses indicated that MSC MVs could ameliorate ARDS-associated early pulmonary fibrosis via the suppression of EMT and might be related to Wnt/-catenin transition signaling.","output":"Wnt/-Catenin Participates in the Repair of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome-Associated Early Pulmonary Fibrosis via Mesenchymal Stem Cell Microvesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many enveloped virus families, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), a crucial, yet unexploited, step in the viral life cycle is the release of particles from the infected cell membranes. This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which are recruited by viral structural proteins and provide the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug tenatoprazole was previously shown to bind to the ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and to quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report, we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious HSV-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the transit of HSV particles through the cell nuclear membrane, resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 0.8 to 1.2 M, which is much more potent than tenatoprazole. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with the potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses by interrupting the cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell.

In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%. With the proposed approach in this study, it is evident that the model can efficiently contribute to the detection of COVID-19 disease.","output":"COVID-19 detection using deep learning models to exploit Social Mimic Optimization and structured chest X-ray images using fuzzy color and stacking approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has become an unprecedented health, economic, and social crisis The present study has built a theoretical model and used it to develop an empirical strategy, analyzing the drivers of policy-response agility during the outbreak Our empirical results show that national policy responses were delayed, both by government expectations of the healthcare system capacity, and also by expectations that any hard measures used to manage the crisis would entail severe economic costs With decision-making based on incomplete information, the agility of national policy responses increased as knowledge increased and uncertainty decreased in relation to the epidemic's evolution and the policy responses of other countries","output":"The effect of health and economic costs on governments' policy responses to COVID?19 crisis under incomplete information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had an enormous burden on the healthcare system worldwide as a consequence of its new emerging variants of concern (VOCs) since late 2019. Elucidating viral genome characteristics and its influence on disease severity and clinical outcome has been one of the crucial aspects toward pandemic management. Genomic surveillance holds the key to identify the spectrum of mutations vis--vis disease outcome. Here, in our study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mutation distribution among the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovered and mortality patients. In addition to the clinical data analysis, the significant mutations within the two groups were analyzed for their global presence in an effort to understand the temporal dynamics of the mutations globally in comparison with our cohort. Interestingly, we found that all the mutations within the recovered patients showed significantly low global presence, indicating the possibility of regional pool of mutations and the absence of preferential selection by the virus during the course of the pandemic. In addition, we found the mutation S194L to have the most significant occurrence in the mortality group, suggesting its role toward a severe disease progression. Also, we discovered three mutations within the mortality patients with a high cohort and global distribution, which later became a part of variants of interest (VOIs)/VOCs, suggesting its significant role in enhancing viral characteristics. To understand the possible mechanism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of nucleocapsid mutations, S194L and S194*, from the mortality and recovered patients, respectively, to examine its impacts on protein structure and stability. Importantly, we observed the mutation S194* within the recovered to be comparatively unstable, hence showing a low global frequency, as we observed. Thus, our study provides integrative insights about the clinical features, mutations significantly associated with the two different clinical outcomes, its global presence, and its possible effects at the structural level to understand the role of mutations in driving the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Mutations and COVID-19 Clinical Outcome: Mutation Global Frequency Dynamics and Structural Modulation Hold the Key"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of vaccines or medicines to stop COVID-19, one of the effective methods to slow the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the overloading of healthcare is to wear a face mask. Nevertheless, to mandate the use of face masks or coverings in public areas, additional human resources are required, which is tedious and attention-intensive. To automate the monitoring process, one of the promising solutions is to leverage existing object detection models to detect the faces with or without masks. As such, security officers do not have to stare at the monitoring devices or crowds, and only have to deal with the alerts triggered by the detection of faces without masks. Existing object detection models usually focus on designing the CNN-based network architectures for extracting discriminative features. However, the size of training datasets of face mask detection is small, while the difference between faces with and without masks is subtle. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a face mask detection framework that uses the context attention module to enable the effective attention of the feed-forward convolution neural network by adapting their attention maps feature refinement. Moreover, we further propose an anchor-free detector with Triplet-Consistency Representation Learning by integrating the consistency loss and the triplet loss to deal with the small-scale training data and the similarity between masks and occlusions.

This study evaluated the reproductive protective effect of ellagic acid (EA) against testicular damage and abnormalities in sperm parameters in Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats (T1DM) and examined some possible mechanisms of protection. Adult male rats were segregated into 5 groups (n = 12 rat/each) as control, control + EA (50 mg/kg/day), T1DM, T1DM + EA, and T1DM + EA + brusatol (an Nrf-2 inhibitor) (2 mg/twice/week). All treatments were conducted for 12 weeks, daily. EA preserved the structure of the seminiferous tubules, prevented the reduction in sperm count, motility, and viability, reduced sperm abnormalities, and downregulated testicular levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax in diabetic rats. In the control and diabetic rats, EA significantly increased the circulatory levels of testosterone, reduced serum levels of FSH and LH, and upregulated Bcl-2 and all steroidogenic genes (StAr, 3-HSD1, and 11-HSD1). Besides, it reduced levels of ROS and MDA but increased levels of GSH and MnSOD and the transactivation of Nrf2. All these biochemical alterations induced by EA were associated with increased activity and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. However, all these effects afforded by EA were weakened in the presence of brusatol. In conclusion, EA could be an effective therapy to alleviated DM-induced reproductive toxicity and dysfunction in rats by a potent antioxidant potential mediated by the upregulation of Nrf2.","output":"Ellagic acid improved diabetes mellitus-induced testicular damage and sperm abnormalities by activation of Nrf2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I am writing this Presidents Message column as my last one in this honorable position for the IEEE Vehicular Technology Society (VTS).

Appropriate empiric therapy for UTIs requires an understanding of antibiotic resistance in the community. In this nationwide study, we examined trends in antibiotic resistance in urinary Enterobacterales isolates from ambulatory patients in the United States (US). METHODS: We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL]-producing phenotype and not susceptible [NS] to beta-lactams, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [TMP/SMX], fluoroquinolones [FQ], or nitrofurantoin [NFT]) of 30-day non-duplicate Enterobacterales isolates from urine cultures tested at ambulatory centers in the BD Insights Research Database (2011C2020). The outcome of interest was the percentage of resistant isolates by pathogen and year. Multi-variable generalized estimating equation models were used to assess trends in resistance over time and by additional covariates. RESULTS: A total of 338 US facilities provided data for > 2.2 million urinary Enterobacterales isolates during the 10-year study. Almost three-quarters (72.8%) of Enterobacterales isolates were Escherichia coli. Overall unadjusted resistance rates in Enterobacterales isolates were 57.5%, 23.1%, 20.6%, and 20.2% for beta-lactams, TMP/SMX, FQ, and NFT, respectively, and 6.9% had an ESBL-producing phenotype. Resistance to two or more antibiotic classes occurred in 16.4% of isolates and 5.5% were resistant to three or more classes. Among isolates with an ESBL-producing phenotype, 70.1%, 59.9%, and 33.5% were NS to FQ, TMP/SMX, and NFT, respectively. In multivariable models, ESBL-producing and NFT NS Enterobacterales isolates increased significantly (both P < 0.001), while other categories of resistance decreased. High rates ( 50%) of beta-lactam and NFT resistance were observed in Klebsiella isolates and in non-E. coli, non-Klebsiella Enterobacterales isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance was common in urinary Enterobacterales isolates. Isolates with an ESBL-producing phenotype increased by about 30% between 2011 and 2020, and significant increases were also observed in NFT NS Enterobacterales isolates. Resistance rates for all four antibiotic classes were higher than thresholds recommended for use as empiric therapy. Non-E. coli Enterobacterales isolates showed high levels of resistance to commonly used empiric antibiotics, including NFT. These data may help inform empiric therapy choices for outpatients with UTIs.

Patients with comorbidities are most vulnerable to this disease. Therefore, cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection, particularly lung cancer patients. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted the two most crucial agents, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-X-C motif 10 (CXCL10). ACE2 is a receptor protein that plays a vital role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell and CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm. By using the UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We then identified the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences using the cBioPortal web portal. Lastly, we did the pathological assessment of targeted genes using the PANTHER database. Here, we found that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are involved respectively in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection. Finally, based on this systemic analysis, we concluded that ACE2 and CXCL10 are two possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.","output":"Evaluation of the Susceptibility and Fatality of Lung Cancer Patients towards the COVID-19 Infection: A Systemic Approach through Analyzing the ACE2, CXCL10 and their Co-expressed Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Stent assistance for treatment of wide-based aneurysms is becoming rapidly accepted. METHODS Cases of aneurysms arising in the paraclinoid location of the internal carotid artery treated with intracranial stents and/or bare platinum coils were analyzed retrospectively from our prospectively collected database. We identified 70 aneurysms treated with stent assistance (including one stenting-alone case) and 24 aneurysms treated with coiling alone. Stenting-assisted coiling was achieved either as a one-time treatment or as a two-step maneuver with the stent placed several weeks before coiling, or stent-assisted coiling was used as a second maneuver in aneurysms that recanalized after previous coiling. RESULTS In aneurysms treated with stent assistance, 60% had 95% occlusion at treatment completion, a result comparing favorably with the 54.2% rate of 95% occlusion associated with coiling alone. At last follow-up, 60 aneurysms treated with stent assistance had a 66.7% incidence of 95% occlusion, with no in-stent stenosis; 75% of patients treated with coiling alone had 95% aneurysm occlusion. Thrombus occurred during stent deployment in two patients, one with and one without neurologic sequelae; stent displacement occurred in one patient without neurologic sequelae. At last follow-up, 57 of 62 patients (91.9%) treated with stent-assisted coiling experienced excellent/good outcomes (modified Rankin scale score 2). These results compared favorably with those for the coiling-alone group in which 23 of 24 (95.8%) had good outcomes.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) of human viruses can be a useful tool for population-scale monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and epidemiology to help prevent further spread of the disease, particularly within urban centres. Here we present a longitudinal analysis (March-July, 2020) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA prevalence in sewage across six major urban centres in the UK (total population equivalent 3 million) by q(RT-)PCR and viral genome sequencing. Our results demonstrate that levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA generally correlated with the abundance of clinical cases recorded within the community in large urban centres, with a marked decline in SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance following the implementation of lockdown measures. The strength of this association was weaker in areas with lower confirmed COVID-19 case numbers. Further sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater suggested that multiple genetically distinct clusters were co-circulating in the local populations covered by our sample sites, and that the genetic variants observed in wastewater reflected similar SNPs observed in contemporaneous samples from cases tested in clinical diagnostic laboratories. We demonstrate how WBE can be used for both community-level detection and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 and other virus prevalence, and can inform public health policy decisions.

Malta's population density, large proportion of elderly and high prevalence of diabetes and obesity put the country at risk of uncontrolled viral transmission and high mortality. Despite this, Malta achieved low mortality rates compared to figures overseas. The aim of this paper is to identify key factors that contributed to these favorable outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, nationwide study which evaluates outcomes of patients during the first wave of the pandemic in Malta, from the 7th of March to the 24th of April 2020. Data was collected on demographics and mode of transmission. Hospitalization rates to Malta's main general hospital, Mater Dei Hospital, length of in-hospital stay, intensive care unit admissions and 30-day mortality were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were 447 confirmed cases in total; 19.5% imported, 74.2% related to community transmission and 6.3% nosocomially transmitted. Ninety-three patients (20.8%) were hospitalized, of which 4 were children. Patients with moderate-severe disease received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, in line with evidence available at the time. A total of 4 deaths were recorded, resulting in an all-cause mortality of 0.89%. Importantly, all admitted patients with moderate-severe disease survived to 30-day follow up. CONCLUSION: Effective public health interventions, widespread testing, remote surveillance of patients in the community and a low threshold for admission are likely to have contributed to these favorable outcomes. Hospital infection control measures were key in preventing significant nosocomial spread. These concepts can potentially be applied to stem future outbreaks of viral diseases.

While these measures are imperative to mitigate spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on psychosocial health is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the behavioral and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the preliminary results from the first thousand responders on social participation and life satisfaction. Methods Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey through their networks to the general society, in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format with questions related to responses before and during confinement conditions. Results 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. Preliminary findings revealed psychosocial strain during the enforced COVID-19 home confinement. In particular, large decreases in the amount of social activity through family (58%), friends/neighbors (44.9%) or entertainment (46.7%) were triggered by the enforced confinement. These negative effects on social participation were also associated with lower satisfaction (-30.5%) during the confinement period. Conversely, social contact score through digital technologies has significantly increased (p<0.001) during the confinement period with more individuals (24.8%) being socially connected through digital technology. Conclusion These preliminary findings elucidate the risk of psychosocial strain during the current home confinement period.

However, patients still have to pay a substantial proportion of their annual income for treatment of this disease. This study describes the economic burden on patients with tuberculosis; identifies related factors by comparing two areas with different management models; and provides policy recommendation for tuberculosis control reform in China. METHODS: There are three tuberculosis management models in China: the tuberculosis dispensary model, specialist model and integrated model. We selected Zhangjiagang (ZJG) and Taixing (TX) as the study sites, which correspond to areas implementing the integrated model and dispensary model, respectively. Patients diagnosed and treated for tuberculosis since January 2010 were recruited as study subjects. A total of 590 patients (316 patients from ZJG and 274 patients from TX) were interviewed with a response rate of 81%. The economic burden attributed to tuberculosis, including direct costs and indirect costs, was estimated and compared between the two study sites. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to compare the cost differences between the two groups. Potential factors related to the total out-of-pocket costs were analyzed based on a step-by-step multivariate linear regression model after the logarithmic transformation of the costs. RESULTS: The average (median, interquartile range) total cost was 18793.33 (9965, 3200-24400) CNY for patients in ZJG, which was significantly higher than for patients in TX (mean: 6598.33, median: 2263, interquartile range: 983C6688) (Z = 10.42, P < 0.001). After excluding expenses covered by health insurance, the average out-of-pocket costs were 14304.4 CNY in ZJG and 5639.2 CNY in TX. Based on the multivariable linear regression analysis, factors related to the total out-of-pocket costs were study site, age, number of clinical visits, residence, diagnosis delay, hospitalization, intake of liver protective drugs and use of the second-line drugs.

Since they were proposed decades ago, several have been approved for clinical use to correct genetic mutations. Three types of mechanisms of action (MoA) have emerged: RNase H-dependent degradation of mRNA directed by short chimeric antisense oligonucleotides (gapmers), correction of splicing defects via splice-modulation oligonucleotides, and interference of gene expression via short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These antisense-based mechanisms can tackle several genetic disorders in a gene-specific manner, primarily by gene downregulation (gapmers and siRNAs) or splicing defects correction (exon-skipping oligos). Still, the challenge remains for the repair at the single-nucleotide level. The emerging field of epitranscriptomics and RNA modifications shows the enormous possibilities for recoding the transcriptome and repairing genetic mutations with high specificity while harnessing endogenously expressed RNA processing machinery. Some of these techniques have been proposed as alternatives to CRISPR-based technologies, where the exogenous gene-editing machinery needs to be delivered and expressed in the human cells to generate permanent (DNA) changes with unknown consequences.

We sought to determine the frequency and type of cytokine elevations and their relationship to endothelial injury induced by plasma from patients with SARS-CoV-2 versus controls. Plasma from eight consecutively enrolled patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was compared to controls. Endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity was evaluated using ECIS (electric cell-substrate impedance sensing) on human lung microvascular EC. Plasma from all SARS-CoV-2 but none from controls decreased transendothelial resistance to a greater degree than that produced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), the positive control for the assay. Thrombin, angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), complement factor C3a and C5a, and spike protein increased endothelial permeability, but to a lesser extent and a shorter duration when compared to SARS-CoV-2 plasma. Analysis of Ang2, VEGF, and 15 cytokines measured in plasma revealed striking patient-to-patient variability within the SARS-CoV-2 patients. Pretreatment with thrombin inhibitors, single, or combinations of neutralizing antibodies against cytokines, Ca3 and C5a receptor antagonists, or with ACE2 antibody failed to lessen the SARS-CoV-2 plasma-induced EC permeability. The EC barrier destructive effects of plasma from patients with SARS-CoV-2 were susceptible to heat inactivation. Plasma from patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection uniformly disrupts lung microvascular integrity. No predicted single, or set of, cytokine(s) accounted for the enhanced vascular permeability, although the factor(s) were heat-labile.

The effect on endothelial cell permeability of plasma from patients with SARS-CoV-2 was heat-labile. The main plasma factor that causes the increased endothelial permeability remains to be identified.

Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction.

METHODS: A 7-year-old boy with severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and severe ARDS was treated with allogeneic UCB as salvage therapy. RESULTS: The patient did not improve after being treated with lung protective ventilation, pulmonary surfactant replacement, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for 30 days. However, his disease reversed 5 days after allogeneic UCB infusion, and he weaned from ECMO after 7 days of infusion. Bioinformatics confirmed that his Toll-like receptor (TLR) was abnormal before UCB infusion. However, after the infusion, his immune system was activated and repaired, and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-B signaling pathway was recovered. CONCLUSION: Allogenic UCB could treat ARDS by repairing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-B signaling pathway, thereby achieving stability of the immune system.","output":"First case of low-dose umbilical cord blood therapy for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper was originally delivered at The Psychology of Global Crisis: State Surveillance, Solidarity and Everyday Life virtual conference, 2020, at The American University of Paris I discuss with my own lived experience of surviving COVID-19 as the basis for how the event of a crisis brings into focus hopes undecidable, ontological nature, thus shattering everyday presumptions about hope as located elsewhere than the here and now in what I call either imagineered prostalgia or salvaged and recycled nostalgia I also discuss the challenge of the suicidal moment to the idea that hope is ontological I close with a suggested link to various kinds of pandemics, either virally infective or racially oppressive or genocidal, in the shared, ontological nature of breath as hope, dum spiro spero, where, as I breathe, I hope I note how this ontology of breath as hope, whether as ruach, pneuma, prana, qi, alruwh, or roho, is incomparably and ontically unique in both the different kinds of asphyxiations faced of breath and in what each is trying to breathe My hope is that by knowing hope is ontological and inherent to existence, even in despair, and neither coupled to imagineered prostalgia nor salvaged and recycled nostalgia, that one can embrace life as is, knowing we gasp even when we cannot breathe ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature","output":"Dum Spiro Spero: On Post-Pandemic Hope"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coastal area of Watulimo District is included as a tsunami-prone area that is directly adjacent to the Indian Ocean.

Methods: We report preliminary results from the Vall dHebron prospective cohort study at Vall dHebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARSCoV2) and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Results: 82 patients with COVID19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean (SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) ageadjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1 to 4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5 to 11) days. The median time from symptom onset to the first dose of tocilizumab was 9 (7 to 11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%.

This definition provides a perspective that is complementary to the well-understood detrimental effects of physical inactivity. Sitting occupies the majority of the daily waking hours in most adults and has become even more pervasive owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The potential for a broad cardiovascular health benefit exists through an integrated approach that involves 'sitting less and moving more'. In this Review, we first consider observational and experimental evidence on the adverse effects of prolonged, uninterrupted sitting and the evidence identifying the possible mechanisms underlying the associated risk. We summarize the results of randomized controlled trials demonstrating the feasibility of changing sedentary behaviour. We also highlight evidence on the deleterious synergies between sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity as the underpinnings of our case for addressing them jointly in mitigating cardiovascular risk. This integrated approach should not only reduce the specific risks of too much sitting but also have a positive effect on the total amount of physical activity, with the potential to more broadly benefit the health of individuals living with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.","output":"Sit less and move more for cardiovascular health: emerging insights and opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Product miniaturization is a trend for facilitating product usage, enabling product functions to be implemented in microscale geometries, and aimed at reducing product weight, volume, cost and pollution.

We find (i) negative impacts of CO(2) emissions on health outcomes; (ii) R&D expenditures have a weak positive impact on health outcomes; (iii) additionally to their direct effects on health outcomes, R&D expenditures remarkably enhanced health outcomes through reducing per capita CO(2) emissions; (iv) R&D expenditures interact with CO(2) from electricity and heat production and from electricity and heat production to negatively influence health outcomes. Similarly, environmentally related R&D, measured by patents environmental-related technologies, interacts with per capita CO(2) emissions to negatively influence health outcomes.

OATP3A1 is widely expressed in the human body and its presence in tissue-blood barriers, neurons and muscle cells marks it as a potential pharmacological target. Herein we demonstrate that an otherwise membrane impermeant, zwitterionic fluorescent coumarin probe, bearing a sulfonate function is a potent substrate of human OATP3A1, thus readily transported into HEK-293-OATP3A1 cells allowing functional investigation and the screen of drug interactions of the OATP3A1 transporter. At the same time, dyes lacking either the sulfonate motif or the coumarin scaffold showed a dramatic decrease in affinity or even a complete loss of transport. Furthermore, we observed a distinct inhibition/activation pattern in the OATP3A1-mediated uptake of closely related fluorescent coumarin derivatives differing only in the presence of the sulfonate moiety. Additionally, we detected a synergistic effect between one of the probes tested and the endogenous OATP substrate estrone-3-sulfate. These data, together with docking results indicate the presence of at least two cooperative substrate binding sites in OATP3A1. Besides providing the first sensitive probe for testing OATP3A1 substrate/inhibitor interactions, our results also help to understand substrate recognition and transport mechanism of the poorly characterized OATP3A1.

End-expiratory lung impedance (EELI), measured by electrical impedance tomography, was recorded at baseline, during ES, during hyperinflation and 1, 5, 15 and 30 min post-hyperinflation. RESULTS Nine participants were studied. ES decreased EELI by 1672z (95% CI, 1204 to 2140) from baseline. From baseline, MHI increased EELI by 1154z (95% CI, 977 to 1330) while VHI increased EELI by 769z (95% CI, 457 to 1080). Five minutes post-VHI, EELI remained 528z (95% CI, 4 to 1053) above baseline.

Viral FLICE-inhibitory protein (vFLIP), encoded by KSHV ORF K13, inhibits KSHV lytic reactivation, implying that the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks regulated by vFLIP can be modulated to induce the lytic reactivation of latent KSHV, a promising strategy for KSHV-associated malignancies. Here, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing to reveal the global landscape of non-coding RNAs and mRNAs in iSLK-RGB-BAC16 cells and iSLK-RGB-K13 mutant cells. It showed that vFLIP regulated 227 differently expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 57 DE circRNAs, 20 DE miRNAs and 1371 DE mRNAs.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the psychological burden of COVID-19 on the people in quarantine and isolation centers and to identify associated factors for early and effective psychosocial intervention during the pandemic and beyond. Method: A cross-sectional study was done among 392 suspected cases of COVID-19 that were in quarantine and isolation centers found in Eastern Ethiopia in 2020. Participants were selected by the convenience sampling method. The common mental disorder was measured by the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20). Logistic regression was done to identify predictive factors, and a P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The common mental disorder among suspected cases of COVID-19 in Ethiopia was found to be 13.5% (95% CI: 10.2, 17.1%).

However, the underlying modulation mechanisms for high stretch-induced mechanobiological responses in ASMCs are not fully understood. Here, we hypothesize that ASMCs respond to high stretch with increased expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) that may in turn modulate the biomechanical behaviors of the cells. Thus, this study aimed to identify the miRNA in cultured ASMCs that is most responsive to high stretch, and subsequently investigate in these cells whether the miRNA expression level is associated with the modulation of cell biomechanics. Methods: MiRNAs related to inflammatory airway diseases were obtained via bioinformatics data mining, and then tested with cultured ASMCs for their expression variations in response to a cyclic high stretch (13% strain) simulating in vivo ventilator-imposed strain on airways. Subsequently, we transfected cultured ASMCs with mimics and inhibitors of the miRNA that is most responsive to the high stretch, followed by evaluation of the cells in terms of morphology, stiffness, traction force, and mRNA expression of cytoskeleton/focal adhesion-related molecules. Results: 29 miRNAs were identified to be related to inflammatory airway diseases, among which let-7a-5p was the most responsive to high stretch. Transfection of cultured human ASMCs with let-7a-5p mimics or inhibitors led to an increase or decrease in aspect ratio, stiffness, traction force, migration, stress fiber distribution, mRNA expression of -smooth muscle actin (SMA), myosin light chain kinase, some subfamily members of integrin and talin. Direct binding between let-7a-5p and ItgV was also verified in classical model cell line by using dual-luciferase assays. Conclusion: We demonstrated that high stretch indeed enhanced the expression of let-7a-5p in ASMCs, which in turn led to changes in the cells morphology and biomechanical behaviors together with modulation of molecules associated with cytoskeletal structure and focal adhesion.

The start codon of the BM2 ORF overlaps the stop codon of the M1 ORF in the pentanucleotide UAA UG and 10% of ribosomes terminating at the M1 stop codon reinitiate translation at the overlapping AUG. BM2 synthesis requires the presence of, and translation through, 45 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG, known as the termination upstream ribosome binding site (TURBS). This region may tether ribosomal 40S subunits to the mRNA following termination and a short region of the TURBS, motif 1, with complementarity to helix 26 of 18S rRNA has been implicated in this process. Here, we provide further evidence for a direct interaction between mRNA and rRNA using antisense oligonucleotide targeting and functional analysis in yeast cells. The TURBS also binds initiation factor eIF3 and we show here that this protein stimulates reinitiation from both wild-type and defective TURBS when added exogenously, perhaps by stabilising ribosome-mRNA interactions. Further, we show that the position of the TURBS with respect to the UAA UG overlap is crucial, and that termination too far downstream of the 18S complementary sequence inhibits the process, probably due to reduced 40S tethering. However, in reporter mRNAs where the restart codon alone is moved downstream, termination-reinitiation is inhibited but not abolished, thus the site of reinitiation is somewhat flexible. Reinitiation on distant AUGs is not inhibited in eIF4G-depleted RRL, suggesting that the tethered 40S subunit can move some distance without a requirement for linear scanning.","output":"Further Characterisation of the Translational Termination-Reinitiation Signal of the Influenza B Virus Segment 7 RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a global pandemic due to the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

However, little is known about how this pandemic could affect the more vulnerable population with severe mental illness. Aims: : To explore adolescent psychiatric inpatients' perceptions, emotional reactions and needs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with nine psychiatric inpatients aged 12-17 years. Through open-ended questions, interviewers initiated five themes: (1) knowledge about the coronavirus pandemic, (2) changes in everyday routine, (3) pandemic-related emotions, (4) helpful thoughts and attitudes and (5) practices for helping adolescents deal with the hardships brought about by the pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted using line-by-line open coding. Results: : With regard to their knowledge of the impact of the current pandemic, almost all adolescents focused on information about the nature of coronavirus and also on existing crisis management practices. Almost all patients identified predominantly negative changes due to the quarantine state, including restrictions on both social life and personal freedom as well as excessive contact with family members during home isolation. As far as their emotions was concerned, adolescents did acknowledge anxiety about self-harm and harming their loved ones as well as mood swings within the family nucleus;anxiety was also manifested about the unknown and the management of the pandemic in other countries. Avoidance of thought rumination about the coronavirus and its consequences, positive thinking and looking towards the future were reported as constructive strategies for coping with challenging emotions. Additionally, a sense of belongingness (provided that they are not alone and share a common experience) seems to have been playing a pivotal role in the adolescents coping strategies. Trust in the authorities and the community was another quite noteworthy point that emerged during the interviews. Lastly, our findings indicated adolescents' benefit from receiving balanced health messaging coupled with balanced thinking within both their social and family environment. Conclusions: : Enhanced comprehension of possible mediating psychological pathways is needed to help clinicians, researchers and decision-makers to avert the deterioration of mental disorders and overall functioning, as well as additional stress-related disorders.","output":"Perceptions, emotional reactions and needs of adolescent psychiatric inpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ethics in social science experimentation and data collection are often discussed but rarely articulated in writing as part of research outputs.

In Germany, intravenous therapy with high-dose corticosteroids is the treatment standard of acute relapses. The treatment leads to a faster reduction of symptoms in about 25 of 100 treated patients but has no proven long-term benefits over placebo treatment. Intravenous treatment is not superior to oral treatment. Therefore, informed decisions on relapse management are required. An earlier randomised controlled trial showed that evidence-based patient information and education on relapse management leads to more informed decisions and more relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. This study aims to evaluate whether a web-based relapse management programme will positively change relapse management and strengthen autonomy in people with multiple sclerosis. METHODS: The pragmatic double-blind randomised controlled trial is accompanied by a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation and follows the UK Medical Research Council guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions. A total of 188 people with possible or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with  1 relapse within the last year and/or  2 relapses within the last 2 years will be recruited and randomised using blocks. The intervention group receives a web- and dialogue-based decision aid on relapse management, a nurse-led webinar and access to a monitored chat forum. The control group receives standard information, which will be made available via the same online platform as the intervention. The primary endpoint is the proportion of relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. Key secondary endpoints are the annualised relapse rate, decision-making, empowerment, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Facilitators and barriers will be assessed by mixed-methods process evaluation measures. The study ends when 81 relapses have been documented or after 24 months of observation per individual patient. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that the intervention will enhance patient empowerment and have a positive impact on patients relapse management.

We investigated changes in UK workers mental health by industry, socioeconomic class and occupation and differential effects by UK country of residence, gender and age. METHODS: We used representative Understanding Society data from 6474 adults (41 207 observations) in paid employment who participated in pre-pandemic (2017C2020) and at least one COVID-19 survey. The outcome was General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) caseness (score: 4). Exposures were industry, socioeconomic class and occupation and are examined separately. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate relative (OR) and absolute (%) increases in distress before and during pandemic. Differential effects were investigated for UK countries of residence (non-England/England), gender (male/female) and age (younger/older) using three-way interaction effects. RESULTS: GHQ-12 caseness increased in relative terms most for professional, scientific and technical (OR: 3.15, 95% CI 2.17 to 4.59) industry in the pandemic versus pre-pandemic period. Absolute risk increased most in hospitality (+11.4%). For socioeconomic class, small employers/self-employed were most affected in relative and absolute terms (OR: 3.24, 95% CI 2.28 to 4.63; +10.3%). Across occupations, sales and customer service (OR: 3.01, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.62; +10.7%) had the greatest increase. Analysis with three-way interactions showed considerable gender differences, while for UK country of residence and age results are mixed.

Given the persistent state of malnutrition in India, we probe, are there more nuances and unexplored dimensions to malnutrition issue that can add to the existing literature and support policy making? Demographic and Health Survey (2015C16) data of 70,618 children between the age of 2 and 5 years, from underprivileged communities in India, were investigated using the Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Theory Model. Three malnutrition outcome measures were calculated as per WHO standards, namely, height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age. Binary and multinomial logistic regression models brought out two noteworthy results, namely, the importance of vaccination and the paradox of maternal working status. Vaccination status positively impacts the outcome measures, and maternal working status demonstrates a paradoxical situation. The children of non-working mothers had better health statistics, indicating positive impact of a higher amount of time spent on direct childcare. However, working women in poor households bring economic capital to the house, indirectly bringing positive impacts on family health and nutrition. The results also confirmed the significance of maternal and child health status, access to healthcare, and need for dietary diversity. The importance of vaccination, especially in the context of COVID-19, has been emphasized by policymakers.

METHODS: An online survey, in Arabic, was disseminated during the period from 9 to 13 April 2020, to parents of children who were up to 18 years old residing in Egypt, selected using a snowball sampling technique, during the period from 25 March to 8 April during the implementation of the nationwide compulsory isolation measures against COVID-19 (25 March to 8 April 2020). The survey covered three areas: socio-demographic data, psychological impact measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and violence against children during the past 2 weeks measured using a modified parent-report of a child abuse screening tool (ICAST-P) developed by the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. RESULTS: Out of 1118 completed survey responses, 90.5% of children were subjected to violent discipline, 88.7% experienced psychological aggression, and 43.2% encountered severe physical punishment. Approximately 60% of respondents reported a moderate-to-severe psychological impact (IES-R scores  33), which was associated with a higher rate of violent discipline (OR: 9.3; 95% CI: 5.37C16.027; p < 0.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS During a 7-year period (2003-2010), right HALDN was performed on 51 and left HALDN on 40 living kidney donors. We prospectively collected perioperative outcome data in donors and recipients including graft function and calculated 1-year graft survival according to the Kaplan-Meier-method. RESULTS There were no conversions. The mean procedure time was 123 minutes versus 135 minutes for left HALDN (P = .09). Mean blood loss was 92 mL versus 101 mL in left HALDN (P = .09). There was no renal artery or vein thrombosis. The mean warm ischemia time was 47 seconds versus 41 seconds in left HALDN (P = .21). Hospital discharge was on an average at 3.4 days postoperatively. Delayed graft function occurred in two recipients: one in the left group and the other in the right group.

Each country was affected but with a varying number of infected cases and mortality rates. Africa was hit late by the pandemic but the number of cases rose sharply. In this study, we investigated 224 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) in the early part of the outbreak, of which 69 were from Africa. We analyzed a total of 550 mutations by comparing them with the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan. We classified the mutations observed based on country and region, and afterwards analyzed common and unique mutations on the African continent as a whole. Correlation analyses showed that the duo variants ORF1ab/RdRp 4715L and S protein 614G variants, which are strongly linked to fatality rate, were not significantly and positively correlated with fatality rates (r = -0.03757, P = 0.5331 and r = -0.2876, P = 0.6389, respectively), although increased number of cases correlated with number of deaths (r = 0.997, P = 0.0002). Furthermore, most cases in Africa were mainly imported from American and European countries, except one isolate with no mutation and was similar to the original isolate from Wuhan. Moreover, unique mutations specific to countries were identified in the early phase of the outbreak but these mutations were not regional-specific. There were common mutations in all isolates across the continent as well as similar isolate-specific mutations in different regions. Our findings suggest that mutation is rapid in SARS-CoV-2 in Africa and although these mutations spread across the continent, the duo variants could not possibly be the sole cause of COVID-19 deaths in Africa in the early phase of the outbreak.","output":"Genomic and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease) Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR;PCR without rapid tests;and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively ) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene' ) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6 3% The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33 3% and 72 85%, and 35 48% and 85 02%, respectively At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7 28%, 94 48%, 13 13%, and 95 38%, respectively Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the general population These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection Orv Hetil 2020;161(20): 807-812","output":"[A specifikus IgM- es IgG-antitesteket detektalo gyorstesztek erteke a SARS CoV-2 virusfertozes kimutatasaban (A COVID-19-pandemia orvosszakmai kerdesei)]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Se trat de redactar una gua para la prctica segura de la especialidad en tiempos de COVID-19 Se realiz una bsqueda de las publicaciones recientes disponibles en Pub-Med y en otros buscadores, se utiliz la experiencia de expertos a travs de diferentes conferencias o comunicados de sociedades cientficas Esta pandemia nos ha obligado a aprender de una manera vertiginosa el manejo de una nueva enfermedad, donde especialistas en ciruga comenzamos a hablar de terminologa clnica, virolgica, entre otras completamente nueva y desconocida para la mayora de nosotros Tuvimos que adaptar nuestra prctica habitual a nuevos estndares, cometiendo diferentes errores en el manejo inicial, provocados por la falta de informacin previa La gua trata de abarcar los tpicos considerados ms relevantes en este momento, como son el manejo del consultorio, recomendaciones de que patologas se recomienda operar y cules no Recomendaciones de tratamientos alternativos al quirrgico mientras dura la pandemia Mtodos de diagnsticos utilizados para evaluar infeccin en pacientes que se sometern a una ciruga, etc Se agregaron links y apndices para aquellos que deseen ampliar algn tema en particular, esto evita que la gua sea ms extensa y pierda su practicidad con la que fue pensada Esperamos esta gua sirva para facilitar la compresin de esta nueva enfermedad y su manejo para cualquier cirujano que necesite asistir a pacientes con patologa colorrectal Seguramente al finalizar estas lneas habr nueva evidencia que deber ser adaptada e incorporada a la presentada actualmente An attempt was made to write a guide for the safe practice of the specialty in times of COVID-19 A search of recent publication available in Pub-Med and other platforms was performed Experts&#039;opinions and experiences were taken into account from various conferences or communications of scientific societies This pandemic has forced us to learn the management of a new disease in a sudden way Surgical specialists began to learn clinical and virologic terminology, among other new concepts previously ignored by most of us We were forced to adapt our usual practice to new standards, making different mistakes in the initial handling, caused by the lack of prior information The present guide tries to cover the topics considered most relevant at this time, such as outpatients ?

Unfortunately, experimental PPI data remains sparse in most model organisms and even more so in other species. Existing methods for computational prediction of PPIs seek to address this limitation, and while they perform well when sufficient within-species training data is available, they generalize poorly to new species or often require specific types and sizes of training data that may not be available in the species of interest. We therefore present D-SCRIPT, a deep learning method for predicting a physical interaction between two proteins given just their sequences. Compared to existing methods, D-SCRIPT generalizes better to new species and is robust to limitations in training data size. Our approach encodes the intuition that for two proteins to physically interact, a subset of amino acids from each protein should be in contact with the other. The intermediate stages of D-SCRIPT directly implement this intuition; the penultimate stage in D-SCRIPT is a rough estimate of the inter-protein contact map of the protein dimer. This structurally-motivated design enables interpretability of our model and, since structure is more conserved evolutionarily than sequence, improves generalizability across species. We show that a D-SCRIPT model trained on 38,345 human PPIs enables significantly improved functional characterization of fly proteins compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Evaluating the same D-SCRIPT model on protein complexes with known 3-D structure, we find that the inter-protein contact map output by D-SCRIPT has significant overlap with the ground truth. Our work suggests that recent advances in deep learning language modeling of protein structure can be leveraged for protein interaction prediction from sequence.

In December 2020, two mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were approved for use in the United States (US) which provide immunity to those receiving the vaccine. Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of infants' immunity. Certain vaccines given to pregnant and lactating mothers provide immunity to infants through transmission across the placenta, umbilical cord (IgG) and human milk (IgA). Human milk produced by mothers with a history of COVID-19 infection contains SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. Objective: To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins are found in human milk after the COVID-19 vaccination, and to characterize the types of immunoglobulins present. Design, setting and participants: This is a prospective observational study conducted at Shands Hospital, University of Florida from December 2020 to March 2021. Twenty-two lactating healthcare workers who received the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna) made up the sample group. Plasma and human milk were collected at three-time points (pre-vaccination, post first vaccine dose , and post-second vaccine dose). SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and in plasma were measured by ELISA. Maternal demographics was compiled. Exposures: Pfizer/BioNtech or Moderna vaccination. Main outcome and measure: Levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma. Results: We found significant secretion of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG in human milk and plasma after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Conclusions and relevance: Our results show that the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines induce SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgG secretion in human milk. Further studies are needed to determine the duration of this immune response, its capacity to neutralize the COVID-19 virus, the transfer of passive immunity to breastfeeding infants, and the potential therapeutic use of human milk IgA to combat SARS-Cov-2 infections and COVID-19.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA in the human milk of COVID-19 vaccinated, lactating health care workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 virus causes upper and lower respiratory diseases including pneumonia, and in some cases, leads to lethal pulmonary failure.

The expression levels of ACE2 and type I interferons were also found to be correlated with each other, consistent with the recent finding that ACE2 is an interferon-inducible gene. Furthermore, induction of ACE2 and type I interferons by poly I:C, an interferon inducer, was suppressed by S1 protein in primary cells of BAL. These observations suggest that the downregulation of ACE2 and type I interferons induced by S1 protein may directly contribute to SARS-CoV-2-associated lung diseases.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Suppresses ACE2 and Type I Interferon Expression in Primary Cells From Macaque Lung Bronchoalveolar Lavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zines are a form of small-circulation self-produced publication often akin to a magazine.

RESULTS Of 579 patients with intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas, 545 had 1 fistula (mean age, 45  23 years) and 34 (5.9%) had enlarging, de novo, multiple, or recurrent fistulas (mean age, 53  20 years; P = .11). Among these 34 patients, 19 had progressive dural arteriovenous fistulas with de novo fistulas or fistula enlargement with time (mean age, 36  25 years; progressive group) and 15 had multiple or recurrent but nonprogressive fistulas (mean age, 57  13 years; P = .0059, nonprogressive group). Whereas all 6 children had fistula progression, only 13/28 adults (P = .020) progressed. Angioarchitectural correlates to chronically elevated intracranial venous pressures, including venous sinus dilation (41% versus 7%, P = .045) and pseudophlebitic cortical venous pattern (P = .048), were more common in patients with progressive disease than in those without progression. Patients with progressive disease received more treatments than those without progression (median, 5 versus 3; P = .0068), but as a group, they did not demonstrate worse clinical outcomes (median mRS, 1 and 1; P = .39). However, 3 young patients died from intracranial venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage related to progression of their fistulas despite extensive endovascular, surgical, and radiosurgical treatments. CONCLUSIONS Few patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas follow an aggressive, progressive clinical course despite treatment.

They can polymerize into extended filaments and, hence, are considered a component of the cytoskeleton. The number of individual septins varies across the tree of lifeyeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has seven distinct subunits, a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) has two, and humans have 13. However, the overall geometric unit (an apolar hetero-octameric protomer and filaments assembled there from) has been conserved. To understand septin evolutionary variation, we focused on a related pair of yeast subunits (Cdc11 and Shs1) that appear to have arisen from gene duplication within the fungal clade. Either Cdc11 or Shs1 occupies the terminal position within a hetero-octamer, yet Cdc11 is essential for septin function and cell viability, whereas Shs1 is not. To discern the molecular basis of this divergence, we utilized ancestral gene reconstruction to predict, synthesize, and experimentally examine the most recent common ancestor (Anc.11-S) of Cdc11 and Shs1. Anc.11-S was able to occupy the terminal position within an octamer, just like the modern subunits. Although Anc.11-S supplied many of the known functions of Cdc11, it was unable to replace the distinct function(s) of Shs1. To further evaluate the history of Shs1, additional intermediates along a proposed trajectory from Anc.11-S to yeast Shs1 were generated and tested. We demonstrate that multiple events contributed to the current properties of Shs1: (1) loss of Shs1CShs1 self-association early after duplication, (2) co-evolution of heterotypic Cdc11CShs1 interaction between neighboring hetero-octamers, and (3) eventual repurposing and acquisition of novel function(s) for its C-terminal extension domain. Thus, a pair of duplicated proteins, despite constraints imposed by assembly into a highly conserved multi-subunit structure, could evolve new functionality via a complex evolutionary pathway.","output":"Reconstructed evolutionary history of the yeast septins Cdc11 and Shs1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As life expectancy increases, the number of octogenarians requiring primary and revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasing. Recently, primary TKA has become a common treatment option in octogenarians. However, surgeons may still be hesitant about performing revision TKA on octogenarians because of concern about risk and cost benefit. The purpose of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes, postoperative complications, and mid-term lifetime survival in octogenarians after primary and revision TKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 231 primary TKAs and 41 revision TKAs performed on octogenarians between 2000 and 2016. The mean age of patients undergoing primary TKA was 81.9 years and that of patients undergoing revision TKA was 82.3 years (p = 0.310). The age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index was higher in revision TKA (4.4 vs. 4.8, p = 0.003). The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The incidence of postoperative complications (TKA-related, specific or systemic) and lifetime survival rate (endpoint death determined by telephone or mail communication with patient or family) were investigated. RESULTS: The WOMAC and ROM improved significantly after primary and revision TKA, although postoperative results were worse in the revision group (33.1 vs. 47.2; 128.9 vs. 113.6; p < 0.001, respectively). There were no cases of aseptic or septic component failure in either group. One case of periprosthetic fracture was observed in the revision group (0% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.151), and three cases of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) (one case of DVT and two cases of PTE) were observed in the primary group (1.3% vs. 0%, p = 1.000). The most common systemic complication in both groups was delirium (7.4% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.131). There were no differences between the two groups in the other systemic complication rates. The 5-year and 10-year lifetime survival rates were 87.2% and 62.9%, respectively, in primary TKA and 82.1% and 42.2%, respectively, in revision TKA (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Both primary and revision TKA are viable options for octogenarians, based on the satisfactory clinical outcomes, TKA-related complication rates, and mid-term lifetime survival.

POC real-time PCR usually adopts chips with small-volume chambers for portability, which is more likely to produce complex noise that seriously affects the accuracy. Such complex noises are difficult to be eliminated by the traditional fixed area algorithm that is most commonly used at present because they usually have random shape, location, and brightness. To address this problem, we proposed a novel image analysis method, Dynamic Deep Learning Noise Elimination Method (DIPLOID), in this paper. Our new method could recognize and output the mask of the interference by Mask R-CNN, and then subtract the interference and select the maximum valid contiguous area for brightness analysis by dynamic programming. Compared with the traditional method, DIPLOID increased the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity from 57.9 to 94.6%, 49.1 to 93.9%, and 65.9 to 95.2%, respectively. DIPLOID has great anti-interference, robustness, and sensitivity, which can reduce the impact of complex noise as much as possible from the aspect of the algorithm. As shown in the experiments of this paper, our method significantly improved the accuracy to over 94% under the complex noise situation, which could make the POC real-time PCR have greater potential in the future.

The focus was on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cared for around the world during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. RESULTS: Ninety-one centres expressed interest to participate and 76 were included in the analysis, from Europe, South America, North America, Asia and Africa (73.7%, 17.1%, 5.3%, 2.6% and 1.3% per continent, respectively). Eighty-seven per cent of the centres modified their clinical practice: 40.8% the diagnostic procedures, 80.9% the screening program, 50% cancelled curative and/or palliative treatments for LC, and 44.0% cancelled the liver transplantation program.

However, there are few studies that have explored the association between air pollution exposure and respiratory diseases among young children (particularly aged 0C2 years) based on the entire population in a megalopolis. METHODS: Daily hospital admission records were obtained from 54 municipal hospitals in Wuhan city, China. We included all children (aged 0C2 years) hospitalized with respiratory diseases between January 2017 and December 2018. Individual air pollution exposure assessment was used in Land Use Regression model and inverse distance weighted. Case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were adopted to estimate the hospitalization risk associated with air pollutants. RESULTS: We identified 62,425 hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases, of which 36,295 were pneumonia. Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 m (PM(2.5)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) were significantly associated with respiratory diseases and pneumonia. ORs of pneumonia were 1.0179 (95% CI 1.0097C1.0260) for PM(2.5) and 1.0131 (95% CI 1.0042C1.0220) for NO(2) at lag 0C7 days. Subgroup analysis suggested that NO(2), Ozone (O(3)) and sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) only showed effects on pneumonia hospitalizations on male patients, but PM(2.5) had effects on patients of both genders. Except O(3), all pollutants were strongly associated with pneumonia in cold season. In addition, children who aged elder months and who were in central urban areas had a higher hospitalization risk.

The cross-industry exponential laws of booking curves constitute an important discovery in regard to mathematical laws in the social sciences and can be applied to give leading microeconomic indicators.","output":"The Cross-Industry Universal Laws of Exponential Booking Curves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HLA (HLA) class II molecules, HLA-DR, DP, and DQ, together with HLA II-like protein DM, play a dominant role in the processing and presentation of antigens, which may influence vaccine effectiveness. We previously demonstrated that variations in the HLA-DRB1, DPB1, and DQB1 genes may affect the neutralising antibody (NAb) response induced by the inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccine (IJEV). In the present study, we genotyped HLA-DPA1, DQA1, DMA, and DMB genes and used previous HLA-DRB1, DPB1, and DQB1 data to evaluate the association of these genes with IJEV-induced NAbs, at both the seroconversion and geometric mean titres (GMTs). We confirmed the seropositive association of DQB1*02:01 and NAbs (0.156 vs. 0.075, Padj = 0.018; OR = 2.270; 95% CI = 1.285-3.999) and seronegative association of DQB1*02:02 (0.014 vs. 0.09, Padj = 0.0002; OR = 0.130; 95% CI = 0.047-0.400). Furthermore, the DMB*01:03-DMA*01:01-DPA1*01:03-DPB1*04:01 haplotype was associated with a negative response (0.020 vs. 0.074; Padj = 0.03; OR = 0.250; 95% CI = 0.097-0.649), whereas DRB1*15:02-DMB*01:01-DMA*01:01 was associated with a positive response (0.034 vs. 0; Padj = 0.044). In addition, DRB1*12:02, DRB1*13:02, DPB1*04:01, DPB1*05:01, DPB1*09:01, DQA1*06:01, and DQA1*01:02 were associated with a higher GMT of NAbs, whereas DRB1*11:01, DPB1*13:01, and DQA1*05:05 were associated with a lower GMT of NAbs. In conclusion, the present study suggests that variations in the HLA-DM and HLA class II genes, as well as their combined allotypes, may influence the IJEV NAbs at seroconversion and GMT levels.

Recently, we reported that Notch-1 signaling plays a key role in macrophage polarization and response during infection. We employed Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) infection in Crohns disease (CD) as a model to demonstrate the role of Notch-1/IL-6 signaling on MCL-1 based apoptosis and intracellular MAP infection and persistence. This study was designed to investigate the impact of polymorphisms in miR146a on the immune response and infection in our MAP-CD model. METHODS: We determined the incidence of miR-146a rs2910164 G > C in 42 blood samples from clinical CD patients and controls. We also measured the effect of rs2910164 on expression of Notch-1 and IL-6, and plasma IL-6 protein levels in our study group. Finally, we analyzed the blood samples for MAP DNA and studied any correlation with miR-146a polymorphism. Samples were analyzed for statistical significance using unpaired tow-tailed t-test, unpaired two-tailed z-score and odds ratio. P < 0.05 considered significant. RESULTS: MiR-146a rs2910164 GC was detected at a higher incidence in CD (52.6%) compared to healthy controls (21.7%) rs2910164 GC Heterozygous polymorphism upregulated Notch-1 and IL-6, by 0.9 and 1.7-fold, respectively. As expected, MAP infection was detected more in CD samples (63%) compared to healthy controls (9%). Surprisingly, MAP infection was detected at a higher rate in samples with rs2910164 GC (67%) compared to samples with normal genotype (33%). CONCLUSIONS: The data clearly associates miR-146a rs2910164 GC with an overactive immune response and increases the risk to acquire infection. The study is even more relevant now in our efforts to understand susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of COVID-19. This study suggests that genetic variations among COVID-19 patients may predict who is at a higher risk of acquiring infection, developing exacerbating symptoms, and possibly death. A high scale study with more clinical samples from different disease groups is planned.","output":"MiR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism modulates Notch-1/IL-6 signaling during infection: a possible risk factor for Crohns disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This primer describes the statistical uncertainty in mechanistic models and provides R code to quantify it.

The authors focused on occurrences that significantly influenced medical students' school lives negatively from the students' perspective. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The authors classified incidents into frames of reference for the use of faculty development for student support. Results The authors extracted 22 themes from a total 334 codes and classified them into eight subcategories. Finally, four categories emerged from frames of reference. Students manipulate relationships and colluding for better specialty choice. They experience uncontrolled rifts in interpersonal relationships between peers including lawsuits, sexual assaults, and social network service conflicts. Today's students feel resentment towards dependent hierarchical relationships with seniors. They struggle with gender discrimination but perpetuate outdated gender role toward the opposite gender.

Understanding the average duration of recovery and its predictors is crucial in formulating preventive measures and optimizing treatment options. Therefore, evidence showing the duration of recovery from COVID-19 in different contexts and settings is necessary for tailoring appropriate treatment and prevention measures. This study aimed to investigate the average duration and the predictors of recovery from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among COVID-19 patients. METHOD: A hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted at Eka Kotebe General Hospital, COVID-19 Isolation and Treatment Center from March 18 to June 27, 2020. The Center was the first hospital designated to manage COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia. The study participants were all COVID-19 adult patients who were admitted to the center during the study period. Follow up was done for the participants from the first date of diagnosis to the date of recovery (negative Real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCT) test of throat swab). RESULT: A total of 306 COVID-19 cases were followed up to observe the duration of viral clearance by rRT-PCR. Participants' mean age was 34 years (18-84 years) and 69% were male. The median duration of viral clearance from each participant's body was 19 days, but the range was wide: 2 to 71 days. Cough followed by headache was the leading sign of illness among the 67 symptomatic COVID-19 patients; and nearly half of those with comorbidities were known cancer and HIV/AIDS patients on clinical follow up. The median duration of recovery from COVID-19 was different for those with and without previous medical conditions or comorbidities. The rate of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection was 36% higher in males than in females (p = 0.043, CI: 1.01, 1.85). The rate of recovery was 93% higher in those with at least one comorbidity than in those without any comorbidity. The risk of delayed recovery was not influenced by blood type, BMI and presence of signs or symptoms. The findings showed that study participants without comorbidities recovered more quickly than those with at least one comorbidity. Therefore, isolation and treatment centers should be prepared to manage the delayed stay of patients having comorbidity.","output":"Time to recovery and its predictors among adults hospitalized with COVID-19: A prospective cohort study in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Solid-organ transplant patients have a high risk of severe infection related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 There are limited data on COVID-19 presentation and clinical outcome in a cardiac transplant recipient Case Report A 54-year old woman a heart transplant recipient presented with symptoms of fatigue, excessive sleepiness and cough with phlegm for one week She did not report any fever or shortness of breath She had a heart transplant six months prior complicated by antibody-mediated rejection She was treated with plasmapheresis, intravenous immune globulin, and high dose methylprednisolone She could not have further scheduled RV biopsies due to the lockdown She remained on a high dose of immune suppressive medication till her current presentation Her medication included Prednisolone 20mg daily, Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 1g bid, Tacrolimus 7 mg bid for a target FK level 10-15 On her current presentation to the hospital, she was found to be hypoxic, tachypnic, tachycardic with a BP 130/70 Her chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates She had leukopenia 3 5 and lymphopenia 0 2, CRP 25, ferritin 1106, LDH 632, and IL6 87 She was started empirically on oseltamivir, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam Her COVID-19 PCR result was positive Subsequently, she was started on Favipiravir loading of 1600 mg for two doses and a maintenance dose of 600 mg twice daily for 7 days The MMF and tacrolimus were discontinued The prednisone was switched to hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6h Despite treatment, she had reduced level of consciousness and progressive bilateral lung infiltrates requiering mechanical ventilation The multidisciplinary team discussed enrolling patients in the convalescent plasma study The patient's family was informed and they agreed and consented to proceed with plasma therapy Two units of compatible ABO plasma therapy was given for two consecutive days Intravenous dexamethasone was started She was extubated successfully after ten days Given her marked clinical improvement, she was started on MMF 1g bid, and tacrolimus adjusted to the target FK level of 5 The patient was discharged home after three weeks of admission Summary This case represents a recent heart transplant recipient who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia Her treatment involved convalescent plasma transfusion, Favipiravir, dexamethasone, and reduction of immune suppression","output":"Recovery from COVID-19 Pneumonia in a Heart Transplant Recipient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has caused a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1]. The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths. Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities' restrictions could impact the citizens' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation. The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle.","output":"Health-related quality of life and behavior-related lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 home confinement: dataset from a Moroccan sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had a rapid and deadly onset, spreading quickly throughout the world.

RECENT FINDINGS: Development of tools for fast-tracked testing including small and large animal models for vaccine efficacy analysis, assays for immunogenicity assessment, critical reagents, international biological standards, and data sharing allowed accelerated development of vaccines. More than 300 vaccines are under development and 9 of them are approved for emergency use in various countries, with impressive efficacy ranging from 50 to 95%. Recently, several new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged and are circulating globally, and preliminary findings imply that some of them may escape immune responses against previous variants and diminish efficacy of current vaccines. Most of these variants acquired new mutations in their surface protein (Spike) which is the antigen in most of the approved/under development vaccines. SUMMARY: In this review, we summarize novel and traditional approaches for COVID-19 vaccine development including inactivated, attenuated, nucleic acid, vector and protein based. Critical assessment of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses induced by vaccines has shown comparative immunogenicity profiles of various vaccines in clinical phases. Recent reports confirmed that some currently available vaccines provide partial to complete protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. If more mutated variants emerge, current vaccines might need to be updated accordingly either by developing vaccines matching the circulating strain or designing multivalent vaccines to extend the breadth.","output":"Status Report on COVID-19 Vaccines Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasing despite the limited evidence in survival benefit.

Mortality varies by time and location, and its measurement is affected by well known biases that have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to estimate excess mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic in 191 countries and territories, and 252 subnational units for selected countries, from Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2021. METHODS: All-cause mortality reports were collected for 74 countries and territories and 266 subnational locations (including 31 locations in low-income and middle-income countries) that had reported either weekly or monthly deaths from all causes during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and for up to 11 year previously. In addition, we obtained excess mortality data for 12 states in India. Excess mortality over time was calculated as observed mortality, after excluding data from periods affected by late registration and anomalies such as heat waves, minus expected mortality. Six models were used to estimate expected mortality; final estimates of expected mortality were based on an ensemble of these models. Ensemble weights were based on root mean squared errors derived from an out-of-sample predictive validity test. As mortality records are incomplete worldwide, we built a statistical model that predicted the excess mortality rate for locations and periods where all-cause mortality data were not available. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as a variable selection mechanism and selected 15 covariates, including both covariates pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as seroprevalence, and to background population health metrics, such as the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, with direction of effects on excess mortality concordant with a meta-analysis by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the selected best model, we ran a prediction process using 100 draws for each covariate and 100 draws of estimated coefficients and residuals, estimated from the regressions run at the draw level using draw-level input data on both excess mortality and covariates. Mean values and 95% uncertainty intervals were then generated at national, regional, and global levels. Out-of-sample predictive validity testing was done on the basis of our final model specification. FINDINGS: Although reported COVID-19 deaths between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, totalled 594 million worldwide, we estimate that 182 million (95% uncertainty interval 171C196) people died worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic (as measured by excess mortality) over that period. The global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 1203 deaths (1131C1293) per 100 000 of the population, and excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100 000 of the population in 21 countries. The number of excess deaths due to COVID-19 was largest in the regions of south Asia, north Africa and the Middle East, and eastern Europe. At the country level, the highest numbers of cumulative excess deaths due to COVID-19 were estimated in India (407 million [371C436]), the USA (113 million [108C118]), Russia (107 million [106C108]), Mexico (798 000 [741 000C867 000]), Brazil (792 000 [730 000C847 000]), Indonesia (736 000 [594 000C955 000]), and Pakistan (664 000 [498 000C847 000]). Among these countries, the excess mortality rate was highest in Russia (3746 deaths [3697C3784] per 100 000) and Mexico (3251 [3016C3533] per 100 000), and was similar in Brazil (1869 [1722C1998] per 100 000) and the USA (1793 [1707C1875] per 100 000). INTERPRETATION: The full impact of the pandemic has been much greater than what is indicated by reported deaths due to COVID-19 alone. Strengthening death registration systems around the world, long understood to be crucial to global public health strategy, is necessary for improved monitoring of this pandemic and future pandemics. In addition, further research is warranted to help distinguish the proportion of excess mortality that was directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and the changes in causes of death as an indirect consequence of the pandemic.

CONCLUSION: This study found gender-based differences regarding the factors influencing anxiety and depression in isolated COVID-19 patients, with males reporting a greater general tendency for symptoms. On the other hand, female patients reported greater overall psychological nursing needs than males. Targeted nursing should thus be implemented to address specific psychological characteristics and nursing needs.","output":"Gender Differences in Anxiety, Depression, and Nursing Needs Among Isolated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness practice has been recommended as part of health and social care education and training because of its potential benefits in fostering clinical skills and attitudes, increasing self-care, and reducing the effect of stress in education and occupation. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on stress, physical distress, job burnout, work engagement, and empathy for health and social care education. METHODS: Students (N = 124) from postgraduate programs in social work, counseling, and family therapy were recruited. Sixty-four students participated in an 8-week MBSR program as an elective course. Sixty students were recruited from other elective courses in the same cohort as control group participants. All participants completed self-report assessments. RESULTS: The results suggested that MBSR was associated with significant improvements in perceived efficacy and vigor and significant reductions in physical distress, total job burnout, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization of clients compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the growing body of literature highlighting the potential use of mindfulness practice to improve students personal well-being and professional growth in health and social care education.

C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize carbohydrate structures on endogenous molecules and pathogens. The myeloid CLR dendritic cell immunoreceptor (DCIR) is expressed by antigen presenting cells and mediates inhibitory intracellular signalling. To investigate the effect of DCIR on neurotropic virus infection, mice were infected experimentally with Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). Brain tissue of TMEV-infected C57BL/6 mice and DCIR(?/?) mice were analysed by histology, immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, and spleen tissue by flow cytometry. To determine the impact of DCIR deficiency on T cell responses upon TMEV infection in vitro, antigen presentation assays were utilised. Genetic DCIR ablation in C57BL/6 mice was associated with an ameliorated hippocampal integrity together with reduced cerebral cytokine responses and reduced TMEV loads in the brain. Additionally, absence of DCIR favoured increased peripheral cytotoxic CD8(+) T cell responses following TMEV infection. Co-culture experiments revealed that DCIR deficiency enhances the activation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells by virus-exposed dendritic cells (DCs), indicated by increased release of interleukin-2 and interferon-. Results suggest that DCIR deficiency has a supportive influence on antiviral immune mechanisms, facilitating virus control in the brain and ameliorates neuropathology during acute neurotropic virus infection.","output":"C-type lectin receptor DCIR contributes to hippocampal injury in acute neurotropic virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the worldwide spread of the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by a new strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic.

However, viruses are able to evade the immune attack and proliferate and, in susceptible individuals, cause severe inflammatory response known as cytokine storm, particularly in the lungs. The advancement in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the host immune responses promises to facilitate the development of approaches for prevention or treatment of diseases. Components of immune system, such as antibodies, can also be used to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic methods as well as novel therapeutic agents. In this review, we summarize our knowledge about how the host mounts immune responses to infection by SARS-CoV-2.

These systemic failures may be associated with cytokine release syndrome, characterized by hyperpyrexia, thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and the elevation of other inflammatory markers. Rhabdomyolysis with high fever is a complication that is rarely found in COVID-19. The exact relations of these clinical conditions in patients with COVID-19 remain unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 36-year-old man with severe COVID-19 complicated by rhabdomyolysis and high fever. After admission, his condition continued to deteriorate, with a high body temperature. On day 9, the patient had elevated creatine kinase and myoglobin levels consistent with rhabdomyolysis (26,046 U/L and 3668 ng/mL, respectively). In addition to viral therapy, he was immediately treated with hydration. However, the patient had persistent fever and elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was diagnosed with malignant hyperthermia as a late complication of COVID-19, although he had no hereditary predisposition to malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The administration of dantrolene with muscle relaxation and anti-inflammatory function showed potential efficacy for rhabdomyolysis, high fever, and increased plasma inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant hyperthermia is triggered by not only anesthetic agents but also viral infections. A possible mechanism of malignant hyperthermia is hypersensitivity of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These include mutations in or the activation of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor calcium release channel. Dantrolene is a ryanodine receptor antagonist and is used as an anti-inflammatory agent. The administration of dantrolene showed potential efficacy for rhabdomyolysis, high body temperature due to inflammation, and increased inflammatory markers. The underlying mechanism of the association of rhabdomyolysis and high fever in COVID-19 might be similar to the pathogenesis of malignant hyperthermia.","output":"Beneficial effects of dantrolene in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis as a potential late complication associated with COVID-19: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In 2020, colorectal cancer (CRC) was the most diagnosed cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer related mortality in Portugal. Early detection and adequate treatment lead to improvements in mortality. Increasing participation in screening programs has been challenging and health authorities in Portugal reported that in 2018 only 40% of the target population had an up-to-date screening status. Not only screening but also access to specialized consultation and surgery seem to preclude timely treatment. The year 2020 brought forth another challenge as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic halted screening efforts and discouraged patients from seeking healthcare. We hypothesized that under these conditions an increase in colorectal obstruction and more advanced staging at diagnosis would be observed. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively identified the consecutive cases of malignant colorectal obstruction (MCO) that presented to the emergency department and demanded emergent surgery between January 1st 2017 and March 1st 2021. Recruitment was performed by reviewing operating room logbooks and electronic patient records. A total of 226 patients operated for colorectal obstruction were identified. Patients with benign disease or non-digestive primary were excluded and the 161 remaining cases were reviewed. Results: Median age of patients 72(29-97) years and female to male ratio of 1:1.3. Statistical analysis of complete years (2017-2020) observed an overall average of 39(8.4) cases/year with no clear increasing trend. Previous CRC diagnosis had been established in 20.0%, 28.9%, 37.3% and 31.3% of cases in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. Stage III or higher at pathological diagnosis was increasingly more frequent (62.9%, 76.3%, 76.5%, 81.3 %) but M status remained stable at an average of 42.7(5.9)%. Surgical approach did not vary and in an average of 33.6(2.7)% of patients, derivative surgery alone was indicated (palliation or bridge to therapy) and in 72.4(1.0)% of patients, resection with ostomy was performed. Conclusions: The descriptive nature of this analysis hinders the accuracy of its conclusions but offers some insights. The incidence of MCO did not seem to vary, however our selection is biased as patients may have searched for emergent care in other hospitals. In the patients that evolve to obstruction, the delay in screening and treatment implementation seem to result in an increase in stage at surgery dependent on lymph node status as metastatic disease remained stable. It seems early to observe the effect of the pandemic on timely diagnosis and treatment, but it seems it contributed for a higher staging at diagnosis. It is possible we would find a similar effect on non-obstructive cases rather than an increase in MCO. A larger scope and prospective recruitment seem key to capturing this difference in outcomes.","output":"Malignant colorectal obstruction: a university hospital 4-year retrospective case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019 the SARS-CoV-2 virus appeared in the world, mainly presenting as an acute infection of the lower respiratory tract, namely pneumonia.

This RCT has shown that the administration of potassium canrenoate to patients with COVID-19 induced pneumonia was not associated with shorter mechanical ventilation time, shorter passive oxygenation, shorter length of hospitalization or less fibrotic changes on CT imaging. The overall mortality rate was not significantly different between the two groups. Adverse events recorded in this study were not significantly increased by the administration of potassium canrenoate.

The data were analyzed via frequency, mean, standard deviation, Cronbach's alpha analysis, linear regression, Pearson correlation analysis, independent samples t-test, and ANOVA test. RESULTS Self-stigmatization (32.48  15.15) and perceived social support (44.36  22.88) were found to be moderate in caregivers. Self-stigmatization was found to be higher in caregivers who do not work; have a spouse, mother, or father; have a disease; do not receive support from their family and have not received any education about schizophrenia (p < .05). It was determined that, with increasing age, perceived social support decreases, and the perception of social support increases in caregivers who are high school graduates, working, having children, have no illness, and are educated about schizophrenia (p < .05). It was determined that, as the level of perceived social support increases in caregivers, self-stigmatization decreases (p < .05).

They report that, while respiratory tract infections were associated with graft loss and death in nonClung transplant recipients, lower respiratory tract and influenza infections were associated with graft loss and death in both lung and nonClung transplant recipients. Helanter? and colleagues (page 1848) focused specifically on influenza in Finland, reporting on more than 3900 kidney transplant recipients. Compared to the general Finnish population of approximately 5.5 million, kidney transplant recipients have a greater than fivefold increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for laboratory\\\\confirmed influenza and a greater than fourfold SIR for hospitalization.

The management of this emergency sanitary situation could not take care of the possible indirect adverse effects on the environment, such as the release of a large amount of pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plants. The massive use of drugs, which were never used so widely until then, implied new risks for the aquatic environment. In this study, a suspect screening approach using Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry techniques, allowed us to survey the presence of pharmaceuticals used for COVID-19 treatment in three WWTPs of Lombardy region, where the first European cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases was detected. Starting from a list of sixty-three suspect compounds used against COVID-19 (including some metabolites and transformation products), six compounds were fully identified and monitored together with other target analytes, mainly pharmaceuticals of common use. A monthly monitoring campaign was conducted in a WWTP from April to December 2020 and the temporal trends of some anti-COVID-19 drugs were positively correlated with those of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The comparison of the average emission loads among the three WWTPs evidenced that the highest loads of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were measured in the WWTP which received the sewages from a hospital specializing in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The monitoring of the receiving water bodies evidenced the presence of eight compounds of high ecological concern, whose risk was assessed in terms of toxicity and the possibility of inducing antibiotic and viral resistance.

Here, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects acute stroke care through interruptions in the stroke chain of survival. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe. To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region. RESULTS: Following confinement of the population, our stroke unit activity decreased sharply, with a 25% reduction in admitted cases (mean number of 58 cases every 15 days in previous months to 44 cases in the 15 days after the outbreak, P<0.001). Consultations to the telestroke network declined from 25 every 15 days before the outbreak to 7 after the outbreak (P<0.001). The increasing trend in the prehospital diagnosis of stroke activated by 911 calls stopped abruptly in the region, regressing to 2019 levels.

A total of 69 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were classified as asymptomatic infection (n = 14), nonsevere (n = 39), and severe (n = 16) groups. Decreased lymphocytes and increased CD14 + 4- monocytes are found in patients with severe COVID-19. Decreased CD4 expression level was observed in the monocytes of patients with severe COVID-19. The total lymphocytes, B and T lymphocytes, CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells, and natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells were found to be decreased in patients with severe COVID-19. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was not significantly different between patients with COVID-19 and healthy controls. The percentage of activated T cells (CD3+HLA-DR+) and B cells (CD19+CD38+) was lower in patients with severe COVID-19. Age and CD4- monocytes were independent predictors of disease severity. The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect lymphocyte subsets, resulting in decreased T and B cells, monocytes, and NK and NKT cells. Decreased CD4 expression level by monocytes was significantly correlated with disease severity. Further studies on the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to predict the disease severity and protect against the virus.","output":"Lymphocyte Subset Alteration and Monocyte CD4 Expression Reduction in Patients with Severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several contact tracing solutions have been proposed and implemented all around the globe to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

The dynamics of ligand binding to ions of transition metals falls within the realm of Coordination Chemistry, and it provides the basic principles controlling traffic, regulation, and use of metals in cells. Yet, the cellular environment stands out against the conditions prevailing in the test tube when studying metal ions and their interactions with various ligands. Indeed, the complex and often changing cellular environment stimulates fast metalCligand exchange that mostly escapes presently available probing methods. Reducing the complexity of the problem with purified proteins or in model organisms, although useful, is not free from pitfalls and misleading results. These problems arise mainly from the absence of the biosynthetic machinery and accessory proteins or chaperones dealing with metal / metal groups in cells. Even cells struggle with metal selectivity, as they do not have a metal-directed quality control system for metalloproteins, and serendipitous metal binding is probably not exceptional. The issue of metal exchange in biology is reviewed with particular reference to iron and illustrating examples in patho-physiology, regulation, nutrition, and toxicity.","output":"Cellular Dynamics of Transition Metal Exchange on Proteins: A Challenge but a Bonanza for Coordination Chemistry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Amphiphilic chitosan, bPalm-CS-HTAP, having N-(2-((2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl) (bPalm) groups as double hydrophobic tails and O-[(2-hydroxyl-3-trimethylammonium)] propyl (HTAP) groups as hydrophilic heads was synthesized and evaluated for its self-assembly properties and potential as a gene carrier.

However, less than 50% of patients have complete kidney recovery and relapse of ATIN can occur. Infliximab is effective in treating other immune-related adverse events but its use for the treatment of CPI-ATIN is not well established. We report the first retrospective study examining the steroid-sparing potential of infliximab in achieving durable and complete renal recovery for patients with CPI-ATIN. Data were collected from medical records of patients diagnosed with CPI-AKI with a kidney biopsy or clinical diagnosis of ATIN that was managed with GC and infliximab.

Four patients relapsing after GC therapy achieved durable and complete renal recovery, four patients experienced partial renal recovery, and two patients showed no improvement in kidney function. This is the first study evaluating clinical outcomes using an infliximab-containing regimen for treatment of relapsed CPI-ATIN in patients or patients failing to achieve complete response after primary therapy. Our data suggest that infliximab may be a treatment option for achieving durable and complete renal recovery in this patient population and represents a potential steroid-sparing strategy in challenging cases of CPI-ATIN.

However, little was known about whether fipronil and fipronil sulfone transferred into fetus through the blood placenta barrier. Our objectives were to investigate the transplacental transfer and the pharmacokinetics of fipronil and fipronil sulfone in rats. Male and 13-day gestation female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in pharmacokinetics and transplacental transfer experiments, respectively. Biological samples were collected at each time point after fipronil intravenous or oral administration. To monitor fipronil and fipronil sulfone in the plasma, placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetus, a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed. After fipronil administration in male rats, the oral bioavailability decreased while the biotransformation increased as the dose increased, revealed an enhancement of first-pass effect and a fast metabolism in vivo. The results of fipronil transplacental transfer in pregnant rats demonstrated that the concentration of fipronil and fipronil sulfone varied in the following order respectively: placenta > plasma > fetus > amniotic fluid and plasma > placenta > fetus > amniotic fluid. This is the first direct evidence that fipronil and fipronil sulfone cross the blood placental barriers and enter the fetus. The amount of fipronil distributed to the fetus was greater than that of fipronil sulfone in the short term, but by contrast, pharmacokinetic data showed that the latter stayed longer in the body. These findings provide constructive information for public health alarm. Significance Statement Fipronil and fipronil sulfone interfere with the GABAergic system. Fipronil can cause thyroid dysfunction, which may affect brain growth and nerve development.

A cross sectional study was made, sampling total daily cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta from March 3 to July 3, 2020. Climate variability consisted of the mean daily temperature (MDT), mean daily humidity (MDH), mean daily rainfall (MDR), length of solar radiation (LSR), and mean daily wind velocity (MDW). The incidence of COVID-19 was registered by data in the Department of Health (DoH) in Jakarta, while climate variability was obtained by data from the Geophysical and Meteorological Board (BMKG). This data was analyzed by Pearson correlation, Poisson regression and linear regression using SPSS version 23. The mean and standard deviations of the incidences of COVID-19 during the four months were 98.32 +/- 56, MDT 29.1 +/- 0.77, MDH 77.9 +/- 3.84, MDR 51.3 +/- 453.2, LSR 5.03 +/- 2.5, and MDW 1.7 +/- 0.51.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 892 nurses was conducted during four weeks from February to March 2021. METHODS: Sociodemographic data related to the pandemic were collected and anxiety, depression, burnout and post-traumatic stress were measured with validated scales. A multivariate and predictive analysis was carried out with risk estimates. FINDINGS: 75.6% of the nurses had experience in COVID-19 units, and 49.1% had worked for more than 10 months in a COVID-19 unit. Nurses in COVID-19 units (hospital ward or ICU) were more likely to report emotional fatigue (OR 1.9, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 1.5, p = 0.021). In general, moderate posttraumatic stress was evident in general nurses (p = 0.027), and severe posttraumatic stress was evident in ICU nurses (p = 0.027). A 1.24-month reduction in COVID-19 patient care predicted reduced levels of emotional fatigue (5.45 points), depersonalization (1.87 points) and posttraumatic stress (4.65 points) in nurses.

The key insight is that a negative result in the first stage implies negative infection for all individuals. Thus, a single test could rule out infection in multiple individuals. Using simulations, we show that this protocol reduces the required number of testing kits, especially when the infection rate is low, alleviating a key bottleneck for public health authorities in times of pandemics and epidemics such as COVID-19. Our proposed protocol is expected to be more effective when the infection rate is low, which suggests that it is better suited for early stage and large-scale, population-wide testing. However, the managerial trade-off is that the protocol has costs in additional time for returning test results and an increased number of false negatives.

In some types of lysosomal diseases, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is administered intravenously in weekly or biweekly doses. Unfortunately, scheduled ERT during COVID-19 was disrupted. We considered the possibility of adverse outcomes caused by the disruption in the treatment of patients with lysosomal storage disorders. METHODS During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a questionnaire that was delivered via Internet to assess how this vulnerable patient group was affected by the pandemic in terms of their access to treatment and their disease-related symptoms. RESULTS The questionnaire was filled out by 75 patients. There were 35 patients whose treatment dose was missed because of COVID-19. The most common reason for skipping treatment was not wanting to go to the hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19. These 35 patients missed a median of four doses of ERT (range: 1-16 dosages).

The aim was to estimate hospitalization rates among exposed civilians who later immigrated to Israel. We conducted a historical follow-up study, among persons exposed to Chernobyl (n = 1128) using linked hospitalization records from Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC), compared with immigrants from other areas of the Former Soviet Union (FSU) (n = 11,574), immigrants not from FSU (n = 11,742) and native-born Israelis (n = 8351), matched on age and gender (N = 32,795). Hospitalizations for specific ICD-10 coded diagnostic groups were analyzed by exposure and comparison groups by gender and age at accident. In addition, the rate of hospitalization, and the duration of hospital days and the number of hospitalizations for these selected diagnostic groups was also calculated. Hospitalizations for specific ICD-10 coded diagnostic groups and for any hospitalization in these diagnostic groups in general were analyzed by exposure and comparison groups and by covariates (gender and age at accident). The rate of any hospitalization for the selected diagnostic groups was elevated in the low exposure Chernobyl group (51.1%), which was significantly higher than the immigrant (41.6%) and the Israel-born comparison group (35.1%) (p < .01) but did not differ from either the high exposure group (46.9%) or the FSU comparison group (46.4%), according to the post-hoc tests. The total number of hospitalizations in the low exposure Chernobyl group (2.35) differed from the immigrant (1.73) and Israel comparison group (1.26) (p < .01) but did not differ from the FSU comparison group (1.73) or the high exposure group (2.10). Low exposure women showed higher rates of circulatory hospitalizations (33.8%) compared to immigrants (22.8%) and Israeli born (16.5%), while high exposure women (27.5%) only differed from Israelis (p < .01). Neither exposure group differed from FSU immigrant women on the rate of circulatory hospitalizations. Post-hoc tests showed that among women in the low exposure group, there was a significant difference in rate of hospitalizations for neoplasms (28.6%) compared to the three comparison groups; FSU (18.6%), immigrants (15.7%) and Israel (13.1) (p < .01). Those among the low exposure group who were over the age of 20 at the time of the accident showed the higher rates of circulatory (51.2%) and neoplasm hospitalizations (33.3%), compared to the other immigrant groups (p < .01). When controlling for both age at accident and gender, hospitalizations for neoplasms were higher among Chernobyl-exposed populations (RR = 1.65, RR = 1.77 for high and low-exposure groups, respectively) compared to other FSU immigrants (RR = 1.31) other immigrants (RR = 1.11) and Israeli born (RR = 1.0) after controlling for gender and age at accident. High RRs attributable to Chernobyl exposure were also found for circulatory diseases compared to other immigrants and Israeli born (RRs = 1.50, 1.47 for high and low exposure compared to 1.11. and 1.0, other immigrants and Israeli born, respectively). Endocrine problems and disorders of the eye also showed elevated RR compared to the immigrant comparison groups. Respiratory and mental disorders did not show any consistent association with Chernobyl exposure. The findings support unique Chernobyl morbidity associations only in some diagnostic groups, particularly for low exposure women. General immigration effects on hospitalizations compared to the Israeli born population were found on all diagnostic groups. There is a need to improve the services and medical follow-up for these Chernobyl exposed groups in specific diagnostic groups.","output":"Hospitalizations Among Chernobyl-Exposed Immigrants to the Negev of Israel, 1992-2017: A Historical Follow-Up Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction This study aimed to identify factors associated with self-medication in patients with COVID-19.

A solution is to adopt data-driven approaches where user-generated data are collected to extract information on the extent each transport service was used. This is consistently used. However, it suffers from incomplete data, as not all users always validate their ticket when checking out or when switching lines.

Yet, as few as 20% of these women are treated with frontline interventions such as evidence-based psychological treatments. Major barriers to uptake are the limited number of specialized mental health treatment providers in most settings, and problems with accessing in-person care, such as childcare or transportation. Task sharing of treatment to non-specialist providers with delivery on telemedicine platforms could address such barriers. However, the equivalence of these strategies to specialist and in-person models remains unproven. METHODS: This study protocol outlines the Scaling Up Maternal Mental healthcare by Increasing access to Treatment (SUMMIT) randomized trial. SUMMIT is a pragmatic, non-inferiority test of the comparable effectiveness of two types of providers (specialist vs. non-specialist) and delivery modes (telemedicine vs. in-person) of a brief, behavioral activation (BA) treatment for perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Specialists (psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers with  5 years of therapy experience) and non-specialists (nurses and midwives with no formal training in mental health care) were trained in the BA protocol, with the latter supervised by a BA expert during treatment delivery. Consenting pregnant and postpartum women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of  10 (N = 1368) will be randomized to one of four arms (telemedicine specialist, telemedicine non-specialist, in-person specialist, in-person non-specialist), stratified by pregnancy status (antenatal/postnatal) and study site. The primary outcome is participant-reported depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes are maternal symptoms of anxiety and trauma symptoms, perceived social support, activation levels and quality of life at 3-, 6-, and 12-month post-randomization, and depressive symptoms at 6- and 12-month post-randomization. Primary analyses are per-protocol and intent-to-treat. The study has successfully continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with needed adaptations, including temporary suspension of the in-person arms and ongoing randomization to telemedicine arms. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT trial is expected to generate evidence on the non-inferiority of BA delivered by a non-specialist provider compared to specialist and telemedicine compared to in-person. If confirmed, results could pave the way to a dramatic increase in access to treatment for perinatal depression and anxiety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 04153864.

Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are strongly associated with respiratory symptoms during infection, but gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain, have been identified in subsets of COVID-19 patients. This article focuses on gastrointestinal symptoms and pathophysiology in COVID-19 disease. Evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal tract could be a viral target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Not only is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 highly expressed in the GI tract and is associated with digestive symptoms, but bleeding and inflammation are observed in the intestine of COVID-19 patients. We further systemically summarize the correlation between COVID-19 disease, gastrointestinal symptoms and intestinal microbiota. The potential oral-fecal transmission of COVID-19 was supported by viral RNA and live virus detection in the feces of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the viral balance in the GI tract could be disordered during SARS-CoV-2 infection which could further impact the homeostasis of the gut microbial flora. Finally, we discuss the clinical and ongoing trials of treatments/therapies, including antiviral drugs, plasma transfusion and immunoglobulins, and diet supplementations for COVID-19. By reviewing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and understanding the correlation among COVID-19, inflammation, intestinal microbiota, and lung microbiota, we provide perspective in prevention and control, as well as diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease.","output":"Gastrointestinal symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak, the lockdown of all activities including schools and universities became a normal habit, forcing educational institutes to find new ways to ensure the continuity of the learning process.

This systematic review aims (i) to explore the intersectoral costs associated with STIs and HIV considered in cost-of-illness (COI) studies, (ii) to categorise and analyse these costs according to cost sectors, and (iii) to illustrate the impact of intersectoral costs on the total cost burden. METHODS: Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Ovid), Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EconLit and NHS EED were searched between 2009 and 2019. Key search terms included terms for cost-of-illness, cost analysis and all terms for STIs including specific infections. Studies were included that assessed intersectoral costs. A standardised data extraction form was adopted. A cost component table was established based on pre-defined sector-specific classification schemes. Cost results for intersectoral costs were recorded. The quality of studies was assessed using a modified version of the CHEC-list. RESULTS: 75 COI studies were considered for title/abstract screening. Only six studies were available in full-text and eligible for data extraction and narrative synthesis. Intersectoral costs were captured in the following sectors: Patient & family, Informal care and Productivity (Paid Labour). Patient & family costs were addressed in four studies, including patient out-of-pocket payments/co-payments and travel costs. Informal care costs including unpaid (home) care support by family/friends and other caregiver costs were considered in three studies. All six studies estimated productivity costs for paid labour including costs in terms of absenteeism, disability, cease-to-work, presenteeism and premature death. Intersectoral costs largely contributed to the total economic cost burden of STIs and HIV. The quality assessment revealed methodological differences. CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that intersectoral costs associated with STIs and HIV are substantial. If relevant intersectoral costs are not included in cost analyses the total cost burden of STIs and HIV to society is severely underestimated. Therefore, intersectoral costs need to be addressed in order to ensure the total economic burden of STIs and HIV on society is assessed, and communicated to policy/decision-makers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, patients with RT-PCR test positive in the first nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were accepted as true positive, and patients with negative 3 consecutive swab results were considered true negative. Those who had a negative initial swab were considered false negatives if they subsequently tested positive on the second or third swab. Demographic data of the patients, the onset of the disease, presence of nasal septal deviation, presence of epistaxis, the clinician (otolaryngologist/other physicians [OP]) who collected the samples, and medical treatments for laryngopharyngeal reflux, allergic respiratory diseases, allergic rhinitis, which include proton pump inhibitors and nasal steroids (NS), were documented. The analysis of dependent variables was performed with the chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was performed for significant variables. RESULTS: A total of 399 patients were included in the study, and 357 (89.5%) patients were detected as positive after 2 or 3 consecutive RT-PCR tests. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, and collecting the samples within 7 days following the onset of symptoms were determined as significant factors for positive RT-PCR results (P = <.001; odds ratio [OR] = 6.2, 5.8, 11.6, respectively). The profession of the clinician (OP), NS use, and the presence of epistaxis were detected as significant factors for the false-negative RT-PCR results (P < .001; OR = 2.3, 3.1, 8.7, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patient- and/or sample-related factors can affect RT-PCR results of possible COVID-19 cases. The presence of these factors can easily be determined in cases with high clinical suspicion and negative RT-PCR results. The presence of ageusia, anosmia, early sampling (<7days), and appropriate collection of swabs decrease false-negative RT-PCR results.","output":"Analysis of Factors Causing False-Negative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Results in Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal Swabs of Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveStudies describe COVID-19 patient characteristics and outcomes across populations, but reports of variation across healthcare facilities are lacking The objectives were to examine differences in COVID-19 patient volume and mortality across facilities, and understand whether facility variation in mortality was due primarily to differences in patient versus facility characteristics DesignObservational cohort study with multilevel mixed effects logistic regression modelling SettingThe Veterans Health Administration (VA) is the largest healthcare system in the USA ParticipantsPatients with COVID-19 Main outcomeAll-cause mortality within 45 days after COVID-19 testing (MarchCMay, follow-up through 16 July 2020) ResultsAmong 13 510 patients with COVID-19, 3942 (29 2%) were admitted (2266/3942 (57 5%) ward;1676/3942 (42 5%) intensive care unit (ICU)) and 679/3942 (17 2%) received mechanical ventilation Marked heterogeneity was observed across facilities in median age (range: 34 3C83 9 years;facility mean: 64 7, SD 7 2 years);patient volume (range: 1C737 at 160 facilities;facility median: 48 5, IQR 14C105 5);hospital admissions (range: 1C286 at 133 facilities;facility median: 11, IQR 1C26 5);ICU caseload (range: 1C85 at 115 facilities;facility median: 4, IQR 0C12);and mechanical ventilation (range: 1C53 at 90 facilities;facility median: 1, IQR 0C5) Heterogeneity was also observed in facility mortality for all patients with COVID-19 (range: 0%C29 7%;facility median: 8 9%, IQR 2 4%C13 7%);inpatients (range: 0%C100%;facility median: 18 0%, IQR 5 6%C28 6%);ICU patients (range: 0%C100%;facility median: 28 6%, IQR 14 3%C50 0%);and mechanical ventilator patients (range: 0%C100%;facility median: 52 7%, IQR 33 3%C80 6%) The majority of variation in facility mortality was attributable to differences in patient characteristics (eg, age) ConclusionsMarked heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient volume, characteristics and mortality were observed across VA facilities nationwide Differences in patient characteristics accounted for the majority of explained variation in mortality across sites Variation in unadjusted COVID-19 mortality across facilities or nations should be considered with caution","output":"Heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient volume, characteristics and outcomes across US Department of Veterans Affairs facilities: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to the coronavirus 2019 pandemic limiting both applicants and residency programs in their ability to connect in-person, it is likely that a shift toward virtual connections was made.

Based on this, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) has recently developed a digital health tool dedicated to patients with hematologic malignancies: the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this web-based platform are to generate relevant data to better understand quality of life, symptoms, and medication adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era; to develop a prospective real-life registry on outcomes of patients with hematologic cancer, with or without a diagnosis of COVID-19; and to facilitate patient-centered care in routine practice. METHODS: The platform consists of physician- and patient-secure portals and enables electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments with real-time graphical presentation to physicians of individual patient symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes. Automated alerts are sent to treating hematologists based on the following predetermined criteria: presence of clinically important problems and symptoms, problems with adherence to therapy, and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform also allows physicians to set up video consultations. Clinical information regarding disease and treatment as well as clinical and survival outcomes are also prospectively collected. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in December 2020. As of April 2021, a total of 116 patients have been enrolled in this study. Use of this platform may help to improve patient-physician communication and help hematologists in the early recognition of clinically important problems and symptoms of their patients. More than 20 community and university-based hospitals have currently agreed to participate. In addition to patient-reported outcome data, the prospective collection of disease- and treatment-related information, as well as data on possible COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 vaccination, will allow the development of a large database to also identify subgroups of patients at risk of poor outcomes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of its variation as a possible mediator of the efficacy of enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-E) on classic ED symptomatology, including body uneasiness. METHODS: 73 patients with anorexia nervosa and 68 with bulimia nervosa were treated with a multidisciplinary approach including CBT-E. Psychometric questionnaires were administered at baseline (T0) and after one (T1) and 2 years (T2) to evaluate general and ED-specific psychopathology, body uneasiness and the embodiment disorder. Data regarding diagnostic crossover and remission were also collected. RESULTS: Longitudinal analysis showed an improvement of all psychopathological dimensions at T1, which remained stable at T2 (p < 0.05). Remission rate at T2 was 44.7%, and diagnostic crossover occurred in 17.0% of patients. Higher levels of embodiment disorder predicted increased diagnostic instability (OR: 1.80 [1.01C3.20], p = 0.045).

According to the obtained results, the greater the distance between their home and workplace, the higher the acceptance score declared by the survey participants about remote working. Additionally, higher incomes and better-quality lifestyles with larger devotion to leisure activities also provide higher acceptance. Finally, the existence of a comfortable room to be used for work activities plays a crucial role on the declared acceptance. From an environmental point of view, remote working is always sustainable in case of long commuting distances (above 10 km) are avoided on a daily routine. In conclusion, a sensible use of remote working could reduce the environmental impact of any organization employing desk-workers as well as improve their work satisfaction and lifestyle.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to estimate the prevalence and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis . METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and MedRxiv databases were searched from December 1, 2019, up to July 27, 2020. Two independent co-authors completed the screening process, data extraction, and quality assessment of the retrieved records. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to determine the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) of AKI among COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Out of 2,332 unique identified records, 51 studies were included in the review. Overall, the studies were carried out on 25,600 patients. A total of 6,505 patients (in 18 cross-sectional studies) were included to estimate the pooled prevalence of AKI, and 18,934 patients (in 27 cohort studies) were included to determine the pooled incidence of AKI. The pooled prevalence of AKI was estimated as 10.08% (95% CI: 4.59, 17.32; I2=98.56%; P<0.001). Furthermore, the pooled incidence of AKI was 12.78% (95% CI: 7.38, 19.36; I2=99.27%; P<0.001).

This study aimed to investigate knowledge and socio-cognitive perceptions, and their associations with such protective behaviours, in UK university students. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 293 students was undertaken on 13 May 2020. Survey questions addressed demographics, knowledge of the disease and effectiveness of the protective measures, risk perception, socio-cognitive perceptions (e.g. attitude, social support, and self-efficacy), habit, time factors and trust, as well as the hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest associations of potential determinants with behaviour. RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of social distancing with 88.9% answering Mostly or Always for every activity, but only 42.0% reporting the same for all hand hygiene activities. Knowledge of the effectiveness of each activity in preventing transmission was high, with 90.7% and 93.5% respectively identifying at least 7 of 8 hand hygiene or 9 of 10 social distancing activities correctly. Habit ( = 0.39, p = 0.001) and time factors ( = 0.28, p = 0.001) were the greatest contributors to unique variance in hand hygiene behaviour, followed by ethnicity ( = ? 0.13, p = 0.014) and risk perception ( = 0.13, p = 0.016). For social distancing behaviour, the determinants were self-efficacy ( = 0.25, p < 0.001), perceived advantages ( = 0.15, p = 0.022), trust in policy ( = 0.14, p = 0.026) and gender ( = ? 0.14, p = 0.016). Regression models explained 40% hand hygiene and 25% social distancing variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that communications about effectiveness of hand hygiene and social distancing behaviours had been effective in terms of knowledge acquisition. However, in the light of likely second waves of COVID-19, attention to maintaining social distancing behaviour and improving hand hygiene behaviour may need to address more difficult areas of changing habits, overcoming time factors and building trust, as well as interventions to increase self-efficacy and address risk perception concerns.

Such outcomes include low mood, suicide, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Studies have mostly looked at the mental health of general citizens, healthcare workers, or infected survivors, with limited research targeting university students. This study aimed to understand the psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS Undergraduate students enrolled at the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in a 47-item online questionnaire. 73 participants completed the questionnaire. Demographic data, data about COVID-19 exposure, stressors during quarantine, understanding the rationale, compliance, and difficulties associated with quarantine, and levels of psychological distress were analysed. RESULTS 75.3% of the participants were considered as having a high risk of developing acute stress. Undergoing quarantine for more than 14 days, having a chronic medical illness, inadequate access to supplies, and fear of infection were all significantly associated with an increased risk of acute stress. CONCLUSION Despite being a necessary preventive measure during infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be associated with negative psychological effects, particularly in undergraduate students. Providing preventive and effective interventions is of utmost necessity.KEY POINTSDuring COVID-19, three-quarter of students had high risk for acute stress.Females had higher odds of high-risk acute stress compared to males.Having a chronic medical condition was associated with high risk acute stress.Long quarantine and lack of supplies were associated with high risk acute stress.Providing interventions to protect the mental health of students is necessary.","output":"Psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The use of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described, but reported utilisation and outcomes are variable, and detailed information on patient characteristics is lacking We aim to report clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients requiring VV-ECMO, admitted over 2 months to a high-volume centre in the UK Methods: Patient information, including baseline characteristics and clinical parameters, was collected retrospectively from electronic health records for COVID-19 VV-ECMO admissions between 3 March and 2 May 2020 Clinical management is described Data are reported for survivors and nonsurvivors Results: We describe 43 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who received VV-ECMO Median age was 46 years (interquartile range 35 5C52 5) and 76 7% were male Median time from symptom onset to VV-ECMO was 14 days (interquartile range 11C17 5) All patients underwent computed tomography imaging, revealing extensive pulmonary consolidation in 95 3%, and pulmonary embolus in 27 9% Overall, 79 1% received immunomodulation with methylprednisolone for persistent maladaptive hyperinflammatory state Vasopressors were used in 86%, and 44 2% received renal replacement therapy Median duration on VV-ECMO was 13 days (interquartile range 8C20) 14 patients died (32 6%) and 29 survived (67 4%) to hospital discharge Nonsurvivors had significantly higher d-dimer (38 2 versus 9 5 mgL?1, fibrinogen equivalent units;p=0 035) and creatinine (169 versus 73 molL?1;p=0 022) at commencement of VV-ECMO Conclusions: Our data support the use of VV-ECMO in selected COVID-19 patients The cohort was characterised by high degree of alveolar consolidation, systemic inflammation and intravascular thrombosis","output":"Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Population density can limit the level of care that can be provided in local facilities in Ontario, and as such, patients with severe illnesses often require interfacility transfers to access specialized care. This study aimed to identify causes of delay in interfacility transport by air ambulance in Ontario. METHODS: Causes of delay were identified by manual review of electronic patient care records (ePCRs). All emergent interfacility transfers conducted by Ornge, the sole provider of air-based medical transport in Ontario, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 were included. The ePCRs were reviewed if they met one or more of the following: (1) contained a standardized delay code; (2) contained free text including \\"delay\\", \\"wait\\", or \\"duty-out\\"; (3) were above the 75th percentile in total transport time; or (4) were above the 90th percentile in time to bedside, time at the sending hospital, or time to receiving facility. RESULTS: Our search strategy identified 1,220 ePCRs for manual review, which identified a total of 872 delays. Common delays cited included aircraft refueling (234 delays), waiting for land emergency medical service (EMS) escort (146), and staffing- or dispatch-related issues (124). Other delays included weather/environmental hazards (43); mechanical issues (36); and procedures, imaging, or stabilization (80). CONCLUSIONS: Some common causes of interfacility delay are potentially modifiable: better trip planning around refueling and improved coordination with local EMS, could reduce delays experienced during interfacility trips.

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. To determine the characteristics of patients transported for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we included patient data from February 2, 2020, to May 6, 2020. To investigate the surge capacity and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19, we built and validated an interactive operations area-level discrete event simulation decision support model underpinned by RFDS air medical activity data from 2015 to 2019 (4 years). This model was subsequently used in a factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate both the supply of RFDS air medical services and the increased rates of demand for these services for diseases of the respiratory system. Results: The RFDS conducted 291 patient episodes of care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This included 288 separate patients, including 136 men and 119 women (sex missinga?=a?33), with a median age of 62.0 years (interquartile range, 43.5-74.9 years). The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision makers in understanding the system's performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand. With increased COVID-19-related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available. The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands. Conclusion: Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19-related demand for RFDS services, modeling demonstrates that the robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft.","output":"Royal Flying Doctor Service Coronavirus Disease 2019 Activity and Surge Modeling in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rice straw (RS), an agricultural resource for lignocellulosic biorefineries, can deteriorate when sun-drying is ineffective.

The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit and underwent craniotomy due to brain injuries. Two weeks following the initial procedure, pus drained from the surgical wound was microscopically examined and cultured, yielding Lichtheimia spp. Imaging showed parietal, temporal and frontal abscesses at the right side. The patient was commenced on amphotericin B and underwent surgical debridement, while histopathological examination of the affected tissue demonstrated broad, aseptate hyphae, findings typical for mucormycetes. The patient passed away due to heavy traumatic injuries after 2 months. It is speculated that direct inoculation was the portal of entry for infection, and that high steroid use for 2 weeks following inoculation contributed to the severity of infection that developed. Isolated cerebral mucormycosis in immunocompetent hosts is an extremely rare, but severe disease. Diagnosis is established through direct microscopy, histopathology and/or cultures. PCR-based techniques are useful either to detect mucormycetes in tissues, especially when cultures are negative, or to accurately identify the fungi grown in cultures at the species level.

MethodsTwo onchocerciasis transmission models (EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM) are used to simulate microfilarial prevalence trends, elimination probabilities, and age-profiles of Onchocerca volvulus microfilarial prevalence and intensity, for different treatment histories and transmission settings, assuming no interruption, a 1-year (2020) or 2-year (2020-2021) interruption. Biannual MDA or increased coverage upon MDA resumption are investigated as remedial strategies. ResultsProgrammes with shorter MDA histories and settings with high pre-intervention endemicity will be the most affected. Biannual MDA is more effective than increasing coverage for mitigating COVID-19s impact on MDA. Programmes which had already switched to biannual MDA should be minimally affected. In high transmission settings with short treatment history, a 2-year interruption could lead to increased microfilarial load in children (EPIONCHO-IBM) or adults (ONCHOSIM).

This study aims to determine whether journalists reporting on the COVID-19 crisis have been affected emotionally, and if so to assess the severity of their distress. It also investigates potential demographic and work-related predictors and whether news organisations had provided counselling to their journalists. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 111 journalists working for two international news organisations were approached of which 73 (66%) participated in the study. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms of anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7)), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)), overall psychological distress (12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)), and treatment.

While Spike mutations that enhance virus infectivity may drive the emergence of these novel variants, studies documenting a critical a role for interferon responses in the early control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, combined with the presence of viral genes that limit these responses, suggest that interferons may also influence SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Here, we compared the potency of 17 different human interferons against 5 viral lineages sampled during the course of the global outbreak that included ancestral and emerging variants. Our data revealed increased interferon resistance in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating that evasion of innate immunity is a significant driving force for SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Since substantial technical advance relies on long-term efforts and continuous progress, reasonably scheduling the distribution of agricultural products acts as a key aspect of smart public healthcare. The most intuitive factor affecting the distribution of agricultural products is its dynamic price. Forecasting price fluctuations in advance can optimize the distribution of agricultural products and pave the way to smart public healthcare. Most researchers study the prices of various agricultural products separately, without considering the interaction of different agricultural products in the time dimension. This study introduces a typical deep learning model named graph neural network (GNN) for this purpose and proposes deep data analysis-based agricultural products management for smart public healthcare (named GNN-APM for short). The highlight of GNN-APM is to take latent correlations among multiple types of agricultural products into consideration when modeling evolving rules of price sequences. A case study is set up with the use of real-world data of the agricultural products market. Simulative results reveal that the designed GNN-APM functions well.","output":"Deep Data Analysis-Based Agricultural Products Management for Smart Public Healthcare"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to compare the treatment pathway and 30-day outcomes of hip fracture patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic with the pre-pandemic period.

Boiling may reduce the immunogenicity of many antigens. More recently, the technology to transform fruit and vegetable plants have become perfected. We transformed carrot plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens to generate plants (which can be eaten raw) transgenic for an immunodominant antigen of the measles virus, a major pathogen in man. The hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein is the principle target of neutralizing and protective antibodies against measles. Copy numbers of the H transgene were verified by Southern blot and specific transcription was confirmed by RT-PCR. The H protein was detected by western blot in the membrane fraction of transformed carrot plants. The recombinant protein seemed to have a 8% lower molecular weight than the viral protein. Although this suggests a different glycosylation pattern, proper folding of the transgenic protein was confirmed by conformational-dependent monoclonal antibodies. Immunization of mice with leaf or root extracts induced high titres of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies that cross-reacted strongly with the measles virus and neutralized the virus in vitro. These results demonstrate that transgenic carrot plants can be used as an efficient expression system to produce highly immunogenic viral antigens.

The CORB, in conjunction with the multidisciplinary OR oversight committee that was formed during COVID-19 to review and triage the urgent cases, allowed for prioritization of cases among surgical services. Centralized OR booking provided opportunities that were essential in OR planning during the pandemic, including the ability to plan surgeries to maximize OR efficiency, minimize the number of admissions on any given day to the wards and the intensive care unit, flatten the number of admissions over the week and provide the flexibility to ramp up or down the number of ORs as the crisis changed.","output":"Redesigning operating room booking in a tertiary care academic centre during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thailand has been affected by COVID-19, like other countries in the Asian region at an early stage, and the first case was reported as early as mid-January 2020.

Cohorting patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) into\\"bubbles\\"has been proposed as an infection-control mechanism. In this paper, we present a novel and flexible model for clustering patient care in healthcare facilities into bubbles in order to minimize infection spread. Our model aims to control a variety of costs to patients/residents and HCPs so as to avoid hidden, downstream adverse effects of clustering patient care. This model leads to a discrete optimization problem that we call the BubbleClustering problem. This problem takes as input a temporal visit graph, representing HCP mobility, including visits by HCPs to patient/resident rooms. The output of the problem is a rewired visit graph, obtained by partitioning HCPs and patient rooms into bubbles and rewiring HCP visits to patient rooms so that patient-care is largely confined to the constructed bubbles. Even though the BubbleClustering problem is intractable in general, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem that can be solved optimally for problem instances that arise from typical hospital units and long-term-care facilities. We call our overall solution approach Cost-aware Rewiring of Networks (CoRN). We evaluate CoRN using fine-grained-movement data from a hospital-medical-intensive-care unit as well as two long-term-care facilities. These data were obtained using sensor systems we built and deployed.

Twelve NASs were calculated before operation, and patients were categorised according to each score as being either at risk or not at risk for malnutrition. The association of malnutrition according to each score and occurrence of at least one major complication was the primary endpoint, which was achieved using a multivariate logistic regression analysis including established risk factors in liver surgery as covariates. Results: The population consisted of 182 patients. The percentage of patients deemed malnourished by the NAS varied among the different scores, with the lowest being 2.20% (Mini Nutritional Assessment) and the highest 52.20% (Nutritional Risk Classification). Forty patients (22.0%) had a major complication. None of the scores were significantly associated with major complications.

Methods: : An experimental study was conducted in Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) from September 25 to October 15, 2020. A total of 188 Oro-pharyngeal swabs were collected from COVID-19 suspected cases, referred to EPHI for SARS COV-2 testing during the study period. One group of the sample was inactivated at 56 C heat for 30 min, and the other group was stored at 4C for a similar period of time. RNA extraction and detection were done by DAAN Gene extraction and detection kit. Abbott m2000 RT-PCR was used for amplification and detection. Data analysis was done by using SPSS version 23.0;Chi-square and Pearson correlation test for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis were used. P-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: : Out of 188 total samples, 117 (62.2 %) and 118 (62.8%) were positive for ORF1a/b and N gene respectively before inactivation.

In contrast, relatively little is known concerning the interplay between HIV-1 and microglia. Recent findings suggest that, counter-intuitively, HIV-1 infection may extend the lifespan of microglia. We developed a novel cell line model system to confirm and mechanistically study this phenomenon. We found that transduction of a human microglial cell line with an HIV-1 vector results in a powerful cytoprotective effect following apoptotic challenge. This effect was reproduced by ectopic expression of a single virus-encoded protein, Tat. Subsequent studies showed that the pro-survival effects of intracellular Tat could be attributed to activation of the PI-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the microglial cell line. Furthermore, we found that expression of Tat led to decreased expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI-3-K pathway. Consistent with this, decreased p53 activity and increased E2F activity were observed. Based on these findings, a model of possible regulatory circuits that intracellular Tat and HIV-1 infection engage during the cytoprotective event in microglia has been suggested. We propose that the expression of Tat may enable HIV-1 infected microglia to survive throughout the course of infection, leading to persistent HIV-1 production and infection in the central nervous system.","output":"Infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Intracellular Viral Tat Protein Exert a Pro-survival Effect in a Human Microglial Cell Line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The introduction of new vaccines has been delayed in some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which has led to delays in accessing vaccines for target patients. However, the approval lag of vaccines in the Asia-Pacific region has not been assessed. The objective of this study is to assess the availability and approval lag of vaccines in Asia-Pacific countries and compare them among Asia-Pacific countries, the United States (US), and Europe (EU). Methods: The information on vaccines prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) between 2010 and 2019 was obtained primarily from the WHO website. The date of approval of the WHO prequalified vaccine in Australia, India, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, and EU was retrieved from the official website of national regulatory agencies. The vaccines were divided into two groups based on their first approval pathway, that is, vaccines that were first approved by SRA (Stringent Regulatory Authority including the US, EU, and WHO) and those that were first approved by non-SRA. The absolute approval lag represented the availability of the vaccine. Relative approval lag represented the lag time between the approval date of the country of interest and the first global approval date and was measured as the median approval lag. A MannCWhitney U test was used to examine statistical differences between relative approval lag between the SRA first and the non-SRA first groups. Results: A total of 92 vaccines were prequalified by the WHO between 2010 and 2019, but only 61 vaccines were included in the analysis. Over 50% of vaccines were first licensed by non-SRAs. Of all the WHO-prequalified vaccines, the median approval lag in the ASEAN countries in this study was longer than those in the US and EU, with a median of 30 months in Australia, 15 months in South Korea, 52 months in Thailand, and 23 months in Singapore, compared to 0 months in the US and EU. The differences in approval lags between SRA first vaccines and non-SRA first vaccines were statistically significant in South Korea and Thailand (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The approval lag of vaccines was observed in the Asia-Pacific region, indicating a gap between the Asia-pacific region and the US and EU in regard to access to new vaccines. Future studies need to analyze the background factors related to the gap in availability and vaccine approval lag in the Asia-Pacific region and assess the impact of vaccine approval lag in the region.","output":"Delay in Vaccine Access in ASEAN Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, have been reported to play essential roles as extracellular messengers by transporting goods in various diseases, while their potential roles in bladder cancer (BC) still remain to be further studied.

To date, the most studied exosomal molecular cargo is long non\\\\coding RNA (lncRNA). Although there is increasing interest in its role and function, there is relatively little knowledge about it compared with other RNA transcripts. Nevertheless, in the past ten years, we have witnessed increasing interest in the role and function of lncRNA. For example, lncRNAs have been studied as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of BC. They may play a role as a therapeutic target in precision medicine, but they may also be directly involved in the characteristics of tumour progression, such as metastasis, epithelial\\\\mesenchymal transition and drug resistance.

In this in vitro study, we examined the stent-thrombus interaction and the influence of additional aspiration on the efficiency of mechanical thrombectomy with established stent retrievers. METHODS Human blood thrombi were made in a Chandler loop. The thrombi were placed into the middle cerebral artery of a vascular silicon phantom. A programmable piston pump was used to acquire physiological flow in the model. Resistances were interposed to gain physiological pressure. The stent retrievers Trevo, Solitaire FR, Separator 3D, and Aperio were used to perform thrombectomy under direct visual control. For the additional aspiration, we used intermediate catheters. RESULTS Ten attempts per device were made with and without aspiration under standardized conditions, a total of n = 80. For all thrombectomy maneuvers, it was demonstrated that the thrombus was pushed by the stent struts against the vessel wall and was retracted along it. The stent-thrombus interaction was only superficial for all devices. Using additional distal aspiration, the amount of distal embolism and rate of embolism in new territories was significantly lower than without. Moreover, additional aspiration reduced the number of recanalization maneuvers and the recanalization time. CONCLUSION Distal aspiration with intermediate catheters increases the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers significantly. In contrary to earlier suggestions, the interaction between the thrombus and the stent retriever is only superficial, rather than an integration of the thrombus into the retriever. No significant differences between the proven devices could be shown in our model.","output":"Stent-thrombus interaction and the influence of aspiration on mechanical thrombectomy: evaluation of different stent retrievers in a circulation model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 precipitated varied responses from public health officials in London, England.

This was followed by critical responses within HIV prevention circles. Drawing from these responses, this article examines the implications of the clinic's 'Test Now, Stop HIV' campaign by asking how has the early COVID-19 pandemic reshaped institutional responses and strategies to end HIV transmission in England? We assess how campaign messages developed between April and May 2020. We analyse materials related to the campaign, including the clinic's Twitter account, the campaign website, and journalism in mainstream media. Based on this information, we discuss three themes: testing and issues of access; the biopolitics of testing; and the idealism of quarantine. We draw on sociology, cultural theory and science and technology studies to describe how the 'end of HIV' was constructed through the link between COVID-19 and HIV. We suggest the campaign reinscribes historical perceptions of abstinence and quarantine as idealised HIV prevention strategies, and thus fails to address safer sex in the time of Coronavirus.","output":"'Test Now, Stop HIV': COVID-19 and the idealisation of quarantine as the 'end of HIV'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Our study investigates the extent to which uptake of a COVID-19 digital contact-tracing (DCT) app among the Dutch population is affected by its configurations, its societal effects, and government policies toward such an app. METHODS: We performed a discrete choice experiment among Dutch adults including 7 attributes, that is, who gets a notification, waiting time for testing, possibility for shops to refuse customers who have not installed the app, stopping condition for contact tracing, number of people unjustifiably quarantined, number of deaths prevented, and number of households with financial problems prevented. The data were analyzed by means of panel mixed logit models. RESULTS: The prevention of deaths and financial problems of households had a very strong influence on the uptake of the app. Predicted app uptake rates ranged from 24% to 78% for the worst and best possible app for these societal effects. We found a strong positive relationship between people's trust in government and people's propensity to install the DCT app. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake levels we find are much more volatile than the uptake levels predicted in comparable studies that did not include societal effects in their discrete choice experiments. Our finding that the societal effects are a major factor in the uptake of the DCT app results in a chicken-or-the-egg causality dilemma. That is, the societal effects of the app are severely influenced by the uptake of the app, but the uptake of the app is severely influenced by its societal effects.","output":"Societal Effects Are a Major Factor for the Uptake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Digital Contact Tracing App in The Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) released the Australian and New Zealand Guideline for Mild to Moderate Head Injuries in Children in 2021.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the hemodynamic effects caused by PSBPs in aneurysms treated with FD stents. METHODS We measured blood properties (density and viscosity) for 12 patients who underwent FD stent deployment. We conducted CFD simulations with the measured PSBPs and non-PSBPs quoted from previous studies. The average blood flow velocity and wall shear stress within the aneurysms were calculated and two simulation patterns were compared. RESULTS The velocity and wall shear stress changed by 2.93% and 3.16% on average, respectively, without an FD stent deployed. Conversely, with the FD stents deployed, the change rates increased to 11.1% and 9.06% on average, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The change in hemodynamic parameters if PSBPs are considered, may not be negligible when conducting CFD simulations of FD stent deployed aneurysms To obtain an adequate hemodynamic environment for cerebral aneurysms with FD stents deployed, it is recommended to use PSBPs for CFD simulations.","output":"Role of patient-specific blood properties in computational fluid dynamics simulation of flow diverter deployed cerebral aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Code blue events and related resuscitation efforts involve multidisciplinary bedside teams that implement specialized interventions aimed at patient revival.

OBJECTIVES: Plan, implement, and evaluate a culturally and linguistically appropriate screening, vaccination, and linkage-to-care initiative that used Vietnamese-speaking community health workers for care navigation among Vietnamese-Americans residing in the Mississippi coastal counties of Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson. METHODS: The initiative employed a community-based participatory framework to plan and implement the program. An active community advisory board was established and was representative of all the partners that worked together to make the initiative a success.Results and Lessons Learned: Before program implantation, results from focus groups indicated that the Vietnamese community had low knowledge about the risk of CHBI. Additionally, there were no Vietnamese-speaking health care providers, nor primary care providers treating CHBI in the prioritized counties. A total of 505 Vietnamese individuals were screened. One-half were immune by infection (n = 235 [46.5%]), 83 (16.4%) were immune by vaccination, 46 (9.1%) had CHBI, 130 (25.7%) were vaccine na?ve, and 40 (7.9%) were undetermined, (n = 130), 101 (77.7%) received the complete three-injection vaccine series.

HSPs act as potent adjuvants, inducing a Th1 response, as well as antigen-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) via cross-presentation. Our previous work has demonstrated that Hsp70-like protein 1 (Hsp70L1), a new member of the Hsp70 subfamily, can act as a powerful Th1 adjuvant in a DC-based vaccine. Here we report the efficient induction of tumor antigen-specific T cell immune response by DCs pulsed with recombinant fusion protein of Hsp70L1 and Her2(341-456), the latter of which is a fragment of Her2/neu (Her2) containing E75 (a HLA-A2 restricted CTL epitope). The fusion protein Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456) promotes the maturation of DCs and activates them to produce cytokines, such as IL-12 and TNF-, and chemokines, such as MIP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES. Taken together, these results indicate that the adjuvant activity of Hsp70L1 is maintained in the fusion protein. Her2-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted CD8(+) CTLs can be generated efficiently either from the Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of healthy donors or from the splenocytes of immunized HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice by in vitro stimulation or immunization with DCs pulsed with the Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456) fusion protein. This results in more potent target cell killing in an antigen-specific and HLA-A2.1-restricted manner. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from transgenic mice immunized with Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456)-pulsed DCs can markedly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of nude mice with Her2(+)/HLA-A2.1(+) human carcinomas. These results suggest that Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456)-pulsed DCs could be a new therapeutic vaccine for patients with Her2(+) cancer.","output":"Efficient induction of a Her2-specific anti-tumor response by dendritic cells pulsed with a Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456) fusion protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A 45-year old woman of Cambodian ethnic background presented with fatal respiratory failure due to a severe diaphragmatic dysfunction.

Secondary objectives include assessing the impact of MI on physical activity and performance, self-efficacy, safety, cost-utility, participants' experiences and functional status at 3 months. METHODS We will conduct a multicenter randomized clinical trial in three geriatric rehabilitation hospitals in Spain. Older adults after mild-moderate stroke without previous severe cognitive impairment or disability will be randomized into the control or intervention group (136 per group, total N = 272). The intervention group will receive 4 sessions of MI by trained nurses, including the design of a personalized rehabilitation plan agreed between stroke survivors and nurses based on stroke survivors goals, needs, preferences and capabilities. Main outcome will be the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). In-hospital physical activity will be measured through accelerometers and secondary outcomes using validated scales.

The dependent variable selected was positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and/or positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 200 out of a total of 4,665 healthcare workers, who received mRNA vaccine at the hospital in that period of time, reported adverse effects. Regarding local symptoms, a lower risk of presenting them was observed after the administration of the second dose (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10-0.37, p <0.001). Attending to general symptoms, the results indicate older workers (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86-0.99, p = 0.045) had fewer symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: An association between SARS-CoV-2 prior infection and more adverse effects to mRNA vaccine was not found in our study of hospital healthcare workers. Furthermore, variable age needs to be further investigated, since younger people seem to have more adverse effects to the vaccine.","output":"Is SARS-CoV-2 prior infection related with more adverse effects to mRNA vaccine in healthcare workers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the eating behaviours of people especially fruits and vegetable intake. No study has addressed the fruits and vegetables intake during the COVID-19 in Malaysia. Aim: to assess the daily intake of fruits and vegetables among Malaysian adults during the COVID-19 outbreak, perceived changes in intake, as well as factors associated with the changes in intake. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through online platforms and a total of 506 participants were recruited. Semi food-frequency questionnaires were used to assess participants fruit and vegetable intake. Socio-demographics information, knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of fruits and vegetables were collected. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS. Results: The majority of participants (99.8%) did not achieve the recommended five servings per day, in which they consumed an average of 0.84 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. 46.4% of participants reported no changes in intake compared to before the outbreak. Fruits and vegetables intake was associated with physical activity level, knowledge, and beliefs of foods that may prevent/cure COVID-19. Binary logistic regression identified two significant risk factors of daily fruits and vegetables intake namely, being a non-Chinese (AOR = 1.905, 95% CI = 1.114C3.257) and having good practices scores (AOR = 2.543, 95% CI = 1.611C4.015).

Oncogenic properties of eIF4E are directly linked to its ability to bind 7-methyl guanosine of the 5' mRNA. Here, we observe that the antiviral guanosine analogue ribavirin binds to eIF4E with micromolar affinity at the functional site used by 7-methyl guanosine mRNA cap, competes with eIF4E:mRNA binding, and, at low micromolar concentrations, selectively disrupts eIF4E subcellular organization and transport and translation of mRNAs posttranscriptionally regulated by eIF4E, thereby reducing levels of oncogenes such as cyclin D1. Ribavirin potently suppresses eIF4E-mediated oncogenic transformation of murine cells in vitro, of tumor growth of a mouse model of eIF4E-dependent human squamous cell carcinoma in vivo, and of colony formation of eIF4E-dependent acute myelogenous leukemia cells derived from human patients. These findings describe a specific, potent, and unforeseen mechanism of action of ribavirin. Quantum mechanical and NMR structural studies offer directions for the development of derivatives with improved cytostatic and antiviral properties. In all, ribavirin's association with eIF4E may provide a pharmacologic means for the interruption of posttranscriptional networks of oncogenes that maintain and enhance neoplasia and malignancy in human cancer.","output":"Ribavirin suppresses eIF4E-mediated oncogenic transformation by physical mimicry of the 7-methyl guanosine mRNA cap."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nosocomial transmission of droplet-borne respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may be influenced by the choice of oxygen face mask.

The mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity remain unclear. We set out to identify the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic proteins that through host interactions cause the cellular damages underlying COVID-19 symptomatology. METHODS: We examined each of the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins for their cytotoxicity in HEK 293 T cells and their subcellular localization in COS-7 cells. We also used Mass-Spec Affinity purification to identify the host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 protein and tested a drug that could inhibit a specific Orf6 and host protein interaction. RESULTS: We found that Orf6, Nsp6 and Orf7a induced the highest toxicity when over-expressed in human 293 T cells. All three proteins showed membrane localization in COS-7 cells. We focused on Orf6, which was most cytotoxic and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagosome and lysosomal membranes. Proteomics revealed Orf6 interacts with nucleopore proteins (RAE1, XPO1, RANBP2 and nucleoporins). Treatment with Selinexor, an FDA-approved inhibitor for XPO1, attenuated Orf6-induced cellular toxicity in human 293 T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed Orf6 as a highly pathogenic protein from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, identified its key host interacting proteins, and Selinexor as a drug candidate for directly targeting Orf6 host protein interaction that leads to cytotoxicity.

The main objective of this simulation study was to characterize the surgical smoke exposure in terms of the particle number concentration and size distribution in a human breathing zone. Additionally, the performance of respiratory protective devices designed for ORs was examined using two commercially available N95 facepiece filtering respirators (FFRs) as well as the same FFRs modified with new faceseal technology. The tests were conducted in an OR-simulating exposure chamber with the surgical smoke generated by electrocautery equipment applied to animal tissue and measured in the breathing zone with four aerosol spectrometers. The simulated workplace protection factor of each tested respirator was determined for ten subjects by measuring the total aerosol concentrations inside and outside of a respirator. The peak of the particle size distribution was in a range of 60-150 nm. The concentration of particles generated during the simulated surgical procedure significantly exceeded the background concentration under all tested air exchange conditions. The data suggest that wearing N95 filtering facepiece respirators significantly decreased the human exposure to surgical smoke.

Characterizing global genomic surveillance, sequencing coverage, the extent of publicly available genomic data coupled with traditional epidemiologic data can provide evidence to inform SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and control strategies. Methods We collected country-specific data on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, sequencing capabilities, public genomic data, and aggregated publicly available variant data. We divided countries into three levels of genomic surveillance and sequencing availability based on predefined criteria. We downloaded the merged and deduplicated SARS-CoV-2 sequences from multiple public repositories, and used different proxies to estimate the sequencing coverage and public availability extent of genomic data, in addition to describing the global dissemination of variants. Findings Since the start of 2021, the COVID-19 global epidemic clearly featured increasing circulation of Alpha, which was rapidly replaced by the Delta variant starting around May 2021 and reaching a global prevalence of 96.6% at the end of July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and sequencing availability varied markedly across countries, with 63 countries performing routine genomic surveillance and 79 countries with high availability of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. Less than 3.5% of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were sequenced globally since September 2020, with the lowest sequencing coverage in the WHO regions of Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Africa. Across different variants, 28-52% of countries with explicit reporting on variants shared less than half of their variant sequences in public repositories. More than 60% of demographic and 95% of clinical data were absent in GISAID metadata accompanying sequences. Interpretation Our findings indicated an urgent need to expand sequencing capacity of virus isolates, enhance the sharing of sequences, the standardization of metadata files, and supportive networks for countries with no sequencing capability.","output":"Landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance, public availability extent of genomic data, and epidemic shaped by variants: a global descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This collection of articles takes up a thematic focus on law, medicine, and bioethics in the contexts of the pandemic environment, including a range of issues concerning democracy, climate change and adaptive governance, structural inequities and health disparities, and social justice.

One passenger was coughing in each case, while cough particles with measured size distributions were released during coughs and were tracked using the Lagrangian framework. Outcomes revealed that cough flow released by passengers could develop rapidly into a strong turbulent cough jet, breaking up the local airflow field. The released cough particles were largely dominated by the cough jet within 5 s, especially the first 1.5 s. Deposition of particles under 100 m were relatively delayed when released from a window-seat location. Small particles (under 50 m) released by a window-seat passenger were more likely to spread widely in the studied cabin section, which could lead to the highest exposure risks to nearby passengers. Also, due to ventilation design and seating arrangement, cough particles released by the middle-seat passenger were found easily trapped in his/her own local environment.

Regular testing producing rapid and reliable results is important in this population because infections spread quickly and presentations are often atypical or asymptomatic. This study evaluated current testing pathways in care homes to explore the role of point-of-care tests (POCTs). Methods Ten staff from eight care homes, purposively sampled to reflect care organisational attributes that influence outbreak severity, underwent a semi-structured remote videoconference interview. Transcripts were analysed using process mapping tools and framework analysis focussing on perceptions about, gaps within, and needs arising from, current pathways. Results Four main steps were identified in testing: infection prevention, preparatory steps, swabbing procedure, and management of residents. Infection prevention was particularly challenging for mobile residents with cognitive impairment. Swabbing and preparatory steps were resource-intensive, requiring additional staff resource. Swabbing required flexibility and staff who were familiar to the resident. Frequent approaches to residents were needed to ensure they would participate at a suitable time. After-test management varied between sites. Several homes reported deviating from government guidance to take more cautious approaches, which they perceived to be more robust. Conclusion Swab-based testing is organisationally complex and resource-intensive in care homes. It needs to be flexible to meet the needs of residents and provide care homes with rapid information to support care decisions. POCT could help address gaps but the complexity of the setting means that each technology must be evaluated in context before widespread adoption in care homes.","output":"Understanding COVID-19 testing pathways in English care homes to identify the role of point-of-care testing: an interview-based process mapping study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has been implicated in several mental health challenges faced by many people.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal case studies of a seizure detection and reporting technology for epilepsy (Southern England, 2018-2019), a telehealth service for heart failure (7 UK sites, 2016-2018), and a remote video consultation service (Scotland-wide, 2019-2020). We carried out interviews with 158 participants and collected more than 200 pages of field notes from observations. Within- and cross-case analysis was informed by sociotechnical theory. RESULTS: In the epilepsy case, co-design prioritized patient-facing features and focused closely around a specific clinic, which led to challenges with sustainability and mainstreaming. In the heart failure case, patient-focused co-design produced an accessible and usable patient portal but resulted in variation in uptake between clinical sites. Successful scale-up of video consultations was explained by a co-design process involving not only the technical interface, but also careful reshaping of work practices. DISCUSSION: A shift is needed from co-designing with technology users to co-designing with patients as service users, and with healthcare staff as professionals. Good co-design needs to involve users, including those who engage with the technology-supported service bothdirectly and indirectly. It requires sensitivity to emergence and unpredictability in complex systems. Healthcare staff need to be supported to accommodate iterative change in the service.

Method An eye and computer mouse-tracking visual-world paradigm was used to investigate how a listener's cognitive effort (local and global) and decision-making processes were affected by a speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication. Results Experiments 1 and 2 found that an environmental cue that made a miscommunication more or less salient impacted listener language processing effort (eye-tracking). Experiment 2 also indicated that listeners may develop different processing heuristics dependent upon the speaker's use of ambiguity that led to a miscommunication, exerting a significant impact on cognition and decision making. We also found that perspective-taking effort and decision-making complexity metrics (computer mouse tracking) predict language processing effort, indicating that instances of miscommunication produced cognitive consequences of indecision, thinking, and cognitive pull. Conclusion Together, these results indicate that listeners behave both reciprocally and adaptively when miscommunications occur, but the way they respond is largely dependent upon the type of ambiguity and how often it is produced by the speaker.","output":"Cognitive Processing of Miscommunication in Interactive Listening: An Evaluation of Listener Indecision and Cognitive Effort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A new virus called Sars-CoV-2, or COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and caused several changes worldwide.

There is considerable discussion amongst clinicians as well as lay people about anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 sufferers. We aimed to report the results from comprehensive olfactory and gustatory testing in a series of hospital in-patients. METHODS: The prospective study evaluated 81 individuals with a COVID-19 infection, as confirmed by 2019 n-cov Real-Time PCR laboratory testing. The control group consisted of forty individuals with COVID-19 negative. Olfactory and gustatory testings were carried out by an examiner utilizing stringent safety standards and wearing full personal protective equipment. The results obtained in the case group were then compared with those obtained for the controls. RESULTS: In the case group, 41(50.6%) of patients were male and 40 (49.4%) were female, mean age of 54.16  16.98 years (18-95). In the control group, 21 (52.5%) of subjects were male and 19 (47.5%) were female, and mean age was 55  15.39 years (18-90). Fifty (61.7%) COVID-19-positive patients had complaints related to olfaction. The distribution of olfactory symptoms in the case group differed at the level of statistical significance from the control group (p < 0.001). Turning to gustatory abnormalities, within the case group, 22 individuals (27.2%) had taste malfunction. A statistically significant difference was found in the distribution of gustatory abnormalities between cases and controls (p < 0.001).

In the potential region controlled by kinetics, such a lower ECSA is counterbalanced by the high specific activity. At higher overpotentials, however, which are often applied in real systems, a low ECSA leads to limitations in the reaction rate not by kinetics, but by mass transport.

Convergence offers a unifying strategy applicable to all systems that can be modeled as evolving neural-like networks. The paper presents an overview of the convergence science including underlying theories, principles, and methods and illustrates its implementation in key areas of application. The convergence approach begins with deep integration of previously separated fields, communities, and modes of thinking, to form and improve a new system, from where solutions divergence to previously unattainable applications and outcomes. The worldwide science and technology (S&T) landscape is changing at the beginning of the twenty-first century because of convergence.

Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on patients affected by COVID-19 who were admitted at our center. Our study included patients with no, mild, and moderate symptoms (nonsevere cases). Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients were excluded considering the difficulty in procuring the fundus image by the handheld camera due to patients positioning. Patients with systemic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and severe anemia) known to cause retinopathy were also excluded. Bedside anterior segment examination, fundus examination using indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus imaging of each patient using a nonmydriatic handheld fundus camera was done by a trained ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Results: In a cohort of 138 patients, 94 (68.1%) were men and 44 (31.9%) were women. A total of 276 eyes were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 38.51  14.4 years. Anterior segment evaluation showed no abnormality in any of the eyes. On fundus screening using nonmydriatic handheld camera, a single streak of superficial retinal hemorrhage was noted at the posterior pole of the fundus in the left eye of one patient (0.72%), which was away from fovea.

As the disease evolves, uncertainty and fear of harm rise, which can significantly diminish community health and wellbeing. This article stresses the importance of public health preparedness in overcoming social and health risks associated with public panic.Since the COVID-19 outbreak began in late 2019, the numbers of people affected and fatalities continue to mount, causing panic and crippling vital economic and social activities. Authorities have failed to prevent inaccurate and misleading headlines that agitate the public and impinge on public communication. Fake news and rumors about magical products claiming to cure the virus abound. Additionally, people assumed emergency preparation meant stockpiling resources. Amid growing fears, consumers raided supermarkets and pharmacies for supplies, from masks to hygiene products, and people have fought over protective gear as tensions flared among anxious customers.When general panic starts driving political decision-making, public health professionals may be unable to implement strategies based on informed decisions. Researchers argue that government secrecy and non-transparency diminish people?s confidence and trust, creating panic (Wilson et al., 2007). Even naming the disease possibly triggered epidemic-related trauma and the ensuing public mistrust and disbelief of authorities;the panic has also sparked a wave of racial prejudice (Titanji, 2020). Although a series of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, from Avian flu to Zika virus, may have created more public awareness, whether leaders can translate this newfound awareness into meaningful policies and action is debatable.Globally, attention is growing on responses from state leaders, as some try to downplay the epidemic?s severity to maintain ?business as usual?. In early March 2020, the Indonesian government was still in a state of denial and was attempting to convince the general public that the country was free from COVID-19 (Lindsey & Mann, 2020) Instead, currently confirmed cases are growing rapidly, suspected cases are far above the testing capacity, and case fatality is at an alarming rate.In contrast, several countries took drastic action by declaring travel restrictions and locking down cities. As an example, New Zealand decided to implement level-4 measures, with strict movement restrictions, not long after they confirmed their first case on 28 February 2020;they have recently begun a gradual exit from coronavirus lockdown (Knight, 2020).The public expects leaders to curb the spread of COVID-19 responsibly, appropriately, effectively, and proactively. Meanwhile, leaders are urging the public to stay calm and adopt new norms during this rapidly evolving situation. This crisis is not limited to any individual and requires cooperation rather than a unilateral response.?DISCUSSIONHow to do this?A critical approach to pandemics is to ensure the preparedness of both healthcare capacity and public health systems (Jain, Duse, & Bausch, 2018). To respond to emergency needs?to have the capacity to treat rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients?it is important for each country to have existing policies and action plans for healthcare facilities to temporarily expand service capacity, cancel or postpone elective procedures, and engage in rapid intervention to conserve medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (Gan, Tseng, & Lee, 2020). Measures including recalling recently retired healthcare workers and providing drive-through services for chronic disease medications have been implemented to lessen pressures on hospitals (Wang, Ng, & Brook, 2020).While healthcare capacity is the ability to care for patients with COVID-19, the public health system aims to prevent people from being infected and mitigating the health risks associated with COVID-19. The public health system is important for strengthening community vigilance by promoting effective sanitation, a healthy lifestyle, and food safety, and preventing injuries, inequality, and violence. This involves not only healthcare professionals, but also well-planned strategies that consider various stakeholders? perspectives and concerns (Glik, 2007). Despite the lockdown, we have seen healthcare workers and people in the community providing the basic essentials for those in need?from food, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), mental health support, and evidence-based research communication, to virtual musical performances and concerts. Organizations in the virtual sphere, including WhatsApp (WhatsApp Inc, 2020) and TikTok, are partnering with health agencies to increase accessibility to health information.The best outbreak response is a collective response (Gille & Brall, 2020), which could effectively contain the disease and the panic caused by the disease. People naturally experience fear when dealing with a catastrophic event. This unprecedented threat triggered panic purchasing or falling for viral hoaxes, which reflects misconceptions about the problem, most likely because people lack trust in the measures taken (Heide, 2004), When designing and implementing public health measures, we must ensure we do not just acknowledge that, but actively engage relevant stakeholders. In an age of uncertainty, community solidarity and collective action are key to maintaining community vigilance against the crisis (Aldrich et al., 2015).","output":"How Can The Public Be Better Protected Against COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral interventions have been a crucial tool for the prevention of HIV transmission since early in the epidemic.

This can lead to increased complications, including antibacterial resistance. We aim to analyze risk factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription in these patients and describe possible complications arising from their use. METHODS: The SEMI-COVID-19 Registry is a multicenter, retrospective patient cohort. Patients with antibiotic were divided into two groups according to appropriate or inappropriate prescription, depending on whether the patient fulfill any criteria for its use. Comparison was made by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. Possible complications of antibiotic use were also identified. RESULTS: Out of 13,932 patients, 3047 (21.6%) were prescribed no antibiotics, 6116 (43.9%) were appropriately prescribed antibiotics, and 4769 (34.2%) were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics. The following were independent factors of inappropriate prescription: February-March 2020 admission (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.18-2.00), age (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.97-0.99), absence of comorbidity (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.05-1.94), dry cough (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.94-3.26), fever (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.13-1.56), dyspnea (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.04-1.69), flu-like symptoms (OR 2.70, 95%CI 1.75-4.17), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (OR 1.01 for each mg/L increase, 95% CI 1.00-1.01).

METHODS Children, 6 months to 30 months old, were prospectively enrolled from September 2019 to September 2020 at Rochester, NY, pediatric clinics. H. influenzae isolates from nasopharynx (NP) at healthy visits and disease isolates from NP and middle ear fluid (MEF) at onset of acute otitis media (AOM) were characterized by capsular typing, -lactamase production and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS Samples from 565 healthy visits and 130 AOM visits were collected. H. influenzae was detected 5.9% and 27% in the NP from healthy and AOM visits, respectively. In the MEF, H. influenzae was isolated in 43% of samples. Eight percent of H. influenzae isolates were encapsulated, 88% type f. Overall 39.7% of isolates were -lactamase producing; 43% for MEF isolates. Ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin nonsusceptibility were found in more than 25% of isolates. None of the encapsulated H. influenzae isolates were positive for -lactamase production or ampicillin nonsusceptibility. 9.2% of isolates were -lactamase negative, ampicillin resistant (-lactamase negative, ampicillin resistant + -lactamase negative, ampicillin intermediate). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of H. influenzae in the NP of young children is very low at times of health, but H. influenzae is highly prevalent in MEF at onset of AOM.

We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. RESULTS: Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. DISCUSSION: The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.","output":"Nurses' and Physicians' Distress, Burnout, and Coping Strategies During COVID-19: Stress and Impact on Perceived Performance and Intentions to Quit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic created a globally shared stressor that saw a rise in the emphasis on mental and emotional wellbeing.

While the mental health of older adults during COVID-19 has been well explored, less is known about how changes in modes and frequency of social contact is associated with loneliness. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study COVID-19 data, this study assessed how the frequency of varying modes of contact (e.g., phone/email/text, in-person visits, videocalls) during the pandemic was associated with feelings of loneliness during COVID-19 among community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries (n = 2149). Participants were asked if they felt lonely more often, less often, or about the same compared to before the outbreak started. Multinomial regression analyses indicated that, compared to those who reported daily in-person visits, the odds of having more feelings of loneliness as compared to about the same as pre-COVID-19 was significantly higher among those who reported having in-person visits a few times (OR=2.17,CI=1.08-4.36), at least once (OR=2.37,CI=1.11-5.04), and never/less than once a week (OR=3.37, CI=1.59-7.16) while controlling for demographics, household, and social network size. Compared to daily use, use of phone/email/text at least once (OR=0.44, CI=0.201-0.965) or a few times (OR=0.76,CI=0.58-0.99) a week was associated with lower odds of reporting more feelings of loneliness versus about the same.

The identification of potential symptoms has been reported to be a useful tool for clinical decision-making in emergency departments to avoid overload and improve the quality of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of symptoms as a diagnostic tool for SARS -CoV-2 infection. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, prospective and analytical study was carried out, during the period of time from April 14 to July 21, 2020. Data (demographic variables, medical history, respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms) were collected by emergency physicians. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 was evaluated by calculating the positive and negative likelihood ratios. A Mantel-Haenszel and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of symptoms with COVID-19. RESULTS: A prevalence of 53.72% of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. The symptom with the highest sensitivity was cough 71%, and a specificity of 52.68%. The symptomatological scale, constructed from 6 symptoms, obtained a sensitivity of 83.45% and a specificity of 32.86%, taking &#8805;2 symptoms as a cut-off point. The symptoms with the greatest association with SARS-CoV-2 were: anosmia odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% CI; 2.52-4.17), fever OR 2.98 (95% CI; 2.47-3.58), dyspnea OR 2.9 (95% CI; 2.39-3.51]) and cough OR 2.73 (95% CI: 2.27-3.28). CONCLUSION: The combination of &#8805;2 symptoms / signs (fever, cough, anosmia, dyspnea and oxygen saturation < 93%, and headache) results in a highly sensitivity model for a quick and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, and should be used in the absence of ancillary diagnostic studies.

We mobilized interprofessional teams of students and provided training to implement projects identified by GCHD as necessary for responding to the pandemic. We provided a safe outlet for students to contribute to their community by creating remote volunteer opportunities when students faced displacement from clinical rotations and in-person didactics converted to virtual formats. As students gradually returned to clinical rotations and didactic demands increased, it became necessary to expand volunteer efforts beyond what had initially been mostly hand-selected student teams.

METHODS: The sample consisted of 202 families with same-sex twins [N = 404 children, mean age 45 months (SD = 6.81)]. Randomization was done at the family level in a 2:3 ratio, with 83 families (41%) randomized to the VIPP-SD group, and 119 families (59%) to the control group. After two pre-tests in year 1 and year 2 of the study, the VIPP-SD was implemented in the third year, with a post-test assessment 1 month after the five intervention sessions. Parental sensitivity was observed during structured play in which parent and child copied a drawing together in a computerized Etch-A-Sketch paradigm. Parental limit-setting was observed in a dont touch task in which the parent required from the child to abstain from playing with attractive toys. Parents interacted with each of their twins in separate sessions. RESULTS: The VIPP-SD intervention had a positive impact on the level of parents positive limit-setting in interaction with their preschool twins, and this positive effect was most pronounced when the parents completed at least five intervention sessions. However, the intervention did not enhance parental sensitivity during structured play. Parents with higher reactivity were not more open to the impact of the intervention, thus for this temperamental marker differential susceptibility in adults was not supported. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is unique in targeting families with twin preschoolers, providing proof of principle that coaching parents with video-feedback promotes parental sensitive limit-setting to both children. It remains to be seen whether this finding can be replicated in families with non-twin siblings, or other parental susceptibility markers.

In addition, two children with significant complications from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and diabetes are highlighted. Methods Hospitalized children with T1DM or T2DM and SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, and electronic medical records were reviewed. Results We observed a 16.3% increased rate of new-onset T1DM and 205.3% increased rate of new-onset insulin-dependent T2DM between April and November 2020 when compared to the same observational time frame in 2019.

The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is used as the initial diagnostic test in the tuberculosis diagnostic algorithm. To extend the national tuberculosis testing programme in South Africa, mobile units fitted with the GeneXpert equipment were introduced to high-burden peri-mining communities. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to assess the cost of mobile testing compared to traditional laboratory-based testing in a peri-mining community setting. METHODS: Actual cost data for mobile and laboratory-based Xpert MTB/RIF testing from 2018 were analysed using a bottom-up ingredients-based approach to establish the annual equivalent cost and the cost per result. Historical cost data were obtained from supplier quotations and the local enterprise resource planning system. Costs were obtained in rand and reported in United States dollars (USD). RESULTS: The mobile units performed 4866 tests with an overall cost per result of $49.16. Staffing accounted for 30.7% of this cost, while reagents and laboratory equipment accounted for 20.7% and 20.8%. The cost per result of traditional laboratory-based testing was $15.44 US dollars (USD). The cost for identifying a tuberculosis-positive result using mobile testing was $439.58 USD per case, compared to $164.95 USD with laboratory-based testing. CONCLUSION: Mobile testing is substantially more expensive than traditional laboratory services but offers benefits for rapid tuberculosis case detection and same-day antiretroviral therapy initiation.

Methods Large-sample statistical methods and proprietary data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey from 2000 to 2018 were used to assess factors associated with exposure to COVID-19 and vulnerabilities associated with medical complications. Results An aging workforce and increased access to health care within the crop worker population has been associated with a higher reported incidence of diabetes, asthma, and heart disease among workers over time. These trends confirm a vulnerable, but essential, workforce with higher risks for COVID-19 complications than would have been true of U.S. farmworkers as a group in earlier years. Conclusions Increasing age and disease burden in the U.S. agricultural labor force puts workers at increased risk for developing COVID-19 complications. Limits to field sanitation and housing quality inflate the probability of the development of COVID-19 hotbeds in rural communities that could further compromise the physical health of workers, the economic health of farm establishments, the agricultural supply-chain, and rural health capacities.

In hemodialysis, obese subjects display lower mortality rates despite hypoadiponectinemia, while higher adiponectin concentrations correlate with an elevated cardiovascular risk in nonobese subjects. The aim of the study is to suggest that adiponectin level variations are associated with differences in the body mass index (BMI). The interplay between adiponectin and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) levels may vary according to body fat mass. Fifty-two chronic hemodialysis patients were divided into three groups. Group A, BMI<25 (n=20); Group B, BMI 25 to 30 (n=21), and Group C, BMI>30 (n=11). Diabetics: Group A 10%; Group B 6 29%; Group C 55%, P=0.027. Determinations: Adiponectin, Pro-BNP, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA), troponin T, nutritional status, ultrafiltration rates, C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular accesses, and echocardiography. Group A: adiponectinemia positively and significantly correlated with Pro-BNP, CRP, and troponin T. As BMI increased, adiponectin, Pro-BNP, and malnutrition significantly decreased, while insulin, HOMA, and ultrafiltration rates significantly increased. Cardiac restriction was significantly higher in obese patients. In all groups, Pro-BNP and troponin T displayed a strong positive correlation. In low-BMI subjects, high Pro-BNP and adiponectin, low myocardial restriction, and worse nutritional status were prevalent. In obesity, hypoadiponectinemia stimulates cardiac remodeling, cardiac hypertrophy, and decreased stretching, rendering Pro-BNP levels low despite high ultrafiltration rates. Thus, adiponectin correlates inversely with BMI, probably playing different cardiovascular roles as BMI changes.","output":"In hemodialysis, adiponectin, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels may be subjected to variations in body mass index."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some perverse health disparities that we know have long existed in the United States.

In 2012, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in patients resistant to endocrine therapy. Although everolimus is generally well tolerated, mTOR inhibitor-associated pneumonitis is one of the most common adverse drug events leading to treatment discontinuation. To date, the underlying pathophysiology of this toxicity is unclear, and this uncertainty may hinder the optimization of management strategies. However, experiences from breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma clinical trials indicate that mTOR inhibitor-associated pneumonitis can be effectively managed by early detection, accurate diagnosis, and prompt intervention that generally involves everolimus dose reductions, interruptions, or discontinuation. Management can be achieved by a multidisciplinary approach that involves the collaborative efforts of nurses, oncologists, radiologists, infectious disease specialists, pulmonologists, clinical pharmacists, and pathologists. Comprehensive education must be provided to all health care professionals involved in managing patients receiving everolimus therapy.

Coryza, cough, sore throat and tinnitus were the most common symptoms, and there was a low prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress compared with the psychological impact of the symptom. Comparison of the two symptom groups demonstrated a common need for updates, their relationship with the media and correct information about the route of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The health information provided during a disease outbreak must be grounded in evidence. This would help to prevent adverse psychological reactions and somatization symptoms that can engulf healthcare systems, especially in clinical areas like ENT, which frequently treat airway problems.","output":"Self-perceived general and ear-nose-throat symptoms related to the COVID-19 outbreak: a survey study during quarantine in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Explanations for lagging life expectancy in the US compared to other high-income countries have focused largely on \\"deaths of despair,\\" but attention has also shifted to the role of stalling improvements in cardiovascular disease and the obesity epidemic.

These changes led to a decrease in patient volume, impacting physician trainee education due to lost clinical and didactic opportunities. We measured the prevalence of trainee concern over missed educational opportunities and investigated the risk factors leading to such concerns. METHODS: All residents and fellows at a large academic medical center were invited to participate in a web-based survey in May of 2020. Participants responded to questions regarding demographic characteristics, specialty, primary assigned responsibility during the previous 2 weeks (clinical, education, or research), perceived concern over missed educational opportunities, and burnout. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between missed educational opportunities and the measured variables. RESULTS: 22% (301 of 1375) of the trainees completed the survey. 47% of the participants were concerned about missed educational opportunities. Trainees assigned to education at home had 2.85 [95%CI 1.33C6.45] greater odds of being concerned over missed educational opportunities as compared with trainees performing clinical work. Trainees performing research were not similarly affected [aOR = 0.96, 95%CI (0.47C1.93)]. Trainees in pathology or radiology had 2.51 [95%CI 1.16C5.68] greater odds of concern for missed educational opportunities as compared with medicine. Trainees with greater concern over missed opportunities were more likely to be experiencing burnout (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Trainees in radiology or pathology and those assigned to education at home were more likely to be concerned about their missed educational opportunities. Residency programs should consider providing trainees with research or at home clinical opportunities as an alternative to self-study should future need for reduced clinical hours arise.

In view of this, patients with head and neck cancer may present with oral complications due to anticancer therapy, making dental assistance necessary. Thus, the objective of the study was to review the literature and critically discuss important concerns about the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because dental professionals are in close contact with the main viral transmission routes, this study presents recommendations for management and protection during clinical dental care. The main characteristics and transmission routes of COVID-19 are also discussed. Dental professionals should control pain and the side effects of antineoplastic treatment and use preventive measures for infection control. During this pandemic, patients with head and neck cancer should not undergo elective procedures, even if they do not have symptoms or a history of COVID-19; therefore, in asymptomatic or painless cases, only preventive actions are recommended. In symptomatic or painful cases, precautions for safe interventional treatments must be implemented by following the hygiene measures recommended by health agencies and using personal protective equipment. During health crises, new protocols emerge for cancer treatment, and professionals must act with greater attention toward biosafety and updated knowledge.

DESIGN: Web-based cross-sectional survey. SETTING: This study was conducted in March 2020, nearly 10 years into the Syrian war crisis. The Arabic-language survey was posted on various social media platforms including WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram and Facebook targeting various social groups. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4495 participants completed the survey. Participants with a history of COVID-19 infection, residing outside Syria or who did not fully complete the survey were excluded from the study. The final sample of 3586 participants (completion rate=79.8%) consisted of 2444 (68.2%) females and 1142 (31.8%) males. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: First, knowledge of COVID-19 in four areas (general knowledge; transmission pathways; signs and symptoms; prevention methods). Second, factors associated with poor knowledge. RESULTS: Of the 3586 participants, 2444 (68.2%) were female, 1822 (50.8%) were unemployed and 2839 (79.2%) were college educated. The study revealed good awareness regarding COVID-19 (mean 75.6%, SD 9.4%).

To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and other approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limited resources. METHODS: Using stochastic simulations with a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamic model, we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs surveillance testing and subcohorting strategies. RESULTS: In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection. Importantly, we found that creating smaller patient/HCW-interaction subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development with limited resources. CONCLUSION: These findings reinforce the importance of ensuring adequate PPE supplies even in the absence of testing and provide support for strict subcohorting regimens to reduce outbreak potential in healthcare institutions.","output":"Evaluating the contributions of strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the healthcare setting: a modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Bioterrorism is intentional use of bioweapons (bacteria, viruses, or fungi or their toxins) to harm people, animals, agriculture, or environment of a country.

In a study in Beirut in 2003, before banning the leaded gasoline, 79% of the participants showed blood lead levels (BLLs) higher than 5 g/dL. The prevalence of lead exposure in Lebanon after the ban on leaded gasoline has not been studied. This study assessed the BLL in Lebanese children aged 1-6 years. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted in three hospitals in Beirut. The children's BLLs were tested, and their caregiver completed a questionnaire to identify subgroups at risk of exposure. Participants were provided with a WHO brochure highlighting the risks of lead. RESULTS Ninety children with a mean age of 3.51.5 years were enrolled in the study and had a mean BLL of 1.10.7 g/dL, with all values being below 5.0 g/dL, showing a marked decrease in BLL compared with the mean BLL before the ban on leaded gasoline in 2002. Having a father or a mother with a college degree (p=0.01 and p=0.035, respectively) and having a monthly household income greater than $1000 (p=0.021) were associated with significantly lower BLL. Having more rooms at home and residing close to construction sites were associated with a significantly lower BLL (p=0.001 and p=0.026, respectively). Residing in a house aged >40 years and receiving traditional remedies were associated with a significantly higher BLL (p=0.009 and p<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION BLLs have declined among Lebanese children and this could be attributed to multiple factors including the ban of leaded gasoline.

In our country, we started to observe the first cases by March 2020. SARS-CoV-2, which is transmitted by droplets and by way of contact with surfaces contaminated by these droplets, is generally transmitted to children from adults through close contact. There is no proven information about other transmission routes such as fecal-oral transmission. Similar to adults, the primary symptoms at presentation include fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, nasal dis-charge, and rarely, vomiting and diarrhea in children. Although the majority of pediatric patients are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical course, severe cases have been reported in children with underlying chronic diseases. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Supportive treatment is recommended in children with a mild course, and some treatments are recommended in children with comorbidities or in children who are observed to have a more severe course. Asymptomatic pediatric patients or pediatric patients who have a mild course constitute an important group in terms of transmission of the infection to the advanced age group who carry high risk. Prevention of infection is very important in terms of reducing new cases and alleviating the load on the health-care system. In order to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, hygienic rules should be pursued in the community, social distancing should be observed, and the family members and contacts of patients who have been diagnosed should be screened and isolated.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in children/ ?ocuklarda sars-cov-2 enfeksiyonu"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The dissemination of the Delta VOC in Brazil is still unclear, despite the frequent reports of isolated cases from different Brazilian states.

The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014C2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE.

The present study aims to assess the sociodemographic correlates of psychosocial health situation of Chinese community-dwelling residents. Methods: : This was a cross-sectional survey that was carried out online and using a structured questionnaire during April 2020. In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11-98 years were included in the analysis. Outcome variables were the change in the experience of hopelessness, loneliness and depression before and during the pandemic, and the explanatory variables included demographic and social capital related variables. Results: Respectively 34.80%, 32.50% and 44.84% of the participants expressed feeling more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness (50.67% vs 49.33%), loneliness (52.44% vs 47.56%), and depression (56.22% vs 43.78%). Being married was associated lower odds of loneliness among men [Odds ratio= 0.63, 95% CI=0.45,0.90]. Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking [Odds ratio= 0.67, 95% CI=0.45,0.99] and positively with drinking [Odds ratio= 1.45, 95% CI=1.04,2.02]. Compared with those in the lowest income bracket (<10K), men [Odds ratio= 0.34, 95% CI=0.21,0.55] and women [Odds ratio= 0.36, 95% CI=0.23,0.56] in the highest (>40K) had the lowest odds of reporting perceived hopelessness [Odds ratio= 0.35, 95% CI=0.25,0.48].

Convalescent plasma is used without a consistent evidence of efficacy. Our hypothesis is that passive immunization with plasma collected from patients having contracted COVID-19 and developed specific neutralizing antibodies may alleviate symptoms and reduce mortality in patients treated with mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory failure during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: We plan to include 500 adult patients, hospitalized in 16 Belgian intensive care units between September 2020 and 2022, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, under mechanical ventilation for less than 5 days and a clinical frailty scale less than 6. The study treatment will be compared to standard of care and allocated by randomization in a 1 to 1 ratio without blinding. The main endpoint will be mortality at day 28. We will perform an intention to treat analysis. The number of patients to include is based on an expected mortality rate at day 28 of 40 percent and an expected relative reduction with study intervention of 30 percent with &#945; risk of 5 percent and ? risk of 20 percent. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the efficacy of plasma in the population of mechanically ventilated patients. A stratification on the delay from mechanical ventilation and inclusion will allow to approach the optimal time use. Selecting convalescent plasmas with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will allow a homogeneous study treatment. The inclusion in the study is based on the consent of the patient or his/her legal representative, and the approval of the Investigational Review Board of the University hospital of Lige, Belgium.

The aim of this study is to compare the hospitalization rate for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the first nine months of 2020 with the same period of 2018 and 2019. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of hospital discharge records. The pathologies of interest were coded as follows: all the hospitalizations with main discharge diagnosis as ICD-9-CM 410.xx, 411.xx, 413.xx for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS); 410.xx was used in all diagnoses except in codes 410.7x or 410.9x for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); 410.7x was used in all diagnoses except 410.9.x for acute non-STEMI. Hospitalization rate ratios (HRR) comparing the study period with each of the control periods were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: During the study period there was a statistically significant decrease in hospitalizations for ACS both vs 2018 (HRR 0.80;95%CI 0.80-0.81; p < 0.001) and vs 2019 (HRR 0.85;95%CI 0.84-0.86; p < 0.001). A decrease also affected STEMI vs 2018 (HRR 0.91;95%CI 0.90-0.92; p < 0.001) and vs 2019 (HRR 0.87;95%CI 0.86-0.88; p < 0.001) and NSTEMI vs 2018 (HRR 0.76;95%CI 0.75-0.77; p < 0.001) and vs 2019 (HRR 0.79;95%CI 0.78-0.80; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This report shows a significant decrease in ACS-related hospitalization rates across the Region during the study period. General out-of-hospital mortality need to be further investigated, as to focus on patients died of ACS without receiving adequate assistance from the emergency network.

METHODS: We followed up 1174 patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)who were recovered and discharged for 6 months. RESULTS: There were 175 cases with clear IgG results 6 months after discharge, of which 82 (46.9%) were IgG (+) and 16 (9.1%) were IgG (dim+). Four hundred and forty-one participants (55.4%) had some kind of sequelae. The most common symptoms were fatigue (25.3%), sleep disorder (23.2%) and shortness of breath (20.4%). In those who had sequelae, 262 (59.4%) had more than one symptom. Critical cases were more likely to have cough (20.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.023) and hypomnesis (15.1% vs 8.0%, p = 0.041) than severe cases. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women are more likely to have multiple symptoms (p = 0.002), fatigue (p = 0.009) and sleep disorder (p = 0.008), whereas critical illness was found as independent risk factor for hypomnesis (p = 0.045).

Rohingya refugee children suffer widespread rates of education insecurity both in their home country, Myanmar and in their host country, Bangladesh. While the right to education is recognized in several human rights instruments, access to education is not ubiquitous, making the ability to achieve this right challenging for many Rohingya. Government restrictions on accredited education, COVID-19 related school closures, failures in launching a pilot of the Myanmar curriculum, and recent government plans to relocate refugees to Bhasan Char Island have created a lost generation of Rohingya youth. This study traces the development of education insecurity among the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic minority group who fled to Bangladesh in 2017 in response to ethnic violence in Myanmar. Drawing upon available literature and primary fieldwork, this study examines the social, cultural, and political determinants of learning opportunities for Rohingya children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 10005 (CI95: [08130-11881]) and 12046 (CI95: [07532-16560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%.

HISTORY Rehabilitation developed in a piecemeal way, focused on specific problems: spinal cord injury, burns, polio, stroke, back pain, equipment and adaptations etc. Rehabilitation is also provided using other names (e.g. intermediate care). Patients with complex needs do not fit easily within this system. SYSTEM FAILURE After Covid-19, patients have problems that cross existing condition-specific and/or treatment-specific services. Covid-19 has exposed the lack of any coherent organisational principle underlying development or commissioning of rehabilitation services. Consequently, in order to have their needs met, patients either have to engage with two or more separate services or they receive good management for some problems and sub-optimal management for other problems. THE GOALS The multitude of small specific services need to coalesce into an integrated service able to meet all the needs of any patient referred. Second, rehabilitation needs to be fully integrated into all healthcare services. A SOLUTION The purpose of healthcare is to 'improve our health and well-being . . . to stay as well as we can to the end of our lives'. (NHS constitution) All healthcare services need to consider patients holistically, giving equal attention to disease, disability, and distress. Rehabilitation, acute care, mental health and palliative care services need to work in parallel to achieve this purpose.

Epidemiological investigation was carried out to determine the epidemiological and demographic characteristics of the outbreak. We estimated the secondary attack rate (SAR), incubation time and time-dependent reproductive number (Rt ) and explored the predisposing factors for cluster infection. The incubation time was 5.4 days and the serial interval (SI) was 4.4 days, with the rate of negative-valued SIs at 24.5%. The SAR at the bathing pool (3.3%) was relatively low due to its high temperature and humidity. The SAR was higher in the colleagues' cluster (20.5%) than in the family cluster (11.8%). Super-spreaders had a longer isolation delay time (p = .004). The Rt of the cluster decreased from the highest value of 3.88 on January 27, 2020 to 1.22 on February 6. Our findings suggest that the predisposing factors of the outbreak included close contact with an infected person, airtight and crowded spaces, temperature and humidity in the space and untimely isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts at the early stage of transmission. Measures to reduce the risk of infection at these gatherings and subsequent tracking of close contacts were effective.","output":"COVID-19 outbreak following a single patient exposure at an entertainment site: An epidemiological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES A recent individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis suggested that patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation strategies. However, thresholds for continuous variables (eg, hypoxaemia) are often arbitrary and linearity assumptions in regression approaches may not hold; the multivariable fractional polynomial interaction (MFPI) approach can address both problems. The objective of this study was to apply the MFPI approach to investigate interactions between four continuous patient baseline variables and higher versus lower PEEP on clinical outcomes. SETTING Pooled data from three randomised trials in intensive care identified by a systematic review. PARTICIPANTS 2299 patients with acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS Higher (N=1136) versus lower PEEP (N=1163) ventilation strategy. OUTCOME MEASURES Prespecified outcomes included mortality, time to death and time-to-unassisted breathing. We examined the following continuous baseline characteristics as potential effect modifiers using MFPI: PaO2/FiO2 (arterial partial oxygen pressure/ fraction of inspired oxygen), oxygenation index, respiratory system compliance (tidal volume/(inspiratory plateau pressure-PEEP)) and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS We found that for patients with PaO2/FiO2 below 150 mm Hg, but above 100 mm Hg or an oxygenation index above 12 (moderate ARDS), higher PEEP reduces hospital mortality, but the beneficial effect appears to level off for patients with very severe ARDS. Patients with mild ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 above 200 mm Hg or an oxygenation index below 10) do not seem to benefit from higher PEEP and might even be harmed. For patients with a respiratory system compliance above 40 mL/cm H2O or patients with a BMI above 35 kg/m(2), we found a trend towards reduced mortality with higher PEEP, but there is very weak statistical confidence in these findings. CONCLUSIONS MFPI analyses suggest a nonlinear effect modification of higher PEEP ventilation by PaO2/FiO2 and oxygenation index with reduced mortality for some patients suffering from moderate ARDS.

It has not been tested in the most common PH groups; 2 (left heart disease), 3 (lung disease), or 5 (other disorders). Further it has not been evaluated in the UK National Health Service (NHS) out-patient setting, or with long-term follow-up. The aim of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention with psychosocial support compared to best practice usual care for people with PH in the community/outpatient setting. METHODS: This multi-centre, pragmatic, two-arm RCT with embedded process evaluation aims to recruit 352 clinically stable adults with PH (groups 1C5) and WHO functional class II-IV. Participants will be randomised to either the Supervised Pulmonary Hypertension Exercise Rehabilitation (SPHERe) intervention or control. The SPHERe intervention consists of 1) individual assessment and familiarisation sessions; 2) 8-week, twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; 3) psychosocial/motivational support and education; 4) guided home exercise plan. The control intervention consists of best practice usual care with a single one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on physical activity. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention) and 12 months by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is the incremental shuttle walk test at 4 months. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life (HRQoL), time to clinical worsening and health and social care use. A purposive sample of participants (n = 20 intervention and n = 20 control) and practitioners (n = 20) will be interviewed to explore experiences of the trial, outcomes and interventions. DISCUSSION: The SPHERe study is the first multi-centre clinical RCT to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised exercise rehabilitation intervention compared to usual care, delivered in the UK NHS, for people in all PH groups. Results will inform clinicians and commissioners as to whether or not supervised exercise rehabilitation is effective and should be routinely provided for people with PH.

We aimed to identify the attitudes and perceptions of Gastroenterology Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) and applicants regarding the virtual interview experience and the role of virtual interviews (VI) in the future. METHODS: We designed separate surveys targeting PDs and applicants using the Qualtrics software. At the end of the interview season, we e-mailed both survey links to all PDs and requested that they forward the applicant survey to their interviewed candidates. Surveys were voluntary and anonymous. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data with results presented as percentages. RESULTS: A total of 29.7% of PDs completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 46.5% of PDs to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. Yet, 69.1% envisioned a role for VI in the future. A total of 14.2% of applicants completed the survey. Compared to traditional interviews, VI were viewed by 42.3% of applicants to be very suboptimal or suboptimal. However, 61.8% saw a future role for VI. While both applicants and PDs reported that establishing an interpersonal connection was a disadvantage with VI, applicants placed more emphasis on this need for connection (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Overall, PDs and applicants report mixed views with regard to VI but anticipate that it may continue to have a future role.

In India, the popularity and awareness of RT-PCR and particularly the increased availability of testing machines across hospitals has now opened up possibilities of diagnostic tests with RT-PCR. In view of the cytokine storm which is the significant reason for morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 patients, we proposed to test the usefulness of a multiplex RT-PCR test kit that simultaneously measured inflammatory markers namely, IL-6, TNFC  and IL-10 (IFM) all in one tube. The study included a group of patients who were equally allotted to two treatment arms one of which received standard of care along with a food supplement capsule as a natural anti-inflammatory (RECOVEREEZ FORTE?), and the other group received standard of care that included oral Prednisolone tablets in tapered dosage. RECOVEREEZ FORTE? consists of potent biomolecules from cardamom extract. A natural product with substantial anti-inflammatory action when consumed early at the onset of symptoms is hereby proven by comparing gene expression profile of inflammatory markers with routinely tested inflammatory parameters such as serum IL-6, CRP and LDH. In addition to predicting worse disease outcomes beforehand, RT-PCR assay tests provides an opportunity for identifying therapeutic window aiding in practicing effective treatment strategy for COVID-19. RT-PCR analysis of IFM together being used in a single multiplex kit is being first reported and such a test as a prognosticator for disease progression does seem promising and worthy of clinicians adopting novel testing modalities in clinical practice. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the anti-inflammatory response of RECOVEREEZ FORTE? using RT-PCR based multiplex gene profiling of inflammatory markers in disease prognosis and show its predictability of worsening outcomes and its role in identifying therapeutic window for RECOVEREEZ FORTE?. To show the potentiality of RECOVEREEZ FORTE? in reducing COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values of the treatment group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a short study of a 10-day period where the end point was the negativity of COVID-19 on RT-PCR test or the decline in cycle threshold (Ct) values of the test performed on day 10 when compared to day 0. During the course of the study, patients were given standard treatment and an oral dose of 500 mg of RECOVEREEZ FORTE? thrice daily, or standard of care and oral Prednisolone in tapered dosage (control group). All essential interventions were included in the standard of care as decided by the attending physician. The RT-PCR results of inflammatory markers were compared to routinely tested parameters such as IL-6, CRP and LDH. Time to clinical improvement was in terms of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test negativity or recovery of COVID-19 symptoms. We enrolled 64 patients, of which 32 were allocated to RECOVEREEZ FORTE ? group and 32 to the control group. RESULTS: The RT-PCR analysis of elevated IFM on day 0 corresponded to above normal protein levels of routinely tested parameters such as serum IL-6, CRP and LDH on day 5. Similarly, elevated IFM on day 5 corresponded to above normal protein levels on day 10. Such an association was equally prevalent in both the control group and RECOVEREEZ FORTE? group, stipulating that RECOVEREEZ FORTE? may be used as an alternative to steroids. The obtained results indicate that the RT-PCR assessment predicts worse outcomes 5 days earlier. But, the RT-PCR analysis of elevated IFM on day 0 did not correspond to the above normal protein levels of other parameters on day 10. Hence, indicating that the IFM RT-PCR test cannot predict worse outcomes 10 days earlier. Also, RECOVEREEZ FORTE? when consumed for a period of 10 days normalized LDH values, compared to the control group. Moreover, IFM RT-PCR test identified a 5-day therapeutic window for RECOVEREEZ FORTE? against inflammation experienced by patients. In addition to the above findings, the authors also observed that majority of the patients belonging to the treatment group showed recovery from symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and breathlessness compared to control group by day 5. 12 (37.5%) out of 32 patients and 6 (18.75%) out of 32 patients belonging to the treatment group and control group, respectively, became SARS-CoV-2 negative by day 5, indicating a probable anti-viral action of RECOVEREEZ FORTE? against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The IFM RT-PCR test possess 5-day early prediction ability and lacks 10-day prediction ability. Treatment with RECOVEREEZ FORTE? indicates good anti-inflammatory action which is equivalent to steroids. Intake of RECOVEREEZ FORTE ? for a period of 5 days depicts persistent anti-inflammatory action, recovery of COVID-19 symptoms and a probable anti-viral action. Moreover, an effective normalization of LDH may be rendered by RECOVEREEZ FORTE? when consumed for a period of 10 days.

DESIGN Qualitative content analysis. SETTING Canada. PARTICIPANTS Sixteen family physicians who have experienced a public health crisis. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 family physicians practising in various regions across Canada who had experienced what they defined as a public health crisis. These events included environmental crises, like forest fires and hurricanes, and infectious disease crises, like the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H1N1 outbreaks. Interview transcripts were coded using an inductive qualitative content analysis method, specifically focusing on recommendations from participants on how to improve risk communication to family physicians in the event of a future public health crisis. MAIN FINDINGS Based on their personal experiences, participants had many explicit recommendations on how to improve risk communication strategies in the event of a future public health crisis. These included having a single trusted source of information; having timely and succinct communication; having consideration for learners; ensuring access to information for all physicians; improving public health and family medicine collaboration; having crisis information for patients; and creating communication infrastructure before a crisis occurs. CONCLUSION This research provides thoughtful and varied considerations and advice from practising family physicians on how to improve risk communication from public health agencies and professional organizations to this group in the event of a public health crisis.

This is done through comprehensive geriatric assessment and multi-disciplinary team management. Hence, we adopted an approach consisting of multi-professional teachers teaching a Healthcare of Elderly Course (HEC), in a public university in Malaysia. We aimed to analyze the students' attitude, self-perceived competency and interest in geriatric medicine as a career before and after the course. We also investigated variables that might influence this interest among these students. All 96 students in the course were invited to participate in the survey. Sixty-eight (70.8%) completed both pre and post-course questionnaires. Although most students (93%) have a positive attitude (University of California at Los Angeles Geriatric Attitude Scale >3) toward older adults at baseline, it did not significantly increase post-course. We found that the mean scores for self-perceived competency increased from 3.62 (0.76) to 3.81 (0.56) post-course (p < 0.01). However, the students remained neutral with no significant change in the mean interest in pursuing a geriatric medicine career after the course. Students with higher self-perceived competency post-course were found to be more interested in geriatric medicine ( = 0.56, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the HEC in our centre could sustain a positive attitude and increase self-perceived competency in students.

Guidelines recommend evaluation of pts' symptom burdens and prognostic risk scores at clinic visits. The myeloproliferative neoplasm symptom assessment form total symptom score (MPN-SAF TSS) is a standardized system that evaluates 10 specific MPN-related symptoms on a scale of 1-10. Furthermore, the dynamic prognostic scoring system plus (DIPSS plus) has been validated as a risk stratification tool for MF pts at any point during the disease course. At our institution, leukemia physicians have created an MF pathway to guide practitioners throughout a large healthcare system with many locations. The pathway recommends MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus risk score with clinic visits occurring every 3-6 months. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to obtaining the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus score is burdensome for many providers and pts. Moreover, a recent analysis (Verstovsek Ann Hematol 2020) demonstrates that risk prognostication is very often performed incorrectly. We designed a study to streamline workflow by incorporating our specialty pharmacy to assist in the completion of the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus score via telephone prior to clinic visits. We hypothesized that partnership between our physicians and the specialty pharmacy may benefit pts by increasing adherence to the MF pathway. Methods: This study is conducted in two parts, a retrospective and a prospective phase. A review 12 months prior to start of study was completed to gain historical insight on provider adherence to the MF pathway, with attention to MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus. Then, a prospective study was designed to include new or established MF pts. Pts would be followed for 12 months after start of study. The pilot study was open only at our largest site, home to a subspecialty leukemia clinic where disease-specific physicians practice. For pts who enroll in the prospective study, specialty pharmacists complete both the MPN-SAF TSS and the DIPSS plus score ~3 months via phone prior to clinic visits. Calls for each pt are completed within 10 days of the pt's next visit. If the pharmacist is unable to reach the pt, the physician is notified via EMR message. Completed assessments are documented in the EMR. All enrolled pts are evaluated for MF pathway adherence during the study period. Results: We reviewed system-wide charts for 12 months prior to March 1, 2020 to assess if DIPSS and/or MPN SAF forms were documented for MF patients. 79 MF pts, treated by 32 physicians, were identified. Patients in remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation were excluded. 36 pts (46%) had the MPN-SAF TSS completed and 53 pts (67%) had DIPSS plus performed at least once in the preceding 12 months. 45 pts, treated by 8 physicians, were followed primarily at the pilot site. 27 pts (60%) had MPN-SAF TSS documented and 38 (84%) had DIPSS Plus performed at least once in the preceding 12 months. The prospective study was initiated on March 1, 2020. As of July 15, 2020, 32 patients have been screened for enrollment by treating physicians. This includes 3 newly diagnosed patients not included in the retrospective analysis. 22 pts have had their initial assessments completed. 2 pts could not be reached, 1 of which died prior to the next clinic visit, 2 pts declined the study, and 6 pts had not yet had clinic visits. Of the 22 pts consented and contacted for the study, 100% had the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS Plus score documented with their first visit during the study period. To date 11 pts (of the initial 22) have undergone reevaluation;100% had the MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS Plus score documented with their 3-month follow-up visit. Conclusion: Many practicing clinicians perform MPN-SAF TSS and DIPSS plus scores for MF pts. However, there are lapses in the uptake of both. At our institution, the DIPSS plus score is performed more commonly than the MPN-SAF TSS. This early analysis suggests that a telemedicine approach and partnership between specialty pharmacy and physicians can optimize clinical wor flow. With the initial success of this pilot, our program is expanding study enrollment to include regional clinics. Due to the COVID19 pandemic, there is now heightened interest in telemedicine practices. Preliminary data from this study suggest that a multidisciplinary approach incorporating telemedicine for MF pts provides an effective approach to measuring patient symptom burdens and assigning prognostic categories.

In this study, we aimed to predict and visualize the progression of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients in the early stage of illness by using chest CT. METHODS: COVID-19 patients who underwent three chest CT scans in the progressive phase were retrospectively enrolled. An extended CT ventilation imaging (CTVI) method was proposed in this work that was adapted to use two chest CT scans acquired on different days, and then lung ventilation maps were generated. The prediction maps were obtained according to the fractional ventilation values, which were related to pulmonary regional function and tissue property changes. The third CT scan was used to validate whether the prediction maps could be used to distinguish healthy regions and potential lesions. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients (mean age  SD, 43  10 years, 19 females, and 2C12 days between the second and third CT scans) were included in this study. The predicted lesion locations and sizes were almost the same as the true ones visualized in third CT scan. Quantitatively, the predicted lesion volumes and true lesion volumes showed both a good Pearson correlation (R(2) = 0.80; P < 0.001) and good consistency in the BlandCAltman plot (mean bias = 0.04 cm(3)). Regarding the enlargements of the existing lesions, prediction results also exhibited a good Pearson correlation (R(2) = 0.76; P < 0.001) with true lesion enlargements. CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated that the extended CTVI method could accurately predict and visualize the progression of lung lesions in COVID-19 patients in the early stage of illness, which is helpful for physicians to predetermine the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and make effective treatment plans in advance.

Researchers and scientists have developed many software defects prediction techniques to overcome this very helpful issue. But to some extend there is a need for an algorithm/method to predict defects with more accuracy, reduce time and space complexities. All the previous research conducted on the data without feature reduction lead to the curse of dimensionality. We brought up a machine learning hybrid approach by combining Principal component Analysis (PCA) and Support vector machines (SVM) to overcome the ongoing problem. We have employed PROMISE (CM1: 344 observations, KC1: 2109 observations) data from the directory of NASA to conduct our research. We split the dataset into training (CM1: 240 observations, KC1: 1476 observations) dataset and testing (CM1: 104 observations, KC1: 633 observations) datasets. Using PCA, we find the principal components for feature optimization which reduce the time complexity. Then, we applied SVM for classification due to very native qualities over traditional and conventional methods. We also employed the GridSearchCV method for hyperparameter tuning. In the proposed hybrid model we have found better accuracy (CM1: 95.2%, KC1: 86.6%) than other methods. The proposed model also presents higher evaluation in the terms of other criteria. As a limitation, the only problem with SVM is there is no probabilistic explanation for classification which may very rigid towards classifications. In the future, some other method may also introduce which can overcome this limitation and keep a soft probabilistic based margin for classification on the optimal hyperplane.","output":"Principal component based support vector machine (PC-SVM): a hybrid technique for software defect detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A large subset of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are experiencing symptoms well beyond the claimed 2-week recovery period for mild cases.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and accuracy of alternative screening strategies to provide evidence for cervical cancer screening guidelines in China. METHODS: In total, 32,306 women were enrolled. The current screening with Cervista(?) high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) nongenotyping and cytology cotesting (Cervista(?) cotesting) was compared with PCR-reverse dot blot HR-HPV genotyping and cytology cotesting (PCR-RDB cotesting). All eligible participants were divided into Arm 1, in which both HR-HPV assays were performed, and Arms 2 and 3, in which the PCR-RDB HPV or Cervista(?) HR-HPV assay, respectively, was performed. Outcome indicators included the cases, sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), colposcopy referral rate and cost of identifying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2/3 or worse (CIN2+/CIN3+). RESULTS: Among the eligible participants, 18.4% were PCR-RDB HR-HPV-positive, while 16.9% were Cervista(?) HR-HPV-positive, which reflects good agreement (k = 0.73). PCR-RDB cotesting identified more CIN3+ cases than Cervista(?) cotesting in the first round of screening in Arm 1 (37 vs 32) and Arms 2/3 (252 vs 165). The sensitivity and NPV of PCR-RDB cotesting for identifying CIN3+ in Arm 1 (sensitivity: 94.9% vs 86.5%; NPV: 99.9% vs 99.7%) and Arms 2/3 (sensitivity: 95.1% vs 80.9%; NPV: 99.9% vs 99.6%) were higher than those of Cervista(?) cotesting, but the cost was similar. CONCLUSIONS: The PCR-RDB HR-HPV genotyping and Cervista(?) HR-HPV assay results were consistent. PCR-RDB cotesting possesses optimal cost-effectiveness for cervical cancer screening in China, which has the highest number of cases globally but low screening coverage.","output":"Cost-effectiveness and accuracy of cervical cancer screening with a high-risk HPV genotyping assay vs a nongenotyping assay in China: an observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing has been suggested as one of the most effective measures to break the chain of viral transmission in the current COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS We reviewed our procedural database for all percutaneous gastrostomy and gastrojejunostomy tube insertions performed over a 14-month period using a widely accepted t-fastener kit for gastropexy (Kimberly-Clark). Of 201 patients, 71 (41 males, 30 females; mean age, 56 years) underwent subsequent abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging. The location and associated findings of each t-fastener were retrospectively recorded for each CT scan performed after the tube insertion. RESULTS A total of 153 t-fasteners were deployed during 71 procedures with subsequent CT follow-up. In the short term (within 4 weeks after deployment), 5.1% of the t-fasteners had detached and were no longer present; 59.5% were intraluminal or within the gastric wall; and 35.5% were within the anterior abdominal wall musculature or subcutaneous. In the long term (>3 months), 48.6% of the t-fasteners had detached and were no longer present, 25.0% were intraluminal or within the gastric wall, and 26.4% were within the anterior abdominal wall musculature or subcutaneous. No t-fastener-related complications, such as abscesses, fluid collections, or fistulae, were identified. CONCLUSIONS Following gastropexy for percutaneous transgastric feeding tube placement, t-fastener migration into the abdominal wall frequently occurred soon after the tube insertion.

OBJECTIVE: To simulate the association of different vaccine allocation strategies with COVID-19Cassociated morbidity and mortality and their distribution across racial and ethnic groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed and internally validated the risk of COVID-19 infection and risk of hospitalization models on randomly split training and validation data sets. These were used in a computer simulation study of vaccine prioritization among adult health plan members who were drawn from an integrated health care delivery system. The study was conducted from January 3, 2021, to June 1, 2021, in Oakland, California, and the data were analyzed during the same period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We simulated the association of different vaccine allocation strategies, including (1) random, (2) a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proxy, (3) age based, and (4) combinations of models for the risk of adverse outcomes (CRS) and COVID-19 infection (PROVID), with COVID-19-related hospitalizations between May 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, that were randomly permuted by month across 250 simulations and assessed vaccine allocation by race and ethnicity and the neighborhood deprivation index across time. RESULTS: The study included 3 202 679 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [18.0] years; 1 677 637 women [52.4%]; 1 525 042 men [47.6%]; 611 154 Asian [19.1%], 206 363 Black [6.4%], 642 344 Hispanic [20.1%], and 1 390 638 White individuals [43.4%]), of whom 36 137 (1.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. A risk-based strategy (CRS/PROVID) showed the largest avoidable hospitalization estimates (4954; 95% CI, 3452-5878) followed by age-based (4362; 95% CI, 2866-5175) and CDC proxy (4085; 95% CI, 2805-5109) strategies. Random vaccination showed substantially lower reductions in adverse outcomes. Risk-based strategies also showed the largest number of avoidable COVID-19 deaths (joint CRS/PROVID) and household transmissions. Risk-based (PROVID) and CDC proxy strategies were estimated to vaccinate the highest percentage of Hispanic and Black patients in 8 months (joint CRS/PROVID: 642 570 [100%] Hispanic, 185 530 [90%] Black; PROVID: 642 570 [100%] Hispanic, 198 480 [96%] Black; CDC proxy: 605 770 [95%] Hispanic and 151 772 [74%] Black) compared with an age-based approach (438 423 [68%] Hispanic, 154 714 [75%] Black). Overall, the PROVID and joint CRS/PROVID risk-based strategies were estimated to be followed by the most patients from areas with high neighborhood deprivation index being vaccinated early. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation modeling study of adults from a large integrated health care delivery system, risk-based strategies were associated with the largest estimated reductions in COVID-19 hospitalizations, deaths, and household transmissions compared with the CDC proxy and age-based strategies, with a higher proportion of Hispanic and Black patients were estimated to be vaccinated early in the process compared with the CDC strategy.","output":"Evaluation of Vaccination Strategies to Compare Efficient and Equitable Vaccine Allocation by Race and Ethnicity Across Time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The paper provides new evidence for Bitcoin's safe-haven property by examining the relationship between currency price, return and Bitcoin trading volume. Design/methodology/approach A unique dataset from a person-to-person (p2p) exchange is used to investigate association between Bitcoin trading volume and currency prices. Currency returns are used to identify local economic crises, the 8 crisis affected currencies are Venezuela Bolivar (VES), Iranian Rial (IRR), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Argentine Peso (ARS), Egyptian Pound (EGP), Nigerian Naira (NGN), Turkish Lira (TRY) and Kazakhstani Tenge (KZT). Findings The paper demonstrates that local economic crises are positively associated with increased Bitcoin trading. There is a negative association between trading volume and currency value (and return), suggesting low currency price and currency depreciation are accompanied with increased Bitcoin trading. The results not only hold for the crisis affected currencies but also currencies of advanced economies. Granger causality test also reinforces the negative association results. Originality/value The finding indicates some forms of flight-to-safety have occurred during local market crises when capital flight from domestic markets to Bitcoin, strengthening Bitcoin's hedging asset status. However, total global trading volume declines after the start of the COVID pandemic, suggesting that Bitcoin is still regarded as a speculative asset.

This study examines the effects of COVID-19 on health service utilisation in a sub-Saharan country, Sierra Leone. Methods: Mixed-methods study using longitudinal nationwide hospital data (admissions, operations, deliveries and referrals), and qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and patients. Hospital data were compared across Quarters (Q) in 2020, with day 1 of Q2 representing the start of the pandemic in Sierra Leone. Admissions are reported in total and disaggregated by sex, service (surgical, medical, maternity, paediatric), and hospital type (government or private not for profit). Referrals in 2020 were compared with 2019, to assess whether any changes were the result of seasonality. Comparisons were performed using students t test. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: From Q1-Q2, weekly mean hospital admissions decreased by 14.7% (p=0.005). Larger decreases were seen in male 18.8%, than female 12.5% admissions. The largest decreases were in surgical admissions, a 49.8 % decrease (p<0.001) and medical admissions, a 28.7% decrease (p=0.002). Paediatric and maternity admissions did not significantly change. Total operations decreased by 13.9% (p<0.001), whilst caesarean sections and facility-based deliveries showed significant increases, 12.7 % (p=0.014) and 7.5% (p=0.03) respectively. In Q3 total admissions remained 13.2% lower (p<0.001) than Q1. Mean weekly referrals were lower in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 compared to 2019, suggesting findings were unlikely to be seasonal. Qualitative analysis identified both supply-side factors, prioritisation of essential services, introduction of COVID-19 services and pausing elective care, and demand-side factors, fear of nosocomial infection and financial hardship.

Findings Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 'good' and 'fair' quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, tau = 0.41]. Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.05, 95% CrI = 0.95-1.17, tau = 0.17), but favoured there being no important association (21% probability of RR &gt;= 1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalization (RR = 1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, tau = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR = 1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, tau = 0.29) and mortality (RR = 1.39, 95% CrI = 1.09-1.87, tau = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR = 1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, tau = 0.27;RR = 1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, tau = 0.34;RR = 1.22, 95% CrI = 0.78-1.94, tau = 0.49, respectively), but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalization and mortality (35% and 70% probability of RR &gt;= 1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79% probability of RR &gt;= 1.1). Conclusions Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal.

Although telepsychotherapy is new to many clinical psychologists, there is considerable research on telepsychotherapy treatments. Nearly 2 decades of clinical research on telepsychotherapy treatments with children with neurological conditions has the potential to inform emerging clinical practice in the age of COVID-19. Toward that end, we synthesized findings from 14 clinical trials of telepsychotherapy problem-solving and parent-training interventions involving more than 800 children and families with diverse diagnoses, including traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, brain tumors, congenital heart disease, and perinatal stroke. We summarize efficacy across studies and clinical populations and report feasibility and acceptability data from the perspectives of parents, children, and psychotherapists. We describe adaptation for international contexts and strategies for troubleshooting technological challenges and working with families of varying socioeconomic strata. The extensive research literature reviewed and synthesized provides considerable support for the utility of telepsychotherapy with children with neurological conditions and their families and underscores its high level of acceptability with both diverse clinical populations and providers. During this period of heightened vulnerability and stress and reduced access to usual supports and services, telepsychotherapy approaches such as online family problem-solving treatment and online parenting skills training may allow psychologists to deliver traditional evidence-based treatments virtually while preserving fidelity and efficacy.","output":"Telepsychotherapy With Children and Families: Lessons Gleaned From Two Decades of Translational Research."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To assess the extent to which public support for outbreak containment policies varies with respect to the severity of an infectious disease outbreak. Methods: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1,017 residents of Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, gender and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among 5 policies restricting local movement and 4 border control policies) they would support in 5 randomly-assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics and perceived policy effectiveness. Results: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies; however, was generally higher for border control policies compared to internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher income and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support.","output":"Public Preferences for Government Response Policies on Outbreak Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine the predictors of acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the COVID-19 vaccine among the Indian public and to provide insights for future demand forecasts and pricing considerations Methods: A nationwide, web-based, self-administered, cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 to 20 October 2020 The health belief model (HBM) approach was used as a theoretical framework to assess the predictors of acceptance of and WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine Results: Of 2 480 respondents, 2 451 completed the online survey, yielding a response rate of 98 8% Participants who participated in the survey had diverse demographics in terms of their location, educational level, occupation type, and family income Among 2 451 respondents, the majority (89 3%) intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Respondents with high perceived benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, such as reduction in worry (OR 5 87;95% CI 4 39-7 96) and sickness (OR 4 31;95% CI 3 31-5 62), showed higher intention to receive the vaccine However, respondents with a high perception of the side effects and barriers to vaccination (OR 0 36;95% CI 0 25-0 54) and vaccine shortage (OR 0 58;95% CI 0 41-0 81) showed lower intention to receive the vaccine The majority (2 162, 88 21%) of respondents were willing to pay an amount of INR: 500-1 000 or USD: 6 81-13 62 for a dose of COVID-19 vaccine, with a median (Q1, Q3) of INR: 500 (500, 1 000) or USD: 6 81 (6 81, 13 62) The higher marginal WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine was influenced by advanced age, marital status, female sex, intermediate educational background, high family income, fair or poor perceived health status, and no affordable barriers Conclusions: The majority of respondents intended to receive the COVID-19 vaccine Healthcare interventions focusing on HBM constructs and demographic predictors associated with low intention to receive the vaccine can be effective in enhancing the coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine The findings of this study provide guidance for the future price considerations of the COVID-19 vaccine ? 2021 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters KluwerMedknow All rights reserved","output":"Predictors of acceptance and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine in the general public of India: A health belief model approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the COVID-19 pandemic, currently, there are many drugs in clinical trials against this virus.

We have also performed docking of drugs Lopinavir, Ribavirin, and Azithromycin on SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Further, binding of these compounds (Hyaluronic acid, Acarbose, and Lopinavir) is validated by extensive molecular dynamics simulation of 500 ns where these drugs show stable binding with M(pro).

In response to the pandemic, our genetics department offered telehealth visits to all outpatients, regardless of their physical proximity to Omaha, Nebraska. Traditionally, our department did not offer telehealth visits to patient's homes or to patients who lived in close proximity to a genetics clinic. Therefore, we designed a survey to gain insight into the patient experience with remote genetic counseling appointments during the pandemic. Any patient referred to see a genetics provider in pediatrics, prenatal, adult, or cancer between March 16, 2020 and October 28, 2020 was eligible for the study. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess patient demographics, patient experience, stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxiety and depression. We hypothesized that patients would report they received quality care by telehealth despite the presence of COVID-19-related stressors or anxiety/depression. From the 143 survey participants, 80% had their first telehealth appointment during the pandemic. The vast majority (96%) reported that they felt like they received quality care by telehealth. Additionally, more than 93% of participants strongly or somewhat agreed that their genetic providers were attentive to their emotional needs, medical needs, and privacy. Since March 2020, participants reported experiencing several COVID-19-related stressors including fear of illness (86%), feelings of isolation (45%), and safety concerns (33%). Relatively low levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms were recorded using the HADS questionnaire. Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 stressors, depression, and/or anxiety, our participants felt they received quality care via telehealth.

As such, we investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio (BAR) predicts mortality in the COVID-19 patients in the emergency department. METHODS: A total of 602 COVID-19 patients who were brought to the emergency department within the period from March to September 2020 were included in the study. The BUN level, albumin level, BAR, age, gender, and in-hospital mortality status of the patients were recorded. The patients were grouped by in-hospital mortality. Statistical comparison was conducted between the groups. RESULTS: Of the patients who were included in the study, 312(51.8%) were male, and their median age was 63 years (49-73). There was in-hospital mortality in 96(15.9%) patients. The median BUN and BAR values of the patients in the non-survivor group were significantly higher than those in the survivor group (BUN: 24.76 [17.38-38.31] and 14.43 [10.84-20.42], respectively [p < 0.001]; BAR: 6.7 [4.7-10.1] and 3.4 [2.5-5.2], respectively [p < 0.001]). The mean albumin value in the non-survivor group was significantly lower than that in the survivor group (3.60  0.58 and 4.13  0.51, respectively; p < 0.001). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) and odds ratio values obtained by BAR to predict in-hospital COVID-19 mortality were higher than the values obtained by BUN and albumin (AUC of BAR, BUN, and albumin: 0.809, 0.771, and 0.765, respectively; odds ratio of BAR>3.9, BUN>16.05, and albumin<4.01: 10.448, 7.048, and 6.482, respectively). CONCLUSION: The BUN, albumin, and BAR levels were found to be reliable predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients, but BAR was found to be a more reliable predictor than the BUN and albumin levels.","output":"The role of the BUN/albumin ratio in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients in the emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptosporidium spp. is the most important foodborne and waterborne pathogens and the leading cause of mortality from foodborne and waterborne gastrointestinal disease. In neonates of domestic animals it is associated with consistent diarrhoea and dehydration. Cryptosporidium infection begins with the ingestion of sporulated oocytes disseminated by carrier animals that consistently contaminate the environment. Many diagnostic tests are available including microscopy, antigen trap ELISA, but none of the diagnostic tests available currently cannot differentiate between active and passive infection in the host. In the current study, to address this challenge an mRNA based duplex TaqMan? probe PCR (dRT-qPCR) was developed to target the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and 18ssu rRNA gene in a single tube that can detect metabolically active Cryptosporidial oocysts. The mRNA transcripts are the direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and it will help decipher the active stages of its lifecycle in host. This diagnostic assay was standardized by computing transcript copy number-based limit of detection. For COWP and 188ssu rRNA genes the limit of detection was 7.081004 and 5.951005 respectively. During active infections the oocyst wall protein will be active and so its COWP gene transcripts will act as marker for active infection. While transcripts for 18SSU rRNA are constitutively expressing in Cryptosporidial life cycle. This current diagnostic assay will be a quantitative marker that will help assess active stages of Cryptosporidium infection in neonates. The disease dynamics will help better understand to formulate the control strategies and contain infection among the healthy animals. Importance Cryptosporidiosis is an important neonatal disease affecting goats causing diarrhoea, dehydration and stunted growth. For diagnosing this condition, many diagnostic tests are available including microscopy, immunological tests, but none of the diagnostic tests available currently can differentiate between active and passive infection in the host. The mRNA transcripts are the direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and especially in intracellular parasites it will help decipher the infective stages of a lifecycle in the host, and hence the test was developed in a reverse transcriptional format in a duplex mode. The currently developed diagnostic assay for cryptosporidiosis was evaluated for sensitivity using Limit of detection (LOD). This diagnostic test will act as a quantitative marker to aid in detecting active stages of Cryptosporidium infection in neonatal goats and will eventually lead to better control strategies for managing cryptosporidial infections in the future.","output":"Development of duplex real time PCR for quick detection of Cryptosporidia in goats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opinion formation and disease spreading are among the most studied dynamical processes on complex networks. In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction [Formula: see text] of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling [Formula: see text] overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with [Formula: see text] in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.","output":"Interacting opinion and disease dynamics in multiplex networks: Discontinuous phase transition and nonmonotonic consensus times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To examine associations of changing employment conditions, specifically switching to working from home (WFH) or job loss, with mental health, using data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data from 2,301 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd?7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were WFH when they had not been before, or they had lost their job due to the pandemic. Outcomes were symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and positive mental health (PMH) assessed using validated questionnaires. Linear regression quantified associations of employment changes with mental health outcomes, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, screen time, physical activity, marital status, chronic conditions, and current COVID-19 containment strategies being followed. Results: Compared to participants whose employment remained unchanged, those who switched to WFH did not differ in any measures of mental health (all p  0.200). Participants who had lost their job reported higher symptoms of depression (g = ?0.200, 95%CI = ?0.333 to ?0.067; p = 0.003), anxiety (g = ?0.212, ?0.363 to ?0.061; p = 0.008), and stress (g = ?0.348, ?0.482 to ?0.214; p < 0.001), and lower PMH (g = ?0.212, ?0.347 to ?0.078; p = 0.002).

Unlike the well-characterized DNA virus-encoded miRNAs, the role of RNA virus-encoded miRNAs remains controversial. In this review, we first describe the current knowledge of miRNAs encoded by various RNA viruses, including newly emerging viruses.

However, the desired recovery was not achieved with Arbidol. Many countries still use this drug in the treatment of COVID19. AIM: We aimed to determine whether Arbidol, the hemagglutinin esterase inhibitor used in the treatment of COVID-19, was effective against SARS Cov-2 in silico. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The similarity between hemagglutinin and spike proteins were reported due to the fact that inhibition properties of Arbidol and its 39 analogues were examined in detail against hemagglutinin esterase and spike glycoproteins. CID 1070884 and CID 1207786 were found to be more active against hemagglutinin esterase than in Arbidol, while these compounds were inactive against spike glycoproteins. The interaction mechanism was clarified between arbidol and spike proteins.

Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset.

We postulate that these two interleukins may participate in the early phase of TBE and NB. The aim of the study was to measure serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of ICAM-1, IL-21 and IL-23 in patients with TBE and NB before treatment and to assess their usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory process in TBE and NB. METHODS: Forty-three patients hospitalized in The Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections of Medical University in Bialystok, Poland, were included in the study. Patients were divided into three groups: TBE, NB and CG. Pre-treatment blood and CSF samples were obtained from all patients. ELISA kits (DRG Instruments, Germany) were used to measure the concentration of IL-21, IL-23 and sICAM-1. RESULTS: Significant differences between TBE/CG and NB/CG concentration of sICAM-1 were found only in the CSF. CSF IL-21 levels in NB were lower than in TBE. In TBE, a strong negative correlation between CSF concentration of IL-21 and IL-23 and monocyte count in CSF was observed. Negative correlation between IL-21 in CSF and neutrophil count was also noted. Serum IL-23 correlated positively with leukocytes and platelet count in serum. In NB, a strong positive correlation between serum IL-21 and platelet count and negative correlation between IL-21 in serum and CSF with pleocytosis was observed.

The current study reports experimental observations on deposition in micro-capillaries, representing distal lung bronchioles, over a wide range of Re that imitates the particle dynamics in the entire lung. The experiment investigated deposition in tubes of diameter ranging from 0.3 mm to 2 mm and over a wide range of Reynolds number (10-2 a Re a 103). The range of the tube diameter and Re used in this study is motivated by the dimensions of lung airways and typical breathing flow rates. The aerosol fluid was loaded with boron doped carbon quantum dots as fluorophores. An aerosol plume was generated from this mixture fluid using an ultrasonic nebulizer, producing droplets with 6.5 m as a mean diameter and over a narrow distribution of sizes. The amount of aerosol deposited on the tube walls was measured using a spectrofluorometer. The experimental results show that dimensionless deposition (?) varies inversely with the bronchiole aspect ratio ( L  ), with the effect of the Reynolds number (Re) being significant only at low L  . ? also increased with increasing dimensionless bronchiole diameter ( D  ), but it is invariant with the particle size based Reynolds number.

Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 60 actinobacterial strains as BCAs against M. phaseolina and R. solani&nbsp;in vitro by dual culture assays. The most effective strains were characterized according to their cellulolytic, chitinolytic and proteolytic extracellular enzymatic activity, as well as by their morphological and biochemical characters in vitro. Forty and 25 out of the 60 actinobacteria strains inhibited the mycelial growth of M. phaseolina and R. solani, respectively, and 18 of them showed a common effect against both pathogens. Significant differences were observed on their enzymatic and biochemical activity.

Current short-read sequencing technologies achieve high read depth but are limited in their ability to resolve complex isoforms. In this review we examine how long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies can address this challenge by covering the entire RNA sequence in a single read and thereby distinguish isoform changes that could impact RNA regulation or protein function. Coupling LRS with technologies such as single cell sequencing, targeted sequencing and spatial transcriptomics is producing a rapidly expanding suite of technological approaches to profile alternative splicing at the isoform level with unprecedented detail. In addition, integrating LRS with genotype now allows the impact of genetic variation on isoform expression to be determined. Recent results demonstrate the potential of these techniques to elucidate the landscape of splicing, including in tissues such as the brain where AS is particularly prevalent.

Blood homocysteine concentrations are determined by the ion exchange liquid column chromatography method with the use of an automatic amino acid analyzer. The behavioral responses and cognitive abilities of the rats have been studied with the use of behavioral tests (open field test, fear conditioning test, and social interaction test). The production of Alfacognitin dietary supplement has been launched with Nutrimed Ltd. (Kyiv). Results. Alfacognitin has been shown to reduce homocysteine levels, to improve cognitive abilities, social interaction and communication skills, and to compensate functional memory and learning disorders in animals with hyperhomocysteinemia. Specifications for the dietary supplement have been approved, a pilot technology for obtaining the capsule form of the drug has been developed, and an experimental batch has been manufactured. Conclusions. Alfacognitin may reduce the homocysteine levels. Therefore, it may be used to normalize the functional state of the cardiovascular and nervous systems in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, as well as to improve the cognitive functions, in particular in patients after COVID-19.","output":"Development of a Dietary Supplement for Improving the Cognitive Functions an D Lowering the Homocysteine Levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a major global health threat. Epidemiological studies suggest that bats (Rhinolophus affinis) are the natural zoonotic reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. However, the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and intermediate hosts that facilitate its transmission to humans remain unknown. The interaction of coronavirus with its host receptor is a key genetic determinant of host range and cross-species transmission. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter host cells in a species-dependent manner. In this study, we characterized the ability of ACE2 from diverse species to support viral entry. By analyzing the conservation of five residues in two virus-binding hotspots of ACE2 (hotspot 31Lys and hotspot 353Lys), we predicted 80 ACE2 proteins from mammals that could potentially mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry. We chose 48 ACE2 orthologs among them for functional analysis, and showed that 44 of these orthologsincluding domestic animals, pets, livestock, and animals commonly found in zoos and aquariacould bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. In contrast, New World monkey ACE2 orthologs could not bind the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and support viral entry. We further identified the genetic determinant of New World monkey ACE2 that restricts viral entry using genetic and functional analyses. These findings highlight a potentially broad host tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be distributed much more widely than previously recognized, underscoring the necessity to monitor susceptible hosts to prevent future outbreaks.","output":"Functional and genetic analysis of viral receptor ACE2 orthologs reveals a broad potential host range of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are described as the most common comorbidities among COVID-19 patients. We investigated the adverse effect of ACEIs in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with COVID-19. Methods. This prospective study consisted of 617 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. Demographic and baseline characteristics, underlying comorbid diseases, and antihypertensive drugs were evaluated. Study outcome (in-hospital death) was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and Cox regression model. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software for Windows. P values < .05 were considered significant. Results. Mean  SD age was 58.49  15.80 (range: 18 to 94) years old. Cox regression analysis revealed that age (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.06), diabetes mellitus (adjusted HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.26), immunocompromised patients (adjusted HR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.29 to 4.21), acute kidney injury (AKI) (adjusted HR = 3.23, 95% CI: 2.01 to 5.19), ICU admission (adjusted HR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.46 to 4.21), Asthma and COPD (adjusted HR = 2.13, CI:1.6 to 4.28) and ACEI (adjusted HR = 3.08, 95% CI: 1.56 to 6.06), respectively were associated with in-hospital death.

DATA SOURCES The PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically from inception to May 2021 by using the search terms ('de-escalation' OR 'switching') AND ('antiplatelet' OR 'clopidogrel' OR 'ticagrelor' OR 'prasugrel') AND ('percutaneous coronary intervention' OR 'PCI'' OR 'Acute coronary syndrome' OR 'ACS'). STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION We included RCTs that reported the primary outcomes, i.e. net clinical benefits and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2 or higher bleeding. A combination of both ischemic and bleeding events was defined as a net clinical benefit. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of four RCTs were included, with 5952 patients. A random-effects meta-analysis revealed that a de-escalation strategy was associated with lower ischemic and bleeding events (net clinical benefits; risk ratio [RR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.85; p = 0.003), and lower BARC type 2 or higher bleeding (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.91; p = 0.02) when compared with a continuation strategy. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE The current guidelines recommend potent P2Y12 prasugrel or ticagrelor for 12 months despite their association with a high risk of bleeding. Our meta-analysis updates cardiologists, providing them with the best available evidence in managing patients with ACS who underwent PCI. CONCLUSION Among patients with ACS treated with PCI, a de-escalation strategy (prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel) is associated with lower ischemic and bleeding events (net clinical benefits) and lower BARC type 2 or higher bleeding; however, due to the limited number of included studies, further high-quality studies are needed to establish the clinical efficacy of the de-escalation strategy.","output":"De-escalation from Prasugrel or Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome Managed with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: An Updated Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory viral illness causing pneumonia and systemic disease. Abnormalities in pulmonary function after COVID-19 infection have been described. The determinants of these abnormalities are unclear. We hypothesized that inflammatory biomarkers and computed tomography (CT) scan parameters at the time of infection would be associated with abnormal gas exchange at short term follow-up.Methods: We studied subjects who were hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and then discharged. Those with pre-existing lung disease (except asthma) or reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) prior to COVID-19 infection were excluded. Information on serum inflammatory biomarkers, CT scan, and clinical characteristics were collected in the index hospitalization. Pulmonary function tests and 6-minute walk tests were assessed at 2-3 months after discharge. CT images at the time of hospitalization were evaluated by Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI;FLUIDDA, Inc., Antwerp, Belgium) with 3D reconstruction of the lungs and pulmonary vasculature to analyze pulmonary blood volume. Blood volumes of the pulmonary vessels that were 5mm (BV5), 5-10mm (BV5-10), and 10mm (BV10) in cross-sectional area were analyzed. Additionally, the amount of inflammation on CT (ground-glass opacities) was quantified. We divided subjects into those with a DLCO &lt;80% predicted and those with a DLCO 80% predicted based on follow-up pulmonary function tests. Results: 38 subjects were included in our cohort. Pulmonary function tests were performed 76.535.1 days after the first day of hospitalization. The results are summarized in the Table. 31 out of 38 (81.5%) subjects had a DLCO&lt;80% predicted. The groups were similar in terms of demographics, body mass index, and smoking status. Peak D-dimer, LDH, and ferritin levels were greater in the DLCO&lt;80% group. Spirometric measures and lung volumes were similar between groups. Inflammation was not different between groups, but BV5-10 and BV10 measures were higher in the DLCO&lt;80% group. BV5-10 was associated with DLCO&lt;80% in multivariable logistic regression with demographics, smoking status, lung volumes, and hemoglobin as covariates (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.01, 1.64).Conclusions: Higher peak D-dimer levels at the time of hospitalization and abnormalities in pulmonary blood volumes are associated with a reduced DLCO at follow-up. These findings suggest that pulmonary vascular and coagulation abnormalities during hospitalization with COVID-19 might have long-lasting effects on pulmonary function. Further study regarding the influence of pulmonary blood volumes and measures of abnormal coagulation on short term COVID-19 outcomes is warranted.","output":"Association of Serum D-Dimer and Abnormal Pulmonary Vasculature on CT Scan during Hospitalization with Decreased Diffusion Capacity in Follow Up for COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colon capsule endoscopy was initially introduced in 2006.

METHODS: Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. RESULTS: Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan.

Tree deaths represent a threat for fauna that are dependent on forest habitats for their survival. Although tree declines have received considerable scientific attention, surprisingly, little is known about their impacts on fauna. In total, we calculated 631 effect sizes across 59 studies that quantified the impact of tree declines on animal abundance. Data representing 186 bird species indicated an overall increase in bird abundance in response to tree declines (meta-analysis mean  estimation g = 0.172  0.053 [CI 0.069 to 0.275], P = 0.001); however, there was substantial variability in responses (significant heterogeneity P < 0.001) with a strong influence of diet as well as nesting guild on bird responses. Granivores (especially ground-foraging species, e.g. Passerellidae species), bark-foraging insectivores (e.g. woodpeckers), as well as ground- and cavity-nesting species apparently benefitted from tree declines, while nectarivorous birds [and, although not significant, aerially foraging insectivores (e.g. flycatchers) and leaf-gleaning insectivores (canopy-feeding)] were less common in the presence of tree declines. Data representing 33 mammal species indicate a tendency for detrimental effects of tree declines on mammals that use trees as refuges, while aerial foragers (i.e. bats) may benefit from opening up the canopy. Overall the average effect for mammals was neutral (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.150  0.145 [-0.433 to 0.134], P = 0.302). Data representing 20 reptile species showed an insufficient range of responses to determine any diet or foraging effect on their responses. Data for 28 arthropod taxa should be considered with caution, as we could not adequately separate taxa according to their specialisations and reliance on key habitat. The data broadly suggest a detrimental effect of tree declines (meta-analysis mean estimation g = -0.171  0.072 [-0.311 to -0.031], P = 0.017) with ground-foraging arthropods (e.g. detritivores and predators such as spiders and centipedes) more likely to be detrimentally impacted by tree declines. The range of responses to tree declines signifies substantially altered animal communities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We describe our experience with performing a true NOTES tansvaginal cholecystectomy after safely accomplishing 3 laparoscopically-assisted hybrid NOTES procedures in humans. To overcome the retracting limitations of currently available endoscopes, we used a 5-mm curved or articulating retractor that was placed into the abdomen via a separate colpotomy in the second and third patient. In a fourth patient, pneumoperitoneum to 15 torr was obtained via a transvaginal trocar placed through a colpotomy made under direct vision and endoscopically placed clips were used for both the cystic duct and artery, thus, obviating the need for any transabdominally placed instruments or needles. RESULTS This patient was the first patient to undergo a completely NOTES cholecystectomy at our institution and to our knowledge in the United States. She was discharged on the day of surgery and has not suffered any complication after 1 month of follow-up.

METHODS: All healthcare and administrative staff working in the Verona University Hospital (Veneto, Italy) during the COVID-19 pandemic were asked to complete a web-based survey from 21 April to 6 May 2020. Symptoms of post-traumatic distress, anxiety and depression were assessed, respectively, using the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Personal socio-demographic information and job characteristics were also collected, including gender, age, living condition, having pre-existing psychological problems, occupation, length of working experience, hospital unit (ICUs and sub-intensive COVID-19 units vs. non-COVID-19 units). A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with each of the three mental health outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 2195 healthcare workers (36.9% of the overall hospital staff) participated in the study. Of the participants, 35.7% were nurses, 24.3% other healthcare staff, 16.4% residents, 13.9% physicians and 9.7% administrative staff. Nine per cent of healthcare staff worked in ICUs, 8% in sub-intensive COVID-19 units and 7.6% in other front-line services, while the remaining staff worked in hospital units not directly engaged with COVID-19 patients. Overall, 63.2% of participants reported COVID-related traumatic experiences at work and 53.8% (95% CI 51.0%C56.6%) showed symptoms of post-traumatic distress; moreover, 50.1% (95% CI 47.9%C52.3%) showed symptoms of clinically relevant anxiety and 26.6% (95% CI 24.7%C28.5%) symptoms of at least moderate depression. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that women, nurses, healthcare workers directly engaged with COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing psychological problems were at increased risk of psychopathological consequences of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare staff working in a highly burdened geographical of north-east Italy is relevant and to some extent greater than that reported in China. The study provides solid grounds to elaborate and implement interventions pertaining to psychology and occupational health.","output":"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in a highly burdened area of north-east Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to highlight the response of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) towards COVID-19 COVID-19, which is known as the Novel Coronavirus originally from Wuhan, a city in China and has been spreading to more than 200 countries in the world within a very short time World Health Organization (WHO) asserts that COVID-19 has been a global pandemic It has reached out to all continents in the world Using primary and secondary resources, this paper argues that ASEAN has significantly responded at the regional level to mitigate the pandemic At the national level, ASEAN member states have responded it with different policies based on their domestic socio-economic, security, and political circumstances Singapore, Philippines, and Malaysia are the countries with the highest cases of COVID-19 implementing a lockdown policy Thailand and Indonesia apply a local lockdown policy While Cambodia, Vietnam, and Indonesia implement social distancing policies to protect their citizens from COVID-19 As a result, Vietnam and Malaysia succeed in suppressing the growth of COVID-19 cases Meanwhile, the COVID-19 cases in Singapore and Indonesia, despite the government efforts to stop its spread, continue to increase as of June 2020","output":"Response of ASEAN member states to the spread of COVID-19 in Southeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of feeding immunized egg proteins (IEP) on the health and performance of newborn dairy calves. Sixty-four Holstein calves, both male and female, were divided over two treatments. Calves either received IEP or a placebo (PCB) in their colostrum and calf milk replacer (CMR) for the first 14 days of their life. Until day 49, CMR was offered at 15% of birth weight (BW), at 10% on days 49-57 and at 5% on days 57-63. In addition, calves received starter concentrate, chopped straw and water from 3 days old until 70 days old at the end of study. Individual CMR and concentrate intake were measured daily whilst BW was recorded weekly. Visual faecal scoring and health observations were conducted daily. Faecal samples were collected weekly up to 4 weeks and during the first 4 days of scouring to screen for presence of Cryptosporidium parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli and Salmonella. Results indicated that feeding IEP increased BW (p < .05) at 42 and 56 days old, and BW also tended (p = .06) to be higher after weaning at 63-70 days old compared to the PCB group. When analysed using a repeated measures model, compared to feeding PCB, feeding IEP increased total concentrate consumption (p = .001) by 3.6kg/calf. Over the entire study, daily water intake was higher (p = .002) for the IEP group when compared with the PCB group. In the IEP group, 12 calves were scored as scouring whereas there were 14 calves in the PCB group. There were no significant differences between treatments in faecal pathogen load of neither healthy nor scouring calves. In conclusion, supplementing IEP during the first 14 days of calf life improved the performance of newborn calves.

Viral RNA elements continue to be discovered using combinations of experimental and computational analyses. However, the wealth of sequence data, notably from deep viral RNA sequencing, viromes, and metagenomes, necessitates computational approaches being used as an essential discovery tool. In this review, we describe practical approaches being used to discover functional RNA elements in viral genomes. In addition to success stories in new and emerging viruses, these approaches have revealed some surprising new features of well-studied viruses e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza, and dengue viruses. Some notable discoveries were facilitated by new comparative analyses of diverse viral genome alignments. Importantly, comparative approaches for finding RNA elements embedded in coding and non-coding regions differ. With the exponential growth of computer power we have progressed from stem-loop prediction on single sequences to cutting edge 3D prediction, and from command line to user friendly web interfaces.

The majority of doubly infected lesions accumulated the RNA3 recombinants. The distribution of the recombinant types was relatively even, indicating that both RNA3 counterparts could serve as donor or as acceptor molecules. The frequency of crossovers between one pair of RNA3 variants, which possessed closely located markers, was similar to that of another pair of RNA3 variants with more distant markers, suggesting the existence of an internal recombination hot spot. The majority of crossovers were precise, but some recombinants had minor sequence modifications, possibly marking the sites of imprecise homologous crossovers.

Its benefits include lower cost and usage convenience. However PD associated peritonitis is a common and serious complication of peritoneal dialysis and a major cause of PD failure. Pasturella multocida is a rare cause of peritonitis but highly specific for domestic pet exposure being the causative factor. We present a case of peritonitis being caused by the contamination of dialysis circuit by a cat. A 55 year old female with ESRD on PD for 3 years presented due to abdominal discomfort low grade fever nausea vomiting and rigors for 3 days. PD fluid was obtained for analysis and showed 215 cells/mm3 with 192 neutrophils/mm3 diagnostic of PD peritonitis. PD fluid culture grew Pasteurella multocida. Given the strong correlation of the organism with cats she was questioned about her living situation. She admitted that her daughter along with her 13 cats had moved in with her recently due to the COVID pandemic. The cats were likely responsible for inadvertent contamination of the PD circuit. She completed a 21 day course of intraperitoneal ceftriaxone with resolution of symptoms and infection. Pasturella multocida is an aerobic gram negative coccobacillus and forms the normal flora of the oral cavity of dogs and cats. Pet bites and scratches to the dialysis tubing can cause translocation of bacteria to the peritoneal cavity causing peritonitis. There are no clinical trials specifically looking at Pasteurella peritonitis but most of the previously reported cases have been known to respond to penicillin amoxicillin or 3rd generation cephalosporins. This case demonstrates the ever-evolving and vulnerable social situations of many PD patients. It underlies the importance of assessing the home situation at every visit as the source of infection might not be obvious on initial history taking and often requires more careful questioning. Patient education on strict hygiene and keeping pets away from the dialysis room plays a crucial role in preventing re-infection. Pasteurella infection does not necessarily require PD catheter removal if the inciting factor can be removed as in our case.","output":"Pasteurella Multocida Peritonitis - Keep the Cat in the Bag!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on stroke systems of care and outcomes within a large multi-hospital system in the Western US Methods: Retrospective data from 37 hospitals within a large multi-hospital stroke registry was analyzed All patients with a confirmed discharge diagnosis of stroke or TIA during the pandemic (March and April 2020) were compared to cohorts during the same periods in 2018 and 2019 Analyzed factors included demographics, stroke mechanism, admission NIHSS, reperfusion therapy rates (IV TPA and EVT), reperfusion performance metrics (door-to-CT, door-to-needle, door-topuncture, door-to-first pass), TICI score, discharge and 90-day mRS, discharge disposition, and length of stay Analyses were conducted using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or Person's Chi-square test, as appropriate, adjusting for multiple comparisons Results: Among the 7,201 analyzed patients, 2,378 (33 0%) were admitted in 2018, 2,613 (36 3%) in 2019 and 2,210 (30 7%) in 2020 Fewer patients were hospitalized with TIA during the pandemic compared to 2018 and 2019 (23 6% vs 36 8% vs 39 6%, p&lt; 001) More patients arrived via EMS (52 2% vs 45 7% vs 45 4 %) and fewer via private car (29 8% vs 37 8% vs 38 7%) (p&lt; 001) during the pandemic Median door-to-CT (in minutes) (26 vs 35 vs 33, p&lt; 001) time was significantly shorter during the pandemic Additionally, a greater percentage of patients were treated with EVT during the pandemic (7 5 vs 5 7 vs 5 4, p= 005) Shorter arrival-to-first pass times (in minutes) occurred in 2020 compared to previous years (103 vs 119 vs 115, p=0 091) but this difference did not reach statistical significance Fewer patients were discharged to a skilled nursing facility during the pandemic (12 7%) compared to 2018 and 2019 (15 1% and 15 2%, p= 012) There were no other significant differences in stroke admission volumes, treatment trends, or outcomes between the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods Conclusion: Fewer walk-in strokes and TIAs were hospitalized during the pandemic while an increased rate of thrombectomy procedures occurred compared to the pre-pandemic era Despite anticipated delays in acute stroke care, our study demonstrates improvement in key triage and treatment times and similar outcomes","output":"Acute stroke trends and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in a multi-system hospital system in the western us"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative inquiry explores how, during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania (European Union), the stakeholders in education system Cuniversity teachers, general education teachers, students and childrens parents Ccoped with the encountered challenge and what was important to them under changed conditions.

The prevalence ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression models, adjusting for age, education, household income, residence area, parity, the timing of delivery, and a prior history of depression. ResultsThe prevalence of postpartum depression was 28.7% (EPDS [] 9), 18.6% ([] 11), and 13.1% ([] 13). Social restrictions including cancellation of home visits by health care professionals, or cancellation of infant checkups or vaccinations, loss of support during pregnancy or after delivery including loss of opportunities to consult with health care professionals or friends, or cancellation of parents or other family members visits to support, and loss of autonomy about delivery or breastfeeding, were associated with postnatal depression.

METHODS: The number of visits and admissions and the reason of visit and admission were prospectively recorded from 15,087 patients files. RESULTS: A substantial decline in the total number of visits and increase in the admission rate were documented during the COVID-19 year compared to the preceding year (10691 vs 4396 patients, 22.59% vs 18.15% (OR: 1.316, CI 95%: 1.208C2.242, p < 0.0001), respectively). Fever and/or respiratory symptoms were the commonest reported symptoms in both periods. Possible explanations include: (i) restricted overall infection transmission due to confinement and self-protective measures, (ii) avoidance of unnecessary hospital visits in the absence of severe symptoms and (iii) reduced or delayed access to medical care due to parental fear of childrens exposure to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study is the first worldwide to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on ED visits and admissions throughout the whole year of the pandemic, and to highlight the need for re-evaluation of future protective strategies to infections, adjustment of health-care systems and parental education so that medical care in a health-care setting is sought in a more appropriate manner. IMPACT: A significant decline in paediatric ED visits and increase in the admission rate was observed during the first year of COVID-19 in a tertiary referral centre, possibly due to reduced overall infection transmission, limited ED overuse, but also ED underuse due to parental fear of childrens exposure to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 may serve as an opportunity for societies to re-evaluate future strategies to infections, adjust health-care systems accordingly, and reinforce parents to seek medical care more appropriately.

While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D-puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber-reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource-efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell-based material applications.","output":"Topological Interlocking and Geometric Stiffening as Complementary Strategies for Strong Plant Shells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Influenza could circulate in parallel with COVID-19.

Methods: A national anonymous cross-sectional survey on COVID-19 and influenza vaccine acceptance among reproductive women aged 18C49 years in China was conducted online based on health belief model, a model widely used to evaluate health beliefs. Sociodemographic characteristics, health status, knowledge, attitude, and health beliefs related to COVID-19 and influenza infection and vaccination were retrieved. Pearson's (2) test was used to compare the vaccine acceptance by the factors mentioned above. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the adjusted associations of factors related to vaccine acceptance. Paired t-test was used to compare scores of health beliefs between influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations. Results: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate among reproductive women was 90.3% (95% CI 89.2C91.3%), which was significantly higher than influenza vaccine acceptance rate (85.5%, 95% CI: 84.2C86.7%).

Three patients were not using any topical steroid treatment at the time of diagnosis of graft rejection. The mean duration between vaccination and onset of symptoms was 16.86  6.96 days for the mRNA vaccine and 17  11.89 days for the adenovirus vector vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal graft rejection has recently been reported after COVID-19 vaccination. Patients with keratoplasty need to be advised regarding the risk of corneal graft rejection and warning symptoms of rejection after COVID-19 vaccination. Seeking early referral to the emergency department and increasing topical steroids pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 vaccination may reduce the risk of rejection.","output":"Five Cases of Corneal Graft Rejection After Recent COVID-19 Vaccinations and a Review of the Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Society has been increasingly concerned about the impact of pain on farm animal welfare. This systematic review aims to provide evidence relating to the measurement properties (i.e. reliability, validity, and sensitivity) of pain scoring instruments used for pain assessment in farm animals. A literature search will be performed using five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CAB abstracts and Biological Abstracts) and search terms related to pain, pain scales and different species of farm animals. Eligibility criteria will include full-text studies on the development and/or validation of acute and chronic pain scoring instruments for farm animals including bovine (beef and dairy), ovine, caprine, camel, swine and poultry. Exclusion criteria will include studies that report the use of pain scales for the validation of another instrument, or those reporting ethograms/list of behaviors potentially indicating pain without a scoring system. Study titles and their abstracts will be screened for eligibility by one investigator. Full-text articles will be independently reviewed for eligibility and evaluated by two investigators. Relevant information will be recorded and evaluated systematically according to the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist using an adapted data collection sheet. The following measurement properties and characteristics of the instruments will be assessed: content validity (internal consistency, structural and cross-cultural validity), reliability, measurement error, criterion and construct validity, responsiveness, interpretability and feasibility. Following the assessment of methodological quality and quality of the findings, evidence for each measurement property will be summarized into high, moderate, low or very low. This systematic review will provide further insights into the evidence-based measurement properties of pain scoring instruments in farm animals.

After this declaration countries swiftly implemented a variety of health policies. In this work we examine how rapid countries responded to this pandemic using two events: the day in which the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and first day in which countries used school closure as one of the measures to avoid outbreaks. We also assessed how countries' health systems, globalization, economic development, political systems, and economic integration to China, Republic of Korea and Italy increased the speed of adoption. METHODS: We compiled information from multiple sources, from December 31st 2019 to June 1st 2020, to trace when 172 countries reported their first COVID-19 case and implemented school closure to contain outbreaks. We applied cross-national Weibull survival analysis to evaluate the global speed of detection of first COVID-19 reported cases and school closure. RESULTS: Ten days after WHO declared COVID-19 to be an international emergency, relative to seven days from this declaration, countries were 28 (95% CI: 12-77) times more likely to report first COVID-19 cases and 42 (95% CI: 22-90) times more likely to close schools. One standard deviation increase in the epidemic security index rises the rate of report first cases by 37% (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% CI: 1.09-1.72) and delays the adoption for school closures by 36% (HR 0.64 (95% CI:0.50-0.82). One standard deviation increase in the globalization index augments the adoption for school closures by 74% (HR 1.74 (95% CI:1.34-2.24). CONCLUSION: After the WHO declared a global emergency, countries were unprecedently acting very rapidly. While countries more globally integrated were swifter in closing schools, countries with better designed health systems to tackle epidemics were slower in adopting it. More studies are needed to assess how the speed of school closures and other policies will affect the development of the pandemic.","output":"The global viralization of policies to contain the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic: Analyses of school closures and first reported cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To Evaluate the effect of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines developed for the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) on ovarian reserve. METHODS: This prospective cross sectional study was carried out between June and September 2021, in the Gynecology Polyclinics of a tertiary hospital, Ankara, Turkey, with 60 patients. Patients between the ages of 25-30 years old, who applied to the gynecology outpatient clinic and who were considering mRNA vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were included in the study group, and those who did not plan to be vaccinated were included in the control group. Anti-mllerian hormone (AMH) was examined before vaccination (1-5 days before vaccination) and within 60-90 days after vaccination. In the unvaccinated group, AMH was examined once. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group was 27.301.66 and of the control group was 27.401.69 (p<0.05). Post-vaccine AMH values of the study and control groups were similar (p>0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between pre-vaccine and post-vaccine AMH values in the study group (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: It is of great value that people who are planning pregnancy and who have hesitation regarding the effect of vaccines on ovarian reserve should be carefully informed that vaccines, which are one of the most important means of fighting against COVID-19 infection, have no effect on AMH levels.

The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is generally used to decrease these complications, but some patients do not respond to clopidogrel and have a higher risk of stent thrombosis. In cardiology, clinical trials have shown that prasugrel reduced the incidence of ischaemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome compared with clopidogrel but, according to several authors, prasugrel would produce an increased risk of cerebral haemorrhagic complications. Objective The purpose of this study was to determine whether prasugrel would be more effective than clopidogrel in reducing procedural events in patients with an unruptured aneurysm treated endovascularly with coils and stent. Materials and methods Two hundred consecutive patients with intracranial aneurysms were treated using coiling and stenting procedures. The first 100 patients were administered a dual antiplatelet of aspirin and clopidogrel, while the remaining 100 patients were administered a dual antiplatelet of aspirin and prasugrel. In each group data were collected on procedural and periprocedural haemorrhagic and ischaemic complications. Results Aneurysmal occlusion and haemorrhagic complications rates were identical in both groups. The number of thromboembolic events observed in the two groups of our study did not differ significantly, but the prasugrel group included more wide-neck aneurysms and more flow-diverted stents. Moreover, complications in the prasugrel group were more benign, explaining the significant difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups on Day 30.

However, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation remain poorly characterized. To dissect the function of HBc, a yeast two-hybrid was performed to identify HBc-binding proteins, and the C-terminal of BRG1/hBRM-associated factors 200 (BAF200C) was identified. Then, the existence of HBc interactions with BAF200C and full-length BAF200 was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293T, HepG2 and HepG2-NTCP cells. Furthermore, we show that the binding between HBc and BAF200 was of vital importance to HBc mediated downregulation of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) expression, and the mechanisms for the downregulation were disclosed as follows. Basal level of IFITM1 expression depends on BAF200, rather than the JAKCSTAT1 pathway. The interaction of HBc with BAF200 disturbs the stability of the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex and results in the suppression of IFTM1 transcription. Finally, the antiviral effects of IFITM1 on cell proliferation and HBV replication were found to be partially restored when HBc was co-transfected with BAF200.

Carbon dioxide removal is possible with substantially less extracorporeal blood flow than needed for oxygenation. Techniques for extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal include (1) pumpless arterio-venous circuits, (2) low-flow venovenous circuits based on the technology of continuous renal replacement therapy, and (3) venovenous circuits based on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation technology. INDICATIONS Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has been shown to enable more protective ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, even beyond the so-called \\"protective\\" level. Although experimental data suggest a benefit on ventilator induced lung injury, no hard clinical evidence with respect to improved outcome exists. In addition, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is a tool to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease failing non-invasive ventilation. This concept has been shown to be effective in 56-90% of patients. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has also been used in ventilated patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure to correct acidosis, unload respiratory muscle burden, and facilitate weaning. In patients suffering from terminal fibrosis awaiting lung transplantation, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is able to correct acidosis and enable spontaneous breathing during bridging. Keeping these patients awake, ambulatory, and breathing spontaneously is associated with favorable outcome. COMPLICATIONS Complications of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal are mostly associated with vascular access and deranged hemostasis leading to bleeding. Although the spectrum of complications may differ, no technology offers advantages with respect to rate and severity of complications.

The purpose of this study was to detect fungal pathogens causing keratitis on direct smear by smartphone-mounted FS and to evaluate the efficacy of FS against routine compound light microscope (CLM). METHODS: The prospective study was conducted at a tertiary eye care center from September 2019 to March 2020. The study included 60 smear examinations (Gram stain [GM] n = 30, Lactophenol Cotton Blue [LCB] n = 30) to detect fungal pathogens from corneal scraping material of clinically suspected fungal keratitis (FK) cases. The diagnostic utility of FS was compared with CLM for both GM and LCB wet mount. Data collected were used to quantify the agreement using Cohens kappa between CLM and FS imaging. RESULTS: Forty-six samples out of 60 were positive for fungi using CLM. GM stain and LCB showed 22/30 (73.33%) and 24/30 (80%) positive results with CLM, respectively. Moderate agreement (0.49) was observed between CLM and FS with the smartphone method. LCB mount showed high specificity of 1.00 over 0.87 of GM stain for FS with the smartphone. CONCLUSION: Direct smear can be an early and sensitive measure to diagnose FK other than clinical suspicion. The smartphone-mounted FS has limited sensitivity as an alternative to CLM, but excellent specificity in the present study for FK.

In this article, we present a case report with a systematic review of literature of patients undergoing major pancreatic surgery with associated PAP. We also intend to discuss and suggest possible surgical strategies to minimise major postoperative complications. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the terms circumportal, periportal, pancreas, annular pancreas, portal annular pancreas and pancreas anomaly. All articles describing portal annular pancreas with surgical resection were included. RESULTS: We identified a total of 53 patients of PAP from 29 articles, who underwent pancreatic resection with a median age of 65 years. POPF (postoperative pancreatic fistula) was demonstrated in 42.55% of patients and 34% had CR (clinically relevant)-POPF. Following pancreaticoduodenectomy, pancreatic stump was reconstructed in all patients with either pancreaticojejunostomy or pancreaticogastrostomy. Standard line of pancreatic transection, i.e., division of anteportal portion at the pancreatic neck and stapling of the retroportal process, resulted in 71% incidence of CR-POPF, whereas it was only 16% when extended resection was performed to achieve single pancreatic stump and 12.5% when retroportal portion was sutured or ligated. Amongst distal pancreatic resections, 66% had POPF and 33% developed CR-POPF. CONCLUSION: It is of utmost importance for pancreatic surgeons to diligently look for and identify PAP in the preoperative imaging. Additional imaging in the form of MRCP helps to define abnormal pancreatic ductal anatomy. Surgeons need to be cognisant of pancreatic stump management in patients with PAP to reduce associated higher rates of POPF.","output":"Portal Annular Pancreas (PAP): an Underestimated Devil in Pancreatic SurgerySystematic Review of Literature and Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In many Western countries, the state pension age is being raised to stimulate the extension of working lives.

This study provides data on the long-term durability of video-based telemedicine visits and their impact on urgent and non-urgent healthcare delivery from one large health system in New York City. Materials and Methods: Electronic health record (EHR) data of patients between January 1st, 2020 and November 30th, 2021 were used to conduct the analyses and longitudinal comparisons of telemedicine or in-person visit volumes. Patient diagnosis data were used to differentiate COVID-19 suspected visits from non-COVID-19 ones while comparing the visit types. Results: While COVID-19 prompted an increase in telemedicine visits and a simultaneous decline in in-person clinic visits, telemedicine use has stabilized since then for both COVID-19 and non-COVID suspected visits. For COVID-19 suspected visits, utilization of virtual urgent care facilities is higher than the trend. The data further suggests that virtual healthcare delivery supplements, rather than replaces, in-person care. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the use of telemedicine as a means of healthcare delivery, and the data presented here suggests that this is an enduring transformation. Conclusion: Telemedicine use increased with the surge of infection cases during the pandemic, but evidence suggests that it will persist after the pandemic, especially for younger patients, for both urgent and non-urgent care. These findings have implications for the healthcare delivery system, insurers and policymakers.","output":"Is virtual care the new normal?

In an ageing society, Sweden's end-of-life (EoL) care is increasingly professionalised and specialised, but there is little community involvement. One goal of Studio D?Bra was therefore to support community engagement with EoL-related topics. Another goal was to create opportunities for interaction between children and older adults as there are few intergenerational meeting places. Two iterations of Studio D?Bra were developed (2016, 2018) in different Swedish cities, utilising a community-based participatory research approach. Project groups comprised first author MK and representatives of community organisations such as meeting places for older adults, after-school centres and artistic organisations. Each iteration engaged eight children and eight older adults in a series of five workshops. This article investigates how children and older adults motivate their participation, their experiences of participating and ways in which they were affected by participation. We also investigate how parents reflect on their child's participation in Studio D?Bra. Older adults, children and their parents were interviewed after each Studio D?Bra. An inductive qualitative process guided by interpretive description was used to analyse the transcripts. Findings indicate that participants acted as individuals with agency in connecting across generations and in creating spaces for engaging with EoL-topics, not only in Studio D?Bra but also in their social networks. Participants reflected on a changing sense of community through new intergenerational connections and social activities, and expressed a desire to maintain these. However, participants indicated sustainability challenges related to lacking agency in maintaining these spaces and sense of intergenerational community, as they rely on support from community organisations.","output":"Death, loss and community-Perspectives from children, their parents and older adults on intergenerational community-based arts initiatives in Sweden."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients develop IgG antibodies within 2-3 weeks after symptom onset. Antibody levels have been shown to gradually decrease in the first months after infection, but few data are available at six months or later. METHODS: A retrospective multi-center study was performed using 652 samples of 236 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from 2 Belgian University hospitals. Patients were included if at least two samples were available (range 2-7 samples); including at least one sample collected 30 days or later after first positive PCR (range 0-240 days). Of those 236 patients, 19.1% were classified as mild/asymptomatic (mild) and 80.9% as moderate to critical (severe). IgG anti-nucleocapsid antibodies (anti-N) were measured using the Abbott Architect immunoassay. RESULTS: 22.2% of mild and 2.6% of severe COVID-19 cases never seroconverted (p < 0.001). Of the mild patients who seroconverted 0-59 days after PCR; 18.8%, 40.0% and 61.1% were seronegative in the windows 60-119 days, 120-179 days and 180-240 days after PCR, respectively. In severe patients, these numbers were 1.9%, 10.8% and 29.4% respectively (p < 0.05 each). Antibody levels were significantly higher in severe patients compared to mild patients in each 60 day window (p < 0.001 each). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG antibody levels steadily decreased after 2 months up to 8 months post PCR. Of severe COVID-19 patients, 70.6% remained positive up to eight months after infection.

An average of 18.6 Gb (14.8 to 25.7 Gb) of raw Illumina paired end sequence data was generated, cleaned, trimmed and mapped against reference sequence databases for bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes. An average of 106,839 (0.06%) reads were assigned to resistance genes with genes encoding resistance to tetracycline, macrolide and beta-lactam resistance genes as the most abundant in all samples. We found significantly higher abundance and diversity of genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, including critical important resistance (e.g. bla(CTX-M)) carried on airplanes from South Asia compared to North America. Presence of Salmonella enterica and norovirus were also detected in higher amounts from South Asia, whereas Clostridium difficile was most abundant in samples from North America.

Understanding the basis for severity remains crucial for better management and therapy development. So far, older age, associated-comorbidities, and IL-6 have been associated with severity/mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: As a primary step, we analyzed the frequency and functional profile of innate immune cells (NK cells/dendritic cells/monocytes) and adaptive immunity-driving lymphocytes (B cells/T cells/follicular T helper cells) by flow cytometry. Sixty cases of SARS CoV-2 infection (25 severe, 35 mild) and ten healthy subjects without SARS CoV-2 IgG were included. Disease-duration based analysis of immune profile was explored for early events differentiating the two disease forms. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by PRNT. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Disease severity was found to be associated with impaired maturation of mDCs and hyperactivation of NK, follicular T helper cells, and CD8 T cells. Lower IL-21 receptor expression on memory B cells indicated an imbalance in IL-21/IL-21 R ratio. Lower BCMA positive plasmablast cells in severe cases did suggest a probable absence of long-term humoral immunity. Multivariate analysis revealed a progressive association of PD-1+CD4 T cells with PRNT50 titers. Thus, in addition to identifying probable prognostic markers for severity, our study emphasizes the definite need for in-depth viral antigen-specific functional analyses in a larger patient cohort and with multiple sampling.","output":"Disease-duration based comparison of subsets of immune cells in SARS CoV-2 infected patients presenting with mild or severe symptoms identifies prognostic markers for severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Crowd counting is a fundamental yet challenging problem, which desires rich information to generate pixel-wise crowd density maps. However, most previous methods only utilized the limited information of RGB images and may fail to discover the potential pedestrians in unconstrained environments. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people. Furthermore, to facilitate the multimodal crowd counting, we propose a cross-modal collaborative representation learning framework, which consists of multiple modality-specific branches, a modality-shared branch, and an Information Aggregation-Distribution Module (IADM) to fully capture the complementary information of different modalities. Specifically, our IADM incorporates two collaborative information transfer components to dynamically enhance the modality-shared and modality-specific representations with a dual information propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for RGBT crowd counting. Moreover, the proposed approach is universal for multimodal crowd counting and is also capable to achieve superior performance on the ShanghaiTechRGBD dataset.","output":"Cross-Modal Collaborative Representation Learning and a Large-Scale RGBT Benchmark for Crowd Counting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has made abundantly clear how far our school systems are from being crisis-ready.

The relative role of restrictions on behaviour (lockdowns) and of a natural slowing for other reasons is difficult to asses when mass testing was not widely done. This paper assesses the evolution of the spread of the COVID 19 virus over this period when there was not data on test results for a large, random sample of the population. METHOD: We estimate a version of the SIR model applied to data on the numbers who were tested positive in several countries over the period when the virus spread very fast and then its spread slowed sharply. Up to the end of April 2020 test data came from non random samples of populations who were overwhelmingly those who displayed symptoms. Using data from a period when the criteria used for testing (which was that people had clear symptoms) was relatively consistent is important in drawing out the message from test results. We use this data to assess two things: how large might be the group of those infected who were not recorded; how effective were lockdown measures in slowing the spread of the infection. RESULTS: We find that to match data on daily new cases of the virus, the estimated model favours high values for the number of people infected but not recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the infection may have spread far enough in many countries by April 2020 to have been a significant factor behind the fall in measured new cases.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of the secondary data of reported adverse events following COVID-19 immunization that presented with neurologic manifestations. Between March 1 and July 31, 2021, we collected and analyzed the medical records of 221 patients diagnosed with stroke-like symptoms following immunization. Demographic and medical data included sex, age, vaccine type, sequence dose, time to event, laboratory data, and recovery status as defined by the modified Rankin score (i.e., defining the degree of severity/dependence, with higher scores indicating greater disability). The affected side was evaluated for associations with the injection site. Results: In total, 221 patients were diagnosed with immunization stress-related responses (stroke-like symptoms) following CoronaVac (Sinovac) or ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) vaccinations. Most patients (83.7%) were women. The median (interquartile range) age of onset was 34 (28-42) years in patients receiving CoronaVac and 46 (33.5-60) years in those receiving ChAdOx1. The median interval between vaccination and symptom onset for each vaccine type was 60 (16-960) min and 30 (8.8-750) min, respectively. Sensory symptoms were the most common symptomology.

Despite a potentially higher risk of pregnant women acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the non-pregnant population (particularly in some ethnic minorities), no additional specific recommendations to avoid exposure are needed in pregnancy. The most common clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are fever, cough, lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the non-pregnant population, including pneumonia, admission to the intensive care unit and death, even after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes. The risk of miscarriage does not appear to be increased in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence with regards to preterm birth and perinatal mortality is conflicting, but these risks are generally higher only in symptomatic, hospitalized women. The risk of vertical transmission, defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the fetus or the newborn, is generally low. Fetal invasive procedures are considered to be generally safe in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the evidence is still limited. In pregnant women with COVID-19, use of steroids should not be avoided if clinically indicated; the preferred regimen is a 2-day course of dexamethasone followed by an 8-day course of methylprednisolone. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used if there are no contraindications. Hospitalized pregnant women with severe COVID-19 should undergo thromboprophylaxis throughout the duration of hospitalization and at least until discharge, preferably with low molecular weight heparin. Hospitalized women who have recovered from a period of serious or critical illness with COVID-19 should be offered a fetal growth scan about 14 days after recovery from their illness. In asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic women who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at full term (i.e. &#8805; 39 weeks of gestation), induction of labor might be reasonable. To date, there is no clear consensus on the optimal timing of delivery for critically ill women. In women with no or few symptoms, management of labor should follow routine evidence-based guidelines. Regardless of COVID-19 status, mothers and their infants should remain together and breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, kangaroo mother care and rooming-in throughout the day and night should be practiced, while applying necessary infection prevention and control measures. Many pregnant women have already undergone vaccination, mostly in the USA where the first reports show no significant difference in pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during pregnancy compared with the background risk. Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in the umbilical cord blood and breast milk samples of pregnant and lactating women who received the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Camostat mesylate, an orally available well-known serine protease inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and has been hypothesized as a potential antiviral drug against COVID-19. In vitro human cell and animal studies have shown that camostat mesylate inhibits virus-cell membrane fusion and hence viral replication. In mice, camostat mesylate treatment during acute infection with influenza, also dependent on TMPRSS2, leads to a reduced viral load.

Gene amplification, a common adaptive mechanism in prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes, has also contributed to viral evolution, especially of large DNA viruses. In experimental systems, gene amplification is one mechanism for rapidly overcoming selective pressures. Because the amplification generally incurs a fitness cost, emergence of adaptive point mutations within the amplified locus or elsewhere in the genome can enable collapse of the locus back to a single copy. Evidence of gene amplification followed by subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization of the copies is apparent by the presence of families of paralogous genes in many DNA viruses. These observations suggest that copy number variation has contributed broadly to virus evolution.","output":"Adaptation by copy number variation in monopartite viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nelumbo nucifera is one of the most valuable medicinal species of the Nelumbonaceae family that has been consumed since the ancient historic period. Its stamen is an indispensable ingredient for many recipes of traditional medicines, and has been proved as a rich source of flavonoids that may provide an antiaging action for pharmaceutical or medicinal applications. However, there is no intense study on antiaging potential and molecular mechanisms. This present study was designed to fill in this important research gap by: (1) investigating the effects of sacred lotus stamen extract (LSE) on yeast lifespan extension; and (2) determining their effects on oxidative stress and metabolism to understand the potential antiaging action of its flavonoids. A validated ultrasound-assisted extraction method was also employed in this current work. The results confirmed that LSE is rich in flavonoids, and myricetin-3-O-glucose, quercetin-3-O-glucuronic acid, kaempferol-3-O-glucuronic acid, and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucose are the most abundant ones. In addition, LSE offers a high antioxidant capacity, as evidenced by different in vitro antioxidant assays. This present study also indicated that LSE delayed yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild-type strain DBY746) chronological aging compared with untreated control yeast and a positive control (resveratrol) cells. Moreover, LSE acted on central metabolism, gene expressions (SIR2 and SOD2), and enzyme regulation (SIRT and SOD enzymatic activities).

Besides respiratory failure, systemic thromboembolic complications are frequent in COVID-19 patients and suggested to be the result of a dysregulation of the hemostatic balance. Although several markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis have been studied extensively, little is known about the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the potent antifibrinolytic enzyme carboxypeptidase U (CPU). Blood was collected longitudinally from 56 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 32 healthy controls. Procarboxypeptidase U (proCPU) levels and total active and inactivated CPU (CPU+CPUi) antigen levels were measured. At study inclusion (shortly after hospital admission), proCPU levels were significantly lower and CPU+CPUi antigen levels significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Both proCPU and CPU+CPUi antigen levels showed a subsequent progressive increase in these patients. Hereafter, proCPU levels decreased and patients were, at discharge, comparable to the controls. CPU+CPUi antigen levels at discharge were still higher compared to controls. Baseline CPU+CPUi antigen levels (shortly after hospital admission) correlated with disease severity and the duration of hospitalization. In conclusion, CPU generation with concomitant proCPU consumption during early SARS-CoV-2 infection will (at least partly) contribute to the hypofibrinolytic state observed in COVID-19 patients, thus enlarging their risk for thrombosis. Moreover, given the association between CPU+CPUi antigen levels and both disease severity and duration of hospitalization, this parameter may be a potential biomarker with prognostic value in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Activation of the Carboxypeptidase U (CPU, TAFIa, CPB2) System in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Could Contribute to COVID-19 Hypofibrinolytic State and Disease Severity Prognosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) possess mutations that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies within the Spike protein and are associated with breakthrough infection and reinfection.

Kidney allocation system allows blood type B candidates accept kidneys from A2/A2B donors. There is no mandate by UNOS on which the anti-A2 level is acceptable. We aimed to investigate the safety of kidney transplant in blood group B patients with anti-A2 titers 16. METHODS. We performed 41 A2-incompatible kidney transplants in blood group B recipients between May 2015 and September 2019. Clinical outcomes were compared with a control group of 75 blood group B recipients who received blood group compatible kidney transplantation at the same period. RESULTS. Of the 41 recipients, 85% were male, 48% African American, with a median age of 53 (20C73) y. Thirty-eight (93%) were deceased-donor and 3 (7%) were living-donor kidney transplant recipients. Pretransplant anti-A2 IgG titers were 2 in 16, 4 in 9, 8 in 6, and 16 in 5 and too weak to titer in 5 recipients. Eight patients had pretransplant donor-specific antibodies. During a median follow-up of 32.6 mo (6C57.3) patient and graft survival were 100% and 92% in the A2-incompatible kidney transplant group, and 91% and 92% in the blood group compatible group, respectively. Twelve A2-incompatible recipients underwent a 21 clinically indicated kidney biopsies at a median 28 d (6C390) after transplantation. None of the patients developed acute antibody-mediated rejection and 2 patients (5%) had acute T-cellCmediated rejection. Interestingly, peritubular capillary C4d positivity was seen in 7 biopsies which did not have any findings of acute rejection or microvascular inflammation but not in any of the rejection-free biopsies in the control group. C4d positivity was persistent in 5 of those patients who had follow-up biopsies. CONCLUSIONS. A2-incompatible transplantation is safe in patients with anti-A2 titers 16 with excellent short-term kidney allograft outcomes.

With these techniques, we have identified several molecular features, namely, number of hydrating waters and intra-PASD hydrogen bonds, as moderately predictive of trafficking. Together with bioinformatics data including sequence conservation and folding energies, we are able to predict with reasonable accuracy (75%) the ability of VUS to traffic.

Several of the phenotype-associated archaic variants had links to regulatory effects as well. In general, analyses of allele-specific expression, regulatory sequence composition and cis-eQTL have demonstrated a significant contribution of this introgressed DNA to the transcriptomic landscape in people today.

Here we used blood eQTL results from >30,000 individuals from eQTLGen Consortium. The cohort size allowed for a robust identification of trans-eQTLs and in addition enabled quantifying the role of transcription factors (TF) in mediating long-range regulatory effects. In our study we used this information to (i) annotate trans-eQTLs that are linked to Neandertal variants and (ii) predict long-range regulatory effects that are induced by Neandertal DNA by screening for the predicted target genes of TFs that are cis-eQTLs linked to Neandertal variants. We show that both trans-eQTL-associated Neandertal variants and those predicted to have long-range regulatory effects affect genes in genomic regions devoid of Neandertal DNA. In addition, both types of variants included candidates for local adaptation and show associations with autoimmune disorders, a severe Covid-19 phenotype, blood cell type composition and anthropometric measures.

Methods Linked pseudonymised records for asymptomatic residents in Liverpool who received a LFT for COVID-19 between 6th November 2020 to 31st January 2021 were accessed using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. Bayesian Hierarchical Poisson Besag, York, and Molli models were used to estimate ecological associations for uptake and positivity of testing. Findings 214 525 residents (43%) received a LFT identifying 5192 individuals as positive cases of COVID-19 (1.3% of tests were positive). Uptake was highest in November when there was military assistance. High uptake was observed again in the week preceding Christmas and was sustained into a national lockdown. Overall uptake were lower among males (e.g. 40% uptake over the whole period), Black Asian and other Minority Ethnic groups (e.g. 27% uptake for Mixed ethnicity) and in the most deprived areas (e.g. 32% uptake in most deprived areas). These population groups were also more likely to have received positive tests for COVID-19. Models demonstrated that uptake and repeat testing were lower in areas of higher deprivation, areas located further from test sites and areas containing populations less confident in the using Internet technologies. Positive tests were spatially clustered in deprived areas. Interpretation Large-scale voluntary asymptomatic community testing saw social, ethnic, digital and spatial inequalities in uptake.

DESIGN Difference-in-difference analysis. METHODS At 20 public sector facilities in Zimbabwe, 10 implemented near-POC VL testing at ANC1 (August 2019-November 2020) and 10 used centralized VL testing at ANC1. Study endpoints included time to result received, clinical action, and unsuppressed VL (UVL; >1000copies/mL) at delivery. RESULTS Of 1782 women, only 46% came for ANC1 before their third trimester. Pre-implementation, 28% of women received VL testing at ANC1, increasing to 86% during implementation. In the near-POC VL arm, women were more likely to receive their result within 30 days of ANC1 sample collection compared with the centralized laboratory arm (54% versus 14%, RR: 4.17, 95% CI: 1.82-9.55), as well as receive clinical action among those with UVL (63% versus 8%, RR: 7.88; 95% CI: 1.53-40.47). However, we did not observe significant changes in risk of UVL at delivery with near-POC VL (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.95-1.10). CONCLUSIONS ANC1 VL coverage was initially low. Near-POC VL testing at ANC dramatically improved the timeliness of result receipt by patients and clinical action for those with an UVL at ANC1. Although we did not observe a significant impact of provision of near-POC VL at ANC1 on re-suppression at delivery, potentially due to late presentation for ANC1, continued near-POC VL testing during pregnancy and delivery may reduce UVL and MTCT risk.","output":"Near-POC VL testing during pregnancy and viremia at delivery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disruption of conventional manufacturing, supply, and distribution channels for medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread shortages and catalyzed local efforts to use nontraditional, rapid manufacturing to meet urgent healthcare needs.

Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","output":"A high-throughput drug screening strategy against coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enterovirus genus has over one hundred genotypes and could cause several kinds of severe animal and human diseases.

However, these interventions increase the risk of respiratory infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). VAP constitutes a serious burden for the healthcare system and worsens the patient's outcomes; thus, several preventive strategies have been implemented. This communication reviews the current knowledge on VAP pathogenesis and the latest preventive measures. RECENT FINDINGS Pathogen-laden oropharyngeal secretions leak across the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff; thus, a continuous control of the internal cuff pressure and cuffs made of polyurethane improve sealing effectiveness and associated risks of infections. Subglottic secretions aspiration prevents VAP, and the latest evidence demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of late-onset VAP. The role of ETT biofilm in the pathogenesis of VAP is not fully elucidated. Nevertheless, antimicrobial-coated ETTs have showed beneficial effects in VAP incidence. Recent experimental evidence has challenged the benefits associated with the use of the semirecumbent position; yet, these findings need to be corroborated in clinical trials. The latest results from trials testing the effects of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) showed beneficial effects on patients' outcomes, but concerns remain regarding the emergence of bacterial resistance, specifically upon digestive tract re-colonization. The use of oropharyngeal decontamination with antiseptics and the use of probiotics are potential alternatives to SDD.

STATE OF THE ART: Inherited WMD are a group of disorders often seen in childhood. In adulthood, progressive WMDs are rare, apart from the common nonspecific causes of hypertension and other cerebrovascular diseases. The pattern of WMDs on neuroimaging can be an important clue to the final diagnosis. Due to the adoption of a combined clinical-imaging-laboratory approach, WMD is becoming better recognised, in addition to the rapidly evolving field of genomics in this area. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: While paediatric WMDs have a well-defined and literature-based clinical-laboratory approach to diagnosis, adult-onset WMDs remain an important, pathologically diverse, radiographic phenotype, with different and distinct neuropathologies among the various subtypes of WMD. Adult-onset WMDs comprise a wide collection of both acquired and inherited aetiologies. While severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neurological complications are emerging, we are as yet unaware of it causing WMD outside of post-anoxic changes. It is important to recognise WMD as a potentially undefined acquired or genetic syndrome, even when extensive full genome testing reveals variants of unknown significance. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: We propose a combined clinical-imaging-laboratory approach to WMD and continued exploration of acquired and genetic factors. Adult-onset WMD, even given this approach, can be challenging because hypertension is often comorbid. Therefore, we propose that undiagnosed patients with WMD be entered into multicentre National Organisation for Rare Diseases registries to help researchers worldwide make new discoveries that will hopefully translate into future cures.","output":"A practical approach to adult-onset white matter diseases, with illustrative cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fabrication of heterostructures by merging two or more materials in a single object. The domains at the nanoscale represent a viable strategy to purposely address materials' properties for applications in several fields such as catalysis, biomedicine, and energy conversion. In this case, solution-phase seeded growth and the hot-injection method are ingeniously combined to fabricate TiO2/PbS heterostructures. The interest in such hybrid nanostructures arises from their absorption properties that make them advantageous candidates as solar cell materials for more efficient solar light harvesting and improved light conversion. Due to the strong lattice mismatch between TiO2 and PbS, the yield of the hybrid structure and the control over its properties are challenging. In this study, a systematic investigation of the heterostructure synthesis as a function of the experimental conditions (such as seeds' surface chemistry, reaction temperature, and precursor concentration), its topology, structural properties, and optical properties are carried out. The morphological and chemical characterizations confirm the formation of small dots of PbS by decorating the oleylamine surface capped TiO2 nanocrystals under temperature control. Remarkably, structural characterization points out that the formation of heterostructures is accompanied by modification of the crystallinity of the TiO2 domain, which is mainly ascribed to lattice distortion. This result is also confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which shows intense emission in the visible range.

METHODS The consensus guideline was introduced in clinical practice on 1 April 2019. It incorporated a modified SRC algorithm, enhanced in-hospital surveillance, ongoing quality assurance, standardised staff training and parent education. The main outcome measure was antibiotic usage/1000 live births, balancing this with analysis of harm from delayed diagnosis and treatment, disease severity and readmissions from true sepsis.

Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) add the patient perspective to evaluating treatment toxicity related to new technology. The objective of this mixed-methods study was to develop and explore the content validity of a set of PRO items to evaluate acute pelvic toxicity to radiotherapy including online MRgRT. METHODS: A literature review and chart audit were conducted to identify symptomatic adverse events (AEs) to be selected from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) library and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) item library. To validate the content, the item set was applied in a prospective pilot cohort of patients referred for primary pelvic RT with curative intent. Patients reported symptoms weekly during RT (4C8 weeks) and the subsequent 4 weeks. Follow-up reports were collected at 8, 12, and 24 weeks after RT. To ensure symptom coverage clinician-reported toxicity and individual patient interviews were conducted. The symptomatic AEs were included in the final item set if 20% of patients reported them. RESULTS: Eighteen acute symptomatic AEs were selected for the initial item set. Forty patients (32 prostate cancer, 8 cervical cancer) were included in the pilot study. Patients with prostate cancer and those with cervical cancer both reported all 18 acute AEs. However, vomiting was not reported by > 20% of patients thus excluded from the item set. Adding a few diagnosis-specific AEs to the final item set was required for both prostate and cervical cancer patients.

Clinical data mining analysis and association rule analysis were employed for mining the high-frequency herbal pairs and groups from formulae. Network pharmacology methods were applied to initially explore the most critical pair's hub targets, active ingredients, and potential mechanisms. The binding power of active ingredients to the hub targets was verified by molecular docking. RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-two prescriptions were obtained from 320 moderate COVID-19 through the Hunan Provincial Health Commission.

As regional and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, families, and children grapple with the immediate public health impact of COVID-19, the rights and well-being of children, especially those who are already marginalized, have been overlooked. Those working with children have likely encountered unprecedented challenges and responded in innovative ways in efforts to address the needs and rights of all children. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol for a large-scale, multinational study using a new smartphone app to capture the real-time experiences and perspectives of practitioners and policymakers supporting children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe in relation to a children's human rights 4P framework of protection, provision, prevention, and participation. METHODS: This protocol describes a mixed methods survey utilizing a custom-built iOS and Android smartphone app called the COVID 4P Log for Children's Wellbeing, which was developed in close consultation with 17 international key partner organizations. Practitioners and policymakers working with and for children's well-being across 29 countries and 5 continents were invited to download the app and respond to questions over the course of 8 weeks. The anticipated large amount of qualitative and quantitative response data will be analyzed using content analysis, descriptive statistics, and word frequencies. RESULTS: Formal data collection took place from October 2020 until March 2021. Data analysis was completed in July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will directly inform the understanding of the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted practitioners', managers', and policymakers' efforts to support children's well-being in their practices, services, and policies, respectively.

Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A matched case-control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender, and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular disease symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square test, t-test, Fisher's exact test and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms and the level of stress were significantly higher among cases (59%; 71.6%; 73.7%, respectively) than among controls (25.6%; 31.1%; 43.3%, respectively). Chi-square and t-test showed significant associations and differences between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.","output":"Mental Health Outcomes of Adults with Comorbidity and Chronic Diseases during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Matched Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To identify characteristics that predict 30-day mortality among patients critically ill with coronavirus disease 2019 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 6,027 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, PaO2/FIO2 ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex, sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.","output":"Prognostic Factors for 30-Day Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: An Observational Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of MSC exosomes with hyaluronic acid (HA) against HA alone for functional cartilage regeneration in a rabbit osteochondral defect model. METHODS Critical-size osteochondral defects (4.5-mm diameter and 1.5-mm depth) were created on the trochlear grooves in the knees of eighteen rabbits and were randomly allocated to two treatment groups: (1) Exosomes and HA combination and (2) HA alone. Three 1-ml injections of either exosomes and HA or HA alone were administered intra-articularly immediately after surgery and thereafter at 7 and 14 days after surgery. At 6 and 12 weeks, gross evaluation, histological and immunohistochemical analysis, and scorings were performed. The functional biomechanical competence of the repaired cartilage was also evaluated. RESULTS Compared to defects treated with HA, defects treated with exosomes and HA showed significant improvements in macroscopic scores (P=0.032; P=0.001) and histological scores (P=0.005; P<0.001) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Defects treated with exosomes and HA also demonstrated improvements in mechanical properties compared to HA-treated defects, with significantly higher Young's moduli (P<0.05) and stiffness (P<0.05) at 6 and 12 weeks. By 12 weeks, the newly-repaired tissues in defects treated with exosomes and HA composed mainly of hyaline cartilage that are mechanically and structurally superior to that of HA-treated defects and demonstrated mechanical properties that approximated that of adjacent native cartilage (P>0.05). In contrast, HA-treated defects showed some repair at 6 weeks, but this was not sustained, as evidenced by significant deterioration of histological scores (P=0.002) and a plateau in mechanical properties from 6 to 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that the combination of MSC exosomes and HA administered at a clinically acceptable frequency of three intra-articular injections can promote sustained and functional cartilage repair in a rabbit post-traumatic cartilage defect model, when compared to HA alone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Human MSC exosomes and HA administered in combination promote functional cartilage repair, and may represent a promising cell-free therapy for cartilage repair in patients.","output":"Intra-articular injections of mesenchymal stem cell exosomes and hyaluronic acid improve structural and mechanical properties of repaired cartilage in a rabbit model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Health care professionals have elevated rates of burnout and compassion fatigue which are correlated with poorer quality of life and patient care, and inversely correlated with self-compassion. Primary studies have evaluated the extent to which mindfulness-based interventions increase self-compassion with contradictory findings. A meta-analytic review of the literature was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on self-compassion among health care professionals. METHODS: Twenty-eight treatment outcome studies were identified eligible for inclusion. Five cumulative effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models to evaluate differences of changes in self-compassion for treatment and control groups. Within and between group comparisons were evaluated. Sub-group and moderator analyses were conducted to explore potential moderating variables. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles (k = 29, N = 1020) were utilized in the pre-post-treatment meta-analysis. Fifteen samples (52%) included health care professionals and fourteen (48%) professional health care students. Results showed a moderate effect size between pre-post-treatment comparisons (g = .61, 95% CI = .47 to .76) for self-compassion and a strong effect size for pre-treatment to follow-up (g = .76, 95% CI = .41 to 1.12). The effect size comparing post-treatment versus post-control was moderate. One exploratory moderator analysis was significant, with stronger effects for interventions with a retreat component. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest mindfulness-based interventions improve self-compassion in health care professionals. Additionally, a variety of mindfulness-based programs may be useful for employees and trainees. Future studies with rigorous methodology evaluating effects on self-compassion and patient care from mindfulness-based interventions are warranted to extend findings and explore moderators.

Three different substrates were prepared: 100% BCI (BCI diet), 100% tifton (Cynodon spp.) hay (CTL diet), and 50% tifton hay +50% BCI (THB diet). Ruminal fermentation parameters of these diets were evaluated in in vitro gas production assays. In a 24-h incubation, increased values for total gas production, organic matter degradability, and methane production were observed for BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05), while neutral THB showed the highest value for neutral detergent fiber degradability (p < 0.05). Fermentation profile was evaluated in a 48-h assay: shorter lag time as well as increased gas production potential and fractional fermentation rate were observed for the BCId and THB as compared to CTL (p < 0.05).

In this study, we developed a novel recombinant Mycobacterium paragordonae expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) (rMpg-RBD-7) that is capable of eliciting RBD-specific immune responses in vaccinated mice. The potential use of rMpg-RBD-7 as a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infections was evaluated in in vivo using mouse models of two different modules, one for single-dose vaccination and the other for two-dose vaccination. In a single-dose vaccination model, we found that rMpg-RBD-7 versus a heat-killed strain could exert an enhanced cell-mediated immune (CMI) response, as well as a humoral immune response capable of neutralizing the RBD and ACE2 interaction. In a two-dose vaccination model, rMpg-RBD-7 in a two-dose vaccination could also exert a stronger CMI and humoral immune response to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections in pseudoviral or live virus infection systems, compared to single dose vaccinations of rMpg-RBD or two-dose RBD protein immunization. In conclusion, our data showed that rMpg-RBD-7 can lead to an enhanced CMI response and humoral immune responses in mice vaccinated with both single- or two-dose vaccination, highlighting its feasibility as a novel vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2.

Like many other previous natural disasters and terrorist attacks, the recent Covid-19 pandemic has placed an enormous stress on the world and its workforce. In many ways the pandemic revealed gaps in the quality and availability of mental health resources, and, by magnifying the intense demand, it also spurred innovation. Telemedicine and virtual trauma-related services became examples of ways in which evaluation, treatment and counselling services could be delivered directly and efficiently to people who were confined to their dwellings and hospital beds. For many, the workplace has been a source of stress but also a vital component of one's self-worth, day-to-day purpose, and a resource for wellness programs and brief counselling services, not to mention, at least in many countries like the United States, a source for health insurance. The employee assistance program (EAP) is an example of a workplace-counselling and triage service that has enormous potential to meet the growing needs of individuals both in 'normal' times and during disasters. By better understanding the EAP's current structure alongside the advent of new technologies, it may be possible to develop a new and improved EAP model to meet a changing global landscape. For EAP to succeed and ultimately be scalable in an increasingly competitive and value-conscious marketplace, its processes of care will first require a bottom-up review with meaningful outcomes data.

The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the NMES effectiveness to counteract the post-ICU impairment in physical function of COVID-19 patients. The specific aim of this manuscript is to describe the study design, protocol, content of interventions, primary and secondary outcomes and to discuss the clinical rehabilitation impact of the expected experimental results. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, single-blind trial will include 80 patients who had undergone mechanical or non-invasive ventilation following pneumonia-induced respiratory failure. Patients are randomized to a control group (routine physical therapy for 3 weeks) or a NMES group (routine physical therapy plus NMES of quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles for 3 weeks). The primary outcome is physical performance assessed through the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes include independence level, perceived fatigue, muscle strength, rectus femoris thickness, and walking performance. The SPBB and walking performance are assessed once (after the intervention), while all other outcomes are assessed twice (before and after the intervention). CONCLUSION: NMES is a simple and non-invasive technique for muscle strengthening that is usually well tolerated, does not produce adverse effects, requires no or little cooperation from patients and is quite inexpensive. Therefore, proving the effectiveness of NMES therapy for physical and muscle function in COVID-19 patients could support its systematic incorporation in post-ICU rehabilitation protocols of patients presenting with post-intensive care syndrome.","output":"Effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy on physical function in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Astragaloside IV(AS-IV), a saponin purified from Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.)

Clinical studies have shown that systemic reactions occur in up to 50% of vaccine recipients. Therefore, COVID-19 vaccination could affect anticoagulation control, potentially leading to an increased risk of thrombotic events and bleeding complications. Aims: To investigate whether the BNT162b2 vaccine affects anticoagulation control in outpatients using Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Methods: A case-crossover study was performed in a cohort of outpatient VKA users from four Dutch anticoagulation clinics who received a BNT162b2 vaccine. INR results and VKA dosages before the first vaccination, the reference period, were compared with those after the first and second vaccination. Results: A total of 3148 outpatient VKA users were included, with a mean age (standard deviation (SD)) of 86.7 (8.7) years, of whom 43.8% were male, 67.0% used acenocoumarol and 33.0% phenprocoumon. We observed a decrease of 8.9% of INRs within range in the standard intensity group (target INR 2.0-3.0). There was both an increased risk of supratherapeutic [OR=1.34 (95% CI 1.08-1.67)] and subtherapeutic levels [OR=1.40 (95% CI 1.08-1.83)] after first vaccination. In the high-intensity group (target INR 2.5-3.5), the risk of a supratherapeutic INR was 2.3 times higher after first vaccination [OR=2.29 (95% CI 1.22-4.28)] and 3.3 times higher after second vaccination [OR 3.25 (95% CI 1.06-9.97). Conclusion: BNT162b2 was associated with an immediate negative effect on anticoagulation control in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists, so it is advisable to monitor the INR short after vaccination, even in stable patients.

Furthermore, differences of patients treated with NIV between the first and second wave are explored. METHODS: Confirmed COVID-19 cases of claims data of the Local Health Care Funds with non-invasive and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in the spring and autumn pandemic period in 2020 were comparable analysed. RESULTS: Nationwide cohort of 17.023 cases (median/IQR age 71/61C80 years, 64% male) 7235 (42.5%) patients primarily received IMV without NIV, 4469 (26.3%) patients received NIV without subsequent intubation, and 3472 (20.4%) patients had NIV failure (NIV-F), defined by subsequent endotracheal intubation. The proportion of patients who received invasive MV decreased from 75% to 37% during the second period. Accordingly, the proportion of patients with NIV exclusively increased from 9% to 30%, and those failing NIV increased from 9% to 23%. Median length of hospital stay decreased from 26 to 21 days, and duration of MV decreased from 11.9 to 7.3 days. The NIV failure rate decreased from 49% to 43%.

Additionally, the mask generally has a more negative impact on those participants with better performance in the full-view condition. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement General Audience Summary: People working in security settings, such as passport control, are required to compare the picture of an ID card to the face of its bearer. This task is highly challenging even for people with years of experience. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, different governmental authorities require the use of face masks in public spaces. These masks cover the bottom part of the face, entailing a new challenge for face identification. The present study explored whether, how, and to what extent forensic face matching ability is impaired by face masks. Across two experiments, it was found that face masks decreased face matching performance. Additionally, although performance in a full-view condition was positively associated with the performance in a mask condition, high proficiency in the full-view condition did not always generalize to the mask condition. These results highlight the importance of using different conditions when evaluating face identification for personnel selection in applied scenarios.

In China, all schools were shut down and students were home quarantined to prevent disease spread; these steps could have potential negative effects on mental health of adolescents. This study aimed to examine changes in depression and anxiety among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic, and explore factors associated with depression and anxiety. Two survey administrations were conducted among Chinese adolescents between February 20 and February 27 and between April 11 and April 19, 2020, respectively. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale were used to assess depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, respectively. A total of 9554 and 3886 adolescents participated in the first and second surveys. During the initial survey, the prevalence of depression was 36.6% (95% CI: 35.6C37.6%) while the prevalence of anxiety was 19% (95% CI: 18.2C19.8%). Rates of depression and anxiety increased to 57.0% (95% CI: 55.4C58.6%) and 36.7% (95% CI: 35.2C38.2%), respectively, in the second survey. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that group membership in the second survey, female gender, senior secondary school enrollment, and concerns about entering a higher grade were positively associated with both depression and anxiety. Conversely, a sleep duration of 6 h/day, an exercise duration 30 min/day, having the same as typical or higher study efficiency during the COVID-19 outbreak, and living in provinces with 1000C9999 confirmed COVID-19 cases were negatively associated with depression and anxiety. In conclusion, compared to figures reported during the COVID-19 outbreak, the prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese adolescents significantly increased after the initial outbreak. Regular screening and appropriate interventions are urgently needed to reduce the risk for emotional disturbances among adolescents during and after the initial COVID-19 outbreaks.","output":"Depression, anxiety and associated factors among Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak: a comparison of two cross-sectional studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Observational studies suggest that low vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causality of the vitamin DCOVID-19 association. METHODS: We constructed a biologically plausible genetic instrument for serum vitamin D based on replicated genome-wide significant variants in genes related to vitamin D metabolism, and evaluated the validity of the genetic instrument in COVID-19 risk subgroups in the UK Biobank. We then performed two sample MR using publically available summary data for the association of the genetic instrument with serum vitamin D in the UK Biobank and with COVID-19 outcomes, including infection, severe respiratory infection, and hospitalization, in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We used the inverse-variance weighted MR method for all analyses. RESULTS: We found little to no evidence for an effect of genetically predicted serum vitamin D on susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio per standard deviation increase in genetically predicted serum vitamin D were: 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.18) for any COVID-19 infection vs. population controls, 1.05 (0.84C1.31) for hospitalized COVID-19 vs. population controls, 0.96 (0.64 to 1.43) for severe respiratory COVID-19 vs. population controls, 1.15 (0.99 to 1.35) for COVID-19 positive vs. COVID-19 negative and, 1.44 (0.75 to 2.78) for hospitalized COVID-19 vs. non-hospitalized COVID-19. Results were similar in analyses where the genetic instrument included all variants with genome-wide significant associations with serum vitamin D (i.e., including variants with no known relationship to vitamin D metabolism) and where the genetic instrument was for risk of vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that unconfounded, long-term differences in vitamin D status do not causally affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection. These findings are consistent with results of a recently published MR study and suggest that associations seen in observational studies may be driven by confounding. Future directions include extending this work to non-European ancestry populations and high-risk populations, for example persons with comorbid disease.

The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) is an epidemiological landmark in the study of allergic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To validate and assess the reproducibility of the ISAAC Written Atopic Eczema Questionnaire (WAEQ) for children aged between 6 and 7 years by telephone contact. METHODS: Observational study through interviews with guardians of children aged 6 to 7 years using the ISAAC atopic eczema module questionnaire in three different phases separated by 2 weeks: telephone interviews in the first and third contacts and in-person interviews under supervision in the second contact. Reproducibility was estimated using the Kappa index and validation using the sensitivity and specificity coefficients. RESULTS: Data from 88 children (32 from the atopic eczema group) were analyzed. Reproducibility showed almost perfect agreement for the questions Recurrent pruritic lesions and Lesions in typical locations (Kappa between 0.81C0.82), while a substantial agreement was observed for all other indicators (Kappa variation between 0.66 and 0.78).

One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. Although gamma-rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modelled the impact of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. We show that gamma-rays produce significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induce less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope is sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.","output":"Monte Carlo simulation of SARS-CoV-2 radiation-induced inactivation for vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are few studies investigating group sex among female sex workers (FSWs).

METHODS For each year of age, we estimated: HIV prevalence (Pt) and the change in HIV prevalence from the previous age (Pt-Pt-1). We then estimated the rate of new HIV infections during that year of age: It = Pt-Pt-1/(1-Pt-1), and calculated HIV incidence for 18-24 and 25-39 year-olds separately as the weighted average of It. We estimated HIV incidence for FSW 1-5 years and 6-15 years since first selling sex using the same approach, and compared HIV prevalence among FSW first selling sex at their current age with the general population. RESULTS Among 9,906 women, 50.2% were HIV positive. Based on HIV prevalence increases by age, we estimated an HIV incidence of 6.3/100 person-years at risk (pyar) (95%CI 5.3,7.6) among 18-24 year-olds, and 3.3/100 pyar (95% CI 1.3,4.2) among 25-39 year-olds.

Available mobile sanitizers and ultraviolet (UV) ray mediated mobile sanitization have their own sets of pros and cons, often being less user-friendly. This study explored the germicidal efficacy of an herbal-based sanitizer, Germi-X spray, on hands and mobiles, through microbiological techniques of micro-broth dilution and Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay, thumb print assay and swab test. Notably, Germi-X spray was found to be 6C67% more effective against surface pathogens, like, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as compared to a very popular product in the Indian market, which was taken as a control for this study. The observed anti-bacterial activity of the spray from disc-diffusion assay suggests its greater surface retentivity as compared to the control. Germicidal potency of Germi-X spray, when used to sanitize hands, was found to be greater than 80%. There was ~ 17-fold reduction in microbial counts after sanitizing smartphones with Germi-X spray. The novelty of this study lies in providing experimental evidence for this herbal-based surface sanitizer in efficiently disinfecting one of the super contaminated fomite, the smartphones.

These humanized monoclonal antibodies target inhibitory receptors (e.g. CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG-3, TIM-3) and ligands (PD-L1) expressed on T lymphocytes, antigen presenting cells and tumor cells and elicit an anti-tumor response by stimulating immune system. Nevertheless, the improved overall survival is complicated by the manifestation of Immune-related Adverse Effects (irAEs). During treatment with ICIs, the most common adverse kidney effect is represented by the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the acute tubulointerstitial nephritis as recurrent histological feature. The mechanisms involved in ICIs-induced AKI include the re-activation of effector T cells previously stimulated by nephrotoxic drugs (i.e. by antibiotics), the loss of tolerance versus self-renal antigens, the increased PD-L1 expression by tubular cells or the establishment of a pro-inflammatory milieu with the release of self-reactive antibodies. For renal transplant recipient treated with ICIs, the increased incidence of rejection is a serious concern. Therefore, the combination of ICIs with mTOR inhibitors represents an emerging strategy. Finally, it is relevant to anticipate which patients under ICIs would experience severe irAEs and from a kidney perspective, to predict patients with higher risk of AKI. Here, we provide a detailed overview of ICIs-related nephrotoxicity and the recently described multicenter studies.

We set out to determine patient preferences for different attributes of a community-based model for the management of MDR-TB in Uganda. METHODS: The study was conducted at five tertiary referral hospitals. We used a parallel convergent mixed methods study design. To collect quantitative data, we conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with three different attributes of community-based care (DOT provider, location of care, and type of support) combined into eight choice sets, each with two options and an opt-out. We elicited patient reasons for selection of each choice set using qualitative methods. We fitted a mixed logit choice model to determine patient preferences for different attributes of community-based care and estimated the relative importance of each attribute using the range method. and used deductive thematic analysis to understand the reasons for the choices made. RESULTS: From December 2019 to January 2020, we interviewed 103 patients with MDR-TB. We found that all the three attributes considered were important predicators of choice. The relative importance of each attribute was as follows; the type of additional support (relative importance 36.2%), the location of treatment delivery (33.5%), and the type of DOT provider (30.3%). Participants significantly valued treatment delivered by community health workers (CHWs) or expert clients over that delivered by a family member, treatment delivered at home over that delivered at the workplace, and monthly travel vouchers as the form of additional support over phone call or SMS reminders. Subgroup analyses showed significant differences in preference across HIV status, age groups and duration on MDR-TB treatment, but not across gender. The preferred model consisted of a CHW giving DOT at home and travel vouchers to enable attendance of monthly clinic follow-up visits to tertiary referral hospitals for treatment monitoring. Qualitative interviews revealed that patients perceived CHWs as knowledgeable and able to offer psychosocial support. Patients also preferred to take medication at home to save both time and money and lower the risk of facing TB stigma. CONCLUSION: People with MDR-TB prefer to be supported to take their medicine at home by a member of their community. The effectiveness of this model of care is being further evaluated.

Accurate and reproducible delineation of the myocardium is crucial for accurate analysis of peak systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. In addition to the conventionally available magnitude CMR data, 3Dir MVM also provides three orthogonal phase velocity mapping datasets, which are used to generate velocity maps. These velocity maps may also be used to facilitate and improve the myocardial delineation. Based on the success of deep learning in medical image processing, we propose a novel fast and automated framework that improves the standard U-Net-based methods on these CMR multi-channel data (magnitude and phase velocity mapping) by cross-channel fusion with an attention module and the shape information-based post-processing to achieve accurate delineation of both epicardial and endocardial contours.

The project was named \\"Tourism in flight mode: Thinking together the post COVID-19 tourism\\". Design/methodology/approach: The project was based on the sharing of information and experiences in virtual forums where participants from all over the world had the opportunity to explain how the pandemic was influencing their work/business, the regional or national tourism activity, GDP and jobs and how they and their regions were preparing for the recovery of tourism. On a biweekly basis, virtual forums were organised, with participants from three continents and 12 countries. The results were contextualised by carrying out a review of the most recent literature and authors' tourism know-how in the field. Findings: The results of the discussions allowed for an identification of new potential successful tourism products and new proposals for the design of basic pillars for destinations planning. Practical implications: This paper offers practical recommendations for public administration and others on dealing with unexpected crises in the tourism sector and how to respond through the development of new and adapted products and approaches to tourism. Originality/value: This paper creates awareness in public administration and other agencies about the opportunities and the needs for this \\"new era\\".","output":"COVID-19 \\"tourism in flight mode\\": a lost opportunity to rethink tourism - towards a more sustainable and inclusive society.

They have been extensively produced since 1940s due to enormous applications as a surface-active agent, and water and oil repellent characteristics. PFASs are made to be non-biodegradable, therefore, many of them have been found in the environment albeit strict regulations have been in place since 2002. PFASs are extremely toxic compounds that can impart harm in both fauna and flora. Recent investigations have shown that wetlands might be useful for their removal from the environment as a passive and nature-based solution. To this end, understanding the role of plants, microbes, and their combined plant-microbe interplay is crucial because it could help design a sophisticated passive treatment wetland system. This review focuses on how these components (plants, microbe, substrate) can influence PFASs removal in wetlands under natural and controlled conditions. The information on underlying removal mechanisms is mostly retrieved from laboratory-based studies; however, pilot- and field-scale data are also presented to provide insights on their real-time performance. Briefly, a traditional wetland system works on the principles of phytouptake, bioaccumulation, and sorption, which are mainly due to the fact that PFASs are synthetic compounds that have very low reactivity in the environment. Nevertheless, recent investigations have also shown that Feammox process in wetlands can mineralize the PFASs; thus, opens new opportunities for PFASs degradation in terms of effective plant-microbe interplay in the wetlands. The choice of plants and bacterial species is however crucial, and the system efficiency relies on species-specific, sediment-specific and pollutant-specific principles. More research is encouraged to identify genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that can help us harness effective plant-microbe interplay in wetlands for the successful removal of PFASs from the environment.","output":"Removal of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) by wetlands: Prospects on plants, microbes and the interplay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses morphological borrowing from American-English to Dutch.

It will be shown that the borrowing of these processes started with borrowing of English lexical material followed by a process of reinterpretation, which subsequently led to the (re-)introduction of the processes in Dutch. Therefore, the traditional distinction between MAT and PAT borrowing turns out to be inadequate.

The present study aimed to estimate the attributable burden of unsafe sex and drug use in Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the Middle East and North Africa countries. METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Disease data 2017 to estimate the attributable mortality and disability-adjusted life-years to unsafe sex and drug use in Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the Middle East and North Africa countries (21 countries) from 1990 to 2017 by region, sex and age. The percent change was calculated at three time points by country and sex. RESULTS: The rate of Disability-adjusted life years/100,000 attributed to drug use for Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome increased 1.10 (95% CI: 0.75C1.71) to 13.39 (95% CI: 9.98C18.17) in women of Middle East and North Africa countries from 1990 to 2017, and there is an increasing trend in Disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use for Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in men. The rate of Disability-adjusted life years/100,000 attributed to unsafe sex for Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome increased in women of Middle East and North Africa countries, 5.15 (95% CI: 3.34C8.07) to 53.44 (95% CI: 38.79C75.89); and 10.06 (95% CI: 6.61C16.18) to 46.16 (95% CI: 31.30C72.66) in men.

Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between use of video-based communication tools and loneliness, mental health and quality of life within age groups, while adjusting by sociodemographic variables. Video-based communication tools were found to be more often used among participants aged 60-69 years (60.1%), compared to participants aged 70 or above (51.8%, p <0.05). Adjusting for all variables, use of video-based communication was associated with less loneliness (= -0.12, p <0.01) and higher quality of life (= 0.14, p <0.01) among participants aged 60-69 years, while no associations occurred for participants in the oldest age group.

We aimed to determine the effect of an electronic clinical pathway on the rates of overall and rational prescription of antibiotics in patients with URI. A pilot quasi-experimental study was conducted in a university hospital and two of its nearby primary care units (PCU) in northeast Thailand from June to September 2020. Clinical pathway pop-up windows were inserted into the hospitals computer-based prescription system. Care providers were required to check the appropriate boxes before they were able to prescribe amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav. We examined a total of 675 visits to the outpatient department due to URI at three points in time: pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 6 weeks post-intervention. Patients in the latter group tended to be younger and visits were more likely to be general practitioner-related and to the student PCU than in the other two groups. In addition, the rate of antibiotic prescription was significantly lower at 6 weeks after intervention than at either of the other time periods (32.0% vs 53.8% pre-intervention and 46.2% immediately post-intervention; p < 0.001), and the proportion of rational antibiotic prescriptions increased significantly after implementation. Antibiotic prescription rates were lower at the community primary care unit and higher when the physician was a resident or a family doctor. The deployment of an electronic clinical pathway reduced the rate of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. The effect was greater at 6 weeks post-implementation.

This paper compares and contrasts the experiences of 15 clinicians in six different African cancer centers to highlight the positive aspects (silver linings) in an otherwise negative situation. METHODS: Data are from personal experience of the clinicians working at the six cancer centers blended with what is available in the literature. RESULTS: The impact of COVID-19 on cancer care appeared to vary not only across the continent but also over cancer centers. Different factors such as clinic location, services offered, available resources, and level of restrictions imposed because of COVID-19 were associated with these variations. Collectively, delays in treatment and limited access to cancer care were commonly reported in the different regions. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data on cancer patients with COVID-19 and online COVID-19 and cancer registries for Africa. Analysis of the available data, however, suggests a higher mortality rate for cancer patients with COVID-19 compared with those without cancer. Positive or silver linings coming out of the pandemic include the adoption of hypofractionated radiation therapy and teleoncology to enhance access to care while protecting patients and staff members. Increasing collaborations using online technology with oncology health professionals across the world are also being seen as a silver lining, with valuable sharing of experiences and expertise to improve care, enhance learning, and reduce disparities.

Knowledge of the seasonality of parasite egg shedding and transmission is important for constructing parasite control programs. However, studies describing these patterns are sparse, and have largely been conducted only in the United Kingdom. This study evaluated strongylid egg shedding patterns and transmission dynamics of Strongylus vulgaris in naturally infected and untreated mares and foals through one calendar year in Kentucky, USA. The study also investigated the existence of a peri-parturient rise (PPR) in strongylid egg counts in foaling mares and collected information about Strongyloides westeri and Parascaris spp. in the foals. METHODS: This study was conducted from January to December 2018. A herd of 18 mares, one stallion, and 14 foals born in 2018 were followed throughout the year. Sera and feces were collected biweekly from all horses, and worm burdens enumerated in 13 foals at necropsy. An S. vulgaris ELISA antibody test was run on all serum samples. Fecal egg counts were determined for all horses, and coproculture and qPCR assay were employed to test for the presence of S. vulgaris in the mature horses. Data were analyzed using the proc glimmix procedure in the SAS 9.4 software program. RESULTS: We found a general lack of seasonality in strongylid egg shedding throughout the year among the mature horses, and no PPR was demonstrated. Shedding of S. vulgaris eggs displayed a higher abundance during the spring, but findings were variable and not statistically significant. Anti-S. vulgaris antibody concentrations did not display significant fluctuations in the mature horses, but evidence of passive transfer of antibodies to the foals was demonstrated, and foals assumed their own production of antibodies starting at approximately 20 weeks of age. Overall, colts shed higher numbers of strongylid, ascarid, and S. westeri eggs than fillies. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a lack of seasonality in strongylid egg shedding for the study population, which is in stark contrast to previous studies conducted elsewhere. This strongly suggests that more studies should be done investigating these patterns under different climatic conditions.

Various existing basic or advanced life support (BLS or ALS, respectively) rules for the termination of resuscitation (TOR) have been derived and validated in North America and Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the external validation of these rules in predicting the survival outcomes of OHCA patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study using the WinCOVID-19 Daegu registry data collected during February 18-March 31, 2020. The subjects were patients who showed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. The outcomes of each rule were compared to the actual patient survival outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive value (FPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of each TOR rule were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 170 of the 184 OHCA patients were eligible and evaluated. TOR was recommended for 122 patients based on the international basic life support termination of resuscitation (BLS-TOR) rule, which showed 85% specificity, 74% sensitivity, 0.8% FPV, and 99% PPV for predicting unfavorable survival outcomes. When the traditional BLS-TOR rules and KoCARC TOR rule II were applied to our registry, one patient met the TOR criteria but survived at hospital discharge. With regard to the FPV (upper limit of 95% confidence interval < 5%), specificity (100%), and PPV (> 99%) criteria, only the KoCARC TOR rule I, which included a combination of three factors including not being witnessed by emergency medical technicians, presenting with an asystole at the scene, and not experiencing prehospital shock delivery or return of spontaneous circulation, was found to be superior to all other TOR rules. CONCLUSION: Among the previous nine BLS and ALS TOR rules, KoCARC TOR rule I was most suitable for predicting poor survival outcomes and showed improved diagnostic performance. Further research on variations in resources and treatment protocols among facilities, regions, and cultures will be useful in determining the feasibility of TOR rules for COVID-19 patients worldwide.","output":"External validation of multimodal termination of resuscitation rules for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a novel viral disease. Severe courses may present as ARDS. Several publications report a high incidence of coagulation abnormalities in these patients. We aimed to compare coagulation and inflammation parameters in patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection versus patients with ARDS due to other causes. METHODS: This retrospective study included intubated patients admitted with the diagnosis of ARDS to the ICU at Munich university hospital. 22 patients had confirmed SARS-CoV2-infection (COVID-19 group), 14 patients had bacterial or other viral pneumonia (control group). Demographic, clinical parameters and laboratory tests including coagulation parameters and thromboelastometry were analysed. RESULTS: No differences were found in gender ratios, BMI, Horovitz quotients and haemoglobin values. The median SOFA score, serum lactate levels, renal function parameters (creatinine, urea) and all inflammation markers (IL-6, PCT, CRP) were lower in the COVID-19 group (all: p < 0.05). INR (p < 0.001) and antithrombin (p < 0.001) were higher in COVID-19 patients. D-dimer levels (p = 0.004) and consecutively the DIC score (p = 0.003) were lower in this group.

RESULTS Five hundred sixty-six patients including 290 men (51%), 62.7  13.2 years old with primary tumor to the colon (34%), rectum (18%), kidney (12%), soft tissue (9%) and miscellaneous (27%) received 642 RFA for 1037 lung metastases. Fifty-three percent of patients had 1 metastasis, 25% had 2, 14% had 3, 5% had 4 and 4% had 5-8. Metastases were unilateral (75%), or bilateral (25%). The median diameter [extremes] of metastases was 15 mm (4-70). Twenty-two percent of patients had extrapulmonary disease amenable to local therapy including 49 liver, 16 bone and 60 miscellaneous metastases. Median follow-up was 35.5 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 62 months. Four-year local efficacy was 89%. Four-year lung disease control rate was 44.1%, with patient retreated safely up to four times.

Then, the modified fuzzy robust stochastic method is employed to tackle the uncertainty. This study selects one of the most important medical devices during the pandemic (COVID-19) namely the blood bank refrigerator as a case study. Afterwards, the proposed multi-objective model is solved by developing a novel method named as augmented lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff method. Based on the obtained results, an increase in the responsiveness level of the supply chain can lead to increasing the sustainability dimensions, including job opportunities, safety, carbon emission, and economic aspects.

Despite strong research on the infection pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms involved in a fatal course are still poorly understood. Machine learning constitutes a perfect tool to develop algorithms for predicting a patient's hospitalization outcome at triage. This paper presents a probabilistic model, referred to as a mortality risk indicator, able to assess the risk of a fatal outcome for new patients. The derivation of the model was done over a database of 2,547 patients from the first COVID-19 wave in Spain. Model learning was tackled through a five multistart configuration that guaranteed good generalization power and low variance error estimators. The training algorithm made use of a class weighting correction to account for the mortality class imbalance and two regularization learners, logistic and lasso regressors. Outcome probabilities were adjusted to obtain cost-sensitive predictions by minimizing the type II error. Our mortality indicator returns both a binary outcome and a three-stage mortality risk level. The estimated AUC across multistarts reaches an average of 0.907. At the optimal cutoff for the binary outcome, the model attains an average sensitivity of 0.898, with a 0.745 specificity. An independent set of 121 patients later released from the same consortium attained perfect sensitivity (1), with a 0.759 specificity when predicted by our model. Best performance for the indicator is achieved when the prediction's time horizon is within two weeks since admission to hospital. In addition to a strong predictive performance, the set of selected features highlights the relevance of several underrated molecules in COVID-19 research, such as blood eosinophils, bilirubin, and urea levels. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Derivation of a Cost-Sensitive COVID-19 Mortality Risk Indicator Using a Multistart Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"NICE, SIGN and the Royal College of General Practitioners have published a joint guideline on identifying and managing the long\\\\term effects of COVID\\\\19 (long COVID) in adults, young people and children.

The resulting specification permits a flexible yet parsimonious model structure with a very low computational cost. This is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce and the uncertainty is abundant. Full sample results show that countries including US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with the US having the worst performance. Furthermore, Iran and South Korea are likely to experience the second wave of the pandemic. A real-time exercise show that the proposed structure delivers timely and precise information on the current stance of the pandemic ahead of the competitors that use rolling window. This, in turn, transforms into accurate short-term predictions of the active cases. We further modify the model to allow for unreported cases.

METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed with 16 questions (eight questions related to demographics, three related to the awareness of social distancing (stay-at-home) and five related to the overall practice of social distancing). RESULTS: A total of 5105 participants completed the survey [58.4% females, 66.3% young individuals (aged 18C37 years), 55.8% bachelor degree holders and 51.0% from the western region]. The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) was the main source of information about COVID-19 for most of the participants (78.2%).

Symptoms include urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, increased daytime urinary frequency and nocturia. OAB has a negative impact on womens social, physical, and psychological wellbeing. Initial treatment includes lifestyle modifications, bladder retraining, pelvic floor exercises and pharmacological therapy. However, these measures are unsuccessful in 25C40% of women (refractory OAB). Before considering invasive treatments, such as Botulinum toxin injection or sacral neuromodulation, most guidelines recommend urodynamics to confirm diagnosis of detrusor overactivity (DO). However, urodynamics may fail to show evidence of DO in up to 45% of cases, hence the need to evaluate its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. FUTURE (Female Urgency, Trial of Urodynamics as Routine Evaluation) aims to test the hypothesis that, in women with refractory OAB, urodynamics and comprehensive clinical assessment is associated with superior patient-reported outcomes following treatment and is more cost-effective, compared to comprehensive clinical assessment only. METHODS: FUTURE is a pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority randomised controlled trial. Women aged  18 years with refractory OAB or urgency predominant mixed urinary incontinence, and who have failed/not tolerated conservative and medical treatment, are considered for trial entry. We aim to recruit 1096 women from approximately 60 secondary/tertiary care hospitals across the UK. All consenting women will complete questionnaires at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 15 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome is participant-reported success at 15 months post-randomisation measured using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. The primary economic outcome is incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained at 15 months. The secondary outcomes include adverse events, impact on other urinary symptoms and health-related quality of life. Qualitative interviews with participants and clinicians and a health economic evaluation will also be conducted. The statistical analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat.

The dataset included in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood counts results from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S?o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR test during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the hospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers to develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.

Literature substantially reports on the favorable macroeconomic impact of the healthcare sector. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data on 19 European countries. Over 30 variables are analyzed to find factors that foster or suppress the economic impact of the healthcare sector. The economic impact is thereby expressed through five types of total multipliers, acting as dependent variables. The authors estimate multiple econometric models. Findings: The results indicate factors that intensify or reduce the economic impact of the healthcare sector as they cause the value of one or more economic multipliers to augment or to diminish. Positive effects are expected from the growth of public funds' share in total healthcare expenditure leading to a higher output, income and value-added multipliers. The import multiplier diminishes when expenditure on healthcare as percent of GDP rises. On the other hand, rising expenditure on pharmaceuticals in the share of healthcare expenditure lowers the output multiplier. Rising GDP per capita and higher healthcare systems' technical efficiency cause the employment multiplier to lower. Originality/value: Policymakers can strengthen the economic impact of the healthcare sector on the national economy. This could be achieved by stimulating factors, being identified in our study.

Consistently, their binding free energies were C36.07, C23.77, C24.07 and C17.76 kcal/mol respectively, while remdesivir and GS-441524 showed C21.22 and C24.20 kcal/mol respectively. Interestingly, the selected C ligands displayed better stability and flexibility for enhancing the plasticity of the receptor than GS-441524, especially 129 and 1303. Their predicted ADMET parameters favour druggability and low expressions for toxicity. Thus, they are recommended as promising adjuvant/standalone anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates for further study.Key words: SARS-CoV-2, nsp3 macrodomain, ADP-ribose, -carboline, bioinformatics, drug design","output":"-Carboline alkaloids induce structural plasticity and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macrodomain more potently than remdesivir metabolite GS-441524: computational approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The changes brought about in higher education by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic require effective action.

METHODS: We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. CASE-CENTERED RECOMMENDATIONS: Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. LIMITATIONS: Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.","output":"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : Pre-operative/neoadjuvant treatment utilization in early-stage breast cancer has been increasing,particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic With goals of minimizing potential exposure to SARS-COV-2, as well asresource rationing, physicians are urged to triage breast cancer patients by identifying those that require urgentsurgical care vs those who may delay surgical treatment Accurate risk assessment is an integral component ofthis triaging process, which has recommended that genomic testing on diagnostic core needle biopsy (CNB)samples be used to assist with the identification of patients with low risk tumor biology who may be candidates forsurgical delay MammaPrint (MP), a 70-gene risk of recurrence signature, and BluePrint (BP), an 80-genemolecular subtyping signature, have been routinely used in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) CNB andsurgical resection (SR) samples since MammaPrint obtained FDA clearance for FFPE tissue in 2015 In addition,over 1,500 CNB tumor samples from patients enrolled in prospective neoadjuvant treatment trials (NBRST andISPY-2) have received successful MP & BP testing This study compares the gene expression results between CNBand SR specimens to better elucidate how these tests perform across specimen type Methods: Routine diagnosticsamples submitted to Agendia, Inc (Irvine, CA) between Feb 2017 and May 2020 for MP and BP testing wereprocessed according to standard FFPE microarray procedures MP was used to stratify samples into Ultra Low Risk(UL), Low Risk (LR), and High Risk (HR) BP was used to classify samples into Luminal, HER2, or Basal-type Thisstudy included 13,603 CNB and 25,684 SR specimens MP Index (MPI) distribution on BP defined Luminal-type tumors were compared between CNB and SR samples Comparative logistics metrics (average turnaround time[TAT] and success rate) were also assessed between these specimen types Results: Of the 39,287 samplesincluded in this analysis, 35% were CNB and 65% were SR ( Table ) BluePrint Luminal, HER2 and Basal-typedistributions were 86%, 4%, and 10% respectively for CNB samples and 94%, 1%, and 5% respectively for SRsamples Within BP defined Luminal-type tumors, the frequency of UL, LR, and HR results were 18%, 58%, and42% for CNB, and 16%, 60%, and 40% for SR, respectively Overall, MP Index distributions were similar betweensamples tested from CNB vs SR Average TAT between CNB and SR were 4 52 and 4 55 days, respectively Forspecimens that met the minimum tumor % threshold, successful testing rates for CNB and SR were 97 5% and98 4%, respectively Conclusions : MP and BP testing were successfully performed on both CNB and SR samplesin approximately 98% of all eligible specimens with rapid TAT allowing for timely pre-operative decision-making Thefrequency of each MP risk group as well as the distribution pattern of MP Index were nearly identical between CNBand SR specimens, indicating comparable performance regardless of specimen type With no meaningful differencein MPI distribution, TAT or success rate between CNB specimens and SR specimens, pre-operative use of MP+BPgenomic testing is feasible, in alignment with recent COVID-19 pandemic guidelines (Figure Presented)","output":"Comparing MammaPrint and BluePrintresults between core needle biopsy and surgical resectionbreast cancer specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current study, it was aimed to examine the relationships between individuals' fear of COVID-19, fear of missing out (FoMO), and ruminative thought style levels.

There remains a paucity of such data from lower prevalence countries, including Australia. AIMS: To describe the patterns of unplanned hospital daily admission rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in a major Australian metropolitan hospital, with a focus on acute medical presentations including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke and falls. METHODS: This single-centre retrospective analysis analysed hospital admission episodes between 1 March and 30 April 2020 (COVID-19-era) and compared this to a historical cohort during the same period between 2017 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19). Information collected included total admission rates and patient characteristics for ACS, stroke and falls patients. RESULTS: A total of 12 278 unplanned admissions was identified across the study period. The daily admission rate was lower in the COVID-19-era compared with pre-COVID-19 (46.59 vs 51.56 days, P < 0.001). There was also a reduced average daily admission rate for falls (7.79 vs 9.95 days, P < 0.001); however, similar admission rates for ACS (1.52 vs 1.49 days, P = 0.83) and stroke (1.56 vs 1.76 days, P = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions have been effective in reducing domestic cases of COVID-19 in Australia. At our tertiary metropolitan hospital, we have observed a significant reduction in unplanned hospital admission rates during the COVID-19-era, particularly for falls.

Nevertheless, a previous zoonotic and highly pathogenic coronavirus, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is still causing concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and neighbour countries. The MERS-CoV has been reported from respiratory samples in more than 27 countries, and around 2500 cases have been reported with an approximate fatality rate of 35%. After its emergence in 2012 intermittent, sporadic cases, nosocomial infections and many community clusters of MERS continued to occur in many countries. Human-to-human transmission resulted in the large outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. The inherent genetic variability among various clads of the MERS-CoV might have probably paved the events of cross-species transmission along with changes in the inter-species and intra-species tropism. The current review is drafted using an extensive review of literature on various databases, selecting of publications irrespective of favouring or opposing, assessing the merit of study, the abstraction of data and analysing data. The genome of MERS-CoV contains around thirty thousand nucleotides having seven predicted open reading frames. Spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the four main structural proteins. The surface located spike protein (S) of betacoronaviruses has been established to be one of the significant factors in their zoonotic transmission through virus-receptor recognition mediation and subsequent initiation of viral infection. Three regions in Saudi Arabia (KSA), Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah were affected severely.

This approach allows little opportunity to provide finders or owners with alternatives to keep pets safe in their homes or community rather than being impounded. In addition to needlessly impounding animals and separating pets from families, unmanaged/unscheduled admission frequently results in animal influx exceeding shelter capacity, leading to crowding, stress, disease, and euthanasia of animals, as well as poor customer experience, compromised staffing efficiency and decreased organizational effectiveness. Many of these harmful consequences disproportionately impact vulnerable community members and their pets. Triage and appointment-based services have been well developed in healthcare and other service sectors allowing organizations to prioritize the most urgent cases, align services with organizational resources and provide situation-specific solutions that may include virtual support or referral as appropriate. This article discusses the trend in animal sheltering toward triage and appointment-based services that parallels the use of these practices in human healthcare. Reported positive results of this approach are detailed including improved staff morale, reduced disease rates and substantially reduced euthanasia. These positive outcomes support the endorsement of triage and appointment-based services by multiple North American animal welfare professional and academic organizations, recognizing that it better realizes the goals of shelters to serve the common good of animals and people in the most humane, equitable and effective possible way.","output":"The Evolving Role of Triage and Appointment-Based Admission to Improve Service, Care and Outcomes in Animal Shelters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has created a global health crisis. Secondary pulmonary bacterial infection is a COVID-19 complication, increasing morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and risk factors for mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study used secondary data from patients electronic medical records at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital and Santo Borromeus Hospital between March 2020 and March 2021. Overall, 2230 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were screened, and 182 of them who were hospitalized 48 hours with a procalcitonin level of 0.25 ng/mL were enrolled. Culture examination was performed on sputum samples to determine pathogen and antibiotic susceptibilities. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine mortality-related risk factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of secondary pulmonary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients was 8.2%, with 161/182 pathogen growth from sputum samples. Mainly gram-negative bacteria (64.8%) were present, including Acinetobacter baumannii (31.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.8%). High rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens was found among isolate (45.9%), ie carbapenem-resistance A.baumannii (CR-Ab) was 84.2%, extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) among K. pneumoniae was 61.1%. Secondary infection of MDR pathogens was associated with a higher risk of mortality (AOR 5.63, p = 0.001). Other associated factors were age 60 years, ventilator use, and female gender. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria are the predominant pathogens causing secondary pulmonary bacterial infection in COVID-19 patients, implying nosocomial infection. High resistance to first-line antimicrobial drugs was observed in Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria. High rate of MDR pathogens was found among isolate and was associated with a significant risk of mortality.","output":"MDR Pathogens Organisms as Risk Factor of Mortality in Secondary Pulmonary Bacterial Infections Among COVID-19 Patients: Observational Studies in Two Referral Hospitals in West Java, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy has raised concerns about negative coping behaviours to offset financial losses.

This limits the clinical application of DOX therapies. Previous studies have attributed DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity to mitochondrial iron accumulation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which seem to be independent of its anti-tumor DNA damaging effects. Chemo-sensitization of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway induces tumor cell death despite the cardiotoxicity associated with DOX treatment. However, sGC-cGMP signaling must be activated during heart failure to facilitate myocardial cell survival. The sGC pathway is dependent on nitric oxide and signal transduction via the nitric oxide-sGC-cGMP pathway and is attenuated in various cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, cGMP signaling is regulated by the action of certain phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that protect the heart by inhibiting PDE, an enzyme that hydrolyses cGMP to GMP activity. In this review, we discuss the studies describing the interactions between cGMP regulation and DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity and their application in improving DOX therapeutic outcomes. The results provide novel avenues for the reduction of DOX-induced secondary tumorigenicity and improve cellular autonomy during DOX-mediated cardiotoxicity.","output":"The sGC-cGMP Signaling Pathway as a Potential Therapeutic Target in Doxorubicin-Induced Heart Failure: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the course of the pandemic, it has become clear that the strictures of social isolation and various levels of lockdown constraints have impacted peoples well-being.

Results showed that well-being was higher for those individuals who increased engagement with creative pursuits during the early stages of the pandemic.

Methods: AUS-COVID is a multicentre observational cohort study across 21 Australian hospitals including all index hospitalisations with laboratory-proven COVID-19 in patients aged 18 years or older. All consecutive patients entered in the AUS-COVID Registry by 28 January 2021 were included in the present study. Results: Six hundred and forty-four hospitalised patients (62.5  20.1 years old, 51.1% male) with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Overall in-hospital mortality was 14.3%. Twenty (3.6%) patients developed new atrial fibrillation or flutter during admission and 9 (1.6%) patients were diagnosed with new heart failure or cardiomyopathy. Three (0.5%) patients developed high grade atrioventricular (AV) block. Two (0.3%) patients were clinically diagnosed with pericarditis or myopericarditis. Among the 295 (45.8%) patients with at least one troponin measurement, 99 (33.6%) had a peak troponin above the upper limit of normal (ULN). In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with raised troponin (32.3% vs 6.1%, p<.001). New onset atrial fibrillation or flutter (6.4% vs 1.0%, p=.001) and troponin elevation above the ULN (50.3% vs 16.4%, p<.001) were more common in patients 65 years and older. There was no significant difference in the rate of cardiac complications between males and females.

Large average declines in travel and public transit use due to the pandemic and related policy responses mask substantial heterogeneity across socioeconomic groups. Travel declined considerably less among less-educated and lower-income individuals, even after accounting for mode substitution and variation across neighborhoods in the impacts of public transit service reductions.

RESULTS Of 12,261 records, 72 studies describing the measurement properties of smartphone-based approaches to measure diet (48/72, 67%), alcohol use (16/72, 22%), and tobacco use (8/72, 11%) were identified and included in this review. Across the health behaviors, 18 different measurement techniques were used in smartphones. The measurement properties most commonly examined were construct validity, measurement error, and criterion validity. The results varied by behavior and measurement approach, and the methodological quality of the studies varied widely. Most studies investigating the measurement of diet and alcohol received very good or adequate methodological quality ratings, that is, 73% (35/48) and 69% (11/16), respectively, whereas only 13% (1/8) investigating the measurement of tobacco use received a very good or adequate rating. CONCLUSIONS This review is the first to provide evidence regarding the different types of smartphone-based approaches currently used to measure key behavioral risk factors for chronic diseases (diet, alcohol use, and tobacco use) and the quality of their measurement properties. A total of 19 measurement techniques were identified, most of which assessed dietary behaviors (48/72, 67%). Some evidence exists to support the reliability and validity of using smartphones to assess these behaviors; however, the results varied by behavior and measurement approach. The methodological quality of the included studies also varied. Overall, more high-quality studies validating smartphone-based approaches against criterion measures are needed. Further research investigating the use of smartphones to assess alcohol and tobacco use and objective measurement approaches is also needed.

A significant uncertainty that would improve the interpretation of wastewater monitoring data is the intensity and timing with which individuals shed RNA from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into wastewater. By combining wastewater and case surveillance data sets from a university campus during a period of heightened surveillance, we inferred that individual shedding of RNA into wastewater peaks on average 6 days (50% uncertainty interval (UI): 6C7; 95% UI: 4C8) following infection, and that wastewater measurements are highly overdispersed [negative binomial dispersion parameter, k = 0.39 (95% credible interval: 0.32C0.48)]. This limits the utility of wastewater surveillance as a leading indicator of secular trends in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during an epidemic, and implies that it could be most useful as an early warning of rising transmission in areas where transmission is low or clinical testing is delayed or of limited capacity.","output":"Inferring SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding into wastewater relative to the time of infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine plays an important role in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virtual surgery simulation system, as a key component in telemedicine, requires to compute in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time cutting model based on finite element and order reduction method, which improves the computational speed and ensure the real-time performance. The proposed model uses the finite element model to construct a deformation model of the virtual lung. Meanwhile, a model order reduction method combining proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection is employed to reduce the amount of deformation computation. In addition, the cutting path is formed according to the collision intersection position of the surgical instrument and the lesion area of the virtual lung. Then, the Bezier curve is adopted to draw the incision outline after the virtual lung has been cut. Finally, the simulation system is set up on the PHANTOM OMNI force haptic feedback device to realize the cutting simulation of the virtual lung. Experimental results show that the proposed model can enhance the real-time performance of telemedicine, reduce the complexity of the cutting simulation and make the incision smoother and more natural. ? 2022 CRL Publishing.

What advice do they have for the postpandemic world? Is there a consensus on the most significant psychological and societal changes ahead? To answer these questions, we analyzed interviews from the World After COVID Project-reflections of more than 50 of the world's top behavioral and social science experts, including fellows of National Academies and presidents of major scientific societies. These experts independently shared their thoughts on possible psychological changes in society in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and provided recommendations how to respond to the new challenges and opportunities these shifts may bring. We distilled these predictions and suggestions via human-coded analyses and natural language processing techniques. In general, experts showed little overlap in their predictions, except for convergence on a set of social/societal themes (e.g., greater appreciation for social connection, increasing political conflict). Half of the experts approached their post-COVID predictions dialectically, highlighting both positive and negative features of the same domain of change, and many expressed uncertainty in their predictions. The project offers a time capsule of experts' predictions for the effects of the pandemic on a wide range of outcomes. We discuss the implications of heterogeneity in these predictions, the value of uncertainty and dialecticism in forecasting, and the value of balancing explanation with predictions in expert psychological judgment.

METHODS: A four-phase study was conducted to agree a set of core outcome domains. Identification of candidate outcome domains were identified through systematic review of trials, and outcome domains relevant to families were identified through semi-structured interviews with 20 families (parent-child pairing or group). Outcome domains were prioritized using an international three-round Delphi survey with 205 panellists and then condensed into a core outcome set through a consensus workshop with 30 stakeholders. RESULTS: The systematic review and interviews identified 85 outcome domains as relevant to professionals or families. The Delphi survey prioritized 30 upper and 29 lower limb outcome domains at first round, an additional 17 upper and 18 lower limb outcomes at second round, and four additional outcomes for upper and lower limb at the third round as important domains. At the consensus workshop, the core outcome domains were agreed as: 1) pain and discomfort; 2) return to physical and recreational activities; 3) emotional and psychosocial wellbeing; 4) complications from the injury and treatment; 5) rturn to baseline activities daily living; 6) participation in learning; 7) appearance and deformity; and 8) time to union. In addition, 9a) recovery of mobility and 9b) recovery of manual dexterity was recommended as a core outcome for lower and upper limb fractures, respectively. CONCLUSION: This set of core outcome domains is recommended as a minimum set of outcomes to be reported in all trials. It is not an exhaustive set and further work is required to identify what outcome tools should be used to measure each of these outcomes.

Under most political circumstances, this is a difficult question to answer, but the novel coronavirus pandemic allows us to understand how partisan animus contributes to opinion formation. Using a two-wave panel that spans the outbreak of COVID-19, we find a strong association between citizens' levels of partisan animosity and their attitudes about the pandemic, as well as the actions they take in response to it. This relationship, however, is more muted in areas with severe outbreaks of the disease.

With the growing popularity of the mhGAP-IG, a systematic review was conducted by Keynejad and colleagues (2018) to identify articles reporting on evidence generated from the implementation and evaluation of the mhGAP-IG in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Their review identified peer-reviewed articles and one thesis. In this current review, we report on the implementation and use of mhGAP-IG documented in the grey literature, an important and accessible channel to share information for LMICs. METHODS: We searched grey literature databases for documents that reported on the implementation and/or use of the mhGAP-IG or its training modules: ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, the Mental Health Innovation Network (MHIN) database, the WHO website, the mhGAP Newsletter, and the first 10 pages of Google search results. Authors developed and adapted search strategies according to database characteristics. Database searches were completed by November 12, 2019. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-one (n = 151) documents were included in our review. We report on where the mhGAP-IG has been implemented and/or used worldwide. Many types of personnel were trained in the mhGAP-IG and/or used it in clinical practice. Contextual barriers and facilitators may influence the implementation and/or use of the mhGAP-IG, and we organized these according to structural, organizational, provider, patient, and innovation characteristics. Some information on evaluating the mhGAP-IG was documented in the grey literature. Outcomes included: feasibility of implementing and/or using the mhGAP-IG, its coverage, its impact on the capacities of personnel, patient outcomes, and policies, as well as program costs. CONCLUSIONS: This review of the grey literature provides rich experiential knowledge that can complement information documented in the peer-reviewed literature. It is important for researchers conducting reviews on global health/global mental health topics to consider incorporating grey literature search strategies in their reviews. This may not only help to acknowledge the research/dissemination realities of many LMICs, but also to generate findings that reinforce and/or expand those documented in peer-reviewed articles.","output":"Implementation and use of the Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG): A review of the grey literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid mobilization of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about renewed concern about the digital divide.

Today, the only approach that can prevent the outbreak is classical epidemic control approaches such as hygiene, case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine. Contact tracing aims to reduce the spread of the epidemic by trying to analyze the potential transmission routes of the infection at the individual level. In addition, it will be possible to prevent official measures such as the curfew taken to prevent the epidemic from spreading. However, when considering ways of communication between people, the epidemic knows no boundaries. Mobile applications and artificial intelligence can be successful in analyzing this contact chain.

In this paper we investigated an expansion of the CLS by using a multidimensional conceptualization of the EL construct that is relevant for physical and online teaching environments. The Multidimensional Cognitive Load Scale for Physical and Online Lectures (MCLS-POL) goes beyond the CLS's operationalization of EL by expanding the EL component which originally included factors related to instructions/explanations with sub-dimensions including EL stemming from noises, and EL stemming from both media and devices within the environment.

All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58).

In an attempt to slow the spread of the virus nationwide lockdown restrictions were introduced. This review aims to scope the literature on the impact of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on the presentation and management of trauma globally. Methods; A scoping review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. A systematic search was carried out on the Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases to identify papers investigating presentation and management of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. All studies based on patients admitted with orthopaedic trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Exclusion criteria were opinion-based reports, reviews, studies that did not provide quantitative data and papers not in English. Results; Three hundred and thirty seven studies were screened, with 17 meeting the eligibility criteria. Studies reported on the footfall of trauma in the UK, Europe, Asia, USA, Australia and New Zealand. A total of 29,591 patients during the pandemic were considered. Mean age was 43.7 years (range <1-103); 54.8% were male. Reported reductions in trauma footfall ranged from 20.3% to 84.6%, with a higher proportion of trauma occurring secondary to interpersonal violence, deliberate self-harm and falls from a height. A decrease was seen in road traffic collisions, sports injuries and trauma occurring outdoors. There was no significant change in the proportion of patients managed operatively, and the number of trauma patients reported to be COVID-19 positive was low. Conclusion; Whilst the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in the number of trauma patients; the services managing trauma have continued to function despite infrastructural, personnel and pathway changes in health systems.

PATIENTS/METHODS: Blood samples from hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were collected. We performed basic coagulation tests and quantification of coagulation factors and physiological inhibitor proteins. Laboratory data were compared with clinical data and outcomes. RESULTS: The study involved 206 patients (63.6% male). D-dimer was particularly elevated (median 450 ng/mL; IQR 222.5-957.3).

Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey to measure burnout and resilience among 196 Internal Medicine physician trainees using the Maslach Burnout Index Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel and the Connor-Davidson Resiliency questionnaires, respectively. We then conducted virtual focus group discussions and in-depth key informant interviews to explore the trainees sources of anxiety and coping mechanisms until thematic saturation was satisfied. Results. Out of 146 respondents (from 196 eligible participants, 74% response rate), four percent of physician trainees fit the frank burnout profile, 40% were engaged, while the majority had intermediate profiles (23% ineffective, 28% overextended, and 4% disengaged). The mean resilience score was 72.9 (SD 12.4). Resilience was a significant negative predictor for burnout (Beta Coefficient = -0.73, p<0.001). Its protective effect decreases in those with more exposure to patient deaths (Beta Coefficient = 6.767, p<0.05). Significant sources of anxiety included changes in the practice of medicine (changes in workflow, working in full personal protective equipment, telemedicine and zoom fatigue, constant threat of acquiring the infection) and having competing demands between service and training. Coping mechanisms included preserving a haven, maintaining social relationships, and self-care. Conclusion. In the largest government hospital in the Philippines, four percent of Internal Medicine physician trainees had burnout, 40% were engaged, and the majority were at-risk for burnout a few months into the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Resilience reduces the risk for burnout. However, its protective effect decreased with exposure to a higher number of patient deaths per week. ? 2022 University of the Philippines Manila.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of immunosuppression on mRNA vaccines efficacy. Methods We included all HT pts followed in our Center completing the vaccine cycle (03-06/21), for whom levels of IgG anti-RBD after the second dose were known, excluding those with a previous COVID infection. Demography, immunosuppression (drugs and trough blood level), lymphocyte count, previous rejection episodes were collected before the first dose. The endpoint was vaccine-induced immunization after the second dose according to our laboratory's threshold of IgG anti-RBD. Results Among 201 vaccinated, IgG anti-RBD values were available for 63 pts at 2 1 months after the second dose (223 days after the first; 89% BNT162b2; 6011 yrs, 51 yrs from HT, 75% males, 3 with rejection > 1R in the previous 6 months). All pts were on CNI-inhibitors (35% tacrolimus, TAC, 65% cyclosporine, CyA), 57% on MMF, 23% mTOR, 69% steroids (CS). 41.7% had no response to vaccine. At univariate analysis the predictors of lack of response to vaccine were: MMF (43% vs 71%), TAC vs CSA (27% vs 73%), steroids (46% vs 76%), steroid dose > 5mg, lymphocytes <18% of leukocytes (both identified by ROC), more than 5 years from HT; mTOR was more likely associated with protection (80% vs 49%), p<0.05 all. Importantly, age was not predictive of immunogenicity. At stepwise multivariate analysis all these factors maintained statistical significance (p<0.05 all). IgG anti-RBD values were influenced by low lymphocytes, steroids and TAC trough levels (p< 0.05 all).Response to vaccine was the lowest for MMF+TAC+CS (23.1%), intermediate for MMF+CyA+CS (53.3%) and steroid-free regimens (68.7%), highest (87.5%) for mTOR+CNI+CS (20%,23%,24%,23% of pts, p=0.01). No rejection episodes were registered 3 months after the second dose of vaccine. Conclusion While confirming a low response to COVID-19 vaccines a in HT pts, our study underscores the negative effect of immunosuppression, particularly of MMF, high doses of steroids and TAC. Given that MMF is a cornerstone of most protocols, from these results it arises the hypothesis (to be tested in larger studies) if switching stable patients from TAC to Cya or to lower steroid doses may favor the attempts to increase the response to vaccines.","output":"Role of Immunosuppression on Efficacy of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Heart Transplanted (HT) Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern showing increased transmissibility relative to the Wuhan virus have recently been identified. Although neither variant appears to cause more severe illness nor increased risk of death, the faster spread of the virus is a major threat.

The mean and median noscapine concentrations for poppy seed samples above the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 89.9 and 28.4 mg kg-1, respectively. Six out of 15 samples were less than the LOQ. Poppy seed samples containing a mean noscapine concentration of 121 mg kg-1 were subjected to dry heat treatments ranging from 120-200 C and a 5 min rinse with water. Baking experiments were also done by incorporating the poppy seeds into a muffin batter and baking in an oven at 200 C. The dry heat treatment experiments showed that noscapine degraded at 160-200 C, with a 50% loss of noscapine observed after 3.44  0.46 min at 200 C. Although the mean concentration of noscapine decreased when a muffin containing poppy seeds was baked at 200 C for 16 min, these changes were not statistically significant (P>0.05).

Therefore, clear clinical criteria are pivotal to early recognition of patients more likely to have poor outcomes, needing prompt organ support. Although most patients with severe COVID19 meet the Sepsis-3.0 criteria for septic shock, it has been increasingly recognized that, in this population, hyperlactatemia is frequently absent, possibly leading to an underestimation of illness severity and mortality risk. Purpose: This study aimed to identify the proportion of patients with COVID19 with hypotension despite adequate volume resuscitation, needing vasopressors to have a MAP>65mmHg, with and without hyperlactatemia, in ICU, and describe its clinical outcomes and mortality rate. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study. All adult patients admitted to ICU with COVID19 were eligible and were further divided in 3 groups according to hyperlactatemia (lactate >2mmol/L) and persistent hypotension with vasopressor therapy requirement: (1) sepsis group (without both criteria), (2) vasoplegic shock (with persistent hypotension with vasopressor therapy requirement without hyperlactatemia) and (3) septic shock 3.0 (with both criteria). COVID19 was diagnosed using clinical and radiologic criteria with a SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR test. Qui-square test was used for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression were used on continuous variables for statistical assessment of outcomes between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and logrank test were also obtained. Results: 103 patients (mean age 62 years, 71% males) were included in the analysis (N=45 sepsis, N=25 vasoplegic shock;N=33 septic shock 3.0). SOFA score at ICU admission and ICU length of stay were different between groups (p<0.001). Ventilator-free days and vasopressor-free days were also different between sepsis vs vasoplegic shock and septic shock 3.0 groups (both p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), and similar in vasoplegic vs septic shock 3.0 groups (p=0.387 and p=0.193, respectively). Mortality was significantly higher in vasoplegic shock and septic shock 3.0 when compared with sepsis group (p<0.001) without difference between the former two groups (p=0.595). Log rank test of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were also different (p=0.07).

PANTIENTS AND METHODS Clinical data and chest CT imaging features of 58 patients confirmed with COVID-19 in the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to the Guidelines on Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment (Provisional 6th Edition), COVID-19 patients were divided into mild type (7), common type (34), severe type (7) and critical type (10 patients). The CT imaging features of the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 types were analyzed, and the volume percentage of pneumonia lesions with respect to the lung lobes (where the lesion was located) and to the whole lung was calculated with the use of AI software. SPSS 21.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Common clinical manifestations of COVID-19 patients: fever was found in 47 patients (81.0%), cough in 31 (53.4%) and weakness in 10 (17.2%). Laboratory examinations: normal or decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts were observed in 52 patients (89.7%), decreased lymphocyte counts (LCs) in 14 (24.1%) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in 18 (31.0%). CT imaging features: there were 48 patients (94.1%) with lesions distributed in both lungs and 46 patients (90.2%) had lesions most visible in the lower lungs; the primary manifestations in patients with common type COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (23/34, 67.6%) or mixed type (17/34, 50.0%), with lesions mainly distributed in the periphery of the lungs (28/34, 82.4%); the primary manifestations of patients with severe/critical type COVID-19 were consolidations (13/17, 76.5%) or mixed type (14/17, 82.4%), with lesions distributed in both the peripheral and central areas of lungs (14/17,82.4%); other common signs, including pleural parallel signs, halo signs, vascular thickening signs, crazy-paving signs and air bronchogram signs, were visible in patients with different clinical types, and pleural effusion was found in 5 patients with severe/critical COVID-19. AI software was used to calculate the volume percentages of pneumonia lesions with respect to the lung lobes (where the lesion was located) and to the whole lung. There were significant differences in the volume percentages of pneumonia lesions for the superior lobe of the left lung, the inferior lobe of the left lung, the superior lobe of the right lung, the inferior lobe of the right lung and the whole lung among patients with different clinical types (p<0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the volume percentage of pneumonia lesions for the whole lung for the diagnosis of severe/critical type COVID-19 was 0.740, with sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% and 58.8%, respectively.

Computer-assisted cognitive behavior therapy (CCBT) has been proposed as a method for improving access to effective psychotherapy, reducing cost, and increasing the convenience and efficiency of treatment for depression. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether clinician-supported CCBT is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in primary care patients with depression and to examine the feasibility and implementation of CCBT in a primary care population with substantial numbers of patients with low income, limited internet access, and low levels of educational attainment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial included adult primary care patients from clinical practices at the University of Louisville who scored 10 or greater on the Patient Health QuestionnaireC9 (PHQ-9) and were randomly assigned to CCBT or TAU for 12 weeks of active treatment. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3 and 6 months after treatment completion. Enrollment occurred from June 24, 2016, to May 13, 2019. The last follow-up assessment was conducted on January 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: CCBT included use of the 9-lesson computer program Good Days Ahead, along with as many as 12 weekly telephonic support sessions of approximately 20 minutes with a masters level therapist, in addition to TAU, which consisted of the standard clinical management procedures at the primary care sites. TAU was uncontrolled, but use of antidepressants and psychotherapy other than CCBT was recorded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure (PHQ-9) and secondary outcome measures (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire for negative cognitions, Generalized Anxiety DisorderC7, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale for quality of life) were administered at baseline, 12 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after treatment completion. Satisfaction with treatment was assessed with the Client Satisfaction QuestionnaireC8. RESULTS: The sample of 175 patients was predominately female (147 of 174 [84.5%]) and had a high proportion of individuals who identified as racial and ethnic minority groups (African American, 44 of 162 patients who reported [27.2%]; American Indian or Alaska Native, 2 [1.2%]; Hispanic, 4 [2.5%]; multiracial, 14 [8.6%]). An annual income of less than $30 000 was reported by 88 of 143 patients (61.5%). Overall, 95 patients (54.3%) were randomly assigned to CCBT and 80 (45.7%) to TAU. Dropout rates were 22.1% for CCBT (21 patients) and 30.0% for TAU (24 patients). An intent-to-treat analysis found that CCBT led to significantly greater improvement in PHQ-9 scores than TAU at posttreatment (mean difference, ?2.5; 95% CI, ?4.5 to ?0.8; P = .005) and 3 month (mean difference, ?2.3; 95% CI, ?4.5 to ?0.8; P = .006) and 6 month (mean difference, ?3.2; 95% CI, ?4.5 to ?0.8; P = .007) follow-up points. Posttreatment response and remission rates were also significantly higher for CCBT (response, 58.4% [95% CI, 46.4-70.4%]; remission, 27.3% [95% CI, 16.4%-38.2%]) than TAU (response, 33.1% [95% CI, 20.7%-45.5%]; remission, 12.0% [95% CI, 3.3%- 20.7%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, CCBT was found to have significantly greater effects on depressive symptoms than TAU in primary care patients with depression. Because the study population included people with lower income and lack of internet access who typically have been underrepresented or not included in earlier investigations of CCBT, results suggest that this form of treatment can be acceptable and useful in diverse primary care settings. Additional studies with larger samples are needed to address implementation procedures that could enhance the effectiveness of CCBT and to examine potential factors associated with treatment outcome.

The aim was to test the feasibility and utility of telerehabilitation to support future randomized controlled trials. Post-stroke aphasia is a common and disabling speech disorder, which significantly affects patients' and caregivers' health and quality of life. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, most of the conventional speech therapy approaches had to stop or \\"switch\\" into telerehabilitation procedures to ensure the safety of patients and operators but, concomitantly, the best rehabilitation level possible. Here, we planned a 5-month telespeech therapy programme, twice per week, of a patient with non-fluent aphasia following an intracerebral haemorrhage. Overall, treatment adherence based on the operator's assessments was high, and incomplete adherence for technical problems occurred very rarely. In line with the patient's feedback, acceptability was also positive, since he was constantly motivated during the sessions and the exercises performed autonomously, as confirmed by the speech therapist and caregiver, respectively. Moreover, despite the sequelae from the cerebrovascular event, evident in some writing tests due to the motor deficits in his right arm and the disadvantages typical of all telepractices, more relevant results were achieved during the telerehabilitation period compared to those of the \\"face-to-face\\" therapy before the COVID-19 outbreak. The telespeech therapy performed can be considered successful and the patient was able to return to work. Concluding, we support it as a feasible approach offering patients and their families the opportunity to continue the speech and language rehabilitation pathway, even at the time of pandemic.","output":"Post-stroke aphasia at the time of COVID-19 pandemic: a telerehabilitation perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outcomes 1. Discuss health professionals perceptions of the contributions of palliative care consultation in COVID-19 inpatient care 2. Recognize the effect of palliative care consultation on health professionals self-reported psychological distress Original Research Background Palliative care (PC) programs worldwide became immediately involved in caring for patients with COVID-19 together with other health professionals. Research Objectives The study aimed to determine health professionals perceptions of the contributions and helpfulness of PC consultation for COVID-19 care and describe its effect on their own psychological distress. Methods This was a survey-based cross-sectional study of physicians, nurses, advance practice providers, and case managers at two acute care hospitals in a large hospital system in the midwestern United States. Eligible participants completed a 17-item questionnaire on demographic and work-related information, contributions and helpfulness of PC consultation, self-reported psychological distress, and likelihood of working with PC in the future. Results Of 427 health professionals invited to participate, 76 responded (18%). Among 64 eligible respondents, 72% were female, 56% were under the age 40, 40.6% were nurses, 28.1% were physicians, and 66% worked in the intensive care unit. The PC team was perceived as helpful in managing pain and other symptoms, coordinating care between providers, discussing end-of-life preferences, communicating with patients and families, and supporting the care team. Median self-reported psychological distress was 7 (range, 2-10). Twenty-five (39%) participants agreed that PC eased distress by communicating with patients, families and other professionals, providing guidance in difficult conversations, and offering companionship. Among respondents, 84% would probably work with PC in the future. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals perceived working with the PC team as helpful in caring for patients and families and in easing their own psychological distress. Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice During the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals perceived working with the PC team as helpful in caring for patients and families and in easing their own psychological distress.

Solid waste items were collected annually for 5 years from 2017 to 2021 from seven stations located in Bor?ka Dam Lake (B1CB4) and Murgul Stream (M1CM3) in the Artvin Province. The highest densities by number and weight were recorded at M3 in 2020 (5.72 items/m(2)) and M1 in 2020 (0.39 kg/m(2)), respectively. However, no significant difference in density was recorded (p < 0.05) between the years. Plastic was the most abundant waste material by number of items in all the stations with a percentage contribution varying between 25.47 and 88.89%. There was a considerable increase in medical items during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020C2021. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and ANOSIM results revealed visually and statistically significant differences in solid waste composition between the years and stations. The dissimilarity between the years was driven by plastic and medical waste. The main sources of solid waste were river transportation (22.93%), improper disposal (20.74%), aquaculture activities (16.42%), and recreational and tourism activities (14.72%). The results of our study can be a baseline for transportation models, local administrations, and non-governmental organizations.

Firstly, this research aims at helping countries implement an equitable, innovative and context-appropriate stay-home game plan for the millions of disadvantaged and under-privileged students severely affected by the forfeiture of school closures; and secondly, this study proclaims that the burgeoning popularity of gamification has the potential to lay the bedrock foundation for Literacy in the New Norm. Design/methodology/approach: The temporal closure of schools around the world to limit the spread of the COVID-19 has resulted in massive educational disruptions triggering adverse effects and bringing much of education under grave threat. Through a review of the current empirical and conceptual literature, this study proposes a new gamification concept in a non-technology environment. Findings: Well underway are global dialogues that hold conversations on implementing mitigation strategies to counter the looming global health crisis. This has generated the impetus for a more concerted effort by concerned governments and international organizations to identify appropriate solutions for the continuity of learning so that the learning never stops. While educators and learners plunge further into the core of reconstructing education, the authors recognize that the fundamentals of technology and virtual connectivity have all along contributed to the multi-faceted e-learning stage set. However, concerns regarding the paradigm shift to remote online learning would certainly exacerbate inequalities cardinally felt across disadvantaged communities around the globe. Originality/value: As the world is currently bound by strict isolation measures, learners of all ages have been relegated to the confines of their homes.

The success of Mohs relies on accurate histopathologic evaluation. Due to law restrictions in some European countries Mohs surgeons are not permitted to report on histopathology, therefore a pathologist evaluates the frozen sections. OBJECTIVE To retrospectively assess the concordance between the certified Mohs surgeon and the pathologist in evaluating the Mohs slides that were intraoperatively evaluated by the pathologist. MATERIALS AND METHODS Frozen section slides of a total of 237 Mohs cases between 2013-2020 were examined by the blinded Mohs surgeon and the tumors were marked on copy maps. The copy maps and the original maps were compared and the non-concordant cases were reevaluated together by the Mohs surgeon and the dermatopathologist. The concordance rate was calculated and the inter-rater agreement was statistically analyzed using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. RESULTS We report high concordance rate (97.9%) and inter-rater agreement (0.96) of Mohs surgeon and dermatopathologist in evaluating Mohs slides. CONCLUSION As a newly settled center, our results are in alignment with experienced centers where the Mohs surgeon evaluates the slides herself and performs the surgery.","output":"Concordance Between a Mohs Surgeon and a Dermatopathologist in Evaluating Mohs Cryosections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MALDI-TOF-MS has essentially delivered more than expected with respect to clinical pathogens.

From the farming perspective, disruption of critical input availability, supply chains and labor, influence crop management. Disruptions to food systems can affect (a) planting area; and (b) crop yields. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the impacts of COVID-19 on major cereal crop's production and their cascading impact on national economy and related policies. METHODS: We used the calibrated crop simulation model (DSSAT suite) to project the impact of potential changes in planting area and grain yield of four major cereal crops (i.e., rice, maize, sorghum, and millet) in Senegal and Burkina Faso in terms of yield, total production, crop value and contribution to agricultural gross domestic product (GDP). Appropriate data (i.e., weather, soil, crop, and management practices) for the specific agroecological zones were used as an input in the model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulated yields for 2020 were then used to estimate crop production at country scale for the matrix of different scenarios of planting area and yield change (?15, ?10, ?5, 0, +5, +10%). Depending on the scenario, changes in total production of four cereals combined at country levels varied from 1.47 M tons to 2.47 M tons in Senegal and 4.51 M tons to 7.52 M tons in Burkina Faso. The economic value of all four cereals under different scenarios ranged from $771 Million (M) to $1292 M in Senegal and from $1251 M to $2098 M in Burkina Faso. These estimated total crop values under different scenarios were compared with total agricultural GDP of the country (in 2019 terms which was $3995 M in Senegal and $3957 M in Burkina Faso) to assess the economic impact of the pandemic on major cereal grain production. Based on the scenarios, the impact on total agricultural GDP can change ?7% to +6% in Senegal and ? 8% to +9% in Burkina Faso. SIGNIFICANCE: Results obtained from this modeling exercise will be valuable to policymakers and end-to-end value chain practitioners to prepare and develop appropriate policies to cope or manage the impact of COVID-19 on food systems.","output":"Projecting potential impact of COVID-19 on major cereal crops in Senegal and Burkina Faso using crop simulation models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inadequate supply of filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) for healthcare workers during a pandemic such as the novel coronavirus outbreak (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue.

METHODS: Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H(2)O (7.97-11.70 mm H(2)O) vs 9.85 mm H(2)O (8.33-11.44 mm H(2)O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m(2) resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A >3 log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m(2). Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m(2)) and did not find evidence of compromise. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m(2) or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.","output":"Decontaminating N95 and SN95 masks with Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI) does not impair mask efficacy and safety: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pedestrian detection and tracking in video surveillance systems is a complex task in computer vision research, which has widely used in many applications such as abnormal action detection, human pose, crowded scenes, fall detection in elderly humans, social distancing detection in the Covid-19 pandemic. This task is categorized into two sub-tasks: detection, and re-identification task. Previous methods independently treat two sub-tasks, only focusing on the re-identification task without employing re-detection. Since the performance of pedestrian detection directly affects the results of tracking, leveraging the detection task is crucial for improving the re-identification task. The total inference time is computed in both the detection and re-identification process, quite far from real-time speed. This paper joins both sub-tasks in a single end-to-end network based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Moreover, the detection includes the classification and regression task. As both tasks have a positive correlation, separately learning classification and regression hurts the overall performance. Hence, this work introduces the Regression-Aware Classification Feature (RACF) module to improve feature representation. The convolutional layer is the core component of CNNs, which extracts local features without modeling global features. Therefore, the Cross-Global Context (CGC) is proposed to form long-range dependencies for learning appearance embedding of re-identification features.

The first-principles calculations revealed that the anisotropic carrier transport property of Zn5In2S8 (Z5) is much stronger than that of ZnIn2S4 (Z1). Furthermore, unsynchronized electron and hole transport leads to higher bulk carrier separation efficiency in Z5. After accelerating the surface photocatalytic reaction rate by Ag2S modification, the differences between 3A/Z5 and 3A/Z1 in the bulk carrier separation were further enlarged. Photoelectrochemical tests confirmed that the bulk charge separation efficiency of 3A/Z5 is 13.70%, which is 7.4 times higher than 3A/Z1 (1.84%). Because of the high bulk carrier separation efficiency, the 3A/Z5 exhibits a promising photocatalytic hydrogen production rate, reaching 3189 mol h-1 g-1. Through intuitive evidence, this work proves that material with stronger anisotropic conductivity has higher bulk carrier separation efficiency, thus has the potential to exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.","output":"Effect of anisotropic conductivity of Ag2S-modified Zn m In2S3+m (m = 1, 5) on the photocatalytic properties in solar hydrogen evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE We assessed the prevalence and variables associated with haloperidol use for delirium in ICU patients and explored any associations of haloperidol use with 90-day mortality. METHODS All acutely admitted, adult ICU patients were screened during a 2-week inception period. We followed the patient throughout their ICU stay and assessed 90-day mortality. We assessed patients and their variables in the first 24 and 72 h in ICU and studied their association together with that of ICU characteristics with haloperidol use. RESULTS We included 1260 patients from 99 ICUs in 13 countries. Delirium occurred in 314/1260 patients [25% (95% confidence interval 23-27)] of whom 145 received haloperidol [46% (41-52)]. Other interventions for delirium were benzodiazepines in 36% (31-42), dexmedetomidine in 21% (17-26), quetiapine in 19% (14-23) and olanzapine in 9% (6-12) of the patients with delirium. In the first 24 h in the ICU, all subtypes of delirium [hyperactive, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 29.7 (12.9-74.5); mixed 10.0 (5.0-20.2); hypoactive 3.0 (1.2-6.7)] and circulatory support 2.7 (1.7-4.3) were associated with haloperidol use. At 72 h after ICU admission, circulatory support remained associated with subsequent use of haloperidol, aOR 2.6 (1.1-6.9). Haloperidol use within 0-24 h and within 0-72 h of ICU admission was not associated with 90-day mortality [aOR 1.2 (0.5-2.5); p = 0.66] and [aOR 1.9 (1.0-3.9); p = 0.07], respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our study, haloperidol was the main pharmacological agent used for delirium in adult patients regardless of delirium subtype.

Nepalese people are rich in traditional medicine especially in folk medicine (ethnomedicine), and this system is gaining much attention after 1995. The use of medicinal plants has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as a private behavior (not under the control of government). A lot of misinterpretations of the use of medicinal plants to treat or prevent COVID-19 have been spreading throughout Nepal which need to be managed proactively. In this context, a research was needed to document medicinal plants used, their priority of use in society, their cultivation status, and the source of information people follow to use them. This study aimed to document the present status of medicinal plant use and make important suggestion to the concerned authorities. METHODS: This study used a web-based survey to collect primary data related to medicinal plants used during COVID-19. A total of 774 respondents took part in the survey. The study calculated the relative frequencies of citation (RFC) for the recorded medicinal plants. The relationship between plants recorded and different covariates (age, gender education, occupation, living place, and treatment methods) was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon test. The relationship between the information sources people follow and the respondent characteristics was assessed using chi-square test. RESULTS: The study found that the use of medicinal plants has increased during COVID-19 and most of the respondents recommended medicinal plants to prevent COVID-19. This study recorded a total of 60 plants belonging to 36 families. The leaves of the plants were the most frequently used. The Zingiber officinale was the most cited species with the frequency of citation 0.398. Most of the people (45.61%) were getting medicinal plants from their home garden. The medicinal plants recorded were significantly associated with the education level, location of home, primary treatment mode, gender, and age class. The information source of plants was significantly associated with the education, gender, method of treatment, occupation, living with family, and location of home during the lockdown caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: People were using more medicinal plants during COVID-19 claiming that they can prevent or cure COVID-19. This should be taken seriously by concerned authorities.

Yet, little is known about the contextual determinants that influence their implementation success. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), this study identifies factors enabling or challenging the implementation of interventions aimed at mitigating immigration-related stressors in the healthcare context. METHODS: We used a qualitative research design to conduct 38 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in implementation of interventions at 25 healthcare facilities across 5 states with the highest undocumented immigrant populations (California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois). Interviews were conducted from May through August 2018. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify barrier and facilitator themes. Deductive coding was thereafter used to categorize themes according to CFIR domain. RESULTS: Barriers to implementation included perceptions of legal complexity and challenges to adopting such systemic strategies. Facilitators included a national policy climate that had brought immigrant health to the forefront, allowing for leveraging momentum towards institutional change; communication among healthcare personnel; existing community partnerships with immigrant rights and service organizations; and a shared sense of mission centering health equity. Local variation in immigration-related policies (e.g., local law agencies enforcing federal immigration laws) and heterogeneity of local immigrant communities also impacted implementation. Champions and informal leaders were integral to institutional efforts but not sufficient for sustainability. Perceived urgency to act superseded evaluation considerations, with all interventions in initial phases of implementation. Future iterations and evaluations of these interventions are needed to establish best practices and implementation determinants. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic study describing implementation determinants of immigration-related interventions across health systems.

Updated burden estimates are needed to characterize long-term changes in the epidemiology of these viruses. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate excess mortality from RSV and influenza in the US from 1999 to 2018. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from 50.3 million US death certificates from 1999 to 2018 to create age-specific linear regression models and assess weekly mortality fluctuations above a seasonal baseline associated with RSV and influenza. Statistical analysis was performed for 1043 weeks from January 3, 1999, to December 29, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Excess mortality associated with RSV and influenza estimated from the difference between observed and expected underlying respiratory mortality each season. RESULTS: There were 50.3 million death certificates (50.1% women and 49.9% men; mean [SD] age at death, 72.7 [18.6] years) included in this analysis, 1.0% for children younger than 1 year and 73.4% for adults aged 65 years or older. A mean of 6549 (95% CI, 6140-6958) underlying respiratory deaths were associated with RSV annually, including 96 (95% CI, 92-99) deaths among children younger than 1 year. For influenza, there were 10 171 (95% CI, 9652-10 691) underlying respiratory deaths per year, with 23 deaths (95% CI, 19-27) among children younger than 1 year. The highest mean mortality rate per 100 000 population for both viruses was among adults aged 65 years or older at 14.7 (95% CI, 13.8-15.5) for RSV and 20.5 (95% CI, 19.4-21.5) for influenza. A lower proportion of influenza deaths occurred among those aged 65 years or older compared with earlier estimates (75.1% [95% CI, 67.4%-82.8%]). Influenza mortality was highest among those aged 65 years or older in seasons when A/H3N2 predominated (18 739 [95% CI, 16 616-21 336] deaths in 2017-2018) and among those aged 5 to 49 years when A/H1N1pdm2009 predominated (1683 [95% CI, 1583-1787] deaths in 2013-2014). Results were sensitive to the choice of mortality outcome and method, with the broadest outcome associated with annual means of 23 352 (95% CI, 21 814-24 891) excess deaths for RSV and 27 171 (95% CI, 25 142-29 199) for influenza. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that RSV poses a greater risk than influenza to infants, while both are associated with substantial mortality among elderly individuals. Influenza has large interannual variability, affecting different age groups depending on the circulating virus. The emergence of the influenza A/H1N1pdm2009 pandemic virus in 2009 shifted mortality toward middle-aged adults, a trend still observed to date.

Further, &#945;-ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of &#945;-ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys145 S?3H) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the &#945;-ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys145 S?3H to His41 N? forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the &#945;-keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the &#945;-keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal.

The carboxy-terminal 223 residues of the CD163 molecule are not required for interactions with either the GP2a or the GP4 protein, although these residues are required for conferring susceptibility to PRRSV infection in BHK-21 cells. Overall, we conclude that the GP4 protein is critical for mediating interglycoprotein interactions and, along with GP2a, serves as the viral attachment protein that is responsible for mediating interactions with CD163 for virus entry into susceptible host cell.","output":"The minor envelope glycoproteins GP2a and GP4 of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus interact with the receptor CD163."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a growing global health threat. The Stockholm Paradigm suggests that their toll will grow tragically in the face of climate change, in particular. The best research protocol for predicting and preventing infectious disease emergence states that an urgent search must commence to identify unknown human and animal pathogens. This short communication proposes that the ethnobiological knowledge of indigenous and impoverished communities can be a source of information about some of those unknown pathogens. I present the ecological and anthropological theory behind this proposal, followed by a few case studies that serve as a limited proof of concept. This paper also serves as a call to action for the medical anthropology community. It gives a brief primer on the EID crisis and how anthropology research may be vital to limiting its havoc on global health.

Although platelet count increased over time (+0.9810(9) units/Lyear [95% confidence interval: 0.12; 1.84]), MedDiet interventions moderated this increase, particularly in individuals with near-high baseline count (both MedDiets combined: ?3.2010(9) units/Lyear [?5.81; ?0.59]). Thrombocytopenia incidence was lower in the MedDiet interventions (incidence rates: 2.23% in control diet, 0.91% in MedDiets combined; hazard ratio: 0.44 [0.23; 0.83]). Finally, thrombocytopenia was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 4.71 [2.69; 8.24]), but this relationship was attenuated in those allocated to MedDiet (p-interaction = 0.018).

However, the prognosis and early treatment response in hospitalized CAP patients based on serial neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) measurement has never been investigated. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study for 175 consecutive patients hospitalized with CAP between February 2016 and February 2018. NLR, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin levels were measured on admission day (D1) and on hospital day 4 (D4). The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) was also assessed on admission. The primary endpoint was all-cause death within 30 days after admission. The secondary endpoint was early treatment response such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospitalization and clinical unstability on day 4. RESULTS: The 30-day mortality rate was 9.7%. In multivariate analysis, NLR D4 (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.04C1.18; P = 0.003) and its incremental change (NLR D4/D1 >1) (OR: 7.10; 95% CI: 2.19C23.06; P = 0.001) were significant predictors of 30-day mortality. NLR D4 and its incremental change were significant predictors of ICU admission and clinical unstability on day 4 in multivariate analyses. Adding of incremental NLR change significantly improved the prognostic ability of the PSI. The additive value of incremental NLR change for the prognostic ability of the PSI was larger than that of incremental CRP change.

Physical strength work has been reported to improve the clinical picture of people with depression. Objective. To determine the relationship between lower body strength, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), depression status and body mass index (BMI) in older women with depression. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study with 685 elder women with depression. Results: A mild direct correlation (Rho = ?0.29; p  0.001) between stand-ip test and EQ-5D-3L test was shown. There is a mild inverse correlation between stand-up test and six of fifteen items of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Rho item 1 = ?0.24; p  0.001; item 4 = 0.11; p  0.001; item 5 = ?0.20; p  0.001; item 7 = ?0.15; p  0.001; item 11 = ?0.19; p  0.001; item 13 = ?0.21; p  0.001).

Patients were randomly assigned to control (sumatriptan and placebo) or intervention (propofol and sumatriptan) groups for comparison of the efficacy and side effects of treatment. Results In this study, 60 patients were included whose mean age was 318.8 years, and headaches were more common among women. After 30 and 60 minutes from the beginning of treatment, the mean pain score reduction in the intervention group was significantly greater than that in the control group (p=0.012, p=0.024). In addition, the rate of chest tightness in the control group was significantly higher than the intervention group.

This paper examines how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the life of families and if long-term support in the context of early childhood intervention could be continued. The following analyses are based on qualitative research with psychosocially stressed mothers of young children, two surveys of health professionals who provide long-term support to families in early childhood intervention, and a survey of municipal actors who are responsible for the management and implementation of early childhood intervention in German communities. During the pandemic, families in high-stress conditions report existential fears and general overstrain. Intrafamilial conflicts seem to increase. Home visits in the context of long-term psychosocial support were initially primarily replaced by phone calls, video calls or other forms of support from a distance. During the course of the pandemic, many professionals have begun conducting home visiting again, but several elements of support from a distance continue to be used as a supplement. Due to the pandemic-related additional burdens on the families who were accompanied by early childhood intervention, the continuation of support was even more important than it already was. Having been tested by necessity during the pandemic, several formats of support from a distance may have the potential to complement the usual assistance provided by health professionals in early childhood intervention and thus contribute to its quality development push.","output":"Frhe Hilfen aus der Distanz C Chancen und Herausforderungen bei der Untersttzung psychosozial belasteter Familien in der COVID-19-Pandemie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) is indicated for treatment-naive and experienced people with HIV; however, questions remain about its utility in a test-and-treat setting because of potential transmitted resistance and baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection.

METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in 16 primary care practices: 6 solo working, 4 monodisciplinary and 7 multidisciplinary. Twenty-one people (doctors, nurses, dieticians) were interviewed, using semi-structured video interviews. A thematic analysis was done using the domains of the Chronic Care Model (CCM). RESULTS: Three themes emerged: changes in health care organization, risk stratification and self-management support. All participating practices reported drastic changes in organization with a collective shift towards COVID-19 care, and reduction of chronic care activities, less consultations, and staff responsible for self-management support put on hold. A transition to digital support did not occur. Few practitioners had a systematic approach to identify and contact high-risk patients for early follow-up. A practice with a pre-established structured team collaboration managed to continue most chronic care elements. Generally, practitioners expected no effects of the temporary disruption for patients, although they expressed concern about patients already poorly regulated.

In such contexts, the establishment of the CCM can facilitate continuity of care in crisis times. Short term actions should be directed to facilitate identifying high-risk patients and to develop a practice organization plan to organize chronic care and use digital channels for support, especially to vulnerable patients, during next waves of the epidemic.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on chronic care according to providers: a qualitative study among primary care practices in Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Children born to parents with severe mental illness have gained more attention during the last decades because of increasing evidence documenting that these children constitute a population with an increased risk of developing mental illness and other negative life outcomes. Because of high-quality research with cohorts of offspring with familial risk and increased knowledge about geneCenvironment interactions, early interventions and preventive strategies are now being developed all over the world. Adolescence is a period characterized by massive changes, both in terms of physical, neurologic, psychological, social, and behavioral aspects. It is also the period of life with the highest risk of experiencing onset of a mental disorder. Therefore, investigating the impact of various risk and resilience factors in adolescence is important. METHODS: The Danish High-Risk and Resilience Study started data collection in 2012, where 522 7-year-old children were enrolled in the first wave of the study, the VIA 7 study. The cohort was identified through Danish registers based on diagnoses of the parents. A total of 202 children had a parent diagnosed with schizophrenia, 120 children had a parent diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and 200 children had parents without these diagnoses. At age 11 years, all children were assessed for the second time in the VIA 11 study, with a follow-up retention rate of 89%. A comprehensive assessment battery covering domains of psychopathology, neurocognition, social cognition and behavior, motor development and physical health, genetic analyses, attachment, stress, parental functioning, and home environment was carried out at each wave. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and electroencephalograms were included from age 11 years. This study protocol describes the third wave of assessment, the VIA 15 study, participants being 15 years of age and the full, 3-day-long assessment battery this time including also risk behavior, magnetoencephalography, sleep, and a white noise paradigm. Data collection started on May 1, 2021. DISCUSSION: We will discuss the importance of longitudinal studies and cross-sectional data collection and how studies like this may inform us about unmet needs and windows of opportunity for future preventive interventions, early illness identification, and treatment in the future.","output":"The Danish High-Risk and Resilience StudyVIA 15 C A Study Protocol for the Third Clinical Assessment of a Cohort of 522 Children Born to Parents Diagnosed With Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder and Population-Based Controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The US has experienced a series of epidemics during the past five decades. None has tested the nation's resilience like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has laid bare critical weaknesses in US pandemic preparedness and domestic leadership and the nation's decline in global standing in public health. Pandemic response has been politicized, proven public health measures undermined, and public confidence in a science-based public health system reduced. This has been compounded by the large number of citizens without ready access to health care, who are overrepresented among infected, hospitalized, and fatal cases. Here, as part of the National Academy of Medicine's Vital Directions for Health and Health Care: Priorities for 2021 initiative, we review the US approach to pandemic preparedness and its impact on the response to COVID-19. We identify six steps that should be taken to strengthen US pandemic resilience, strengthen and modernize the US health care system, regain public confidence in government leadership in public health, and restore US engagement and leadership in global partnerships to address future pandemic threats domestically and around the world.","output":"Infectious Disease Threats: A Rebound To Resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the therapeutic and safety performance of an intramuscular treatment protocol of multidose of allogeneic adipose stem cells (ASCs) isolated, characterized, and expanded ex vivo from a healthy canine donor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve dogs diagnosed with canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) were intramuscularly treated with 0.510(6) of cryopreserved ASCs from a healthy immunized young canine Ehrlichia canis free donor weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by the pruritus index and the CAD Lesion Index (CADLI) test. Safety and adverse effects were determined by injection site reaction, weight, blood chemistry, liver function, and whole blood count. RESULTS: Canine ASCs obtained from a donor met the minimum qualities required for this type of cells and showed viability of 90% after thawing. The efficacy of the CADLI score and the pruritus index in 12 dogs with atopic dermatitis was statistically significant efficacy. No adverse reactions were observed at the intramuscular application site, or in relation to animal weight, blood cell populations, or liver and renal function. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that intramuscular administration of cryopreserved ASCs to dogs with atopic dermatitis is a promising cellular therapeutic product for the relief of the symptoms of this disease; however, the duration of the effects obtained with this dose and with other doses should be evaluated, as well as possible immune reactions. As far as we know, this is the first report of the use of multiple intramuscular doses cryopreserved ASCs to treat atopic dermatitis.","output":"Multidose intramuscular allogeneic adipose stem cells decrease the severity of canine atopic dermatitis: A pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy (VAL) is a common finding on 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations following Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination. However, data regarding VAL on 18F-rhPSMA-7.3-ligand PET are currently lacking. This study assesses its prevalence, temporal response to vaccination and characteristics of VAL. Methods: 233 consecutive vaccinated and 41 unvaccinated patients with confirmed prostate cancer who underwent 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT were retrospectively analyzed. Size and uptake of the axillary lymph nodes were measured. Ratios of SUVmax of ipsilateral to contralateral axillary lymph node (SUVratio) were determined. The characteristics of SUVratio in respect to the duration of PSMA avidity in axillary lymph node after COVID-19 vaccination was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of VAL on 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET was 45%. Up to a period of 8 weeks following last COVID-19 vaccination SUVratio was positive (2.05 + 0.17). Thereafter, SUVratio dropped significantly (1.35 + 0.09) and approached the value of unvaccinated group (1.1 + 0.2). SUVratio of metastatic axillary lymph nodes was very high (>11) and can be easily detected visually or semi quantitatively. In 3 patients we observed suspected development and consecutively confirmed involving metastasis of axillary lymph node with SUVratio between 4.0 to 6.6. Correlation between SUVratio and lymph node size (r=0.93, p<0.0001) and lymph node size and duration following vaccine (r=-0.88, p<0.0008) was found. Conclusion: Increased uptake of the PSMA-ligand 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 by axillary lymph nodes is common after COVID-19 vaccination and can persist for 8 weeks. This finding should be considered in the interpretation of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT examinations.","output":"Temporary reactive response of axillary lymph nodes to COVID-19 vaccination on 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the coronavirus outbreak, YouTube has altered its content moderation policies to surface more authoritative information while removing videos that contain medically unsubstantiated claims.

The recycling of biological wastes by aerobic or anaerobic biotechnological treatment is necessary to protect the environment and to save natural resources. The recycling process may be conducted either in large-scale plants operated mostly in urban industrial areas, or in small plants operated primarily in the rural environment to improve the farmer's income. A relatively large number of pathogens are found in solid and liquid organic wastes and the most prevalent are bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Fungi present in wastes and materials used for composting are mainly of interest from the point of view of occupational health and phytohygiene. The presence of parasites or their infective stages in wastes or residues of plant, animal, or human origin depends on the nature of the wastes and the level of pretreatment. Parasites are of veterinary and medical importance if the raw materials used for composting are generated in wastewater treatment facilities or in slaughterhouses. Plant pathogenic parasites must also be considered, even if some of them are highly specialized on certain plants, which limit their epidemiological importance.

Oral agents are the cornerstone of chronic pain treatment, but their use may be limited in certain patients, particularly the elderly. Topical therapies offer advantages over systemically administered medications, including the requirement of a lower total systemic daily dose for patients to achieve pain relief, site-specific drug delivery, and avoidance of first-pass metabolism, major drug interactions, infections, and systemic side effects. Several types of topical agents have been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with chronic pain. Both capsaicin and topical diclofenac have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with chronic soft-tissue pain. In patients with hand and knee osteoarthritis (OA), the American College of Rheumatology generally recommends oral treatments (acetaminophen, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], tramadol, and intra-articular corticosteroids) and topical NSAIDs equally, favoring topical agents only for patients who have pre-existing gastrointestinal risk or are aged  75 years. Topical NSAIDs have been shown to provide relief superior to that of placebo and comparable to that of oral ibuprofen. Similarly, ketoprofen gel has been shown to be superior to placebo and similar to oral celecoxib in reducing pain in patients with knee OA. Different formulations of topical diclofenac (including the diclofenac hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine patch, diclofenac sodium gel, and diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% w/w with dimethyl sulfoxide USP) have been shown to be superior to placebo and comparable to oral diclofenac in the treatment of patients with pain due to knee OA, with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than with the oral formulation. In patients with neuropathic pain, topical forms of both capsaicin and lidocaine have been shown to be useful in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Lidocaine has also demonstrated efficacy in relieving patient pain due to complex regional pain syndrome and may be useful in the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain who have cancer, although clinical trial results have not been consistent.

This is partly because technological advances have made the equipment less expensive and simpler to use and partly because increasing health care costs and patient expectations have increased the need to find alternative modes of health care delivery. Introduction: Telemedicine and telepsychiatry, in particular, are rapidly becoming important delivery approaches to providing clinical care and information to patients in cases wherein the medical resources and the patients are very hard to be brought together with respect to rules of behavior in case of epidemics. The reliance on technology to bridge the obstacles between the patients (consumers) and medical resources (providers) can create problems that impact service delivery and outcomes, but in cases such as this (COVID-19 pandemics), this is virtually the only tool for providing clinical care and information to patients. Materials and Methods: A client satisfaction survey was undertaken in a daily hospital (a part of University Clinic of Psychiatry in Skopje). The anonymous modified self-report questionnaire (short form patient satisfaction questionnaire [PSQ-18]) covering demographic, gender, and age variables was endorsed by 28 participants. The mean age of the subjects was 40.25  22 years, with a small majority of men (18 participants) versus women (11 participants). Results: Overall satisfaction with psychiatric care was high (80.22%).

Conflicting evidence exists whether patients with POAF after cardiac surgery have an increased long-term risk of stroke and other adverse events. Methods and Results We prospectively followed for up to 5 years 4624 patients without prior atrial fibrillation who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting in an international study. POAF was defined as atrial fibrillation that occurred during the initial hospitalization for surgery, lasted for 5 minutes, and required treatment. Outcomes assessed were a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, and its individual components. Median age was 67 years, and 778 (16.8%) had an episode of POAF. The incidence of the composite outcome was 6.84 and 4.10 per 100 patient-years in patients with and without POAF, and the incidence of stroke was 0.75 versus 0.45, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.16-1.59) for the composite outcome; 1.33 (95% CI, 1.10-1.61) for death; 1.58 (95% CI, 1.23-2.02) for myocardial infarction, and 1.27 (95% CI, 0.81-2.00) for stroke. In a landmark analysis excluding events of the initial hospital admission, the aHRs were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.03-1.54) for the composite outcome, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.03-1.59) for death, 1.70 (95% CI, 0.86-3.36) for myocardial infarction, and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.59-1.93) for stroke.

The office term is 2 years. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to learn and inform about the results of MIRAI's activities. METHODS: We surveyed the trends in new obstetrician-gynecologists and also matched each seminar participant with them. RESULT: The number of new memberships has been increasing since the nadir in 2016. In particular, there are over 100 more new physicians specializing in the field in 2020 than there were at the nadir in 2016. It was revealed that approximately 50% of the participants in the summer school specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. Furthermore, approximately 70% of POP2 participants specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, which shows that these two recruitment seminars are extraordinarily effective events that result in an increase in the number of new obstetricians and gynecologists.

The effect of COVID-19 is more in developing economies where industrial sector is already struggling for its stability. This study introduces the impact of COVID-19 on the corporate investment behavior of non-financial publicly listed firms of Pakistan. To achieve the objective, we employ the panel data ranging from 2010 to 2020 and apply the difference-in-differences (DID) model to quantifies the empirical relationship. The outcomes of DID model suggest that the pandemic period and treatment have a significant and negative impact on corporate capital investment behavior. During pandemic spread period, the enterprises have limited their investment into fixed assets due to less productive use of such assets. Similarly, industries that exist in high-impact areas face a negative investment growth rate due to quarantine policy, fewer social movements, and high installing cost of new machinery. However, this negative effect diminishes across those firms that have a quick cash inflow rate and more availability of bank loans. These two factors serve as a financial setback against the adversities of pandemic.

Methods In total, 154 patients presenting moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 had their oral mucosa examined twice a week until the final outcome, either discharge or death. The oral alterations observed in the patients were grouped into Group 1 (pre-existing conditions and opportunistic oral lesions) and Group 2 (oral mucosal changes related to hospitalization). Results Oral lesions found in the patients of Group 1 are not suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection as they are mainly caused by opportunistic infections. On the other hand, oral alterations found in the patients of Group 2 were statistically (P < 0.001) related to intubation and longer period of hospitalisation. Conclusion It is unlikely that ulcerative lesions in the oral cavity are a direct manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 or a marker of COVID-19 progression.","output":"Lack of direct association between oral mucosal lesions and SARS-CoV- 2 in a cohort of patients hospitalised with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper seek to understand the role of new technologies on transformation processes of special areas of business of travel intermediaries even emerging new entities that collaborate with both poles of tourism demand. Special attention is payed to results of modification of distribution channels to be competitive in online travel market. Softwer as channel manager is more than a tool, it is emerging as core intelligence that manage time, impacting on benefits from converegence. New technologies allowed new digital platforms (Booking, Airbnb, Expedia) making travel easier. The preferences of the postmodern tourist extend beyond the streamlined and impersonal experiences, services and products. Driven by the ambition of deviating from the beaten track, new generations of travellers are converging on digital platforms to retrieve recommendations and information from fellow travellers and local residents,i.e. sources other than traditional travel intermediaries. The COVID crisis has triggered a number of changes in the world of rental accommodation. Some of these changes are flexible cancellations, new market prices, and shorter booking window. High expections make preassure on attnders in channel of distribution. There is an even greater emphasis on cleanliness, privacy and security. At the end of the research, the results speak in favor of exceptional impact of new technology on business development as well as the role that human potential has in acquiring digital skills through education and training and providing their own tools or products that facilitate business.

Pharmacists in one-quarter of US states are able to prescribe hormonal contraception, a model known as pharmacy access. Pharmacy access became available in California in 2016 and Colorado in 2017. Objective To characterize how access to contraception products and services in pharmacies changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, including pharmacist prescribing practices and innovations in service delivery. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among California and Colorado pharmacists from September to October 2020. Survey questions included pharmacist and pharmacy practice site characteristics, prescribing practices, pharmacist perspectives, and pharmacy services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 128 pharmacists participated in the study with 38% (n=49) from California and 62% (n= 79) from Colorado. Among participants, 41% (n=53) prescribed contraception, of which 94% (n=50) continued, 4% (n=2) started, and 2% (n=1) suspended during the pandemic. Most participants reported interest (79%) and effort (75%) in prescribing contraception to be about the same during the pandemic. Community need for contraceptive services was perceived to be slightly or much higher (45%) or about the same (47%). Patient interest in pharmacy access was perceived to be slightly or much higher by 26% and about the same by 57%. When distributing contraception prescriptions, pharmacies increased curbside (from 12% to 52%), home delivery (from 40% to 60%), and mailing options (from 41% to 71%) during the pandemic. Conclusions Pharmacists prescribing hormonal contraception who participated in this study remained committed to providing this service during the pandemic. Some perceived increased community need for contraception and patient interest in direct pharmacy access.

The potential emissions from other pollutants were predicted by multiplying the weight of the burned waste by the emission factors available in the literature. The estimated waste burned in Semarang City in 2020C2021 was 58.8 Gg/year, or approximately 9.70% of the total waste generated in Semarang City. This estimation exceeds local government estimates of 2020 by two-fold. Peri-urban areas (both inner and outer) were identified as the most significant contributors to waste burning. Further, garden waste was the most burned waste (73.61%), followed by plastic waste (17.45%). Other wastes, including paper, leather, textile, rubber, and food, were also burned.

In our previous investigation, we found that TIPE2 expression displayed a decrease or absence in gastric tumor tissue, and the overexpression of TIPE2 suppressed the growth of gastric cancer tumors and cells, demonstrating that TIPE2 could be a potential medicinal target for gastric cancer treatment. However, its seldomly reported that several medicinal agents or candidates targeted TIPE2 for treating diseases, including gastric cancer. To identify the candidate targeting TIPE2 to fight against gastric cancer, several extractions from traditional natural medicinal plants with anti-tumor functions were employed to screen the active compounds according to bioassay-guided isolation. Interestingly, gracillin, a component from the ethyl acetate extraction of Rhizoma Paridis, was identified to induce the expression of TIPE2 and inhibit the cell proliferation in gastric cancer BGC-823 cells. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms that restrain gastric cancer were evaluated by clone formation, EdU staining, flow cytometry, and other assays. Meanwhile, the role of TIPE2 in the anti-tumor effect of gracillin was elucidated via the use of siTIPE2 RNA. It was determined that gracillin could fight against gastric cancer cells by inhibiting the cell proliferation participated by the PI3K/AKT pathway and cell cycle arrest, suppressing the EMT pathway-regulating cell migration, and inducing bcl2-associated mitochondrial apoptosis.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate a totally metal-free technique using a transosseous suturing method and to compare it with the traditional fixation technique. METHOD A total of 25 patients (mean age of 59.60 years) with displaced patellar fractures treated by a transosseous suturing technique were compared with a 1:1 matched historical control group that underwent modified tension-band-wire fixation. Union time, union rate, operation time, number of procedures, mean hospitalisation days and complications were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS Union time (8.43  2.92 vs. 8.64  2.82 weeks) and operation time (69.00  19.31 vs. 64.89  14.27 min) were not different between the two groups.

Most of the recommended precautionary measures are dependent on human behaviors and therefore their effectiveness largely depends on peoples' perception and attitudes toward the disease. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary measures taken in response to COVID-19 in North America. Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study, an online survey targeted to North Americans focused on the public's knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and precautionary behaviors taken in response to this pandemic. Descriptive analyses were performed for the whole population and the subgroup analyses contrasted the differences between Americans and Canadians. Results: The cohort comprised 1,264 relatively young participants with an average age of 28.6  9.8 years. The vast majority (&gt;90%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19. Regarding risk perception, about a quarter assumed to be at less risk to contract the disease, and 42.8% considered themselves to be less contagious than others. While the vast majority avoided performing risky behaviors, only a small proportion (13.2%) wore a face maskwhich is in line with the public health recommendations of the two countries at the time of data collection. Overall, a larger proportion of Canadian participants (55.8%) were satisfied with the performance of their national public health in response to the current pandemic, compared to their American counterparts (12.2%). Discussion: Data regarding the public's knowledge of COVID-19, risk perception, and behaviors in response to this pandemic is limited. The results of this study highlight that this relatively young and educated sample of North Americans had a high level of knowledge about COVID-19 and a large proportion of them were taking the precautionary measures against this pandemic. However, a significant number of individuals believe to be at less risk of contracting the disease compared to the general population.

Methods This retrospective study examined patients who underwent EUS-CDS for malignant distal biliary obstruction between October 2017 and May 2021 at the National Cancer Center, Japan. The primary outcome was a technical success without fistula dilation. Secondary outcomes were the overall technical success, clinical success, adverse events (AEs), procedure time, recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO), and time to RBO (TRBO). Results Forty-one patients were enrolled; 31 patients underwent EUS-CDS with fistula dilation using a conventional SEMS with 7.5-8.5-Fr delivery system (conventional SEMS group), and 10 patients underwent EUS-CDS without fistula dilation using the novel SEMS with a 5.9-Fr delivery system (novel SEMS group). In the novel SEMS group, the rate of technical success without fistula dilation was 90%. There were no differences in overall technical success (100% vs. 97%, p = 1.00), clinical success (80% vs. 90%, p = 0.58), and overall AEs (10% vs. 23%, p = 0.65) rates between the novel and conventional SEMS groups. In the novel SEMS group, no early AEs were observed and no bile leakage into the abdominal cavity was observed on the computed tomography scan after the procedure.

The diameter in the current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. METHODS: We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. RESULTS: Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 15X-20X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. CONCLUSION: Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to conventional group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.","output":"Group testing performance evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 massive scale screening and testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Some people with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst in others the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID\\\\19 disease and COVID\\\\19 pneumonia, leading some patients to require intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID\\\\19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID\\\\19 clinics, has COVID\\\\19 disease or COVID\\\\19 pneumonia. SEARCH METHODS: On 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID\\\\19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID\\\\19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID\\\\19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID\\\\19 disease and controls without COVID\\\\19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies including patients who contracted SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID\\\\19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full\\\\text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS\\\\2 checklist. Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots. We did not attempt meta\\\\analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID\\\\19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%. There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants). We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID\\\\19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID\\\\19 disease when present. Seven studies carried a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional four studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. These factors make it very difficult to determine the diagnostic properties of these signs and symptoms from the included studies. We also had concerns about the applicability of these results, since most studies included participants who were already admitted to hospital or presenting to hospital settings. This makes these findings less applicable to people presenting to primary care, who may have less severe illness and a lower prevalence of COVID\\\\19 disease. None of the studies included any data on children, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We hope that future updates of this review will be able to provide more information about the diagnostic properties of signs and symptoms in different settings and age groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID\\\\19 disease, are urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self\\\\isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing. We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell. Studies in older adults are especially important.","output":"Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID\\\\19 disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Different types of biologic mesh have been introduced as an alternative to synthetic mesh for use in repairing contaminated ventral hernias because of their biocompatible nature. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent complex ventral hernia repairs with either non cross-linked or cross-linked porcine dermal meshes. METHOD This was retrospective analysis from a prospectively maintained database from January 2010 to May 2013. Patients undergoing open incisional hernia repair with a biologic mesh in the presence of a clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty wound were reviewed. RESULTS There were 39 patients who underwent single-staged abdominal wall reconstruction for a contaminated ventral hernia with a biologic mesh. In 15 cases, non cross-linked mesh was used (Strattice, n=8; Protexa, n=1; XenMatrix, n=6); a cross-linked mesh was used in the remaining 24 cases (Permacol n=21; CollaMend n=3). The median follow-up was 11.9  10.6 months. The overall morbidity was 71.8% (n=28), with 15.4% (n=6) for grade I, 23.1% (n=9) for grade II, 23.1% (n=9) for grade III (n=3 grade IIIA, n=6 grade IIIB), 7.7% (n=3) for grade IV and 2.6% (n=1) for grade V. In the cross-linked group, there were six complications directly linked to the biologic mesh, compared with three in the non-cross-linked group. Overall wound morbidity was 41.0% (n=16). There were 13 hernia recurrences (33.3%), and recurrence rate was not significantly different for both groups. CONCLUSION Despite the high rate of wound morbidity associated with the single-staged reconstruction of contaminated fields, it can be safely performed with biologic mesh reinforcement.

Given the large number of unpreventable influences affecting adequate caloric intake, further research on preventable influences of adequate EN administration is warranted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether hang height of EN formula, formula viscosity, or flow rate influences pump accuracy and formula delivery. METHODS Formulas of varying viscosities (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 kcal/mL) were infused at different hang heights (0, 6, 12, and 18 inches) and rates (20, 40, and 80 mL/h). The mean percent difference and the bias between the programmed volume, volume reported, and volume delivered were calculated for the different hang heights, formula compositions, and infusion rates studied. RESULTS For all prespecified hang heights and infusion rates, the volume delivered was less than the programmed volume and volume reported; the mean percent difference increased as the hang height decreased. The volume was overestimated for both the programmed volume (14.4%  5.5%) and volume reported (12.9%  6.7%) compared with volume delivered. The overestimation bias was significantly influenced by differences in hang height as well as type of formula (P < .0001, each) but not by rate of delivery (P = .4633 for programmed volume and .8411 for volume reported).

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used in postmenopausal women to relieve some of the peri- and postmenopausal symptoms, while there is also evidence that the therapy may additionally partially reverse menopausal immune senescence. Flavonoids, and especially isoflavones, are widely used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, although it is not at present clear whether they can reverse or alleviate other menopausal changes. HRT reverses the menopausal CD4/CD8 ratio and also limits the general peri- and postmenopausal inflammatory state. Moreover, the increased levels of interleukins (IL)-1, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) are decreased after the initiation of HRT. However, some reports show no effect of HRT on IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12. It is thus evident that the molecular pathways connecting HRT and female immune senescence need to be clarified.

This secondary illness is characterized by formation and deposition of SAA amyloids in blood vessels, causing inflammation, thrombosis and sometimes organ failure, with symptoms resembling the multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) observed in some COVID-19 survivors. Hence, in order to understand better the danger of SAA amyloidosis in the context of COVID-19 we have used molecular dynamic simulations to study the effect of a SARS-COV-2 protein segment on SAA amyloid formation. We find that presence of the nine-residue segment SK9, located on the Envelope protein, increases the propensity for SAA fibril formation by three mechanisms: it reduces the stability of the lipid-transporting hexamer shifting the equilibrium toward monomers, it increases the frequency of aggregation-prone configurations in the resulting chains, and it raises the stability of SAA fibrils. Our results therefore suggest that SAA amyloidosis-related pathologies are a long-term risk of SARS-COV-2 infections.","output":"The effect of SARS-COV-2 Infections on Amyloid Formation of Serum Amyloid A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 causes global health problems, and new technologies have to be established to detect, anticipate, diagnose, screen, and even trace COVID-19 by all health care experts.

However, the occurrence of the disease in premenopausal females and males suggests that there may be more to the explanation than the level of female sex hormones. The purpose of the present study was to investigate estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity in the lacrimal sacs of individuals with and without chronic dacryocystitis. Methods: The study group included 50 female and 20 male patients diagnosed with chronic dacryocystitis. Lacrimal sac samples were taken during a dacryocystorhinostomy. The control group comprised 29 cadavers with no evidence of lacrimal system pathology in the health records. The samples were obtained transconjunctivally. Lacrimal sac samples from both groups were stained with the estrogen and progesterone receptor protein antigen. Fisher's exact test and a chi-square test were used to compare the receptor positivity results of premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and samples of those with dacryocystitis and cadaver sacs without the disease. Results: In the control group, estrogen receptor positivity was observed in the samples of 2 premenopausal females. In the study group, estrogen receptor positivity was seen in 4 premenopausal females. There was no significant difference in estrogen receptor positivity between the premenopausal and postmenopausal female groups (p=0.41). A similar result was not established between the premenopausal and postmenopausal females in case group (p=0.056).

A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic gastric bypasses between January 2012 and December 2017 was performed. Patients were divided into two different groups (RYGB-G and OAGB-G). PSM analysis was performed to minimize patient selection bias between the two types of sutures (barbed-BS and conventional-CS) in each group. A total of 808 patients were reviewed. After PSM, 488 (244 BS vs 244 CS) patients in RYGB-G and 48 in OAGB-G (24 BS vs 24 CS) patients were compared. Median operative time was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) for BS in RYGB-G. In OAGB-G, BS were associated with a shorter operative time, although no significant difference was observed (p = 0.183). Post-operative hospital stay was significantly shorter for BS in both the groups (p < 0.001). Post-operative 30th-day complications were comparable: no leakage or bleeding of GPJA was observed in BS groups. At median follow-up of 28.78 months, no late complications were observed.

Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 22% of the US economy's GDP, jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable.

COVID-19 patients often suffer from lung fibrosis, a serious and untreatable condition. There remains no effective treatment for these complications. Out of all cytokines, TNF and IL-6 play crucial roles in cytokine storm pathogenesis and are likely responsible for the escalation in disease severity. These cytokines also partake in the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed, that can efficiently and swiftly downregulate TNF, IL-6, and the inflammatory cytokine cascade, in order to curb inflammation and prevent fibrosis, and lead to disease remission. Cannabis sativa has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and is under investigation for several potential therapeutic applications against autoinflammatory diseases and cancer. Here, we hypothesized that the extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars may be used to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathways involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Initially, to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of novel C. sativa cultivars, we used a well-established full thickness human 3D skin artificial EpiDermFTTM tissue model, whereby tissues were exposed to UV to induce inflammation and then treated with extracts of seven new cannabis cultivars. We noted that out of seven studied extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars, three (#4, #8 and #14) were the most effective, causing profound and concerted down-regulation of COX2, TNF, IL-6, CCL2, and other cytokines and pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis. These data were further confirmed in the WI-38 lung fibroblast cell line model. Most importantly, one of the tested extracts had no effect at all, and one exerted effect that may be deleterious, signifying that careful cannabis cultivar selection must be based on thorough pre-clinical studies. The observed pronounced inhibition of TNF and IL-6 is the most important finding, because these molecules are currently considered to be the main targets in COVID-19 cytokine storm and ARDS pathogenesis. Novel anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 cannabis extracts can be useful additions to the current anti-inflammatory regimens to treat COVID-19, as well as various rheumatological diseases and conditions, and inflammaging - the inflammatory underpinning of aging and frailty.","output":"Fighting the storm: could novel anti-TNF and anti-IL-6 C. sativa cultivars tame cytokine storm in COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the first reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the scientific community working in the field of type III IFNs (IFN-&#955;) realized that this class of IFNs could play an important role in this and other emerging viral infections.

The clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia faces challenges, such as the difficulty to perform RT-PCR tests in real time, the lack of experienced radiologists, clinical low-quality images, and the similarity of imaging features of community-acquired pneumonia and COVID-19. Therefore, we proposed an artificial intelligence model GARCD that uses chest CT images to assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in real time. It can show better diagnostic performance even facing low-quality CT images. METHODS: We used 14,129 CT images from 104 patients. A total of 12,929 samples were used to build artificial intelligence models, and 1200 samples were used to test its performance. The image quality improvement module is based on the generative adversarial structure. It improves the quality of the input image under the joint drive of feature loss and content loss. The enhanced image is sent to the disease diagnosis model based on residual convolutional network. It automatically extracts the semantic features of the image and then infers the probability that the sample belongs to COVID-19. The ROC curve is used to evaluate the performance of the model. RESULTS: This model can effectively enhance the low-quality image and make the image that is difficult to be recognized become recognizable. The model proposed in this paper reached 97.8% AUC, 96.97% sensitivity and 91.16% specificity in an independent test set.

By comparing the performance with related works, it is proved that the model proposed has stronger clinical usability. CONCLUSION: The method proposed can effectively assist doctors in real-time detection of suspected cases of COVID-19 pneumonia even faces unclear image. It can quickly isolate patients in a targeted manner, which is of positive significance for preventing the further spread of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Artificial Intelligence Clinicians Can Use Chest Computed Tomography Technology to Automatically Diagnose Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia and Enhance Low-Quality Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nootkatone, an approved insecticide, is a well-known natural product from grapefruit.

To address these barriers, the VA launched a multifaceted implementation intervention focused on planning and educational strategies to increase MOUD delivery in 18 medical facilities. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a multifaceted intervention approach to increase MOUD delivery changed providers perceptions about MOUD over the first year of implementation. METHODS: Cross-disciplinary teams of clinic providers and leadership from primary care, pain, and mental health clinics at 18 VA medical facilities received invitations to complete an anonymous, electronic survey prior to intervention launch (baseline) and at 12- month follow-up. Responses were summarized using descriptive statistics, and changes over time were compared using regression models adjusted for gender and prescriber status, and clustered on facility. Responses to open-ended questions were thematically analyzed using a template analysis approach. RESULTS: Survey response rates at baseline and follow-up were 57.1% (56/98) and 50.4% (61/121), respectively. At both time points, most respondents agreed that MOUD delivery is important (94.7 vs. 86.9%), lifesaving (92.8 vs. 88.5%) and evidence-based (85.2 vs. 89.5%). Over one-third (37.5%) viewed MOUD delivery as time-consuming, and only 53.7% affirmed that clinic providers wanted to prescribe MOUD at baseline; similar responses were seen at follow-up (34.5 and 52.4%, respectively). Respondents rated their knowledge about OUD, comfort discussing opioid use with patients, job satisfaction, ability to help patients with OUD, and support from colleagues favorably at both time points.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)Cconfirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days. RESULTS: The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]).

The whole lung lesion ratio was associated with the levels of plasma fibrinogen (r=0.280, p<0.001), plasma D-dimer (r=0.248, p<0.001), serum -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (r=0.363, p<0.001), serum albumin (r=-0.300, p<0.001), and peripheral blood leukocyte count (r=0.194, p<0.001). Among the four patients groups categorised by whole lung lesion ratio, the highest frequency of cough (p<0.001) and shortness of breath (p<0.001) were found in the severe group, and the highest frequency of hypertension (p<0.001), diabetes (p<0.001) and anemia (p=0.039) were observed in the intermediate group. Based on baseline ordinal regression analysis, cough (p=0.009), shortness of breath (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.002), diabetes (p=0.005), and anemia (p=0.006) were independent risk factors for more severe lung lesions. Conclusions: : Based on AI-enabled CT quantitation , patients with initial symptoms of cough/shortness of breath, or with comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, or anemia, had a higher risk for more severe lung lesions on admission in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Association of Initial Symptoms or Comorbidities With Pneumonia Lesions in COVID-19 Patients: Based on Artificial Intelligence-Enabled CT Quantitation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"South Africa became one of the first African countries to receive the COVID-19 vaccine As the rest of Africa prepares to receive COVID-19 vaccines, most countries in Africa have set up national-level coordination committees for developing national vaccination deployment plans While the main focus of these committees has been on setting up strategies that facilitate the swift distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once they are available, the role of effective public health awareness should not be ignored Countries must devise strategies on how best to enhance public understanding and curb misinformation about the vaccines With this viewpoint, we unpack the threat of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and offer recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine communication strategies in the South African and Zimbabwean contexts","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Roll-Out in South Africa and Zimbabwe: Urgent Need to Address Community Preparedness, Fears and Hesitancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages persist amidst increasing COVID-19 caseloads These shortages encouraged some to pursue 3D printing to produce stopgap N95 alternatives The design presented is an adapter for a commercially available snorkel mask to serve as a full-face respirator, used in dire PPE shortages or in individuals who failed fit testing Masks were fit tested at The University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, KS The mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who previously failed fit testing, and all passed qualitative fit testing with the snorkel mask, adapter and viral filter apparatus The authors endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE","output":"3D-printed snorkel mask adapter for failed N95 fit tests and personal protective equipment shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the lack of an automatic COVID-19 diagnostic system to relieve congestion in health centers and to support the traceability of this disease, this article exposes the implementation of algorithms for automatic diagnosis of lung diseases such as COVID-19 and Pneumonia from chest X-rays (CXR) through GLCM and HOG features extraction using 6300 patches.

These networks can contain a variety of information types and represent different aspects of a system. However, the process for selecting which information to include is not always straightforward. Using data on two agonistic behaviors in a captive population of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), we developed a framework for investigating how pooling or splitting behaviors at the scale of dyadic relationships (between two individuals) affects group-level social properties. We designed two reference models to test whether randomizing the number of interactions across behavior types results in similar structural patterns as the observed data. Although the behaviors were correlated, the sociality measures derived from observed data fell outside the distribution of those derived from the reference model. However, once we controlled for data sparsity in our second reference model, we found that measures from the observed data then fell within the range of those from the reference model which showed that this result may have been due to the unequal frequencies of each observed behavior. Thus, our findings support pooling the two behaviors. This framework can be used for any type of behavior and question, however, caution should be used when interpreting the results as some measures are sensitive to data properties, such as unequal rates of observed behavior in our case. This framework will help researchers make informed and data-driven decisions about which behaviors to pool or separate, prior to using the data in subsequent multilayer network analyses.","output":"A framework to evaluate whether to pool or separate behaviors in a multilayer network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Caring for a relative or friend who lives with dementia is a complex and demanding process that affects the quality of life and the well\\\\being of the informal caregivers. Many previous studies show that informal dementia caregivers experience high levels of stress, psychological burden, and depression due to the demands of caregiving which include changes in one's personal and professional life, self\\\\neglect, and withdrawal from pleasurable activities. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic drastically changed people's lives and everyday interactions and the limited number of studies on this topic shows that it introduced additional challenges for dementia caregivers. These challenges include protecting themselves and the person they care for from infection, managing the behavioural and psychological symptoms of the disease, introducing changes in everyday routines, dealing with quarantine or isolation. METHOD: The aim of this study was to gain a better insight into the experiences of informal dementia caregivers during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. Semi\\\\structured interviews were conducted in the period of July\\\\September with nine participants from different countries and the data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis resulting in extraction of five themes. RESULTS: The results show that informal caregivers experience worsening of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of the person they care for, limited access to the institutions and the person they care for, fear of infection but also more free time for looking after the person with dementia. CONCLUSION: This was one of the first qualitative research aimed to understand the unique experiences of informal dementia caregivers during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, and the first research ever that has included caregivers from North Macedonia. The results show that informal dementia caregivers experience additional burden and challenges due to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic which adds to their existing psychological distress. This can further compromise their health and well\\\\being, and result in lower quality of life for them and the person with dementia and requires more focused attention from the relevant medical and social services.

Volunteers consented on-line and reported height, weight, concomitant illnesses, medication and supplement use, residential, occupational or community COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and symptom severity on a 4-point scale. Of the 12,117 curated analytic population 2,279 reported a COVID-19 viral test result: 865 positive (COVID+) and 1,414 negative (COVID-).

It is clear, however, that instead of a single mechanism being responsible for its aetiology, an orchestra of cellular mechanisms failing is associated with AKI. The integrative physiological compartment where these mechanisms come together and exert their integrative deleterious action is the renal microcirculation (MC). This is why it is opportune to review the response of the renal MC to sepsis and discuss the determinants of its (dys)function and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of renal failure. A main determinant of adequate organ function is the adequate supply and utilization of oxygen at the microcirculatory and cellular level to perform organ function. The highly complex architecture of the renal microvasculature, the need to meet a high energy demand and the fact that the kidney is borderline ischaemic makes the kidney a highly vulnerable organ to hypoxaemic injury. Under normal, steady-state conditions, oxygen (O2) supply to the renal tissues is well regulated; however, under septic conditions the delicate balance of oxygen supply versus demand is disturbed due to renal microvasculature dysfunction. This dysfunction is largely due to the interaction of renal oxygen handling, nitric oxide metabolism and radical formation. Renal tissue oxygenation is highly heterogeneous not only between the cortex and medulla but also within these renal compartments. Integrative evaluation of the different determinants of tissue oxygen in sepsis models has identified the deterioration of microcirculatory oxygenation as a key component in the development AKI. It is becoming clear that resuscitation of the failing kidney needs to integratively correct the homeostasis between oxygen, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Several experimental therapeutic modalities have been found to be effective in restoring microcirculatory oxygenation in parallel to improving renal function following septic AKI. However, these have to be verified in clinical studies. The development of clinical physiological biomarkers of AKI specifically aimed at the MC should form a valuable contribution to monitoring such new therapeutic modalities.","output":"The renal microcirculation in sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (COVID-19) rapidly resulted in a pandemic. We report the characteristics of patients with severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan city, China, and the risk factors related to infection severity and death. METHODS: We extracted the demographic and clinical data of 7283 patients with severe COVID-19 infection from designated Wuhan hospitals as of 25 February 2020. Factors associated with COVID-19 critical illness and mortality were analysed using logistic- and Cox-regression analyses. RESULTS: We studied 6269 patients with severe COVID-19 illness and 1014 critically ill patients. The median (IQR) age was 64 (53-71) years; 51.2% were male, 38.9% were retirees and 7.4% had self-reported histories of chronic disease. Up to the end of the study, 1180 patients (16.2%) recovered and were discharged, 649 (8.9%) died and the remainder were still receiving treatment. The number of daily confirmed critical cases peaked between 23 January and 1 February 2020. Patients with advanced age [odds ratio (OR), 1.03; 95% confidence intervals (CIs), 1.03-1.04], male sex (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.33-1.86) and pre-existing diabetes (OR, 2.11), hypertension (OR, 2.72), cardiovascular disease (OR, 2.15) or respiratory disease (OR, 3.50) were more likely to be critically ill. Compared with those who recovered and were discharged, patients who died were older [hazard ratio (HR), 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05], more likely to be male (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.44-2.11) and more likely to have hypertension (HR, 5.58), cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.83) or diabetes (HR, 1.67). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, male sex and a history of chronic disease were associated with COVID-19 critical illness and death.

While the cellular recognition of well-known HDL-based carriers occurs via interactions with an HDL receptor, the selective delivery and uptake of LDL particles by target cells are more complex. The most well-known mode of LDL-based delivery is via the interaction between apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) - the main protein of LDL - and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). LDLR is expressed in the liver, adipocytes, and macrophages, and thus selectively delivers LDL carriers to these cells and tissues. Moreover, the elevated expression of LDLR in tumor cells indicates a role for LDL in the targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs. In addition, chronic inflammation associated with hypercholesterolemia (i.e., high levels of endogenous LDL) can be abated by LDL carriers, which outcompete the deleterious oxidized LDL for uptake by macrophages. In this case, synthetic LDL nanocarriers act as 'eat-me' signals and exploit mechanisms of native LDL uptake for targeted drug delivery and imaging. Lastly, recent studies have shown that the delivery of LDL-based nanocarriers to macrophages via fluid-phase pinocytosis is a promising tool for atherosclerosis imaging. Hence, the present review summarizes the use of natural and synthetic LDL-based carriers for drug delivery and imaging and discusses various mechanisms of targeting.","output":"Low-density lipoprotein nanomedicines: mechanisms of targeting, biology, and theranostic potential"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To identify the taste and smell impairment in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)Cpositive subjects and compare the findings with COVID-19Cnegative subjects using the American Academy of OtolaryngologyCHead and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Anosmia Reporting Tool.

Infection by CoVs such as HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1 leads to the common cold, short lasting rhinitis, cough, sore throat and fever. However, CoVs such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the newest SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) lead to severe and deadly diseases with mortality rates ranging between ~1 to 35% depending on factors such as age and pre-existing conditions. Despite continuous global health threats to humans, there are no approved vaccines or drugs targeting human CoVs, and the recent outbreak of COVID-19 emphasizes an urgent need for therapeutic interventions.

As vaccination progresses and population immunity increases, a counteracting relaxation of social distancing measures is observed. The result will be a prolonged period of high disease prevalence combined with a fitness advantage for vaccine-resistant variants, implying a considerably increased probability that a resistant variant will spread in the population. In this paper we propose a spatial vaccination strategy that has the potential to dramatically reduce this risk. Instead of spreading the vaccination effort equally throughout a country, distinct geographic regions of the country are sequentially vaccinated, quickly bringing each to effective herd immunity. Regions with high vaccination rates will then have low infection rates and vice versa. Since people primarily interact with others in their own region, spatial vaccination will reduce the number of encounters between infected people (the source of mutations) and vaccinated people (who facilitate the spread of vaccine-resistant strains). Thus with proper logistic preparations, a spatial vaccination campaign could be highly effective in reducing the global risk of vaccine-resistant variants.","output":"A spatial vaccination strategy to reduce the risk of vaccine-resistant variants (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: The current Covid-19 pandemic has already had a definite impact on the daily life of many people worldwide.

Also, participants filled out the regular follow-up questionnaire to assess a chronic pain disorder measuring among other parameters pain intensity, symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and pain-related quality of life.Of 136 eligible patients who presented to our pain center between May 5th and July 17th, 112 agreed to participate in the study (82.4%). Eighty two participants (73.2%) reported a deterioration of the pain disorder using the self-designed questionnaire. The more robust parameters of the regular follow-up questionnaire showed no relevant changes compared to data collected before the pandemic. We were not able to detect any demographic and medical parameters that were clinically relevantly associated with a higher impact of the pandemic.We conclude that a chronic pain disorder is a relatively stable disease that does not change significantly due to external factors, like the Covid-19 pandemic, even if the subjective impact is perceived to be high.","output":"Short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with a chronic pain disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a serious threat to human life, accompanied by massive and rapid necroinflammation. Kupffer cells, the major immune cell population involved in innate immune responses, are considered to be central for FH. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is a pro-coagulant protein that is substantially induced in macrophages upon viral infection, and Fgl2 depletion represses murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection. Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein is a secretory protein with anti-inflammatory properties in allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, its mechanisms of action and pathogenic roles in other disease are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CC10 in FH and the regulation of Fgl2 by CC10. Methods: A mouse FH model was established by peritoneal injection of MHV-3. The mice received CC10 protein through tail vein injection before viral infection. Survival rate, liver function, liver histology, fibrin deposition, and necrosis were examined. The regulatory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression was investigated using THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Results: In the mouse FH model induced by MHV-3, the survival rate increased from 0 to 12.5% in the CC10 group compared to that in the saline-only control group. Meanwhile, the levels of ALT and AST in serum were significantly decreased and liver damage was reduced. Furthermore, hepatic Fgl2, TNF-, and IL-1 expression was obviously downregulated together with fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced after administration of CC10 protein. In vitro, CC10 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of Fgl2 in IFN--treated THP-1 cells and MHV-3-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR. However, there was no direct interaction between CC10 and Fgl2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Microarray investigations suggested that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was significantly low in CC10-treated and IFN--primed THP-1 cells. HBP1-siRNA treatment abrogated the inhibitory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conclusion:CC10 protects against MHV-3-induced FH via suppression of Fgl2 expression in macrophages. Such effects may be mediated by the transcription factor HBP1.","output":"Clara Cell 10 kDa Protein Alleviates Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain 3-Induced Fulminant Hepatitis by Inhibiting Fibrinogen-Like Protein 2 Expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Frher wurde der Begriff Epidemiologie fr die Lehre von den gro?en, menschheitsbedrohenden Seuchen benutzt.

The patients admitted within the first 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms were included in the current patient group, and those admitted at the third and after the third week were included in the past patient group. Serum samples (n= 180) obtained from Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Training and Research Hospital, Blood Center between April and June 2018 before the COVID-19 pandemic were included in the study as a control group.

In patients with past COVID-19, Abbott IgG with 0.86 kappa coefficient and Dia.Pro IgG test with 0.85 kappa coefficient showed the best match. Due to the low sensitivity of IgM detection antibody tests, they should not be preferred instead of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in routine diagnosis. IgG detection tests may be preferred to detect the antibody response and the titers in people who have had COVID-19 for population seroprevalence and especially therapeutic immune plasma production.

Evidence-based data to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin are needed. Objective: To determine the efficacy of ivermectin in preventing progression to severe disease among high-risk patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Ivermectin Treatment Efficacy in COVID-19 High-Risk Patients (I-TECH) study was an open-label randomized clinical trial conducted at 20 public hospitals and a COVID-19 quarantine center in Malaysia between May 31 and October 25, 2021. Within the first week of patients' symptom onset, the study enrolled patients 50 years and older with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, comorbidities, and mild to moderate disease. Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral ivermectin, 0.4 mg/kg body weight daily for 5 days, plus standard of care (n = 241) or standard of care alone (n = 249). The standard of care consisted of symptomatic therapy and monitoring for signs of early deterioration based on clinical findings, laboratory test results, and chest imaging. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who progressed to severe disease, defined as the hypoxic stage requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry oxygen saturation of 95% or higher. Secondary outcomes of the trial included the rates of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, 28-day in-hospital mortality, and adverse events. Results: Among 490 patients included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 62.5 [8.7] years; 267 women [54.5%]), 52 of 241 patients (21.6%) in the ivermectin group and 43 of 249 patients (17.3%) in the control group progressed to severe disease (relative risk [RR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.87-1.80; P = .25). For all prespecified secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences between groups. Mechanical ventilation occurred in 4 (1.7%) vs 10 (4.0%) (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.13-1.30; P = .17), intensive care unit admission in 6 (2.4%) vs 8 (3.2%) (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.27-2.20; P = .79), and 28-day in-hospital death in 3 (1.2%) vs 10 (4.0%) (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09-1.11; P = .09). The most common adverse event reported was diarrhea (14 [5.8%] in the ivermectin group and 4 [1.6%] in the control group). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, ivermectin treatment during early illness did not prevent progression to severe disease.

To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical decision is the extent to which policy makers rely on voluntary as opposed to enforced compliance, and nations vary along this dimension. While enforcement may secure higher compliance, there is experimental and other evidence that it may also crowd out voluntary motivation. How does enforcement affect citizens support for antiCCOVID-19 policies? A survey conducted with 4,799 respondents toward the end of the first lockdown in Germany suggests that a substantial share of the population will support measures more under voluntary than under enforced implementation. Negative responses to enforcementtermed control aversionvary across the nature of the policy intervention (e.g., they are rare for masks and frequent for vaccination and a cell-phone tracing app). Control aversion is less common among those with greater trust in the government and the information it provides, and among those who were brought up under the coercive regime of East Germany. Taking account of the likely effectiveness of enforcement and the extent to which near-universal compliance is crucial, the differing degrees of opposition to enforcement across policies suggest that for some antiCCOVID-19 policies an enforced mandate would be unwise, while for others it would be essential.

Methods: We established a mouse model of IVDD and cultured mouse NP cells and treated them with IL-1 and DEX. The effect of DEX on NP cells was determined by detecting the extracellular matrix of NP cells, changes in ROS levels and inflammatory mediators. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, is used to inhibit the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The effect of DEX on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by studying the effects of DEX on PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway-related molecules and the effect of LY294002 on NP cells degeneration. DEX significantly increased the disc height index and attenuated IVDD in mice. Results: DEX significantly inhibited the expression of MMP3/9 in NP cells, effectively inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrix. In addition, oxidative stress levels and inflammatory levels in NP cells are also attenuated by DEX. The expression of PI3K, Akt and p-Akt was significantly increased in DEX-stimulated NP cells, indicating that DEX increased the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

An integrated, on-patient LCD provides the view of the surgical site. The design intent of the port camera is to enhance SPA by (a) reducing the size of the SPA port through the elimination of the dedicated laparoscope channel; (b) reducing equipment cost by integrating an inexpensive CMOS sensor and LED lamp at the port tip; (c) eliminating the need for an assistant who operates the laparoscope; and (d) mechanically coupling the camera, tool port, and on-patient LCD screen. The effectiveness of the device was evaluated by comparing the video performance with a leading industry laparoscope and by performing a user evaluation study and live porcine surgery with the device. Effectiveness of the device was mixed. Overall video system performance of the device is better than an industry standard high-definition laparoscope, implying that significant cost savings over a traditional system are possible.

Yet, campaigns have often not sought input from the public in their development. OBJECTIVES: To co-produce evidenced-based infographics (EBIs) about antibiotics for common childhood infections and to evaluate their effectiveness at increasing parents understanding of antibiotic use. METHODS: A mixed-methods study with three phases. Phase 1 identified and summarized evidence of antibiotic use for three childhood infections (sore throat, acute cough and otitis media). In phase 2, we co-designed a series of prototype EBIs with parents and a graphic design team (focus groups). Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Phase 3 assessed the effect of EBIs on parents understanding of antibiotic use for the three infections using a national online survey in the UK. RESULTS: We iteratively co-produced 10 prototype EBIs. Parents found the evidence displayed in the EBIs novel and relevant to their families. Parents did not favour EBIs that were too medically focused. Parents preferred one health message per EBI. We included eight EBIs in a national survey of parents (n = 998). EBIs improved knowledge by more than a third across the board (34%, IQR 20%C46%, P < 0.001). Respondents confirmed that EBIs were novel and potentially useful, corroborating our focus groups findings. CONCLUSIONS: Co-designed EBIs have the potential to succinctly change parents perceptions about antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections in children. Further research should test EBIs in real-world settings to assess their reach as a potential public-facing intervention.","output":"Using evidence-based infographics to increase parents understanding about antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance: a proof-of-concept study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fact that wild felines are carriers of pernicious infectious viruses should be a major concern due to the potential cross-species transmission between the felines and human or domestic animals.

In this study, we screened four infectious viruses, namely, feline parvovirus (FPV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine distemper virus (CDV), and influenza A virus (IAV), in the blood samples of 285 captive Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) and in the spleen samples of two deceased lions (Panthera leo), which were collected from 2019 to 2021 in three Siberian Tiger Parks from the northeast of China. Nucleic acids isolated from the blood samples collected from tigers and the spleen samples collected from two deceased lions were positive for FPV by PCR, and the positive rate was 4.6% (13/285) in tigers. Furthermore, the VP2 gene of FPV was amplified by nested PCR, and the sequences of the VP2 gene from these six FPV positive strains shared 98.3C99.9% homology with the reference. The key amino acid sites of VP2 protein were consistent with that of FPV reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP2 gene showed that in this study, FPV-positive strains were grouped within the FPV clade and closely related to the Asian strains clade. The results of this study showed that FPV circulated in the captive Siberian tigers and lions in northeastern China and provided valuable information for the study of FPV epidemiology in wild felines.

This study aimed to examine risks of VTE and major bleeding in hospitalized and community-managed SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with control populations. METHODS: Using nationwide population-based registries, 30-day risks of VTE and major bleeding in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were compared with those of SARS-CoV-2 test-negative patients and with an external cohort of influenza patients. Medical records of all COVID-19 patients at six departments of infectious diseases in Denmark were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: The overall 30-day risk of VTE was 0.4% (40/9,460) among SARS-CoV-2 patients (16% hospitalized), 0.3% (649/226,510) among SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects (12% hospitalized), and 1.0% (158/16,281) among influenza patients (59% hospitalized). VTE risks were higher and comparable in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive (1.5%), SARS-CoV-2 negative (1.8%), and influenza patients (1.5%). Diagnosis of major bleeding was registered in 0.5% (47/9,460) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and in 2.3% of those hospitalized. Medical record review of 582 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients observed VTE in 4% (19/450) and major bleeding in 0.4% (2/450) of ward patients, of whom 31% received thromboprophylaxis. Among intensive care patients (100% received thromboprophylaxis), risks were 7% (9/132) for VTE and 11% (15/132) for major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Among people with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a population-based setting, VTE risks were low to moderate and were not substantially increased compared with SARS-CoV-2 test-negative and influenza patients. Risk of severe bleeding was low for ward patients, but mirrored VTE risk in the intensive care setting.","output":"Venous thromboembolism and major bleeding in patients with COVID-19: A nationwide population-based cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a family of large enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses which has been considered as a global health concern as it has a very high transmissibility potential.

[32P]-complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were prepared by transcription of genomic RNA 1 and RNA 2 nucleotide sequences that had been cloned in a bacteriophage M13 vector. Probes that correspond to unique sequences near the 3 ends of RNA 1 and RNA 2 revealed over 20 smaller RNAs. The subgenomic RNAs derived from each genomic RNA were analyzed more definitively by hybrid selection from total encapsidated RNA, using minus DNA clones derived from sequences in either RNA 1 or RNA 2, and a cDNA probe for the 3 sequence conserved among all the genomic RNAs. Different patterns of over 20 minor RNA species, which were 3-coterminal with RNAs 1 and 2, were detected, and they were reproducible irrespective of the host, cucumber orNicotiana clevelandii, from which the virus was isolated. The same RNA patterns were found in RNA extracted from the particulate fraction of CMV-infected cucumber orN. clevelandii. In order to determine whether the subgenomic RNAs could function as messenger RNAs, hybrid-selected RNAs were tested byin vitro translation, using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The subgenomic RNAs from RNA 1 produced over 10 major polypeptides from Mr 27,000 to Mr 90,000 all of which could be translated from a few RNA species over about 2,300 nucleotides long. The 3-coterminal subgenomic RNAs derived from RNA 2 gave less than 10 products from Mr , 17,000 toMr 85,000.

The current study aimed to understand the biomechanics of the local flap designs along with the effect of wound closures on the respective genders. Two Asian head templates from opposite genders were obtained to use as base models. A third-order Yeoh hyperelastic model was adapted to characterize as skin material properties. A single layer composed of combined epidermis and dermis was considered and the models were thickened according to respective anatomical positions. Each model gender was excised with a fixed defect size which was consequently covered by three different local flap designs namely advancement, rotation, and rhomboid flaps. Post-operative simulation presented various scenarios of skin flap closures. Rotation and rhomboid flaps demonstrated maximal tension at the apex of the flap for both genders as well as advancement flap in the female face model. However, advancement flap closure in the male face model presented otherwise. Yet, the deformation patterns and the peak tension of the discussed flaps were consistent with conventional local flap surgery. Moreover, male face models generated higher stresses compared to the female face models with a 70.34% mean difference. Overall, the skin flap operations were executed manually and the designed surgery model met the objectives successfully while acknowledging the study limitations.

One hundred sixteen students answered a questionnaire about their opinions on several topics related to online learning of Anatomy. The strongest correlation observed showed that the students agree that online anatomy classes make the subject more difficult to learn when compared to face-to-face lectures. Negative attitudes toward motivation, lack of personal contact with classmates, and complaints about being taught without laboratory sessions with cadavers were among the principal negative attitudes in students. After almost one year, motivation to participate in online classes went down;however, students improved their judgment about remote anatomy learning and their views about using authentic anatomy images during online sessions and substituting real anatomy images for apps. Anatomy sessions will have to adapt their learning tools to e-learning as time constraints allow, creating a new environment for students to participate, learn, and take advantage of this change.","output":"The Students' Point of View on the Teaching of Anatomy at the Universidad del Norte, Colombia, Amid the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been three major global outbreaks of acute respiratory disease caused by coronavirus in the last two decades.

METHODS A post hoc analysis of the erythropoietin in traumatic brain injury (EPO-TBI) trial that included twice-weekly lower limb ultrasound screening. Venous thrombotic events were defined as ultrasound-proven proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or clinically detected pulmonary embolism (PE). Results are reported as events, percentages or medians and interquartile range (IQR). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for time to VTE and death. RESULTS Of 603 patients, 119 (19.7%) developed VTE, mostly comprising DVT (102 patients, 16.9%) with a smaller number of PE events (24 patients, 4.0%). Median time to DVT diagnosis was 6 days (IQR 2-11) and to PE diagnosis 6.5 days (IQR 2-16.5). Mechanical prophylaxis (MP) was used in 91% of patients on day 1, 97% of patients on day 3 and 98% of patients on day 7. Pharmacological prophylaxis was given in 5% of patients on day 1, 30% of patients on day 3 and 57% of patients on day 7. Factors associated with time to VTE were age (HR per year 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), patient weight (HR per kg 1.01, 95% CI 1-1.02) and TBI severity according to the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials risk of poor outcome (HR per 10% increase 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25). The development of VTE was not associated with mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.51-1.65). CONCLUSIONS Despite mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis, VTE occurs in one out of every five patients with TBI treated in the ICU. Higher age, greater weight and greater severity of TBI increase the risk.

Fentanyl-related overdose is rising in new geographic areas e.g. the western USA. Stimulant-related overdose is also increasing nationwide driven by methamphetamine and cocaine. Polysubstance use, e.g. the use of a stimulant along with an opioid is driving stimulant-related overdose. Other medical consequences of injection drug use are rising including HIV and hepatitis C infections. Medication approaches to treating opioid use disorder remain the standard of care and there are new promising pharmacological approaches to treating methamphetamine use disorder. SUMMARY: A 'fourth wave' of high mortality involving methamphetamine and cocaine use has been gathering force in the USA. Availability and use of illicit fentanyls are still the major drivers of overdose deaths and the current rise in stimulant-related deaths appears entwined with the ongoing opioid epidemic.","output":"The rise of illicit fentanyls, stimulants and the fourth wave of the opioid overdose crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to assess baseline levels of coughing on a farm free of respiratory disease, and to identify relationships between environmental conditions and coughing frequency in finisher pigs.

Most of the deaths have occurred in severe and critical cases, but information on prognostic risk factors for severely ill patients is incomplete. Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, and we therefore prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severely ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term at the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. Methods: In this single-centered, prospective, and observational study, we enrolled 114 severely ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020, to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were recorded, and the risk factors for poor outcome were analyzed. Results: Among the 114 enrolled patients with a mean age of 63.96  13.41 years, 94 (82.5%) patients were classified as a good outcome group. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with the good outcome group, 20 (17.5%) patients in the poor outcome group more frequently exhibited lymphopenia, and lower levels of albumin, partial arterial oxygen pressure, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, hypersensitive troponin I, C-reactive protein, ferritin, blood urea nitrogen, and D-dimer, as well as markedly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD8 + T cells, decreased in almost all the patients and were markedly lower in the poor outcome group than the good outcome group. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient's condition, which is conducive to the transformation from a severe to mild condition. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of potential factors for poor outcome patients indicated that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction are related to the development of a poor outcome. Conclusion: In summary, we reported this single-centered, prospective, and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. We found that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in the final outcome of severely ill patients with COVID-19.

Narrow band imaging (NBI) is an optical enhancement technique that may improve resection of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and thereby lead to better outcomes for people undergoing the procedure. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of NBI- and white light cystoscopy (WLC)-guided transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) compared to WLC-guided TURBT in the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of 10 databases, including the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, several clinical trial registries, and grey literature for published and unpublished studies, irrespective of language. The search was performed per an a priori protocol on 3 December 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials of participants with suspected or confirmed non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Participants in the control group must have received WLC-guided TURBT alone (hereinafter simply referred to as 'WLC TURBT'). Participants in the intervention group had to have received NBI- and WLC-guided TURBT (hereinafter simply referred to as 'NBI + WLC TURBT'). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion/exclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. We conducted meta-analysis on time-to-event and dichotomous data using a random-effects model in RevMan, according to Cochrane methods. We rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome according to the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes were time to recurrence, time to progression, and the occurrence of a major adverse event, defined as a Clavien-Dindo III, IV, or V complication. Secondary outcomes included time to death from bladder cancer and the occurrence of a minor adverse event, defined as a Clavien-Dindo I or II complication. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies with a total of 2152 participants randomized to the standard WLC TURBT or to NBI + WLC TURBT. A total of 1847 participants were included for analysis. Based on limited confidence in the time-to-event data, we found that participants who underwent NBI + WLC TURBT had a lower risk of disease recurrence over time compared to participants who underwent WLC TURBT (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89; I2 = 53%; 6 studies, 1244 participants; low certainty of evidence). No studies examined disease progression as a time-to-event outcome or a dichotomous outcome. There was likely no difference in the risk of a major adverse event between participants who underwent NBI + WLC TURBT and those who underwent WLC TURBT (risk ratio 1.77, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.96; 4 studies, 1385 participants; low certainty of evidence). No studies examined death from bladder cancer as a time-to-event outcome or a dichotomous outcome. There was likely no difference in the risk of a minor adverse event between participants who underwent NBI + WLC TURBT and those who underwent WLC TURBT (risk ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.56; I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 1385 participants; low certainty of evidence).

AIM: To explore how people of SA origin with LTCs understand, experience, and seek help for emotional distress, depression, and anxiety. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review of qualitative studies exploring emotional distress in people of SA origin with diabetes or coronary heart disease, within primary and community care settings worldwide. METHOD: Comprehensive searches of eight electronic databases from inception to 1 September 2021 were undertaken. Data extracted included study characteristics, and understanding, experience, and help-seeking behaviour for emotional distress. Thematic synthesis was undertaken. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for qualitative studies was used to assess quality of articles, and Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) used to determine the overall strength of evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies from 3165 unique citations were included. Three main themes were identified. Understanding of emotional distress: non-medical terminology used, such as tension, and a complex relationship between emotional and physical illness. Experiences of emotional distress: multiple forms of inequality, distress at diagnosis of their LTC, cultural factors, and sex differences. Help-seeking behaviour: self-management, support from family, friends, and faith, and inadequate clinical support.

METHODS: Nonhuman primates received 10 or 100 g of mRNA-1273, a vaccine encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, or no vaccine. Antibody and T-cell responses were assessed before upper- and lower-airway challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Active viral replication and viral genomes in bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal swab specimens were assessed by polymerase chain reaction, and histopathological analysis and viral quantification were performed on lung-tissue specimens. RESULTS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate induced antibody levels exceeding those in human convalescent-phase serum, with live-virus reciprocal 50% inhibitory dilution (ID(50)) geometric mean titers of 501 in the 10-g dose group and 3481 in the 100-g dose group.

Finally, communication is a key element in increasing acceptance for new tools that require mass uptake to be effective, as seen with roll-out challenges for the COVID-19 vaccines, which faced heightened concerns of efficacy and safety while mired with rampant misinformation. Ultimately, strategies for prevention of viral epidemics such as COVID-19 must include communication strategies at the forefront to reduce the risk of the emergence of new diseases and enhance efforts to control their spread and burden. Despite key themes emerging, what constitutes effective communication strategies for different people and contexts needs to be investigated further.","output":"Effective Communication at Different Phases of COVID-19 Prevention: Roles, Enablers and Barriers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high morbidity and mortality rate of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection arises majorly from the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and \\"cytokine storm\\" syndrome, which is sustained by an aberrant systemic inflammatory response and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, phytocompounds with broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory activity that target multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins will enhance the development of effective drugs against the disease. In this study, an in-house library of 117 steroidal plant-derived pregnanes (PDPs) was docked in the active regions of human glucocorticoid receptors (hGRs) in a comparative molecular docking analysis. Based on the minimal binding energy and a comparative dexamethasone binding mode analysis, a list of top twenty ranked PDPs docked in the agonist conformation of hGR, with binding energies ranging between -9.8 and -11.2 kcal/mol, was obtained and analyzed for possible interactions with the human Janus kinases 1 and Interleukins-6 and SARS-CoV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, Papain-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. For each target protein, the top three ranked PDPs were selected. Eight PDPs (bregenin, hirundigenin, anhydroholantogenin, atratogenin A, atratogenin B, glaucogenin A, glaucogenin C and glaucogenin D) with high binding tendencies to the catalytic residues of multiple targets were identified. A high degree of structural stability was observed from the 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation analyses of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin complexes of hGR. The selected top-eight ranked PDPs demonstrated high druggable potentials and favourable in silico ADMET properties. Thus, the therapeutic potentials of glaucogenin C and hirundigenin can be explored for further in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Dual targeting of cytokine storm and viral replication in COVID-19 by plant-derived steroidal pregnanes: An in silico perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Golimumab is a fully human antitumor necrosis monoclonal antibody that can be administered by either subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Golimumab is approved for the treatment of the adults with rheumatic diseases, and ulcerative colitis, Whereas in children, golimumab is indicated only for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We have written on the off-label use of subcutaneous golimumab, which helped to induce and maintain remission on a low-weight biologically experienced child with steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis flare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 13-year-old pancolitis Syrian boy presented with abdominal pain and six to seven times bloody diarrhea. The child had treated with mesalamine 80 mg/kg/day, azathioprine 2.5 mg/kg/day, infliximab with an induction dose of 5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6 followed by 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Infliximab did not maintain remission as the patient suffered from two flares that required hospital admission, intravenous corticosteroids, and infliximab escalation. Initial tests disclosed leukocytosis, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, an elevation in C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. All Stool studies were negative including routine stool cultures, Clostridium difficile toxin, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Cryptosporidium, and microscopy for ova and parasites. A sigmoidoscopy revealed multiple large ulcerations and spontaneous bleeding, colon biopsies were negative for Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus. Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and adalimumab were unavailable in Syria. Child's parents opposed colectomy as a treatment option. DIAGNOSIS: Ulcerative colitis flare. INTERVENTIONS: A subcutaneous golimumab with a loading dose of 200 mg at week 0, followed by 100 mg at week 2, then 50 mg every 4 weeks. OUTCOMES: The patient achieved clinical remission by week sixth and maintained the remission for the next 90 weeks. At the time of last evaluation, tests, including C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin, were within normal limits, complete colonoscopy revealed erythema, edema, mucosal friability, loss of vascular patterns, and pseudo-polyps. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index and Mayo scores were 5 and 2 points, respectively. No adverse events were documented. CONCLUSION: Golimumab has shown potential efficacy and safety in the treatment of ulcerative colitis in children which may indicate a significant future role for subcutaneous golimumab in pediatrics ulcerative colitis.","output":"Subcutaneous golimumab induced and maintained clinical response in a child with a biological-experienced steroid-refractory flare of ulcerative colitis: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The classic prescription Chaihu Shugan Powder (CHSGP) has been widely used in clinical Chinese medicine treatment and has clear clinical effects in the treatment of emotional diseases.

The local energy features are next normalized into 8-bit values. The multiscale NSST is used to provide translational invariance and has flexible directional sensitivity to catch more anisotropic information of an image. The normalised NSST subband features are next decomposed into bit-plane slices in order to capture very fine to coarse subband details. Then each bit-plane slices of all the subbands are encoded by exploiting the dissimilarity relationship between each neighbouring pixel and its adjacent neighbours.

Contemporary chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer therapy are chemical entities sourced from plants. However, synthetic drugs or their derivatives come with severe to moderate side effects for human health. Hence, the quest to explore and discover plant-based novel anticancer drugs is ongoing. Anticancer activities are the primary method to estimate the potential and efficacy of an extract or compound for drug discovery. However, traditional in vitro anticancer activity assays often show poor efficacy due to the lack of in-vivo-like cellular environment. In comparison, the animal-based in vivo assays lack human genetic makeup and have ethical concerns. Aim: This study aimed to overcome the limitations of traditional cell-culture-based anticancer assays and find the most suitable assay for anticancer activity of plant extracts. We first reported utilizing a liver tumor microphysiological system in the anticancer effect assessment of plant extracts. Methodology: Methanolic extracts of Acer cappadocicum Gled were used to assess anticancer activity against liver tumor microphysiological system (MPS), and cell viability, liver function tests, and antioxidant enzyme activities were performed. Additionally, an embedded transepithelial electrical resistance sensor was utilized for the real-time monitoring of the liver tumor MPS. The results were also compared with the traditional cell culture model. Results: The study demonstrated the superiority of the TEER sensor-based liver tumor MPS by its better anticancer activity based on cell viability and biomarker analysis compared to the traditional in vitro cell culture model. The anticancer effects of the plant extracts were successfully observed in real time, and methanolic extracts of Acer cappadocicum Gled increased the alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase secretion, which may reveal the different mechanisms of these extracts and suggest a clue for the future molecular study of the anticancer pathways.

We identify trafficking networks on the basis of genetic matching of tusks from the same individual or close relatives in separate shipments. Analyses are drawn from 4,320 savannah (Loxodonta africana) and forest (L. cyclotis) elephant tusks, sampled from 49 large ivory seizures totalling 111 t, shipped out of Africa between 2002 and 2019. Network analyses reveal a repeating pattern wherein tusks from the same individual or close relatives are found in separate seizures that were containerized in, and transited through, common African ports. Results suggest that individual traffickers are exporting dozens of shipments, with considerable connectivity between traffickers operating in different ports.

Cryoglobulinemia often manifests as cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV), whose symptoms range in severity from purpuric eruptions to life-threatening features. The majority of CV patients are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), whereas lymphoproliferative disorders or connective tissue diseases (CTD) are commonly diagnosed among patients with CV of non-infectious origin. In the absence of detectable associated disease, cryoglobulinemia is classified as essential (EMC). All HCV-positive CV patients should be given direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that are consistently able to induce a sustained virologic response (SVR). Glucocorticoids (GCs) can mitigate CV-associated vasculitis, but they have no role as maintenance therapy. Cyclophosphamide restrains the hyperactive phase(s) of the disease and the post-apheresis rebound of newly synthesized CGs. Its use has been largely replaced by rituximab (RTX) in patients unresponsive to DAAs, patients progressing to B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and patients in whom CV persists or reappears after clearance of HCV. Therapeutic apheresis is an emergency treatment for CV patients with hyperviscosity syndrome. HCV-positive CV patients are at an increased risk of developing NHL, but the achievement of SVR can effectively prevent HCV-related NHL or induce the remission of an already established lymphoma, even without chemotherapy. The treatment of patients with IgM or IgG monoclonal cryoglobulins and an underlying immunoproliferative disorder is based on the regimens adopted for patients with the same B-cell malignancies but without circulating CGs. For patients with CTD, GCs plus alkylating agents or RTX are similarly effective as first-line therapy and in the relapse/refractory setting. In patients with EMC, treatment should consist of GCs plus RTX, with the dose of GCs tapered as soon as possible to reduce the risk of infectious complications.","output":"The wide spectrum of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and an overview of therapeutic advancements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to shut down colleges and universities including medical schools all over the world, thus pushing medical schools to seek e-learning to maintain continuity of curriculum.

In such devices, automatic face recognition requires a low powered memory efficient visual computing system. For these real time applications in smart cities, efficient visual recognition systems are need of the hour. In this manuscript, efficient fast subspace decomposition over Chi Square transformation is proposed for IoT based on smart city surveillance systems. The proposed technique extracts the features for visual recognition using local binary pattern histogram. The redundant features are discarded by applying the fast subspace decomposition over the Gaussian distributed Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features. This redundancy is major contributor to memory and time consumption for battery based surveillance systems. The proposed technique is suitable for all visual recognition applications deployed in IoT based surveillance devices due to higher dimension reduction. The validation of proposed technique is proved on the basis of well-known databases. The technique shows significant results for all databases when implemented on Raspberry Pi. A comparison of the proposed technique with already existing/reported techniques for the similar applications has been provided. Least error rate is achieved by the proposed technique with maximum feature reduction in minimum time for all the standard databases. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is useful for real time visual recognition for smart city surveillance.","output":"An efficient framework using visual recognition for IoT based smart city surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An underlying concern about the COVID-19 pandemic is that the mental health of children will decline.

We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience improved mental health and reduced fear of COVID-19, when compared to the announcement and control groups. Interaction effects were observed only for depression, indicating a significant intervention effect in the intervention group. These findings suggest that a single school-based intervention that includes self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19 can help to improve childrens mental health.

These include toxins produced by Fusarium fungi, particularly trichothecenes (toxin T-2) and fumonisin (FB1). In the present study, we determined the effects of addition on Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate (SCL) added to feed contaminated with T-2 and FB1 in terms of health, productive efficiency, and egg laying quality. We used 60 Hy-line Brown laying hens, and divided them into five groups with four repetitions per group and three birds per repetition. There was one group with no contamination with toxin (NoC). The four other groups included combinations of mycotoxin (4 ppm T-2, and 20 ppm FB1): A contamination group was used as control (the C+ group), and another two contained 500 g/ton of SCL (Detoxa Plus?) (the C + D500 group) or 1000 g/ton of SCL (the C + D1000 group). Finally, one group received feed containing 500 g/ton of Detoxa Plus? and 1000 g/ton of Uniwall Mos 25? (the C + D500 + U1000 group). The experimental period was 84 days, divided into three productive cycles of 28 days each. The NoC hens had greater egg production than the other groups. Hens that consumed feed with SCL had greater egg production than did the C+ group. The NoC hens produced eggs with greater weights than did the C hens; however, C + D1000 and C + D500 + U1000 birds produced greater egg weights than did the C+ group. The C+ group produced lower egg masses than did the NoC and C + D500 + U1000 groups. The feed intake (FI) was lower in hens that ingested mycotoxin. The use of SCL in feed minimized the negative effects of mycotoxin on feed conversion ratio (FI/dozen). Effects of treatment were detected for feed conversion ratio (kg/kg). The hens that consumed mycotoxin had lower shell resistance and thickness compared to those in the NoC group. The red color of egg yolk was greater in the control groups. There were fluctuations in levels of liver enzymes when birds consumed mycotoxin (sometimes reduced and sometimes increased); nevertheless, the cumulative effect increased the activity of alanine aminotransferase. The serum concentration of reactive oxygen species was greater in hens that ingested mycotoxin only on d 84 compared to the NoC group. Serum glutathione S-transferase activity was greater on d 56 in C + D500 and C + D1000 hens than in the others. We conclude that, in general, the consumption of mycotoxin impaired the performance and quality of the eggs of the hens; the addition of the S. cerevisiae lysate and the addition organic acids, yeast cell wall and mineral carrier minimized some of the negative effects caused by T-2 and FB1.","output":"Laying hens fed mycotoxin-contaminated feed produced by Fusarium fungi (T-2 toxin and fumonisin B1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae lysate: Impacts on poultry health, productive efficiency, and egg quality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) impacts sexual and reproductive health (SRH), which is a prominent component of a patients quality of life and highly influenced by the cultural background. The aim of the study was to explore the interest of Mexican outpatients with RA in SRH and to examine patient view on SRH. METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed 303 consecutive outpatients with RA on their perceptions of SRH importance, SRH satisfaction, access to SRH information, preferences regarding SRH communication with healthcare professionals, and understanding of SRH (qualitative open-ended descriptions). Descriptive statistics and inferential analysis were used. Patient knowledge of each dimension of SRH was rated based on pre-specified criteria. Two assessors assigned ten major themes to each patients description of both dimensions of SRH. RESULTS: Patients perceived their SRH as an important component of their general health and wished to address the topic, although few had access to such communication. Female patients assigned lesser importance to SRH, showed lesser degree of satisfaction with SRH, and expressed preference for a truthful physician. Age showed a linear association with individual survey responses, except for satisfaction with reproductive health dimension. There was a linear association between increased age and decreased years of formal education with a lower level of SRH knowledge. Ten major themes emerged for each of the two dimensions of the SRH construct, although most individual descriptions were assigned to one or two major themes.

This study tested obesity as a risk factor for death in patients hospitalized with CDI. This was a three-center retrospective study that included hospitalized adults with CDI at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Brigham and Womens Hospital, and NYU Langone from 2010 to 2018. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between obesity, measured by body mass index, and death from any cause within 30 days after the index CDI test. RESULTS: Data for 3851 patients were analyzed, including 373 (9.7%) who died within 30 days following a diagnosis of CDI. After adjusting for other factors, BMI was not associated with increased risk for death in any BMI category [adjusted OR (aOR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.34 for BMI > 30 vs BMI 20C30; aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.87 for BMI > 40 vs BMI 20C30]. After stratifying into three groups by age, there were trends towards increased mortality with obesity in the middle-aged (56C75 vs  55 years old) yet decreased mortality with obesity in the old (> 75 vs  55) (p = NS for all). Advanced age and low albumin were the factors most strongly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between obesity and death among patients with CDI, in contrast to most other infections.

METHODS: An individual-based transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, OpenCOVID, was developed to compare the impact of various vaccination and NPI strategies on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. OpenCOVID uses the Oxford Containment Health Index (OCHI) to quantify the stringency of NPIs. RESULTS: Even if NPIs in place in March 2021 were to be maintained and the vaccine campaign rollout rapidly scaled-up, a third wave was predicted. However, we find a cautious phased relaxation can substantially reduce population-level morbidity and mortality. We find that faster vaccination campaign can offset the size of such a wave, allowing more flexibility for NPI to be relaxed sooner. Model outcomes were most sensitive to the level of infectiousness of variants of concern observed in Switzerland. CONCLUSION: A rapid vaccination rollout can allow the sooner relaxation of NPIs, however ongoing surveillance of - and swift responses to - emerging viral variants is of utmost importance for epidemic control.","output":"Impact of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in Switzerland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depression accounts for a large share of the global disease burden, with an estimated 264 million people globally suffering from depression. Despite being one of the most common kinds of mental health (MH) disorders, much about depression remains unknown. There are limited data about depression, in terms of its occurrence, distribution, and wider social determinants. This work examined the use of novel data sources for assessing the scope and social determinants of depression, with a view to informing the reduction of the global burden of depression. This study focused on new and traditional sources of data on depression and its social determinants in two middle-income countries (LMICs), namely, Brazil and India. We identified data sources using a combination of a targeted PubMed search, Google search, expert consultations, and snowball sampling of the relevant literature published between October 2010 and September 2020. Our search focused on data sources on the following HEALTHY subset of determinants: healthcare (H), education (E), access to healthy choices (A), labor/employment (L), transportation (T), housing (H), and income (Y). Despite the emergence of a variety of data sources, their use in the study of depression and its HEALTHY determinants in India and Brazil are still limited. Survey-based data are still the most widely used source. In instances where new data sources are used, the most commonly used data sources include social media (twitter data in particular), geographic information systems/global positioning systems (GIS/GPS), mobile phone, and satellite imagery. Often, the new data sources are used in conjunction with traditional sources of data. In Brazil, the limited use of new data sources to study depression and its HEALTHY determinants may be linked to (a) the governments outsized role in coordinating healthcare delivery and controlling the data system, thus limiting innovation that may be expected from the private sector; (b) the government routinely collecting data on depression and other MH disorders (and therefore, does not see the need for other data sources); and (c) insufficient prioritization of MH as a whole. In India, the limited use of new data sources to study depression and its HEALTHY determinants could be a function of (a) the lack of appropriate regulation and incentives to encourage data sharing by and within the private sector, (b) absence of purposeful data collection at subnational levels, and (c) inadequate prioritization of MH. There is a continuing gap in the collection and analysis of data on depression, possibly reflecting the limited priority accorded to mental health as a whole. The relatively limited use of data to inform our understanding of the HEALTHY determinants of depression suggests a substantial need for support of independent research using new data sources. Finally, there is a need to revisit the universal health coverage (UHC) frameworks, as these frameworks currently do not include depression and other mental health-related indicators so as to enable tracking of progress (or lack thereof) on such indicators.

Patients with COVID-19 with AKI have high mortality rates. Objective: Individuals with African ancestry with 2 copies of apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) variants G1 or G2 (high-risk group) have significantly increased rates of kidney disease. We tested the hypothesis that the APOL1 high-risk group is associated with a higher-risk of COVID-19-associated AKI and death. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 990 participants with African ancestry enrolled in the Million Veteran Program who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 with available genetic information. Exposures: The primary exposure was having 2 APOL1 risk variants (RV) (APOL1 high-risk group), compared with having 1 or 0 risk variants (APOL1 low-risk group). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was AKI. The secondary outcomes were stages of AKI severity and death. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for preexisting comorbidities, medications, and inpatient AKI risk factors; 10 principal components of ancestry were performed to study these associations. We performed a subgroup analysis in individuals with normal kidney function prior to hospitalization (estimated glomerular filtration rate 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Results: Of the 990 participants with African ancestry, 905 (91.4%) were male with a median (IQR) age of 68 (60-73) years. Overall, 392 (39.6%) patients developed AKI, 141 (14%) developed stages 2 or 3 AKI, 28 (3%) required dialysis, and 122 (12.3%) died. One hundred twenty-five (12.6%) of the participants were in the APOL1 high-risk group. Patients categorized as APOL1 high-risk group had significantly higher odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.27-3.02; P = .002), higher AKI severity stages (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.37-2.99; P < .001), and death (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.22-3.72; P = .007).

Unlike municipal supplies, private well water quality remains unregulated, with owners responsible for testing, treating, and maintaining their own water supplies. The COVID-19 global pandemic and associated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have impacted many environmental (e.g., surface water and air quality) and human (e.g., healthcare, transportation) systems over the past 15-months (January 2020 to March 2021). To date, the impact of these interventions on private groundwater systems remains largely unknown. Accordingly, the current study aimed to investigate the impact of a province-wide COVID-19 lockdown (late-March 2020) on health behaviours (i.e., private domestic groundwater sampling) and groundwater quality (via Escherichia coli (E. coli) detection and concentration) in private well water in Ontario, using time-series analyses (seasonal decomposition, interrupted time-series) of a large-spatio-temporal dataset (January 2016 to March 2021; N = 743,200 samples). Findings indicate that lockdown concurred with an immediate (p = 0.015) and sustained (p < 0.001) decrease in sampling rates, equating to approximately 2200 fewer samples received per week post-interruption.

This is partly due to policies and practices led by those who were less familiar and comfortable with using new technologies. SUMMARY: Younger physicians will drive technological advancement and integration faster than previous generations, allowing technology to adapt more quickly to serve the needs of clinicians and patients. These changes will improve efficiency, allow more flexible working arrangements, and increase convenience for patients and physicians. The next generation of physicians will use technology to support their work and lifestyle preferences, making them more resilient to burnout than previous generations.","output":"Inter-generational Effects of Technology: Why Millennial Physicians May Be Less at Risk for Burnout Than Baby Boomers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents classification and analysis of the mathematical models of COVID-19 spread in different groups of populations such as the family, school, office (3-100 people), neighborhood (100-5000 people), city, region (0.5-15 million people), country, continent and the world. The classification covers the main types of models including time-series, differential, imitation ones, and their combinations. The time-series models are built from analysis of the time series derived using filtration, regression and network methods (Section 2). The differential models include those derived from systems of ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as partial-derivative equations (Section 3). The imitation models include cellular automata and agent-based models (Section 4). The fourth group in the classification is combinations of nonlinear Markov chains and optimal control theory, derived within the framework of the mean-field game theory. Due to the novelty of the disease and the difficulties it causes, the parameters of most models are, as a rule, unknown, which necessitates one to solve the inverse problem, so the paper also analyses the main algorithms to solve the inverse problem such as stochastic optimization; nature-like algorithms (genetic; differential evolution; particle swarm, etc.); the understanding method; big-data analysis, and machine learning.","output":"Mathematical models of COVID-19 spread"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing pandemic that profoundly challenges healthcare systems all over the world.

On the fifth day after admission, he developed massive haemoptysis. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest revealed alveolar haemorrhage, more prominent in the left lung. Flexible bronchoscopy confirmed bleeding from the left upper lobe, confirmed by a bronchial arteriography, which was successfully embolized. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) tested for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) repeatedly returned negative. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 was eventually detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Life-threatening haemoptysis is an unusual presentation of COVID-19, reflecting alveolar bleeding as a rare but possible complication.

Immunotherapy via programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade has shown benefits for gastric cancer. Epigenetic DNA methylation critically regulates cancer immune checkpoints. We investigated how the natural compound oleanolic acid (OA) affected PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) at 20 ng/mL was used to stimulate human gastric cancer MKN-45 cells. IL-1 significantly increased PD-L1 expression, which was abolished by OA. Next, OA-treated MKN-45 cells were co-cultured with activated and PD-1-overexpressing Jurkat T cells. OA restored IL-2 levels in the co-culture system and increased T cell killing toward MKN-45 cells. Overexpression of PD-L1 eliminated OA-enhanced T cell killing capacity; however, PD-1 blocking antibody abrogated the cytotoxicity of T cells. Moreover, OA abolished IL-1-increased DNA demethylase activity in MKN-45 cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine rescued OA-reduced PD-L1 expression; whereas DNA demethylation inhibitor gemcitabine inhibited PD-L1 expression, and, in combination with OA, provided more potent inhibitory effects. Furthermore, OA selectively reduced the expression of DNA demethylase TET3 in IL-1-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of TET3 restored OA-reduced PD-L1 expression. Finally, OA disrupted nuclear factor B (NF-B) signaling IL-1-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of NF-B restored OA downregulation of TET3 and PD-L1. The cytotoxicity of T cells toward MKN-45 cells was also weakened by NF-B overexpression. Altogether, OA blocked the IL-1/NF-B/TET3 axis in gastric cancer cells, leading to DNA hypomethylation and downregulation of PD-L1. Our discoveries suggested OA as an epigenetic modulator for immunotherapy or an adjuvant therapy against gastric cancer.","output":"Inhibition of NF-B is required for oleanolic acid to downregulate PD-L1 by promoting DNA demethylation in gastric cancer cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIGNIFICANCE: The estimation of tissue oxygenation is vital in the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of a huge assortment of diseases. The hyperspectral (HS) imaging system is a rising innovation that can be utilized to build a highly sensitive, non-invasive, and tissue hemoglobin immersion map. OBJECTIVE: As a result of the urgent need to design and implement early detection devices and applications for the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose building a non-invasive custom optical imaging system to assist with phlebotomy and vascular approach to survey the reliability of blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels recovered from spectral images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HS images were gathered from 15 healthy subjects without previous medical history complications and with an average age range of 20 to 38 years, who were undergoing phlebotomy. The forearm was vigorously illuminated utilizing an HS camera with polychromatic source light of spectrum range (400a980 nm). Spectroscopic reflectance images were caught by a focal plane exhibit for the region of interest (ROI). Then the custom algorithm comprising normalization and moving average filtering for noise removal was applied, followed by K-mean clustering for image segmentation to visualize and highlight the arteries and the veins in the investigated forearm. RESULTS: The investigations show that after normalization of the recorded signal from the HS camera of the participating subjects it was noticed that at wavelength of 460 nm the oxygenated arteries had a stronger signal than the de-oxygenated veins, and at a wavelength of 750 nm the de-oxygenated veins had a stronger signal than the oxygenated arteries. Thus, the ideal wavelength to reveal the oxygenated arteries was 460 nm, and the ideal wavelength to reveal the de-oxygenated veins was 750 nm. CONCLUSIONS: HSI is a prospective technique to assist with phlebotomy and non-contact oxygen saturation approach. Additionally, it may permit future surgical or pharmacological intercessions that titrate or limit ischemic injury continuously.","output":"Delineation of the Arm Blood Vessels Utilizing Hyperspectral Imaging to Assist with Phlebotomy for Exploiting the Cutaneous Tissue Oxygen Concentration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Results of three rapid immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) were compared with those obtained with two automated immunoassays for evaluation of their usefulness.

We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. Methods A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. Results Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001]. Conclusions Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment.

MEASUREMENTS: We captured baseline demographic, pre-hospitalization antiplatelet medication use, and clinical encounter data for all patients who met inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was peak score on a 6-point modified ordinal scale (MOS), which is based on World Health Organization blueprint R&S groups, used to grade severity of illness through clinical outcomes of interest. Scores indicate the following: 1 C COVID-19 infection not requiring hospitalization, 2 C requiring hospitalization but not supplemental oxygen, 3 C hospitalization requiring supplemental oxygen, 4 C hospitalization requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), 5 C hospitalization requiring intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 6 C death. Multivariable adjusted partial proportional odds model (PPOM) was performed to examine the association between pre-hospitalization antiplatelet medication use and likelihood of each MOS score. MAIN RESULTS: Of 762 people admitted with COVID-19, 239 (31.4%) used antiplatelet medications pre-hospitalization while 523 (68.6%) did not. Antiplatelet users were older and had more co-morbidities at baseline.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between blood glucose (BG) levels and in-hospital mortality in non-critically patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-centre study involving patients hospitalized in Spain. Patients were categorized into three groups according to admission BG levels: <140 mg/dL, 140-180 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 11,312 patients, only 2128 (18.9%) had diabetes and 2289 (20.4%) died during hospitalization. The in-hospital mortality rates were 15.7% (<140 mg/dL), 33.7% (140-180 mg) and 41.1% (>180 mg/dL), p<.001. The cumulative probability of mortality was significantly higher in patients with hyperglycaemia compared to patients with normoglycaemia (log rank, p<.001), independently of pre-existing diabetes. Hyperglycaemia (after adjusting for age, diabetes, hypertension and other confounding factors) was an independent risk factor of mortality (BG >180 mg/dL: HR 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31-1.73) (BG 140-180 mg/dL; HR 1.48; 95%CI: 1.29-1.70).

Setting: Chennai, a densely populated metropolitan city in Southern India, was one of the five cities which contributed to more than half of the COVID-19 cases in India. Participants: We collected the de-identified line list of all the 192,450 COVID-19 case-patients reported from 17 March to 31 October 2020 in Chennai and their contacts for the analysis. We defined a COVID-19 case-patient based on the RT-PCR positive test in one of the Government approved labs. Outcome measures: The primary outcomes of interest were incidence of COVID-19 per million population, case fatality ratio, deaths per million and the effective reproduction number (Rt). We also analysed the indicators for surveillance, testing, contact tracing and isolation. Results: Of the 192,450 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 case-patients reported in Chennai from 17 March-31 October 2020, 114,889 (60%) were males. The highest incidence was 41,064 per million population among the 61-80 years. The incidence peaked during June 2020 at 5239 per million and declined to 3,627 per million in October 2020. The city reported 3,543 deaths, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 1.8% and the crude death rate was 431 per million.

Notably, the increased ACE2-binding affinity of variants containing the N501Y or E484K mutations can be traced to the time-dependent disruption and/or formation of interfacial salt bridges, not necessarily apparent from structural models but detected by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis also explains why the South African variant has an increased tendency to evade mAbs such as REGN10933 (casirivimab), LY-CoV016 (etesevimab), LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab), BD23, and C105 or the nanobody H11-H4, while being insensitive to others including REGN10987 (imdevimab). Simulations also show the distinctive response of the Delta variant to different antibodies, including the minimal effect on the neutralizing activity of the nanobody Nb20, which is confirmed by our experiments. This contrasts the reduction in the potency of the Eli Lilly mAb LY-CoV555.Interpretations. Of interest are critical substitutions T478K, L452R and P681R in the Delta variant that may explain its increased transmissibility. The former two tend to enhance the associations with ACE2 and heparin. The third, P681R, located at a putative superantigenic site, plays a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of proteolytic cleavage and thus accelerating viral entry, because the polybasic wildtype motif P 681 RRAR serving as recognition site for the polyacidic binding epitope of furin-like proteolytic enzymes is rendered even more basic and attractive upon this substitution.

To understand this decline, a national survey of fourth-year US allopathic medical students was conducted to assess experiences, knowledge, and attitudes of pathology and factors that impact specialty choice. Participating in a separate pathology course did not increase the probability of choosing pathology. Experiences significantly associated with choosing pathology included clinical or research opportunities in pathology during the last 2 years of medical school, autopsy observation/participation, and participation in pathology interest groups. Many respondents felt they were not sufficiently exposed to pathology to consider it as a specialty. Those who considered pathology but did not choose it were less likely to report understanding the activities of pathologists and being recruited by pathology faculty and more likely to express a preference for more direct patient contact as compared to those entering pathology. In general, respondents agreed that pathology has a good workClife balance and a satisfying degree of intellectual challenge. On the other hand, respondents generally agreed that information on social media and perception of the pathology job market do not seem to be positive and few agreed that pathology is a highly regarded specialty.

Pooled proportions of EEG findings with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed using a random effects model. The quality of assessment for each study, heterogeneity between the studies, and publication bias were also evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 12 studies with 308 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Abnormal background activity and generalized slowing in the pooled proportions were common findings among the patients with COVID-19 (96.1% [95% CI: 89.4C99.9]; I(2) = 60%; p < 0.01 and 92.3% [95% CI: 81.2C99.3]; I(2) = 74%; p < 0.01, respectively). The proportion of patients with epileptiform discharges (EDs) was 20.3% ([95% CI: 9.85C32.9]; I(2) = 78%; p < 0.01). The proportion of EDs varied between patients with a history of epilepsy or seizures (59.5% [95% CI: 33.9C83.2]; I(2) = 0%; p = 0.49) and patients without them (22.4% [95% CI: 10.4C36.4]; I(2) = 46%; p = 0.07).

Typically, screening mammograms are reported after patients have left the facility. If imaging is abnormal, then an additional visit is needed for diagnostic imaging, introducing delays and potential disparities.Thus, we implemented an immediate-read screening mammography program and measured its impact on racial/ethnic disparities in time to diagnostic imaging after an abnormal screening mammogram. Methods: Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented an immediate read screening program in late May 2020. Patients were provided imaging results before discharge and if the exam was abnormal, efforts were made to perform diagnostic imaging during that visit. We identified consecutive screening mammograms performed weekdays 8:00am-4:30pm and Saturdays 9:00am-4:00pm pre-implementation (6/1/19-10/31/19) and post-implementation (6/1/2020-10/31/2020). Exams left unread while awaiting comparison studies, due to technical factors, or for more than 10 days were excluded. Patient demographics and time from screening exam completion to report finalized were obtained from the electronic medical record. Cancer detection rate (CDR), abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to compare time from screening exam to report, same-day diagnostic imaging, and screening performance metrics pre- and postimplementation overall and by patient subgroups. Results: After 963 exams met exclusion criteria, a total of 8,222 pre- and 7,235 post-implementation exams were included. Median time to report finalization decreased from 61minutes (interquartile range [IQR]:24, 152) to 4 minutes (IQR:2, 7) for pre- and postimplementation periods (p < 0.001). During the pre-implementation period, non-white patients had lower odds of having same-day diagnostic imaging after an abnormal screening exam (age-adjusted odds ratio: 0.28;95% CI: 0.10, 0.78 p = 0.015). There was no evidence of this disparity post-implementation. AIR was higher in the pre- versus post-implementation period (6.3% versus 5.0%;p < 0.001). There was no evidence of a difference in CDR (5.8 versus 4.2 cancers/1,000 exams) and PPV (9.2% versus 8.4%) for pre- versus post-implementation periods.

This is all the more urgent in light of the additional difficulties caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic, such as the demands of remote learning. The present study is a first step toward designing and evaluating an appropriate dynamic resilience intervention for students. The design of the Resilience Journal intervention draws on insights from expressive writing and positive writing research and focuses on reflection on daily challenges. In this online intervention, 100 business school students (66% female, M(age) = 23.74) at a German university were randomly assigned to two groups and completed two different versions of the Resilience Journal for 5 days. The two versions focused, respectively on broadening attention to challenges and priming attention to mastered challenges. In a pre-post design, two resilience measures and one measure of life satisfaction were used to assess intervention outcomes. Additionally, a newly developed rating scale was used for daily monitoring of dynamic resilience. While both groups showed a significant increase in resilience as measured by the Brief Resilience Scale, that increase could not be attributed directly to the intervention, as there were no group differences, and the design did not include a control group. The other resilience and life satisfaction measures showed no significant change.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for mHealth or eHealth technology in the promotion of physical activity among older people aged 50 years or older. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of reviews using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.

We found that cannulation of even a completely occluded inferior petrosal sinus is feasible, especially when using a standard hydrophilic-polymer-jacketed 0.035-inch guidewire as a frontier-wire for probing. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2002 to 2017, the frontier-wire technique was tried in 52 patients with occluded inferior petrosal sinuses for transvenous embolization of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas at our center. Technical success was defined as access into the affected cavernous sinus compartment with a microcatheter through the occluded inferior petrosal sinus and deployment of at least 1 coil. The complications and treatment outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS The frontier-wire technique was applied in 52 patients with 57 occluded inferior petrosal sinuses (52 ipsilateral and 5 contralateral inferior petrosal sinuses). Technical success rates were 80.8% (42/52) of patients and 73.7% (42/57) of inferior petrosal sinuses. Alternative transvenous routes were used in 3 patients, and transarterial access was used in 7 patients. Complete embolization of fistulas was achieved in 82.2% (37/45) of patients in the transvenous embolization group and in 14.3% (1/7) of patients in the transarterial group. No procedure-related morbidity or mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS Transvenous embolization of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas, even through a completely occluded inferior petrosal sinus, is feasible. The difficulty of passing the microcatheter can be minimized by prior probing of the occluded inferior petrosal sinus using a standard 0.035-inch guidewire; the trace of the guidewire on the roadmap image serves as a guide for microcatheter navigation through the inferior petrosal sinus on fluoroscopy.","output":"Cannulation of Occluded Inferior Petrosal Sinuses for the Transvenous Embolization of Cavernous Sinus Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas: Usefulness of a Frontier-Wire Probing Technique."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLI) is an integrative group movement program developed for adults with mild-to-moderate dementia attending day programs. However, many older adults with dementia ultimately require assistance with their activities of daily living and become residents in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities with their complex comorbidities and unique needs. We conducted a post-implementation evaluation of PLI at a San Francisco Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing home to assess reach and effectiveness among residents, staff, and family members who participated in  1 PLI class from 9/2018 to 6/2019. METHODS: Post-implementation number of classes offered and mean attendance; anonymous satisfaction surveys (5-point Likert scales); qualitative content analysis of open-ended survey responses and clinical progress notes. RESULTS: Forty-five PLI classes were offered over 9 months. Residents attended an average of 13  12 classes with an average class size of 14 residents, 4 staff members, and 2 family members. Most survey respondents rated the program overall as very good or excellent (100 % residents, n = 15; 87 % staff, n = 14; 100 % family members, n = 8). Respondents reported improvements in themselves and/or others in four domains: (1) physical, (2) psychological, (3) social, and (4) cognitive. Physical improvements among veterans included mobility, strength, and energy. Psychological improvements included feelings of happiness/well-being, enjoyment, and self-empowerment. Social improvements included connection, social skills, and social support. Cognitive improvements included engagement, communication ability, and focus/attention. Responses were similar among resident, staff, and family member surveys and clinical progress notes. Participants frequently reported improvements in multiple domains (e.g., The veterans are more alert and engaged, many are smiling and laughing.). Negative comments were primarily related to logistics, suggesting that the class occur more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: PLI was successfully implemented in a VA nursing home with high attendance and satisfaction among residents, staff, and family members. Participants reported clinically meaningful physical, psychological, social, and cognitive benefits. Other long-term care facilities could potentially benefit from implementing PLI to increase quality of life in residents with dementia.","output":"Implementation of an integrative movement program for residents with dementia in a VA nursing home"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition that is often undiagnosed or diagnosed late.

In this study, we conducted a serosurvey of asymptomatic infections among food workers and performed serological and cellular response analyses of asymptomatic subjects in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak.

IgM and IgG antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, were significantly lower in asymptomatic subjects than in recovered symptomatic patients with similar disease courses. Furthermore, the asymptomatic subjects showed lymphopenia and a prominent decrease in the B-cell population, as well as a low frequency of antibody-secreting cells and a low cytokine response. These factors probably contributed to the low and unsustained antibody levels in asymptomatic subjects.

Evidence for how oscillatory entrainment changes over developmental time is also lacking.

To date, however, whether obesity is associated with adult cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE To assess whether obesity is a risk factor for CVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A case-control study was performed in consecutive adult patients with CVT admitted from July 1, 2006 (Amsterdam), and October 1, 2009 (Berne), through December 31, 2014, to the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, or Inselspital University Hospital in Berne, Switzerland. The control group was composed of individuals from the control population of the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis study, which was a large Dutch case-control study performed from March 1, 1999, to September 31, 2004, and in which risk factors for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were assessed. Data analysis was performed from January 2 to July 12, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Obesity was determined by body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 30 or greater was considered to indicate obesity, and a BMI of 25 to 29.99 was considered to indicate overweight. A multiple imputation procedure was used for missing data. We adjusted for sex, age, history of cancer, ethnicity, smoking status, and oral contraceptive use. Individuals with normal weight (BMI <25) were the reference category. RESULTS The study included 186 cases and 6134 controls. Cases were younger (median age, 40 vs 48 years), more often female (133 [71.5%] vs 3220 [52.5%]), more often used oral contraceptives (97 [72.9%] vs 758 [23.5%] of women), and more frequently had a history of cancer (17 [9.1%] vs 235 [3.8%]) compared with controls. Obesity (BMI 30) was associated with an increased risk of CVT (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.63; 95% CI, 1.53-4.54). Stratification by sex revealed a strong association between CVT and obesity in women (adjusted OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.00-6.14) but not in men (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.25-5.30). Further stratification revealed that, in women who used oral contraceptives, overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of CVT in a dose-dependent manner (BMI 25.0-29.9: adjusted OR, 11.87; 95% CI, 5.94-23.74; BMI 30: adjusted OR, 29.26; 95% CI, 13.47-63.60).

Whether this is the case for behaviour change counselling, a complex intervention developed specifically for maximising the effectiveness of real-world consultations about health behaviour change, remains unclear. To improve our understanding of treatment effects, best practice guidelines recommend the use of strategies to enhance, monitor and evaluate what clinicians deliver during patient consultations. There has yet to be a systematic evaluation of whether and how these recommendations have been employed within evaluations of behaviour change counselling, nor the impact on patient health behaviour and/or outcome. We seek to address this gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Methods are informed by published guidelines.

These range from a better understanding of human disease at a molecular level, allowing the discovery and development of novel biopharmaceuticals and vaccines, to the improvement of biotechnological processes providing improved food quality and safety, efficient green fuels, and smart textiles. Among these applications, the significance of pathogen diagnostics as the main focus of this Account has become particularly clear during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this context, while RT-PCR is the gold standard method for unambiguous detection of genetic material from pathogens, other isothermal amplification alternatives circumventing rapid heatingCcooling cycles up to 95 C are appealing to facilitate the translation of the assay into point-of-care (PoC) analytical platforms. Furthermore, the possibility of routinely multiplexing the detection of tens to hundreds of target sequences with single base pair specificity, currently not met by state-of-the-art methods available in clinical laboratories, would be instrumental along the path to tackle emergent viral variants and antimicrobial resistance genes. Here, we advocate that padlock probes (PLPs), first reported by Nilsson et al. in 1994, coupled with rolling circle amplification (RCA), termed here as PLP-RCA, is an underexploited technology in current arena of isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) providing an unprecedented degree of multiplexing, specificity, versatility, and amenability to integration in miniaturized PoC platforms. Furthermore, the intrinsically digital amplification of PLP-RCA retains spatial information and opens new avenues in the exploration of pathogenesis with spatial multiomics analysis of infected cells and tissue. The Account starts by introducing PLP-RCA in a nutshell focusing individually on the three main assay steps, namely, (1) PLP design and ligation mechanism, (2) RCA after probe ligation, and (3) detection of the RCA products. Each subject is touched upon succinctly but with sufficient detail for the reader to appreciate some assay intricacies and degree of versatility depending on the analytical challenge at hand. After familiarizing the reader with the method, we discuss specific examples of research in our group and others using PLP-RCA for viral, bacterial, and fungal diagnostics in a variety of clinical contexts, including the genotyping of antibiotic resistance genes and viral subtyping. Then, we dissect key developments in the miniaturization and integration of PLP-RCA to minimize user input, maximize analysis throughput, and expedite the time to results, ultimately aiming at PoC applications. These developments include molecular enrichment for maximum sensitivity, spatial arrays to maximize analytical throughput, automation of liquid handling to streamline the analytical workflow in miniaturized devices, and seamless integration of signal transduction to translate RCA product titers (and ideally spatial information) into a readable output. Finally, we position PLP-RCA in the current landscape of NAATs and furnish a systematic Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis to shine light upon unpolished edges to uncover the gem with potential for ubiquitous, precise, and unbiased pathogen diagnostics.","output":"Rolling Circle Amplification in Integrated Microsystems: An Uncut Gem toward Massively Multiplexed Pathogen Diagnostics and Genotyping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and it has since spread worldwide.

We reviewed and analysed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features involving these cases. Age-tratification analysis was also implemented. RESULTS: We analysed 96 confirmed cases. The patients had a mean age of 43 years, with six patients younger than 18 years and 14 patients older than 60 years. No significant gender difference was discovered. Co-morbidities were commonly observed in patients aged over 40 years. Twenty eight of the patients had travelled from Wuhan City, and 51 patients were infected through close contact. Familial clusters accounted for 48 of the cases. The mean incubation time was 7 days, and the symptoms were mainly fever, cough, fatigue, and sore throat. Lymphocytopenia was observed predominantly in patients aged over 60 years. Fifty five patients presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions. The radiological changes were typically distributed in the subpleural area, and pleural effusion rarely occurred.

Time-dependent associations were explored using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Censoring was performed on 13th May 2020, ensuring a minimum of 28 days follow-up. Findings: The study cohort consisted of 981 patients. During the study period, 354 (36.0%) patients died. Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.53), respiratory disease (aHR 1.37), immunosuppression (aHR 2.23), higher respiratory rate (aHR 1.28), hypoxia (aHR 1.36), Glasgow Coma Score <15 (aHR 1.92), higher urea levels (aHR 2.67), higher alkaline phosphatase (aHR 2.53), higher CRP (aHR 1.15), higher lactate levels (aHR 2.67), lower platelet counts (aHR 0.77) and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph (aHR 1.89) were all associated with increased mortality. Sex and ethnicity were not associated with mortality. Interpretation: Mortality rates from COVID-19 are high among hospitalised patients. This study identifies a number of characteristics associated with a higher risk of mortality. These important data will aid clinical risk stratification and provide direction for further research.

Case study: A 32-year-old patient in her 38th week of pregnancy reported loss of fetal movements. She overcame mild COVID-19 with positive PCR test 22 days before. A histology of the placenta showed deposition of intervillous fibrinoid, lympho-histiocytic infiltration, scant neutrophils, clumping of villi, and extant infarctions. Immunohistochemistry identified focal SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike protein in the syncytiotrophoblast and isolated in situ hybridization of the virus RNA. Low ACE2 and TMPRSS2 contrasted with strong basigin/CD147 and PDL-1 positivity in the trophoblast. An autopsy of the fetus showed no morphological abnormalities except for lung interstitial infiltrate, with prevalent CD8-positive T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization proved the presence of countless dispersed SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial and endothelial cells in the lung tissue. The potential virus-receptor protein ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 expression was too low to be detected. Conclusion: Over three weeks persistence of trophoblast viral infection lead to extensive intervillous fibrinoid depositions and placental infarctions. High CD147 expression might serve as the dominant receptor for the virus, and PDL-1 could limit maternal immunity in placental tissue virus clearance. The presented case indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced changes in the placenta lead to ischemia and consecutive demise of the fetus. The infection of the fetus was without significant impact on its death. This rare complication of pregnancy can appear independently to the severity of COVID-19s clinical course in the pregnant mother.","output":"Intrauterine Fetal Demise After Uncomplicated COVID-19: What Can We Learn from the Case?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Researchers have focused on developing specific assays for conclusively identifying and measuring the levels of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses (microbes), and their associated products (biomarkers) that cause disease in humans and animals (Murray et al., 2003).

Participants interpreted investigations, performed examinations, created management plans, and escalated using a pager. Results: There was a significant improvement in preparedness for giving treatment (median(IQR): pre-simulation 3(3-4) vs. post-simulation 4(4-4.75);p=0.04) and paperwork (2(2-3.75) vs. 4(3.25-4.75);p=0.03).

Material and methods We evaluated the results of EM in 19 patients (men 15, median age: 55, range: 25-83), presenting with SD of the IC or VA with coexisting stenosis and/or aneurysmatic dilatation of the artery in segments C1-C5 of IC or V0-V4 of VA. Twelve patients had a stroke, 6 TIA, and 3 patients a headache and/or a neck pain with Horner syndrome. Stents and PS were tailored according to the location, length of dissection and coexisting stenotic or aneurysmatic lesions. Results There were no new strokes, in-hospital deaths or other serious morbidities during the procedure and postprocedural hospital stay. There were no fatalities during 6-40 months of follow-up. In control angiographies performed after interventions all patients demonstrated a patent target artery, complete coverage of the dissection and aneurysm by stents and no new lesions in the area of the previous dissection.

One of the adverse events of NM is hyperkalaemia due to inhibition of the amiloride\\\\sensitive sodium channels (ENaC). The incidence and risk factors for hyperkalaemia due to NM have been studied in patients with pancreatitis but not in COVID\\\\19. COVID\\\\19 can be associated with hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia, and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 is thought to inhibit ENaC. Therefore, frequency and risk factors for hyperkalaemia due to NM may differ between COVID\\\\19 and pancreatitis. Hyperkalaemia may worsen the respiratory condition of patients. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors for hyperkalaemia in COVID\\\\19 patients treated with favipiravir, dexamethasone and NM. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the records of hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients treated with favipiravir and dexamethasone, with or without NM, between March 2020 and January 2021. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors for hyperkalaemia. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of 45 patients who received favipiravir and dexamethasone with NM for the treatment of COVID\\\\19, 21 (47%) experienced hyperkalaemia. The duration of NM administration was a significant predictor of hyperkalaemia (odds ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.04C2.31, p = 0.031). The receiver\\\\operating characteristic curve analysis determined that the cut\\\\off value for predicting the number of days until the onset of hyperkalaemia was 6 days and the area under the curve was 0.707. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the incidence of hyperkalaemia is high in patients treated for COVID\\\\19 with NM, and that the duration of NM administration is a key risk factor.

Increased school violence, combined with an emphasis on early hemorrhage control, has boosted demand to treat injuries in schools. Meanwhile, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made educating the public about trauma more difficult. A federally funded high school education program in development, called First Aid for Severe Trauma? (FAST?), will teach students to aid the severely injured. The program will be offered in instructor-led, web-based, and blended formats. We created a program to prepare high school teachers to become FAST instructors via virtual in-person (VIP) instruction. We used a webinar followed by VIP skills practice, using supplies shipped to participants homes. To our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated this type of mass, widely distributed, VIP education. METHODS: This study is a prospective, single-arm, educational cohort study. We enrolled a convenience sample of all high school teachers attending FAST sessions at the Health Occupations Students of AmericaCFuture Health Professionals International Leadership Conference. Half of the participants were randomized to complete the Stop the Bleed Education Assessment Tool (SBEAT) prior to the webinar, and the other completed it afterward; SBEAT is a validated tool to measure learning of bleeding competencies. We then performed 76 VIP video-training sessions from JuneCAugust 2020. The FAST instructors assessed each participants ability to apply a tourniquet and direct pressure individually, then provided interactive group skills training, and finally re-evaluated each participants performance post-training. RESULTS: A total of 190 (96%) participants successfully applied a tourniquet after VIP training, compared to 136 (68%) prior to training (P < 0.001). Participants significantly improved their ability to apply direct pressure: 116 (56%) pre-assessment vs 204 (100%) post-assessment (P < 0.001). The mean score for the SBEAT increased significantly from pre-training to post-training: 2.09 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.97 to 2.55 post-training with a SD of 0.72 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a webinar combined with VIP training is effective for teaching tourniquet and direct-pressure application skills, as well as life-threatening bleeding knowledge. VIP education may be useful for creating resuscitative medicine instructors from distributed locations, and to reach learners who cannot attend classroom-based instruction.","output":"The FAST VIP (First Aid for Severe Trauma Virtual in-Person) Educational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The role of plasma therapy in the management of the COVID-19, pandemic has been speculated. However, in view of the varied response regarding its effectiveness from various multicenter studies, there is a need to conduct more singlecenter population-specific studies. We, thus, aimed to assess the role of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patient management in a single -center. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using records of all COVID-19 patients who received plasma therapy over a period of 6 months in a dedicated COVID-19 hospital in Delhi. Information pertaining to transfusion, disease severity, associated comorbidities, the treatment given and patient outcome were recorded. Data was analyzed using SPSSv23. RESULTS: Of the141 patients who received plasma therapy, 62% were discharged after treatment. Mortality was found to be significantly higher in patients >60 years of age (p< 0.001), those with severe COVID-19 infection (p < 0.05) and pre-existing renal disease (p < 0.05). The admission-transfusion interval was significantly correlated to mortality and was a sensitive parameter for predicting outcome at cut off value of <5 days (p <0.001). There was no significant association of mortality with patient blood group, plasma antibody levels or donor hemoglobin levels. CONCLUSIONS: We report improvement and recovery in a large number of patients who received convalescent plasma within the first 5 days of hospitalization with moderate to severe disease.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using EHRs from nine geriatric clinics in Stockholm, Sweden, comprising 3,405 COVID-19 patients (mean age 81.9 years) between 1/3/2020 and 31/10/2021. Frailty was assessed using a 48-item eFI developed for Swedish geriatric patients, the CFS, and Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Comorbidity was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). We analyzed in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission using logistic regression and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 30-day and 6-month mortality were modelled by Cox regression, and the length of stay by linear regression. ResultsControlling for age and sex, a 10% increase in the eFI was associated with higher risks of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]=2.84; 95% confidence interval=2.31-3.51), 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=2.30; 1.99-2.65), 6-month mortality (HR=2.33; 2.07-2.62), 30-day readmission (OR=1.34; 1.06-1.68), and longer length of stay ({beta}=2.28; 1.90-2.66).

A retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 admitted to seven intensive care units (ICUs) in England up to 18 May 2020, was performed. Patients with completed ICU stays were included. The proportion and type of organisms were determined at <48 and >48 h following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections.Results. Of 254 patients studied (median age 59 years (IQR 49-69); 64.6a% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83 (32.7a%) patients. Bacterial co-infections/ co-colonisation were identified within 48 h of admission in 14 (5.5a%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The co-infection/ co-colonisation rate >48 h after admission was 27/1000 person-days (95a% CI 21.3-34.1). Patients with co-infections/ co-colonisation were more likely to die in ICU (crude OR 1.78,95a% CI 1.03-3.08, P=0.04) compared to those without co-infections/ co-colonisation.Conclusion.

Nurses who work to combat COVID-19 are frequently under pressure. The high stresses caused by the consequences of transmission of the COVID-19 put nurses at risk of developing burnout syndrome. AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of anxiety and burnout experienced by nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was conducted using a cross-sectional design. An online web-based survey was used to collected data in the national sample of nurses (n = 243, response rate = 78.6%). This study used a convenience sampling technique. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were also employed. Multiple linear regressions were used to determine characteristics associated with burnout. RESULTS: The participants average age was 34.62 years (SD = 7.91). The mean anxiety score was 7.89 (SD = 2.94). The mean score of emotional exhaustion was 14.35 (SD = 7.72), the depersonalization means score was 8.81 (SD = 5.11), and the professional accomplishment mean score was 13.51 (SD = 7.51). Education and job experience had a substantial effect on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, with R2 values of 10.8% and 18.5%, respectively. When anxiety was included in the model, the R2 for emotional exhaustion increased to 20.4% and the R2 for depersonalization increased to 22.2%, respectively. Work experience had a little effect on professional accomplishment (R2 = 10.3%) but had a much larger effect when the variable of anxiety was included in the model (R2 = 18.3%). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that during the COVID-19 epidemic, nurses experienced many emotional states, including exhaustion, depersonalization, and anxiety.

Alongside vaccines, antivirals are urgently needed to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread, particularly in resource-limited regions which lack access to existing therapeutics. Small molecules isolated from medicinal plants may be able to block cellular entry by SARS-CoV-2 by antagonising the interaction of the viral spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. As the medicinal plant Gunnera perpensa L. is being used by some South African traditional healers for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 management, we hypothesised that it may contain chemical constituents that inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction. Using a previously described AlphaScreen-based protein interaction assay, we show here that the DCM:MeOH extract of G. perpensa readily disrupts RBD (USA-WA1/2020)-ACE2 interactions with a half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of < 0.001 g/mL, compared to an IC(50) of 0.025 g/mL for the control neutralising antibody REGN10987. Employing hyphenated analytical techniques like UPLC-IMS-HRMS (method developed and validated as per the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), we identified two ellagitannins, punicalin (2.12% w/w) and punicalagin (1.51% w/w), as plant constituents in the DCM:MeOH extract of G. perpensa which antagonised RBD-ACE2 binding with respective IC(50)s of 9 and 29 nM. This good potency makes both compounds promising leads for development of future entry-based SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. The results also highlight the advantages of combining reverse pharmacology (based on medicinal plant use) with hyphenated analytical techniques to expedite identification of urgently needed antivirals.

RESULTS Results of the meta-analysis show that in older people, the risk of developing dementia because of the impact of prolonged loneliness and social isolation is about 49 to 60% [HR/HR = 1.49; CI95=1.37-1.61] higher than in those who are not lonely and socially isolated. CONCLUSION The biopsychosocial model of dementia supports the need for more integrated social programs and reduced risks for the older persons who, during the COVID-19 lockdown, have suffered from deprivation of support from primary carers and restricted social interactions.KeypointsDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, social isolation and feelings of loneliness in the general population have increased.Older persons are more vulnerable to social isolation and feelings of loneliness (SIFL).SIFL in older people has been associated with an increased risk of dementia.The current study's findings suggest the need to improve healthcare policies to reduce the impact of SIFL in older persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19, loneliness, social isolation and risk of dementia in older people: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This research aims to analyze the application regularity of Chinese patent medicine during the COVID-19 epidemic by collecting the names of the top three Chinese patent medicines used by 24 hospitals in 14 provinces of China in four time periods (January 20C22, February 16C18, March 01C03, April 01C03, 2020), and explore its contribution to combating the disease. Methods: 1) We built a database of the top three Chinese patent medicines used by 24 hospitals. 2) The frequency and efficacy distribution of Chinese patent medicine were analyzed with risk areas, regions, and hospitals of different properties as three factors. 3) Finally, we analyzed the differences in the use of heat-clearing and non-heat-clearing medicines among the three factors ((2) test) and the correlation between the Chinese patent medicine and COVID-19 epidemic (correlation analysis) with SPSS 23.0 statistical software. Results: 1) The heat-clearing medicine was the main use category nationwide during January 20C22, 2020. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference in the utilization rate of heat-clearing and non-heat-clearing medicine in different risk areas (p < 0.01). 2) The variety of Chinese patent medicine was increased nationwide during February 16C18, 2020, mainly including tonics, blood-activating and resolving-stasis, and heat-clearing medicines. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference in the utilization rate of heat-clearing and non-heat-clearing medicine in the southern and northern regions (p < 0.05). 3) Tonics, and blood-activating and resolving-stasis medicines became the primary use categories nationwide during March 01C03, 2020. 4) The tonics class, and blood-activating and resolving-stasis medicine were still the primary categories nationwide during April 01C03, 2020. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference in the utilization rate of heat-clearing and non-heat-clearing medicine in different risk areas (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Chinese patent medicine has a certain degree of participation in fighting against the COVID-19. The efficacy distribution is related to the risk area, region, and hospital of different properties, among which the risk area is the main influencing factor. It is hoped that future research can further collect the application amount of Chinese patent medicine used in hospitals all over the country, so as to perfectly reflect the relationship between Chinese patent medicine and the epidemic situation.","output":"A Retrospective Study on the Use of Chinese Patent Medicine in 24 Medical Institutions for COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal Bevezets: A COVID-19-jrvny az egsz vilgon elterjedt A jrvny Eurpban val els? megjelense sorn megfigyelhet? volt, hogy a terjeds mrtke kisebb azokban az orszgokban, ahol a tuberkulzis elleni vdekezsl kiterjedt BCG-vakcincit vgeznek Clkit?zs: A jelen munkban olyan ?sszefggseket igyekeztnk feltrni, amelyek befolysoltk a jrvnyterjeds paramtereit, kl?n?s figyelemmel a BCG-vakcincis gyakorlatra Mdszerek: A vilg ?sszes olyan orszgra vonatkozan, ahol megfelel? min?sg? statisztikai adatok lltak rendelkezsnkre, vizsgltuk a jrvny terjedsnek els? hullmt A mozgtlagolt jrvnyg?rbken elemeztk a jrvny id?tartamt, a tet?zs mrtkt, a fert?z?ttek s a hallesetek egymilli lakosra vettett szmt Figyelembe vettk az orszgok gazdasgi mutatit (GDP, lgi forgalom, a tengeri hajzs mrtke) Statisztikai analzis: A vizsglt paramterek nem mutattak normlis eloszlst, gy nemparamteres prbkkal (rangkorrelci, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) statisztikai kapcsolatot kerestnk a jrvnyterjeds mrtke, a BCG-vakcinci s ms paramterek k?z?tt Eredmnyek: A jrvny gyorsan elterjedt a vilgon, de mgis, februr els? hrom hetben a terjedsben egy sznet volt megfigyelhet?

It is of extreme importance to develop an efficient statistical model of COVID-19 spread, which could help in the global fight against the virus. We propose a clustering-segmented autoregressive sigmoid (CSAS) model to explore the space-time pattern of the log-transformed infectious count. Four key characteristics are included in this CSAS model, including unknown clusters, change points, stretched S-curves, and autoregressive terms, in order to understand how this outbreak is spreading in time and in space, to understand how the spread is affected by epidemic control strategies, and to apply the model to updated data from an extended period of time. We propose a nonparametric graph-based clustering method for discovering dissimilarity of the curve time series in space, which is justified with theoretical support to demonstrate how the model works under mild and easily verified conditions. We propose a very strict purity score that penalizes overestimation of clusters. Simulations show that our nonparametric graph-based clustering method is faster and more accurate than the parametric clustering method regardless of the size of data sets. We provide a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to identify multiple change points and calculate a confidence interval for a mean response. By applying the CSAS model to the collected data, we can explain the differences between prevention and control policies in China and selected countries.","output":"Exploring the space-time pattern of log-transformed infectious count of COVID-19: a clustering-segmented autoregressive sigmoid model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a disease outbreak, healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential to treat infected individuals. However, these HCWs are themselves susceptible to contracting the disease. As more HCWs get infected, fewer are available to provide care for others, and the overall quality of care available to infected individuals declines. This depletion of HCWs may contribute to the epidemic's severity. To examine this issue, we explicitly model declining quality of care in four differential equation-based SIR-type models with vaccination. We assume that vaccination, recovery, and survival rates are affected by quality of care delivered. We show that explicitly modelling healthcare workers and accounting for declining quality of care significantly alters model-predicted disease outcomes, specifically case counts and mortality. Models neglecting the decline of quality of care resulting from infection of HCWs may significantly under-estimate cases and mortality. These models may be useful to inform health policy that may differ for healthcare workers and the general population. Models accounting for declining quality of care may therefore improve the management interventions considered to mitigate the effects of a future outbreak.","output":"Analyzing How Changes in the Health Status of Healthcare Workers Affects Epidemic Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"17 September 2021 GENEVA - WHO is urging leaders attending the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) to guarantee equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and other life-saving tools;ensure the world is better prepared to respond to future pandemics;and renew efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The current article aims to describe this experience in designing and organizing a web-congress by the 2020-IWBNC method. METHODS The 2020-IWBNC was organized by the Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery (CIEN in Spanish) in a record time of four weeks. Eight committees were created and assigned with a specific task to fulfill. The event followed a strict protocol based on the double-room method, which consisted of two virtual rooms (A and B) hosted from four different physical locations to avoid lecture overlapping and connection drops.

Our aim was to prospectively and systematically estimate the occurrence of DVT in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, and to identify potential risk factors for DVT occurrence and mortality. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 admitted to our 45-beds intensive care unit (ICU) between March 6, 2020 and April 18, 2020 requiring invasive ventilatory support were daily screened for DVT with lower extremities and jugular veins ultrasonography. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were performed in order to identify predictors of DVT and mortality. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients were included in the final analysis (56 men, mean age 67 years, median SOFA 7 points, median SAPS II 41 points, median PaO2/Fi02 10.8 kPa). The period prevalence of DVT was 40.8%. Thirty-one DVTs were diagnosed. Twenty-five DVTs (80.6% of total DVTs) were catheter-related, mainly in the jugular veins. Twentysix DVTs (83.9%) occurred in patients receiving enhanced antithrombotic prophylaxis. No independent variable was predictive of DVT occurrence. Twenty-eight patients (36.8%) died during the ICU stay. Age and SOFA score were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A high number of critically ill mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients developed a DVT.

Most of the global population live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have historically received a small fraction of global resources for mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many of these countries. This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in four parts. First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies;notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.

The concept that nucleic acid could modulate the activity of target protein as ligand emerged from basic science studies of viruses. Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of specific, high-affinity molecular binding, which allow for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Compared to traditional antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, including small size, flexible structure, good biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity. In vitro selection method is used to isolate aptamers that are specific for a desired target from a randomized oligonucleotide library. The first aptamer drug, Macugen, was approved by FDA in 2004, which was accompanied by many studies and clinical investigations on various targets and diseases. Despite much promise, most aptamers have failed to meet the requisite safety and efficacy standards in human clinical trials. Amid these setbacks, the emergence of novel technologies and recent advances in aptamer and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) design are fueling hope in this field. The unique properties of aptamer are gaining renewed interest in an era of COVID-19. The binding performance of an aptamer and reproducibility are still the key issues in tackling current hurdles in clinical translation. A thorough analysis of the aptamer binding under varying conditions and the conformational dynamics is warranted.

The authors defined three characteristics of digitalised work, conceptually positioned five of the measured constructs as readiness factors and generated readiness profiles for the two national student cohorts. Investigation of significant differences between the groups was conducted using an Independent Samples T-Test. A composite profile was produced for comparing the overall dispositional readiness of both groups for digitalised work.FindingsThe factor-level profiles showed similar patterns of dispositional alignment and misalignment with digitalised work. For example, technology optimism and learning interest were reported by large percentages of Ukrainians and Latvians and tolerance for unstructured work by small percentages. However, significant differences were found in group levels of technology optimism, technology anxiety, ambiguity intolerance and empowered decision-making. In each case, the Ukrainian profile appeared more strongly aligned with the target.Practical implicationsThe global digitalisation of work requires students, educators, human resource professionals and business leaders to rethink workforce readiness assessment and adapt (re)training programs. Technology enthusiasm and learning interest should be regarded as crucial measurable attitudes motivating technical skills development. Also, cultural orientations should be positioned alongside personality traits and digital skills as factors shaping successful humanCcomputer interaction.Originality/valueThis study initiates a new sociotechnical and cross-cultural trajectory of technology readiness research from data generated in two post-Soviet contexts.

The association of race in a cohort of gynecologic oncology patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection is unknown. METHODS Data were abstracted from gynecologic oncology patients with COVID-19 infection among 8 New York City area hospital systems. A multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model accounting for county clustering was used to analyze COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS Of 193 patients who had gynecologic cancer and COVID-19, 67 (34.7%) were Black, and 126 (65.3%) were non-Black. Black patients were more likely to require hospitalization compared with non-Black patients (71.6% [48 of 67] vs 46.0% [58 of 126]; P = .001). Of 34 (17.6%) patients who died from COVID-19, 14 (41.2%) were Black. Among those who were hospitalized, compared with non-Black patients, Black patients were more likely to: have 3 comorbidities (81.1% [30 of 37] vs 59.2% [29 of 49]; P = .05), to reside in Brooklyn (81.0% [17 of 21] vs 44.4% [12 of 27]; P = .02), to live with family (69.4% [25 of 36] vs 41.6% [37 of 89]; P = .009), and to have public insurance (79.6% [39 of 49] vs 53.4% [39 of 73]; P = .006).

Epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 were validated on a limited date range; where substantial uncertainties remained, multiple parameters were tested. The effects of different public-health strategies were tested over a 160-day period, analyzed for their effects on ICU demand and death rate, and compared to Swedish data for April 2020. RESULTS: Swedish mortality rates fall intermediate between European countries that quickly imposed stringent public-health controls and countries that acted later. Models most closely reproducing reported mortality data suggest large portions of the population voluntarily self-isolate. Swedish ICU utilization rates remained lower than predicted, but a large fraction of deaths occurred in non-ICU patients. This suggests that patient prognosis was considered in ICU admission, reducing healthcare load at a cost of decreased survival in patients not admitted. CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish COVID-19 strategy has thus far yielded a striking result: mild mandates overlaid with voluntary measures can achieve results highly similar to late-onset stringent mandates. However, this policy causes more healthcare demand and mortality than early stringent control and depends on continued public will.","output":"Managing COVID-19 spread with voluntary public-health measures: Sweden as a case study for pandemic control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dental visits are unpleasant; sometimes, patients only seek treatment when they are in intolerable pain. Recently, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the need for remote communication when patients and dentists cannot meet in person. Gingivitis is very common and characterized by red, swollen, bleeding gums. Gingivitis heals within 10 days of professional care and with daily, thorough oral hygiene practices. If left untreated, however, its progress may lead to teeth becoming mobile or lost. Of the many medical apps currently available, none monitor gingivitis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a characterization and development model of a mobile health (mHealth) app called iGAM, which focuses on periodontal health and improves the information flow between dentists and patients. METHODS: A focus group discussed the potential of an app to monitor gingivitis, and 3 semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted on the use of apps for monitoring gum infections. We used a qualitative design process based on the Agile approach, which incorporated the following 5 steps: (1) user story, (2) use cases, (3) functional requirements, (4) nonfunctional requirements, and (5) Agile software development cycles. In a pilot study with 18 participants aged 18-45 years and with different levels of health literacy, participants were given a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, toothpicks, and dental floss. After installing iGAM, they were asked to photograph their gums weekly for 4 weeks. RESULTS: All participants in the focus group believed in the potential of a mobile app to monitor gingivitis and reduce its severity. Concerns about security and privacy issues were discussed. From the interviews, 2 themes were derived: (1) what's in it for me? and (2) the need for a take-home message. The 5 cycles of development highlighted the importance of communication between dentists, app developers, and the pilot group. Qualitative analysis of the data from the pilot study showed difficulty with: (1) the camera, which was alleviated with the provision of mouth openers, and (2) the operation of the phone, which was alleviated by changing the app to be fully automated, with a weekly reminder and an instructions document. Final interviews showed satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: iGAM is the first mHealth app for monitoring gingivitis using self-photography. iGAM facilitates the information flow between dentists and patients between checkups and may be useful when face-to-face consultations are not possible (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic).","output":"Developing a Mobile App (iGAM) to Promote Gingival Health by Professional Monitoring of Dental Selfies: User-Centered Design Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Domestic violence is a global public health problem.

Since its discovery almost 140 years before, phagocytosis remains the hot topic of research in immunology. The phagocytosis research has seen a great advancement since its first discovery. Functionally, phagocytosis is a simple immunological process required to engulf and remove pathogens, dead cells and tumor cells to maintain the immune homeostasis. However, mechanistically, it is a very complex process involving different mechanisms, induced and regulated by several pattern recognition receptors, soluble pattern recognition molecules, scavenger receptors (SRs) and opsonins. These mechanisms involve the formation of phagosomes, their maturation into phagolysosomes causing pathogen destruction or antigen synthesis to present them to major histocompatibility complex molecules for activating an adaptive immune response. Any defect in this mechanism may predispose the host to certain infections and inflammatory diseases (autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases) along with immunodeficiency.

Various anticoagulation regimens are now being considered for these patients. Anticoagulation is known to increase the risk for adverse bleeding events, of which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most feared. We present a retrospective study of 33 patients positive for COVID-19 with neuroimaging-documented ICH and examine anticoagulation use in this population. METHODS: Patients over the age of 18 with confirmed COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of ICH were included in this study. Evidence of hemorrhage was confirmed and categorized by a fellowship trained neuroradiologist. Electronic health records were analyzed for patient information including demographic data, medical history, hospital course, laboratory values, and medications. RESULTS: We identified 33 COVID-19 positive patients with ICH, mean age 61.6 years (range 37-83 years), 21.2% of whom were female. Parenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect and herniation occurred in 5 (15.2%) patients, with a 100% mortality rate. Of the remaining 28 patients with ICH, 7 (25%) had punctate hemorrhages, 17 (60.7%) had small- moderate size hemorrhages, and 4 (14.3%) had a large single site of hemorrhage without evidence of herniation. Almost all patients received either therapeutic dose anticoagulation (in 22 [66.7%] patients) or prophylactic dose (in 3 [9.1] patients) prior to ICH discovery.

Upon treatment with FlgE proteins, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and SV40-immortalized murine vascular endothelial cells manifested decreased proliferation, migration, tube formation, and surface ATP production and increased apoptosis. FlgE proteins increased the permeability of HUVEC monolayers to soluble large molecules like dextran as well as to neutrophils.

In Balb/c-nude mice bearing transplanted solid tumors, FlgE proteins induced a microvascular hyperpermeability in pinna, lungs, tumor mass, and abdominal cavity. All effects observed in FlgE proteins were partially or completely impaired in FlgEM proteins or blocked by pretreatment with anti-ATP5B antibodies.

Orthopaedic departments have adopted business continuity models and guidelines for essential and non-essential surgeries to preserve hospital resources as well as protect patients and staff. These guidelines broadly encompass reduction of ambulatory care with a move towards telemedicine, redeployment of orthopaedic surgeons/residents to the frontline battle against COVID-19, continuation of education and research through web-based means, and cancellation of non-essential elective procedures. However, if containment of COVID-19 community spread is achieved, resumption of elective orthopaedic procedures and transition plans to return to normalcy must be considered for orthopaedic departments. The COVID-19 pandemic also presents a moral dilemma to the orthopaedic surgeon considering elective procedures. What is the best treatment for our patients and how does the fear of COVID-19 influence the risk-benefit discussion during a pandemic? Surgeons must deliberate the fine balance between elective surgery for a patient's wellbeing versus risks to the operating team and utilization of precious hospital resources. Attrition of healthcare workers or Orthopaedic surgeons from restarting elective procedures prematurely or in an unsafe manner may render us ill-equipped to handle the second wave of infections. This highlights the need to develop effective screening protocols or preoperative COVID-19 testing before elective procedures in high-risk, elderly individuals with comorbidities. Alternatively, high-risk individuals should be postponed until the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 infection is minimal. In addition, given the higher mortality and perioperative morbidity of patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery, the decision to operate must be carefully deliberated.

Person-centred care is essential to meeting specific patient needs. Nurse-led clinics, where a nurse is responsible for care, have demonstrated added value in some countries but are still not implemented widely. This study aimed to explore stakeholders perceptions of advantages, disadvantages and conditions for the implementation of nurse-led clinics for RA in Belgium. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional qualitative study consisting of five semi-structured focus group interviews. Rheumatology nurses, patients with RA and rheumatologists were interviewed as stakeholders. The analysis was carried out by three researchers according to the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL), formulating a conceptual framework of overarching themes and deconstructing this into perceived advantages, disadvantages and conditions. RESULTS: Two focus groups with nurses (total n = 16), two with patients (n = 17) and one with rheumatologists (n = 9) were conducted. The interview synthesis resulted in five overarching themes across stakeholders: efficiency of care, disease management, legal and organizational requirements, the conventional role of the nurse and the extended role of the nurse. All stakeholders perceived additional education for nurses as essential, but rheumatologists debated nurses abilities to lead a rheumatology clinic. Furthermore, patients preferred care protocols to guide nurses, and care providers approached this reluctantly. Generally, patients with a well-controlled disease were perceived as the ideal candidates for nurse-led care.

We examined the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, followed by recombinant expression of the most frequent HLA-A alleles, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, to study differences in mycobacterial peptide presentation and CD8(+) T-cell recognition. We screened a peptide library (9-mer peptides with an 8-amino-acid overlap) for binding, affinity, and off-rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigen TB10.4 and identified only three TB10.4 peptides with considerable binding to HLA-A*3001. In contrast, 22 peptides bound to HLA-A*3002. This reflects a marked difference in the binding preference between the two alleles, with A*3002 tolerating a more promiscuous peptide-binding pattern and A*3001 accommodating only a very selective peptide repertoire. Subsequent analysis of the affinity and off-rate of the binding peptides revealed a strong affinity (8 nM to 7 M) and moderate off-rate (20 min to 3 h) for both alleles. Construction of HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 tetramers containing selected binding peptides from TB10.4, including a peptide which was shared among both alleles, QIMYNYPAM (TB10.4(3-11)), allowed us to enumerate epitope-specific T cells in HLA-A*3001- and HLA-A*3002-typed patients with active TB.

In this model, the number of patients exponentially increases and decreases, resulting in two phases. Therefore, in these phases, the logarithm of infectious patients changes at a constant rate, the logarithmic growth rate K. However, in the case of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) epidemic, K never remains constant but increases and decreases linearly; therefore, the SIR model does not fit that seen in reality. We would like to clarify the cause of this phenomenon and predict the occurrence of COVID19 epidemics. Methods: We simulated a situation in which smaller epidemics were repeated with short time intervals. The results were compared with the epidemic data from 279 countries and regions. Results: In the simulations, the K values increased and decreased linearly, similar to the real data. Because the previous peak covered the initial increase in the epidemic, K did not increase as much as expected; rather, the difference in the basic reproduction number R0 appeared in the slope of increasing K. Additionally, the mean infectious time {tau} appeared in the negative peaks of K. By using the R0 and {tau} estimated from the changes in K, changes in the number of patients could be approximated using the SIR model. This supports the appropriateness of the model for evaluating COVID-19 epidemics. By using the model, the distributions of the parameters were identified. On average, an epidemic started every eleven days in a country. The worldwide mean R0 was 2.9; however, this value showed an exponential character and could thus increase explosively. In addition, the average {tau} was 12 days; this is not the native value but represents a shortened period because of the isolation of patients. As {tau} represents the half-life, the infectious time varies among patients; hence, prior testing should be performed before isolation is lifted. The changes in K represented the state of epidemics and were several weeks to a month ahead of the changes in the number of confirmed cases. In the actual data, when K was positive on consecutive days, the number of patients increased a few weeks later. In addition, if the negative peaks of K could not be reduced to as small as 0.1, the number of patients remained high. Thus, the number of K-positive days and mean infectious time had a clear correlation with the total number of patients. In such cases, mortality, which was lognormally distributed, with a mean of 1.7%, increased. To control the epidemic, it is important to observe K daily, not to allow K to remain positive continuously, and to terminate a peak with a series of K-negative days. To do this, it was necessary to shorten {tau} by finding and isolating a patient earlier. The effectiveness of the countermeasures is apparent in {tau}. The effect of vaccination, in terms of controlling the epidemic, was limited.","output":"COVID-19 epidemics monitored through the logarithmic growth rate and SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure-based drug discovery efforts require knowledge of where drug-binding sites are located on target proteins.

Cortisone (hydrocortisone) is a natural glucocorticoid, which is secreted with circadian rhythm by the cortical cells of adrenal glands. Physiologically, about 10-20 mg of hydrocortisone are secreted each day for maintaining homeostasis. Since the biological half-life of natural glucocorticoid is short, scientists developed various synthetic glucocorticoids including prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, and so on. These synthetic glucocorticoids are generated by modifying some structures based on the cortisone backbone, leading to extension of their biological half-life with stronger activities. In the face of severe infection, allergy, shock, trauma, pain, and other stresses, the demand for glucocorticoids increases dramatically. It is critical to supplement extra glucocorticoids to protect the biological functions of vital organs. However, the amount and duration of glucocorticoid administration need to be carefully adjusted, because a series of side effects may occur after long-term or high-dose usage of glucocorticoids.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 220 pregnant women underwent an HbA1c measurement as well as an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with multiple measurements of glucose, insulin and C-peptide for evaluation of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function at 16th gestational week (IQR: 14C18). Clinical follow-ups were performed until end of pregnancy. RESULTS: Increased maternal HbA1c 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) corresponding to pre-diabetes outside of pregnancy was associated with altered glucose dynamics during the OGTT. Pregnancies with early HbA1c 5.7% showed higher fasting (90.413.2 vs 79.77.2 mg/dL, p<0.001), mean (145.631.4 vs 116.221.4 mg/dL, p<0.001) as well as maximum glucose concentrations and tended to a delay in reaching the maximum glucose level compared with those with normal-range HbA1c (186.542.6 vs 147.830.1 mg/dL, p<0.001). Women with increased HbA1c showed impaired beta-cell function and differences in disposition index independent of body mass index status.

Infections occurred in 54% of patients in the 90 days before CTI (infection density, 1.23) and in 40% of patients in the first 28 days following CTI (infection density, 2.89). Infection density decreased to 0.55 in the 29C90 days post-CTI. Most infections were bacteremias (39%) or respiratory viral infections (43%). Pre-CTI risk factors associated with infection included prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), immunoglobulin G (IgG) level <400 mg/dL, and lymphodepletion other than cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine; post-CTI risk factors included higher-severity CRS and IgG <400 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: Infection rates in children and young adults receiving CD19 CAR T-cell therapy increase in the first month and then decline. Understanding types and timing of infections and contributing risk factors may help inform prophylactic and monitoring strategies. Specific attention should be given to patients with prior HCT, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, and severe CRS.","output":"Infectious Complications Following CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy for Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A panel of leading global experts working at the forefront of battery research and applications shares insights into how further development of this critical energy technology can effectively integrate sustainability principles.","output":"Charting a sustainable course for batteries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Music learning is increasing day-by-day as the individuals interest is also growing.

This is usually driven by the national stockpile availability. Many studies demonstrate three-panel flat-fold N95/P2 FFRs have higher quantitative fit test (QNFT) pass rates than other FFR styles. This prospective randomized crossover study utilized QNFT to evaluate the performance of the new three-panel flat-fold FFR, the Trident? P2 respirator compared to the previously most effective model, the 3M? Aura? 9320A + N95 respirator. METHODS We recruited 500 participants who completed online training and QNFT on both respirators. The order of the respirator being examined first was randomly allocated. The primary outcome was the QNFT pass rate. Secondary outcomes included the overall fit factor, the individual fit factor for each exercise, and the first-attempt QNFT pass rate. RESULTS We found that both the overall and first-attempt QNFT pass rates of the Trident P2 respirator were significantly higher than the 3M Aura (99.2% vs 92.6%, p < 0.001; and 92.6% vs 76.4%, p < 0.001 respectively). The overall fit factor and the individual fit factor were also significantly higher for the Trident FFR than the 3M Aura. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first to report hospital-based QNFT results of the Trident FFR, demonstrating very high first-time and overall pass rates. Our findings are consistent with previous research showing very high QNFT pass rates with three-panel flat-fold FFRs.

It has spread globally between January and March 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) first declared the outbreak as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. While this lockdown has proven to be an important and successful method of social distancing to counter the growing spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 virus, it has also created a degree of psychological impact on the public. Children may be strongly exposed to pandemic-generated biopsychosocial stressors, and once the containment measures of the population are needed to minimize the spread of viruses, they may be negatively impacted by the disturbance of everyday life as a result of social isolation. During school closures, children's routines may change, and healthy behaviors, such as physical activity, adequate diet, or good sleeping habits, may be less likely to happen. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from 20 March 2021 to 30 March 2021, targeted at children's parents and adolescents. Our concentration was on the impact of COVID-19 on the psychiatric wellbeing of children and adolescents. The data was collected through an online self-administered questionnaire which contains 56 close-ended questions for parents of children and 46 close-ended questions for adolescents. Statistical analysis was performed using R v 3.6.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Counts and percentages were used to summarize the distribution of categorical variables. Results The questionnaire was completed by 1141 respondents, 454 were < 18 years old. Thus, these respondents completed the questionnaire on behalf of themselves. The remaining 688 respondents were adults and completed the questionnaire on behalf of their children. Results showed that higher children's age was associated with less increase in worrying, restlessness, and a higher increase in sadness. Higher age was associated with a higher increase in the frequency of waking up, sleeping little, and uneasiness, and nervousness. Having relatives who were infected with COVID-19 was associated with higher increases in most of the negative behaviors such as anxiety, sadness, sleeping little, indecisiveness, and irritability. Punishment threats, screaming, and hitting were associated with a higher increase in negative behaviors during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. Results showed that neither the gender of the parent nor the child was associated with any of the domains of the child's behavior. Children whose parents were divorced had higher scores on anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disorders than children whose parents were not divorced Conclusion COVID-19 has caused increased stress on families, especially children and adolescents who are vulnerable populations. Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic can affect the mental health of children and adolescents in Saudi Arabia. We showed that parental stress is a predictor of psychiatric problems, which, if unaddressed, can cause child maltreatment and greater psychological distress.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Children's and Adolescent's Mental Health in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enrichment of glycoproteins by fluorescence molecular imprinting has shown an attractive application prospect, however, its specificity and sensitivity in actual sample analysis remain a significant challenge.

Overnight, social work intervention models provided in-person gave way to the utilization of Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate direct practice in virtual environments (e-therapy). Social work's slow acceptance of e-therapy prior to the pandemic resulted in a lack of training for many social work practitioners and MSW student interns, who were required to make rapid transitions to using and operating in online environments. It appears likely that e-therapy will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, so integrating education about effective e-therapy techniques into social work curricula seems like a logical next step. A social worker's ability to establish the therapeutic alliance, which is at the heart of all helping relationships, will be central to this curricula. Understanding social work students' perceptions of e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance can help shape the development of this new curriculum. Using internal student email, students at two Research I universities were invited to participate in a fully online anonymous survey dealing with attitudes towards e-therapy and the therapeutic alliance.

In the context of a pandemic, the interaction between vaccination policies adopted by multiple agents and the cooperation (or lack thereof) creates a complex environment that affects the global transmission dynamics of the disease.

We assume that vaccine efficiency rates are unknown to agents and we propose an optimization policy based on Thompson sampling to learn mean vaccine efficiency rates over time. Furthermore, we develop a budget-balanced resource sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among agents. We apply the proposed framework to the COVID-19 pandemic. We use a raster model of the world where agents represent the main countries worldwide and interact in a global mobility network to generate multiple problem instances. Our numerical results show that the proposed vaccine allocation policy achieves a larger reduction in the number of susceptible individuals, infections and deaths globally compared to a population-based policy. In addition, we show that, under a fixed global vaccine allocation budget, most countries can reduce their national number of infections and deaths by sharing their budget with countries with which they have a relatively high mobility exchange.

However, a wide inter-individual variability has been noted. The aim of this study was to identify patient-related factors affecting surgeon satisfaction with the surgical space and surgery duration in laparoscopic bariatric surgery under deep NMB. METHODS One hundred eighty-five patients scheduled for laparoscopic gastric bypass were enrolled. Anesthesia was standardized. A deep NMB was maintained together with fixed patient positioning (30 reverse Trendelenburg) and constant pneumoperitoneum pressure (14 mmHg) during the whole surgical procedure. Immediately after surgery, the surgeon was invited to state his satisfaction with the surgical space through a verbal numeric scale (VNS) ranging from 0 (extremely poor) to 10 (optimal). RESULTS VNS score was negatively correlated with male gender (r = - 0.35; p = 0.0001), BMI (r = - 0.16; p = 0.03), and age (r = - 0.20; p = 0.008). Surgery duration was positively correlated with male gender (r = 0.27; p = 0.0003) and BMI (r = 0.22; p = 0.006). Multivariate linear regressions showed that lower VNS scores were predicted by male gender (p = 0.000001) and increased age (p = 0.009), and that a longer surgery duration was predicted by male gender (p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS Findings showed that male gender and higher patient age were independent predictors of lower surgeon satisfaction with the workspace during laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Male gender also had a significant role in predicting longer surgery duration.

Zoonotic transmission events have increased in frequency in recent decades due to changes in human behavior, including increased international travel, the wildlife trade, deforestation, and the intensification of farming practices to meet demand for meat consumption. Influenza A viruses (IAV) possess a number of features which make them a pandemic threat and a major concern for human health. Their segmented genome and error-prone process of replication can lead to the emergence of novel reassortant viruses, for which the human population are immunologically na?ve. In addition, the ability for IAVs to infect aquatic birds and domestic animals, as well as humans, increases the likelihood for reassortment and the subsequent emergence of novel viruses. Sporadic spillover events in the past few decades have resulted in human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, with high mortality. The application of conventional vaccine platforms used for the prevention of seasonal influenza viruses, such as inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) or live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs), in the development of vaccines for HPAI viruses is fraught with challenges. These issues are associated with manufacturing under enhanced biosafety containment, and difficulties in propagating HPAI viruses in embryonated eggs, due to their propensity for lethality in eggs. Overcoming manufacturing hurdles through the use of safer backbones, such as low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAI), can also be a challenge if incompatible with master strain viruses. Non-replicating adenoviral (Ad) vectors offer a number of advantages for the development of vaccines against HPAI viruses. Their genome is stable and permits the insertion of HPAI virus antigens (Ag), which are expressed in vivo following vaccination. Therefore, their manufacture does not require enhanced biosafety facilities or procedures and is egg-independent. Importantly, Ad vaccines have an exemplary safety and immunogenicity profile in numerous human clinical trials, and can be thermostabilized for stockpiling and pandemic preparedness. This review will discuss the status of Ad-based vaccines designed to protect against avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential.","output":"Adenoviral Vectors as Vaccines for Emerging Avian Influenza Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are insufficient data regarding the safety of otologic procedures in the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

A factor that can seriously mislead the quantitative measurement of viral copies in sewage is the adsorption of virus fragments onto the highly porous solids suspended in wastewater, making them inaccessible. This depends not only on the available amount of suspended solids, but also on the amount of other dissolved chemicals which may influence the capacity of adsorption. On this account, the present work develops a mathematical framework, at various degrees of spatial complexity, of a physicochemical model that rationalizes the quantitative measurements of total virus fragments in sewage as regards the adsorption of virus onto suspended solids and the effect of dissolved chemicals on it. The city of Thessaloniki in Greece is employed as a convenient case study to determine the values of model variables. The present data indicate the ratio of the specific absorption (UV254/DOC) over the dissolved oxygen (DO) as the parameter with the highest correlation with viral copies. This implies a strong effect on viral inaccessibility in sewage caused (i) by the presence of humic-like substances and (ii) by virus decay due to oxidation and metabolic activity of bacteria. The present results suggest days where many fold corrections in the measurement of viral copies should be applied. As a result, although the detected RNA load in June 2020 is similar to that in April 2020, virus shedding in the city is about 5 times lower in June than in April, in line with the very low SARS-CoV-2 incidence and hospital admissions for COVID-19 in Thessaloniki in June.","output":"A physicochemical model for rationalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentration in sewage.

The limitations to high-level expression of active viral surface glycoproteins in yeast are not well understood. To identify possible bottlenecks we performed a detailed study on overexpression of recombinant mumps hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (MuHN) and measles hemagglutinin (MeH) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, combining the analysis of recombinant proteins with a proteomic approach. RESULTS: Overexpressed recombinant MuHN and MeH proteins were present in large aggregates, were inactive and totally insoluble under native conditions. Moreover, the majority of recombinant protein was found in immature form of non-glycosylated precursors. Fractionation of yeast lysates revealed that the core of viral surface protein aggregates consists of MuHN or MeH disulfide-linked multimers involving eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and is closely associated with small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be removed only under denaturing conditions. Complexes of large Hsps seem to be bound to aggregate core peripherally as they can be easily removed at high salt concentrations. Proteomic analysis revealed that the accumulation of unglycosylated viral protein precursors results in specific cytosolic unfolded protein response (UPR-Cyto) in yeast cells, characterized by different action and regulation of small Hsps versus large chaperones of Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp110 families. In contrast to most environmental stresses, in the response to synthesis of recombinant MuHN and MeH, only the large Hsps were upregulated whereas sHsps were not. Interestingly, the amount of eEF1A was also increased during this stress response. CONCLUSIONS: Inefficient translocation of MuHN and MeH precursors through ER membrane is a bottleneck for high-level expression in yeast.

Toxic shock syndrome(TSS) is a rare, life-threatening complication. The incidence rate of TSS is very low in the plastic surgery field, especially after liposuction and fat transfer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old female patient was transferred to our emergency department from an aesthetic clinic with sepsis shock features after received liposuction and fat transfer. The patient underwent TSS, disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG), and necrotizing soft tissue infection of the buttocks in the next 10 days. Authors used a series of debridement and reconstructive surgery including vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) treatment, artificial dermis grafts,split-thickness skin grafts, amputation surgeries when her vital signs were stable. The patient experienced desquamation of the hand on the 26th day. The skin grafts survived and the function of both fingers and toes recovered. She was discharged 2 months after admission and was in good health. CONCLUSION: TSS is extremely rare in the field of liposuction and autologous fat transfer. The mortality rate of TSS is very high. Early diagnosis and operative treatment, as well as correction of systemic abnormalities, are the important keys to save a patient's life.

The limited supply of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits and reagents has made meeting the rising demand for increased testing incompetent, worldwide. A highly sensitive and specific antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the need of the hour. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR). Methods: : A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests. Results: : Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness &#8804;5 days. Interpretation & conclusions: : With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness &#8804;5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based evaluation of COVID-19: A cross-sectional, diagnostic test accuracy study & its implications for COVID-19 management in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The corona pandemic has caused a serious emergency also in the Federal Republic of Germany; shortages of medical capacities and failure of critical infrastructures may occur resulting in a pandemic catastrophe.

However, the research on the safety of antipsychotic drugs in the real-world is rare. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the safety of antipsychotic drugs based on real-world data. Methods: ADR reports collected by the Henan Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center from 2016 to 2020 were analyzed. We described the safety of antipsychotic drugs by descriptive analysis and four signal mining methods. Meanwhile, the risk factors for serious adverse reactions of antipsychotics were identified. Results: A total of 3363 ADR reports related to antipsychotics were included. We found that the number of adverse drug reaction reports and the proportion of serious adverse reactions have increased year by year from 2016 to 2020. Most adverse drug reactions occurred within 3 months after taking the medicine. The symptoms caused by typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics were different and dyskinesia was more common in typical antipsychotics. Most patients improved or recovered after treatment or intervention while only one patient had sequelae. Low-level hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, youth, and old age could increase the risk of serious adverse reactions. Four off-label signals were found through signal mining, including amisulpride-pollakiuria, ziprasidone-dyspnoea, quetiapine-urinary incontinence, olanzapine-hepatic function abnormal. Conclusion: We found that most ADRs occurred within 3 months after taking the medicine, so close observation was required for patients during the first 3 months of treatment. The ADRs of antipsychotics involved multiple organ-system damages but were not serious. It might be recommended to take alternative drugs after a serious ADR occurred. The symptoms caused by typical APDs and atypical APDs were different. For patients with typical APDs, dyskinesia was more common and should be given special attention. Statistics showed that low-level hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, youth, and old age were risk factors for serious ADRs.

This is relevant when, for example, the number of arriving infected individuals is large, but also to the modeling of a large number of infected individuals, but also to more general situations such as the spread of ideas in the presence of publicity campaigns. This model is frequently studied by mapping to a bond percolation problem, in which edges in the network are occupied with the probability, $p$, of eventual infection along an edge connecting an infected individual to a susceptible neighbor. This approach allows one to calculate the total final size of the infection and epidemic threshold in the limit of a vanishingly small seed fraction. We show, however, that when the initial infection occupies a nonvanishing fraction $f$ of the network, this method yields ambiguous results, as the correspondence between edge occupation and contagion transmission no longer holds. We propose instead to measure the giant component of recovered individuals within the original contact network. This has an unambiguous interpretation and correctly captures the dependence of the epidemic size on $f$. We give exact equations for the size of the epidemic and the epidemic threshold in the infinite size limit. We observe a second order phase transition as in the original formulation, however with an epidemic threshold which decreases with increasing $f$. When the seed fraction $f$ tends to zero we recover the standard results.","output":"Effect of initial infection size on network SIR model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused tremendous losses to the world.

Our goal is to assess the value of radiomics features extracted from adrenal gland and periadrenal fat CT images in predicting disease prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: : A total of 1,325 patients (765 moderate and 560 severe patients) from three centers were enrolled in the retrospective study. We proposed a 3D cascade V-Net to automatically segment adrenal glands in onset CT images. Periadrenal fat areas were obtained using inflation operations. Then, the radiomics features were automatically extracted. Five models were established to predict the disease prognosis in patients with COVID-19: a clinical model (CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model [AM], periadrenal fat model [PM], fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model [FM]), and a radiomics nomogram model (RN).Data from one center (1,183 patients) were utilized as training and validation sets. The remaining two (36 and 106 patients) were used as 2 independent test sets to evaluate the models performance. Results: : The auto-segmentation framework achieved an average dice of 0.79 in the test set. CM, AM, PM, FM, and RN obtained AUCs of 0.716, 0.755, 0.796, 0.828, and 0.825, respectively in the training set, and the mean AUCs of 0.754, 0.709, 0.672, 0.706 and 0.778 for 2 independent test sets. Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3, 0.5, and 0.1 in the validation set, the independent-test set 1 and the independent-test set 2 could gain more net benefits using RN than FM and CM, respectively.

We assessed the impact of a multimodal information session on epidural analgesia delegated to anesthetic nurses on new-mothers satisfaction. METHODS: We performed a prospective sequential study including parturient women who gave birth with epidural analgesia. During the first period, information on epidural analgesia was delivered by anesthetists during the scheduled anesthesia consultation, according to French standard-of-care. Then, a dedicated information session about epidural analgesia provided by anesthetic nurses was implemented. The primary endpoint was the satisfaction of women with the quality of information received. Main secondary endpoints were knowledge of women about epidural analgesia, anxiety before epidural catheter placement, and satisfaction with delivery. RESULTS: 259 and 298 women were included during the first and second periods respectively, among whom 178 and 188 were analyzed. Information on epidural analgesia delivered by anesthetic nurses was associated with improvement of new-mothers satisfaction with information received (9 (8C10) vs. 10 (9C10) C p < 0.001). Moreover, information delivered by anesthetic nurses was associated with decreased anxiety before epidural catheter placement (4 (1C8) vs. 3 (1C6) C p = 0.006) and increased satisfaction with delivery (8 (7C10) vs. 9 (8C10) C p = 0.01).

ObjectivesTo determine adverse events (AEs) and immunogenicity of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1 in health care workers (HCWs). DesignThis prospective study was conducted from February to July 2021. SettingA single center, university-based tertiary care center in Bangkok. ParticipantsHealthy HCWs. ExposureTwo doses of CoronaVac (4 weeks apart) or ChAdOx1 (8 weeks apart) intramuscularly. Main Outcomes and MeasuresSelf-reported AEs were collected for 7 days following each vaccination using electronic diary. The immunogenicity was determined by the level of IgG antibodies against receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1 subunit). The 50% plaque reduction neutralization tests against original Wuhan strain and circulating VOCs were performed in subset of samples at 2 weeks after the second dose. ResultsOf the 360 HCWs, 180 received each vaccine. The median (interquartile range: IQR) age was 35 (29-44) years old and 84.2% were female. Participants who received ChAdOx1 reported higher frequency of AEs than those received CoronaVac after both the first dose (84.4% vs. 66.1%, P < 0.001) and second dose (75.6% vs. 60.6%, P = 0.002), with more AEs in those younger than 30 years of age for both vaccines. The seroconversion rate was 75.6% and 100% following the first dose of CoronaVac and ChAdOx1, respectively. All participants seroconverted at 2 weeks after the second dose. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels induced by CoronaVac was lower than ChAdOX1 with geometric means of 164.4 and 278.5 BAU/mL, respectively (P = 0.0066). Both vaccines induced similar levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Wuhan strain, geometric mean titer (GMT) of 337.4 vs 331.2; however, CoronaVac induced significantly lower GMT against Alpha (23.1 vs. 92.5), Delta (21.2 vs. 69.7), and Beta (10.2 vs. 43.6) variants, respectively. Conclusions and RelevanceCoronaVac induces lower measurable antibodies but with lower frequency of AEs than ChAdOx1.

Airway point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has demonstrated utility in children, but the examinations vary by age and may require non-traditional techniques or utilize less common probes. This study evaluated the performance of measuring the tracheal location of the cuffed TT using a novel, linear probe-based POCUS examination over a wide age range of children. After adjusting for the subjects' height and TT size, ultrasound measurements of the TT cuff location were compared with fluoroscopy measurements of the TT tip location. METHODS Perioperative pediatric patients (<10 years) requiring a cuffed TT were enrolled. After routine TT placement, ultrasound and fluoroscopy images were obtained. Measurements from the TT cuff to the cricoid cartilage were obtained from the POCUS examination. Chest fluoroscopy was reviewed to measure the TT's distance from the carina. Both measurements were then compared after scaling for patient height. The duration of the ultrasound examination and image quality scores were also recorded. RESULTS Forty-one patients were enrolled, with a median age of 3 (25th/75th percentile: 1.50/7.00) years. The POCUS examination identified the TT cuff in all cases with the highest image quality score. The median POCUS exam time was 112 (25th/75th percentile: 80.00/156.00) seconds. There was a strong correlation between the POCUS measurements and the fluoroscopy measurements, r = -0.7575, 95% CI [-0.8638, -0.5866 ], p < 0.001).

Among the conditions and variables that most influence the propensity to use a shared transport mode, the distance between the users places of origin or destination and the parking areas covered plays an important role, especially in the case of station-based type. The common system that has become more and more widespread in Italy is car sharing, with its various forms (i.e. station-based, free-floating, electric vehicles) that allow the use of reserved parking spaces or shared with other circulating vehicles. In urban areas, people generally tend to walk the first and last mile or use micro-mobility, while for longer distances they tend to use private or shared motor vehicles. Starting from this premise, this thesis provides a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of car sharing by measuring the probability of using it based on parking distance. The proposed model is based on the estimation of O/D matrices with associated distance levels and the calculation of a probability index derived from several distance combinations. This research lays the foundation for a deeper analysis, which includes model calibration for different common mobility solutions and the evaluation of user probability in relation to implemented common mobility systems in several case studies.","output":"The Growing Urban Accessibility: A Model to Measure the Car Sharing Effectiveness Based on Parking Distances"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dietary habits have a major impact on the development and function of the immune system This impact is mediated both by the intrinsic nutritional and biochemical qualities of the diet, and by its influence on the intestinal microbiota Fish as a food is rich in compounds with immunoregulatory properties, among them omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, tryptophan, taurine and polyamines In addition, regular fish consumption favors the proliferation of beneficial members of the intestinal microbiota, like short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria By substituting arachidonic acid in the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish change the type of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes being produced, resulting in anti-inflammatory properties Further, they also are substrates for the production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (resolvins, protectins, and maresins), lipid compounds that constitute the physiological feedback signal to stop inflammation and give way to tissue reparation Evidence from human observational and interventional studies shows that regular fish consumption is associated with reduced incidence of chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, and that continuous infusion of fish oil to tube-fed, critically ill patients may improve important outcomes in the ICU There is also evidence from animal models showing that larger systemic concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids may counter the pathophysiological cascade that leads to psoriasis The knowledge gained over the last few decades merits future exploration of the potential role of fish and its components in other conditions characterized by deregulated activation of immune cells and a cytokine storm like viral sepsis or COVID-19","output":"Dietary Fish, Fish Nutrients, and Immune Function: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine hesitancy amongst healthcare personnel (HCP) is a critical issue.

The question arises if the host genetic variation may (partly) affect the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. We postulated that the geographical variation of human polymorphisms might partly explain the variable prevalence of the infection. We investigated some candidate genes that have the potential to play a role in the immune defense against COVID-19: complement component 3 (C3), galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2), haptoglobin (Hp), vitamin D binding protein (DBP), human homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1). In a univariate approach, ACE1 D/I, C3, CFTR, and HFE polymorphisms correlated significantly with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality, whereas Hp and FUT2 polymorphism did not show any significant correlations. In a multivariate analysis, only ACE1 D/I and C3 polymorphisms were determinants for COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. The other polymorphisms (CFTR, DBP, FUT2, HFE, and Hp) did not correlate with COVID-19 prevalence/mortality. Whereas ACE1 D/I polymorphism shows functional links with ACE2 (which is the receptor for the virus) in COVID-19, C3 can act as a critical step in the virus-induced inflammation. Our findings plead against a bystander role of the polymorphisms as a marker for historical migrations, which comigrate with causal genes involved in COVID-19 infection. Further studies are required to assess the clinical outcome of COVID-19 in C3S and ACE1 D allele carriers and to study the role of C3 and ACE1 D/I polymorphisms in COVID-19 and their potential effects on treatment response.","output":"Genetic Polymorphisms in the Host and COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Measures to decrease contact between persons during an influenza pandemic have been included in pandemic response plans.

People with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, are at a greater risk of severe diseases and death upon contracting this new disease. Due to the novelty of COVID-19, no specific information is available about the degree of its mortality and risk factors among diabetic patients. Therefore, this study aims to compare diabetic and nondiabetic COVID-19 patients regarding mortality rate, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive and noninvasive ventilation, and the associated risk factors. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed on the medical records of 650 adult COVID-19 patients (325 diabetics and 325 nondiabetics) admitted to Razi Hospital in Ahvaz from March 2020 to September 2020. Results: The mean age of the patients was 61.3 years in the diabetic group and 52.3 years in the nondiabetic group. Men comprised 48.3% of the diabetic group and 59.7% of the nondiabetic group. Diabetic patients suffered from significantly more underlying diseases, such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and acute renal failure (ARF) compared to the nondiabetic group (p < 0.0001). Also, when compared with the nondiabetic group, the diabetic group had a significantly higher mortality rate (17.5% vs. 12%; p = 0.047, respectively), more ICU admissions (35.4% vs. 27.7%; p = 0.035, respectively), and a greater need for invasive ventilation (17.5% vs. 11.4%; p = 0.026, respectively). Conclusion: In diabetic patients, the mortality rate, need for ICU admission, and need for invasive ventilation were significantly higher than nondiabetic patients. Our logistic regression analysis in diabetic patients with COVID-19 showed that age, CKD, and ARF were the risk factors affecting mortality. In contrast, age and CKD were the risk factors affecting the rate of ICU admission, and CKD and ARF were the risk factors affecting the need for invasive ventilation.","output":"Assessment of Mortality Rate, Need for ICU Admission and Ventilation in COVID-19 Patients with Diabetes Mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the recently established genome organisation of pestiviruses, their classification as members of the togavirus family is no longer tenable.

Microbial synthesis pathways of melatonin are similar to those of animals but different from those of plants. At present, the method of using microorganism fermentation to produce melatonin is gradually prevailing, and exploring the biosynthetic pathway of melatonin to modify microorganism is becoming the mainstream, which has more advantages than traditional chemical synthesis. Here, we review recent advances in the synthesis, optimization of melatonin pathway. l-tryptophan is one of the two crucial precursors for the synthesis of melatonin, which can be produced through a four-step reaction. Enzymes involved in melatonin synthesis have low specificity and catalytic efficiency. Site-directed mutation, directed evolution or promotion of cofactor synthesis can enhance enzyme activity and increase the metabolic flow to promote microbial melatonin production. On the whole, the status and bottleneck of melatonin biosynthesis can be improved to a higher level, providing an effective reference for future microbial modification.","output":"Melatonin biosynthesis pathways in nature and its production in engineered microorganisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae  um importante patgeno em suinocultura e apesar do uso freqente de vacinas contra o mesmo na maior parte das propriedades produtoras do pas, a ocorrncia de quadros clnicos da infeco tem sido amplamente observada e diagnosticada.

However, public opinion reports an associated subjective shortness of breath. We evaluated cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and during maximal exertion to highlight any differences with the use of protection masks. METHODS Twelve healthy subjects underwent three cardiopulmonary exercise tests: without wearing protection mask, with surgical and with FFP2 mask. Dyspnea was assessed by Borg Scale. Standard pulmonary function tests were also performed. RESULTS All the subjects (40.812.4 years; 6 males) completed the protocol with no adverse event. At spirometry, from no mask to surgical to FFP2, a progressive reduction of FEV1 and FVC was observed (3.940.91 l, 3.230.81 l, 2.940.98 l and 4.701.21 l, 3.771.02 l, 3.521.21 l, respectively, p<0.001). Rest ventilation, O2 uptake (V?O2) and CO2 production (VCO2) were progressively lower with a reduction of respiratory rate. At peak exercise, subjects revealed a progressively higher Borg scale when wearing surgical and FFP2. Accordingly, at peak exercise, V?O2 (31.023.4, 27.56.9, 28.28.8 ml/kg/min, p=0.001), ventilation (9226, 7622, 7221 l, p=0.003), respiratory rate (428, 385, 374, p=0.04) and tidal volume (2.280.72, 2.050.60, 1.960.65 l, p=0.001) were gradually lower. We did not observed a significant difference in oxygen saturation. CONCLUSIONS Protection masks are associated with significant but modest worsening of spirometry and cardiorespiratory parameters at rest and peak exercise. The effect is driven by a ventilation reduction due to an increased airflow resistance. However, since exercise ventilatory limitation is far from being reached, their use is safe even during maximal exercise, with a slight reduction in performance.","output":"\\"You can leave your mask on\\": effects on cardiopulmonary parameters of different airway protection masks at rest and during maximal exercise."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the spread of SARS-CoV2 continues to increase globally, newer information gets reported every day.

Parklets can support post COVID-19 (Phase 3) pandemics by improving the quality of public space and social distancing close to shops and activities, benefiting from this micro-urban regeneration. Moreover, they can be considered as an extension of the pavement and their implementation can encourage the reduction of private traffic by promoting soft mobility (i.e. walking and cycling).

As a result, large numbers of unemployed workers returned to their hometowns during April 2020, increasing the risk of spreading the virus across the entire country. APPROACH: In anticipation of the large-scale movement of unemployed workers, the Thai government trained existing village health volunteers to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and educate members of their communities. Provincial health offices assembled COVID-19 surveillance teams of these volunteers to identify returnees from high-risk areas, encourage self-quarantine for 14 days, and monitor and report the development of any relevant symptoms.

(2) Methods: This study is a retrospective case series of patients with CSU diagnosed and treated in the Allergy Department of the Professor Doctor Octavian Fodor RIGH, (Cluj-Napoca, Romania). Patients were assessed for disease activity and level of control with the weekly urticaria activity score and the visual analogue scale. Results were correlated with COVID-19 severity and with nonspecific markers of inflammation during and after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. (3) Results: SARS-CoV-2 impacted a significant proportion (33%) of the CSU patients, of which 71% developed a moderate-severe form of COVID-19. Most of the patients (68%) had moderate-severe forms of CSU and 65% took AH1 treatment (one dose, two-fold dose or four-fold dose). The rest of them (35%) received the second-line treatment (40.3% Omalizumab, 53% Prednisolone and 4.8% Cyclosporine). In Omalizumab treated group of UCS patients we observed that COVID-19 disease was not severe. We established a positive correlation between the severity of the infection and that of the CSU clinical presentation, with most bothersome symptoms of urticaria being experienced by moderate to severe COVID-19 CSU patients (47%). Inflammatory markers were positively correlated (p = 0.01) with a more severe clinical profile of CSU, in accordance with our hypothesis that the level of inflammation triggered by COVID-19 disease has a role in CSU exacerbation. The non-specific inflammatory markers, such as CRP, were positively associated with the UAS7 score (R2 = 0.363; p = 0.001).

However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5-10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21-32% additional cases, whose 19-28% more positives and 4-14% more deaths.

We conducted a prospective study to figure out the viral epidemiology of bronchiolitis in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2009 to March 2011, a total of 113 children with bronchiolitis, aged <2 years, hospitalized in Chang Gung Childrens Hospital were randomly selected for viral etiology investigation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from each case and sent for viral detection by tissue culture, antigen test, and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 120 viruses were detected from 113 children. Positive viral etiology was identified in 86 (76%) children. Mixed viral pathogens were found in 28 cases (25%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was identified in 43.4% of the cases. Human bocavirus (hBoV) was the second most common identified virus (in 19.5%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found among the children with bronchiolitis either caused by different single or mixed viral infection. CONCLUSION: RSV was the most common etiologic agent for children with bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Newly identified viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, were also among the common causative agents.

Therefore, it is more important than ever for manufacturers to quickly identify and respond to changing customer purchasing patterns and requirements. However, few studies have been done on dynamic changes in customer preferences for product features following COVID-19 spread. This study aims to investigate the dynamic change of customer sentiment on product features following COVID-19 through sentiment analysis based on online reviews. The proposed methodology consists of two main processes: feature extraction and sentiment analysis. After finding a specific feature of the product through feature extraction, the words used to mention the feature in the review were analyzed for sentiment analysis of customers.

RESULTS: Strategies for Covid-19 control among migrant labourers were planned and implemented with intersectoral coordination and community participation. Line listing and risk stratification, mobilisation of community volunteers, contactless active symptomatic surveillance using technology, IEC activities for awareness generation in multiple languages, sample collection, testing and distribution of personal protective equipment's were initially implemented. Setting up of a call centre facility assisted with M health technology exclusively for addressing concerns of migrants was first and one of its kind in the country. In addition to that special measures were taken to improve adherence and wellbeing of migrants which included addressing medical needs of migrants including psychological needs, ensuring food security, migrant hostels for the providing shelter, basic health care, isolation facilities and arranging transportation facilities for more than 10,000 stranded migrants. The success of these strategies was evident from the fact that not even a single migrant labourer was tested positive in the district during this period CONCLUSION: Pathanamthitta district being in a resource constraint setting showed a very effective model by implementing technology assisted strategies tailored to the needs of population.The success of these highly effective and replicable strategy underlines the need to incorporate principles of primary health care in crisis management.","output":"Strategies for COVID-19 control among migrant labourers in a developing country setting: Pathanamthitta model from Kerala"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper analyses how Chinas investments in Germany have developed over time and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in this regard, based on four different datasets, including our own survey in mid-2020.

The Royal Colleges of Surgeons recommend best practice depending on local circumstances. The aim of this project is to assess the 30-day outcome of patients managed operatively and conservatively for acute appendicitis during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK. METHOD: Patient data were collected prospectively at the end of March 2020, when Covid-19 became prevalent in the UK and lockdown started. Data was collected for patients admitted to the acute surgical unit for the admission dates of 20/03/2020 to 15/05/2020. At 30 days after admission, a search was done on the electronic clinical portal to check if the patient was readmitted for operation. The inclusion criteria are any patients above 16-year-old admitted through acute surgical unit with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis or computed tomography scan findings of proven acute appendicitis.

Female BALB/cJ mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (group infected, n = 20) or infected and then immediately treated with a single dose of 500 g/kg ivermectin (group infected + IVM, n = 20) or were not infected and treated with PBS (control group, n = 16). Five days after infection/treatment, the mice were euthanized and the tissues were sampled to assess their general health status and infection levels. Overall, the results demonstrated that viral infection induced typical MHV-caused disease, with the livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while mice treated with ivermectin showed a better health status with a lower viral load (23,192 AU; p < 0.05), with only a few having histopathological liver damage (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the group infected + IVM and control group mice (P = NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in the treated mice than in the infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin diminished the MHV viral load and disease in the mice, being a useful model for further understanding this therapy against coronavirus diseases.","output":"Ivermectin reduces in vivo coronavirus infection in a mouse experimental model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 US Elections have been, more than ever before, characterized by social media campaigns and mutual accusations.

We formulate an annotation task, in which we join the tasks of hateful/offensive speech detection and stance detection, and annotate 3000 Tweets from the campaign period, if they express a particular stance towards a candidate. Next to the established classes of favorable and against, we add mixed and neutral stances and also annotate if a candidate is mentioned without an opinion expression. Further, we annotate if the tweet is written in an offensive style. This enables us to analyze if supporters of Joe Biden and the Democratic Party communicate differently than supporters of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. A BERT baseline classifier shows that the detection if somebody is a supporter of a candidate can be performed with high quality (.89 F1 for Trump and .91 F1 for Biden), while the detection that somebody expresses to be against a candidate is more challenging (.79 F1 and .64 F1, respectively).

METHODS: This was a comparative analysis on two groups of patients with various symptoms who underwent surgical colorectal cancer treatment. Group 1 comprised patients operated between March 11, 2019, and December 31, 2019; while group 2 comprised patients at the same time of the year during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 included 56 and 48 patients, respectively. The rate of presentation to the emergency service was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.02). The stage of the pathological lymph nodes and the rate of liver metastasis was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.004 and P < 0.041, respectively). The disease stage was found to be more advanced in Group 2 (P < 0.005). The rate of postoperative complications was higher in Group 2 (P < 0.014). CONCLUSION: The presentation of patients with suspicious findings to the hospital was delayed, due both to the fear of catching COVID-19 and to the pandemic precautions that were proposed and implemented by healthcare authorities worldwide.

Aim: To report the experience with implementing fever clinic utilising the HCQ-based protocol for adults with mild and moderate symptoms of COVID-19, and provide further evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of HCQ. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in one of the primary healthcare centres in Saudi Arabia. All patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who visited the fever clinic and met the eligibility criteria of starting HCQ based protocol were included in the study. Beside supportive treatment, the intervention dose of HCQ was 400 mg twice a day for one day followed by 200 mg twice a day for another four days. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 was used for data analyses. Results: A total of 108 patients with mean age of 36 years with Standard Deviation (SD) of 9.3 were included in the study. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 27.1 (SD 4.9). In addition, 73.1% of the patients were males and 25% were smokers. The study findings showed that the fever clinic was effective in managing the symptoms of COVID-19 and treating the patients regardless of the use of or completion of HCQ. In particular, on day 6, cough improved in >85% of the patients and fever was resolved in >83% of patients.

In the midst of significant ongoing changes to the structure and financing of our underlying organizations, high trust among departmental, hospital, health system, and medical school leadership during the pandemic has promoted these positive changes, allowing us to emerge much stronger from this crisis.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic Spurs Evolution of an Academic Pathology Department and Laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Tuberculosis (TB) has become an occupational health hazard in South African hospitals where healthcare workers (HCWs) are additionally confronted daily with HIV and its associated stigma, causing a syndemic. Early TB diagnosis and treatment are vital, but the uptake of these services through occupational healthcare units (OHUs) is low. The current study hypothesises that (1) the link between HIV and TB and (2) the perceived HIV stigmatisation by colleagues create (3) a double HIV-TB stigma which increases (4) internalised TB stigma and leads to (5) a lower willingness to use OHU services for TB screening and treatment. DESIGN A cross-sectional study using the baseline data from the HIV and TB Stigma among Healthcare workers Study (HaTSaH Study). SETTING Six hospitals in the Free State province of South Africa. PARTICIPANTS 820 HCWs of the six selected hospitals. RESULTS The study results demonstrate that the co-epidemic (=0.399 (screening model) and =0.345 (treatment model)) combined (interaction effect: =0.133 (screening) and =0.132 (treatment)) with the persistent stigmatisation of HIV is altering the attitudes towards TB (=0.345 (screening) and =0.400 (treatment)), where the stigmatising views of HIV are transferred to TB-illustrating the syndemic impact. Our model demonstrated that this syndemic not only leads to higher levels of internal TB stigma (=0.421 (screening) and =0.426 (treatment)), but also to a lower willingness to use the OHU for TB screening (probit coefficient=-0.216) and treatment (probit coefficient=-0.160). Confidentiality consistently emerged as a contextual correlate of OHU use. CONCLUSIONS Theoretically, our results confirm HIV as a 'syndemic generator' which changes the social meaning of TB in the hospital context. Practically, the study demonstrated that the syndemic of TB and HIV in a highly endemic context with stigma impacts the intended use of occupational TB services.

However, the manner and extent of telemental health implementation have varied considerably across settings and areas, and substantial barriers are encountered. There is, therefore, now a need to identify what works best for service users and staff and establish the key mechanisms for efficient integration into routine care. Objective: We aimed to identify investigations of pre-planned strategies intended to achieve or improve effective and sustained implementation of telemental health approaches, and to evaluate how different strategies influence implementation outcomes. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, with five databases searched for relevant literature using any methodological approach, published between January 2010 and July 2021. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they took place in secondary or tertiary mental health services and focused on pre-planned strategies for achieving or improving delivery of mental health care through remote communication between mental health professionals or between mental health professionals and service users, family members, unpaid carers, or peer supporters. All included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Data were synthesised using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) compilation of implementation strategies and the taxonomy of implementation outcomes. Results: A total of 14 studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. A variety of implementation strategies were identified, the most commonly reported being train and educate stakeholders. All studies reported using a combination of several implementation strategies. Conclusions: Using a combination of implementation strategies appears to be a helpful method of supporting the implementation of telemental health.

It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity, and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organizations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%). Forty-three percent, 31%, and 25% reported negative impacts upon personal relationships, employment, and income, respectively. HIV care continued with 95% and 98% being able to access their HIV provider and antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively. Telehealth was used by 92% and was largely well received. PLHIV reported worry about physical health (68%), mental health (66%), finances (50%),z and accommodation (25%). Fifty percent of participants reported weight gain and 27% increased alcohol intake.

In addition, next generation sequencing has resulted in the rapid production of full-length genomes. Presently, sequence data are released to diagnostic clients for the purposes of informing control measures, but are not publicly available as data may be associated with sensitive information. However, public sequence data can be used to objectively design field-relevant vaccines; determine when and how pathogens are spreading across the landscape; identify virus transmission hotspots; and are a critical component in genomic surveillance for pandemic preparedness. We have developed a centralized sequence database that integrates a selected set of previously private clinical data, using PRRSV data as an exemplar, alongside publicly available genomic information. We implemented the Tripal toolkit, using the open source Drupal content management system and the Chado database schema. Tripal consists of a collection of Drupal modules that are used to manage, visualize, and disseminate biological data stored within Chado. Hosting is provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 cloud instance with resource scaling. New sequences sourced from diagnostic labs contain at a minimum four data items: genomic information; date of collection; collection location (state or province level); and a unique identifier. Users can download annotated genomic sequences from the database using a customized search interface that incorporates data mined from published literature; search for similar sequences using BLAST-based tools; and explore annotated reference genomes. Additionally, because the bulk of data presently are PRRSV sequences, custom curation and annotation pipelines have determined PRRSV genotype (Type 1 or 2), the location of open reading frames and nonstructural proteins, generated amino acid sequences, the occurrence of putative frame shifts, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) classification of GP5 genes. Genomic data from seven major swine pathogens have been curated and annotated. The resource provides researchers timely access to sequences discovered by veterinary diagnosticians, allowing for epidemiological and comparative virology studies. The result will be a better understanding on the emergence of novel swine viruses in the United States (US), and how these novel strains are disseminated in the US and abroad.

OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to determine if the referred fever of elderly patients admitted for COVID-19 was related to their mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2020 hospital admissions records of the Hospital de San Juan de Alicante, Spain. RESULTS: Those patients without fever had a greater age and comorbidity. There was not a significant difference related to fever in in-hospital mortality. DISCUSSION: Previous studies seem to indicate that fever in its early stages has a protective effect rather than a harmful one. Our results confirm this trend. No data have been found in the literature that express the differences of elderly patients admitted for COVID-19 who presented fever versus those who did not in the context of hospital admission. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were detected in terms of mortality with respect to the fever variable. However, patients without fever present significantly different laboratory values that could indicate a greater severity in their evolutionary course. For example, patients without fever have significantly higher D-dimer and LDH levels in addition to significantly lower arterial oxygen pressure and PaO2/FiO2 and SpO2/FiO2 ratios.","output":"Elderly Hospitalized for COVID-19 and Fever: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemorrhagic disease (HD) caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is the most important viral disease of farmed and wild white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) and can cause substantial mortality in susceptible hosts. Captive cervid farming is an emerging industry in Florida, an HD-enzootic region. Morbidity and mortality due to HD are major concerns among deer farmers, but the impact of HD on Floridas cervid farming industry is unknown. Our primary objective was to determine the prevalence of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) among WTD submitted to the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Cervidae Health Research Initiative (CHeRI) for post-mortem diagnostics. Our secondary objectives were to identify the predominant circulating EHDV serotypes during each sampling year and to determine the age class with the greatest proportion of EHDV- and BTV-positive post-mortem specimens. From 2016 to 2020, spleen samples from 539 farmed WTD with unexplained mortality were tested for the presence of EHDV and BTV by RT-qPCR. Overall, the prevalence of EHDV, BTV, or EHDV/BTV coinfection was 26%, 16%, and 10%, respectively, and 44% of deer (237/539) were diagnosed with HD by RT-qPCR. The predominant circulating EHDV serotype varied by year. Overall, EHDV-2 was the most commonly identified serotype (55% of PCR-positive cases), and EHDV-1 was the least frequently identified serotype (16% of PCR-positive cases). The greatest proportion of EHDV/BTV positives among mortality cases was observed in young WTD aged 3C6 months (50%C82% positive). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of EHDV/BTV by age when comparing specimens from WTD over 1 year old (p = 0.029, n = 527). Among these samples, the number of reported mortalities and the prevalence of EHDV/BTV were highest in yearling animals (56%). These data provide the first estimate of EHDV and BTV prevalence and virus serotypes among farmed WTD in Florida, identify the WTD age groups with the greatest proportions of EHDV- and BTV-positive specimens, and suggest that HD caused by these two viruses may be a major source of mortality challenging the captive cervid farming industry in Florida.","output":"A Mortality-Based Description of EHDV and BTV Prevalence in Farmed White-Tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Florida, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 Coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, has created a calamitous situation throughout the world.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1765 Bangladeshi adults through the social media networks of the authors. RESULTS: The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD 1.8, range 0C17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. Approximately 67.2% scored well (above the mean 4.5, range 1C5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wore masks outside the home, and 98.7% washed their hands with soap when they came back.

Objective: To understand the predictors of abuse and discrimination of sexual minority men in healthcare settings by Healthcare workers in seven cities in Tanzania. Method: In total, 300 sexual minority men over the age of 18 were interviewed in 7 Tanzanian cities by trained local interviewers. Abuse from others (physical, verbal, sexual, discrimination/humiliation), and abuse from Healthcare workers, was ascertained. Gender role mannerisms were self-rated by the respondent, and at the end of the interview, by the interviewer, on a Likert scale from very feminine to very masculine. Respondents also indicated whether they had revealed their homosexual behavior or had it exposed in the health consultation. Results: Median age was 27. Verbal abuse and community discrimination were the most commonly reported forms of abuse. Eighty-four percent had visited a healthcare center with a sexually related complaint (usually a sexually transmitted infection); of these, 24% reported abuse or discrimination from from a healthcare worker. Correlation between self-rated gender role mannerisms and interviewer-rated was r = 0.84. Regression analysis indicated that the degree of perceived gender role nonconformity was the major and significant predictor from Healthcare worker abuse: confirmation of homosexual behavior was non-significant. Gender role nonconformity predicted 21% of the variance in health worker abuse. Conclusion: There is speculation that abuse of sexual minority men by Healthcare workers in public clinics is due to factors in addition to their sexual behavior as gay/bisexual, and that it is due to violating perceived gender roles. Data confirm that perceived feminine gender role is a significant predictor, of abuse in healthcare and other settings. Common confusion between homosexual behavior and gender role norms may trigger discrimination, which may be as much due to violation of perceived gender roles as having sex with other men.","output":"Stigmatization of men who have sex with men in health care settings in East Africa is based more on perceived gender role-inappropriate mannerisms than having sex with men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The correct affiliation has been given in this paper.","output":"Correction to: Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2: Lessons from Other Coronavirus Strains"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient presented with acute onset of double vision during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when elective medical care was restricted.

AIM: To investigate changes in frequency and patterns of marital sexual activity and the role of potential factors underlying these changes, during and after COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: This longitudinal study followed 409 heterosexual married female participants who completed a baseline survey in AprilCJuly 2018 and biweekly online surveys over the next 14 weeks; an online survey in May 2020 during the lockdown in Singapore; and an online survey in June 2020 after the lockdown was lifted. Participants were recruited in 2018 using street intercept and screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Logistic fixed-effects models were used to test for changes in frequency and patterns of marital sexual activity and assess underlying factors. Pseudo-design-based sample weights were applied. OUTCOMES: The 2018 in-person baseline survey collected information on demographic characteristics and ideal frequency of marital sex, while follow-up online questionnaires in MayCJune 2020 included items on exact dates of marital sexual activity of previous weeks; stress and fatigue levels; both spouses stay-at-home statuses during lockdown; and marital satisfaction. RESULTS: 409 heterosexual married women were included in this study. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, the proportion of participants not having marital sex within a week remained stable while weekly sexual frequency increased, with more evenly distributed sexual activity on weekdays and weekends. Stress, fatigue, and marital satisfaction levels predicted probability of non-activity and sexual frequency. CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The increase in weekly sexual frequency has implications for sexual and reproductive health, including sexual satisfaction and prevalence of infertility and low birth weight associated with waiting time to pregnancy. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The longitudinal nature of the dataset provides unique insights into differences in frequency of marital sexual activity during compared to before the pandemic. Unlike previous studies, detailed data on exact dates of sexual activity allow for detection of differences in sexual activity by day of the week. However, dates of sexual activity were recorded retrospectively and may contain recall errors. Data were collected only from wives and hence dates of marital sexual activities were not cross-validated with husbands.

We dubbed this composite Energetic Phase Change Material (EPCM). When the EPCM is brought into contact with water, the magnesium alloy interacts with the water to produce heat. The EPCM heats up to its phase transition temperature. Any excess heat is absorbed as latent heat and the system is maintained at its desired incubation temperature, independent of ambient temperatures, long enough to facilitate enzymatic amplification. The EPCM together with colorimetric amplicon detection facilitates an inexpensive, disposable, point-of-need diagnostic test that does not require any electric power.

Then, MERS-N was stably overexpressed in A549 cells, and a PCR array containing 84 genes was used to screen for genes transcriptionally regulated by it. Several up-regulated antiviral genes, namely TNF, IL6, IL8, and CXCL10, were selected for independent validation in transiently transfected 293FT cells. Out of these, the overexpression of MERS-N was found to up-regulate CXCL10 at both transcriptional and translational levels.

This problem is the growth of graphene on the copper surface with no carbon feedstock. A new source of undesired carbon species was identified which has not been addressed so far. The hydrogen-rich heating stage was diagnosed as the onset of the unintended nucleation for the first time owing to the determinant catalytic role of hydrogen in this stage. It was found out that this problem leads to uncontrollable growth of multilayer graphene, growth of defective graphene film and also inhibition of the reliable synthesis of monolayer graphene. We managed to grow enhanced-quality monolayer graphene by developing some innovative solutions to the problem containing a general solution based on the hydrogen effects in the heating stage. The results reveal a significant decrease in the unintended nucleation density from ~ 2000 to almost zero domains per 100  100 m2 copper area. Furthermore, Raman, HRTEM and SAED analysis confirm the defect-free growth of monolayer graphene after employing the solutions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the essential role these functions have to preserve public health. Syndromic surveillance, electronic laboratory reporting in the meaningful use program, and the growth of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) have created linkages between hospitals, commercial labs, and public health that can collect and organize data, often through EHR and order workflows, to improve the timeliness and completeness of reporting. In theory, the standard data formats and exchange methods provided by meaningful use should enable rapid healthcare data exchange in the setting of disruptive healthcare events like a pandemic. In reality, access to data remains challenging, and even if available, often lack conformity to regulated standards. Objective: We sought to use regulated interoperability standards already in production to generate regional bed capacity awareness, enhance the capture of epidemiological risk factors and clinical variables among COVID-19 tested patients, and reduce the administrative burden of reporting for stakeholders in a manner that could be replicated by other public health agencies. Methods: Following a public health order mandating data submission, we developed technical infrastructure to combine multiple data feeds from electronic health record systems. We measured the completeness of each feed, and the match rate between feeds. Results: A cloud-based environment was created that received data from electronic lab reporting, consolidated clinical data architecture, and bed capacity data feeds from sites. Data governance was planned from the project beginning to aid in consensus and principles for data use. 88,906 total persons from CCDA data among 14 facilities, and 408,741 persons from ELR records among 88 facilities, were submitted. Fields routinely absent from ELR feeds included travel histories, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities. CCDA data provided an improvement in the quality of data available for surveillance and was highly complete with <5% for all records types with the exception of patient cell phone. 90.1% of records could be matched between CCDA and ELR feeds. Conclusions: We describe the development of a city-wide public health data hub for the surveillance of COVID-19 infection. We were able to assess the completeness of existing ELR feeds, augment these feeds with CCDA documents, establish secure transfer methods for data exchange, develop cloud-based architecture to enable secure data storage and analytics, and produced meaningful dashboards for the monitoring of capacity and disease burden. We see this public health and clinical data registry as an informative example of the power of common standards across electronic records, and a potential template for future extension of the use of standards to improve public health surveillance.","output":"Development of a standards-based city-wide health information exchange for public health in response to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pneumonias in patients with hempblastoses, arising during treatment in setting of myelotoxic agranulocytosis, are life-threatening complications, which press complex approach for diagnosis and treatment In condition of new coronavirus infection COVID-19 pandemia, differential diagnosis of pneumonia with ground glass lung changes is a hot issue In the current paper we present world data on clinical, laboratory and X-ray diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2) pneumonia in children Special attention is paid to X-ray features depending of child age It is provided two clinical examples, demonstrating a necessity of complex microbiological, immunological, molecular and X-ray diagnosis for detection of lung change genesis in oncohematologic patients ? 2020, Graphica Ltd All rights reserved","output":"Differential diagnosis of pneumonia in pediatric patients with oncohematological disease in condition of new coronavirus infection COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By binding to its chemokine receptor CXCR4 on osteoclast precursor cells (OCPs), it is well known that stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) promotes the chemotactic recruitment of circulating OCPs to the homeostatic bone remodeling site. However, the engagement of circulating OCPs in pathogenic bone resorption remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated a possible chemoattractant role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), another ligand for C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), in the recruitment of circulating OCPs to the bone lytic lesion. To accomplish this, we used Csf1r-eGFP-knock-in (KI) mice to establish an animal model of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particle-induced calvarial osteolysis. In the circulating Csf1r-eGFP+ cells of healthy Csf1r-eGFP-KI mice, Csf1r+/CD11b+ cells showed a greater degree of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis compared to a subset of Csf1r+/RANK+ cells in vitro. Therefore, Csf1r-eGFP+/CD11b+ cells were targeted as functionally relevant OCPs in the present study. Although expression of the two cognate receptors for MIF, CXCR2 and CXCR4, was elevated on Csf1r+/CD11b+ cells, transmigration of OCPs toward recombinant MIF in vitro was facilitated by ligation with CXCR4, but not CXCR2. Meanwhile, the level of PMMA-induced bone resorption in calvaria was markedly greater in wild-type (WT) mice compared to that detected in MIF-knockout (KO) mice. Interestingly, in contrast to the elevated MIF, diminished SDF-1 was detected in a particle-induced bone lytic lesion of WT mice in conjunction with an increased number of infiltrating CXCR4+ OCPs. However, such diminished SDF-1 was not found in the PMMA-injected calvaria of MIF-KO mice. Furthermore, stimulation of osteoblasts with MIF in vitro suppressed their production of SDF-1, suggesting that MIF can downmodulate SDF-1 production in bone tissue. Systemically administered anti-MIF neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibited the homing of CXCR4+ OCPs, as well as bone resorption, in the PMMA-injected calvaria, while increasing locally produced SDF-1. Collectively, these data suggest that locally produced MIF in the inflammatory bone lytic site is engaged in the chemoattraction of circulating CXCR4+ OCPs. ? 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","output":"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Supports Homing of Osteoclast Precursors to Peripheral Osteolytic Lesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve, detecting emerging variants early is critical for public health interventions. Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing/sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing. Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here, we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We develop and deploy improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater.

CTEPH is diagnosed by abnormal lung perfusion despite 3-months of oral anticoagulation with persistent pulmonary artery thromboembolic/ fibrotic material confirmed on cross sectional imaging and pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterisation. Without treatment the prognosis is bleak, but there are now three treatment modalities that are effective in treating patients with CTEPH: pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) surgery, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) and medical therapy. AREAS COVERED We provide a comprehensive review of the literature with particular emphasis on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and the established and emerging treatments of CTEPH. EXPERT OPINION It is important to recognise that CTEPH is complication of an acute PE as there are effective and sometimes curative treatments available. In European and North American practice, PEA surgery remains the cornerstone of therapy in patients with CTEPH and accessible disease without significant comorbidity. For those patients with a disease burden that is inaccessible or fails to justify the risk of major surgery, initiating medical therapy and considering BPA is appropriate. Those with persistent pulmonary hypertension after PEA should also receive medical therapy and be considered for BPA or re-do endarterectomy. The available therapies are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and the treatment decision is often subjective and individualised, based on the local available expertise. Further research is needed to understand the optimal treatment strategy for patients and in particular to identify \\"responders\\" and assess the synergies between these three treatment strategies.","output":"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a review of risk factors, management and current challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we critically analyse our experiences of initiating participatory research in the challenging context of the Atacama Desert, Northern Chile.

Hence, transmission dynamics of influenza A/H1N1 were determined across space and time in Thailand. METHODS Dates of symptom onset were obtained for all daily laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1pdm in Thailand from 3 May 2009 to 26 December 2010 for four different geographic regions (Central, North, North-East, and South). These data were analysed using a probabilistic epidemic reconstruction, and estimates of the effective reproduction number, R(t), were derived by region and over time. RESULTS Estimated R(t) values for the first wave peaked at 1.54 (95% CI: 1.42-1.71) in the Central region and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.38-1.92) in the North, whilst the corresponding values in the North-East and the South were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.17-1.46) and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.32-1.45) respectively. As the R(t) in the Central region fell below one, the value of R(t) in the rest of Thailand increased above one. R(t) was above one for 30 days continuously through the first wave in all regions of Thailand. During the second wave R(t) was only marginally above one in all regions except the South. CONCLUSIONS In Thailand, the value of R(t) varied by region in the two pandemic waves. Higher R(t) estimates were found in Central and Northern regions in the first wave.

A new wave is inevitable when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is only partial. Increasing the daily vaccination rates reduces the peak active caseload at Wave-3.

In conclusion, our data imply that future studies should consider a TEVG design that at least includes endothelial recellularization and bioreactor preconditioning, and we suggest that more standard guidelines for testing and reporting TEVGs in large animals should be considered to enable interstudy comparisons and favor a robust and reproducible outcome as well as clinical translation.","output":"Concise Review: Patency of Small-Diameter Tissue-Engineered Vascular Grafts: A Meta-Analysis of Preclinical Trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Regional monitoring of the proportion of the population who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide local management of the epidemic, but is difficult in the absence of regular nationwide serosurveys. We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 57% (95% CI 51-64) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 149% (132-169) by Jan 15, 2021. With 265% (234-298) of adult residents having been infected in ?le-de-France (Paris region) compared with 51% (45-58) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 050) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 074). The proportion infected was twice as high (204%, 156-263) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (97%, 69-141). 402% (343-463) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 493% (429-559) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 089). INTERPRETATION: Our simple approach to estimate the proportion of adults that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 can help to characterise the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, epidemic dynamics, and the performance of surveillance in different regions.

It has been proposed that lockdown conditions, including social and physical distancing measures, may disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain and require rapid adaptation to treatment and care strategies. Using an online methodology, we investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N = 431) relative to a healthy control group (N = 88). Data were collected during the most stringent period of lockdown in the United Kingdom (mid-April to early-May 2020). In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised lockdown-related increases in pain and psychological distress, which would be mediated by levels of pain catastrophising. Responses indicated that people with chronic pain perceived increased pain severity, compared to their estimation of typical pain levels prior to lockdown (p < .001). They were also more adversely affected by lockdown conditions compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater self-perceived increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise (p ? .001). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that pain catastrophising was an important factor relating to the extent of self-perceived increases in pain severity during lockdown ( = .27, p < .001) and also mediated the relationship between decreased mood and pain. Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also related to perceptions of increased pain ( = .15, p < .001). Interestingly, levels of pain intensity (measured at two time points at pre and during lockdown) in a subgroup (N = 85) did not demonstrate a significant change. However, individuals in this subgroup still reported self-perceived pain increases during lockdown, which were also predicted by baseline levels of pain catastrophising. Overall, the findings indicate that people with chronic pain suffer adverse effects of lockdown including self-perceived increases in their pain. Remote pain management provision to target reduction of pain catastrophising and increase health behaviours including physical activity could be beneficial for this vulnerable population.","output":"Adverse effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on pain, physical activity and psychological well-being in people with chronic pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study addresses the current issues in online assessments, which are particularly relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic.

We compared the upper respiratory bacterial profiles among Thai patients with influenza or COVID-19 by using 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing based on MiSeq platform. The Chao1 richness was not significantly different among groups, whereas the Shannon diversity of Flu A and Flu B groups were significantly lower than Non-Flu & COVID-19 group. The beta diversity revealed that the microbial communities of influenza (Flu A and Flu B), COVID-19, and Non-Flu & COVID-19 were significantly different; however, the comparison of the community structure was similar between Flu A and Flu B groups. The bacterial classification revealed that Enterobacteriaceae was predominant in influenza patients, while Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were significantly enriched in the COVID-19 patients. These implied that respiratory viral infections might be related to alteration of upper respiratory bacterial community and susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. Moreover, the bacteria that observed in Non-Flu & COVID-19 patients had high abundance of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Fusobacterium.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April 21st to November 27th, 2020. Setting: Five hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Participants: Hospitalized patients aged []18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation [] 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Intervention: Participants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of convalescent or normal control plasma. Measurements: The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population (with an odds ratio (OR) >1.0 indicating improved clinical status in the convalescent plasma group). Results: Of 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma.

METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, pre-print servers, clinical trial registries, and relevant grey literature sources were searched until July 31, 2020, using database searching and an automated method called Continuous Active Learning? (CAL?). All search results were processed using CAL? to identify the most likely relevant citations that were then screened by a single human reviewer. Full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal were completed by a single reviewer and verified by a second. RESULTS: Nine clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were included. The most common recommendation in the CPGs was establishing surveillance and monitoring systems followed by mandating the use of PPE; physically distancing or cohorting residents; environmental cleaning and disinfection; promoting hand and respiratory hygiene among residents, staff, and visitors; and providing sick leave compensation for staff. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests robust surveillance and monitoring along with support for IPAC initiatives are key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF. However, there are significant gaps in the current recommendations especially with regard to the movement of staff between LTCF and their role as possible transmission vectors.

Ultimately, the public's response to announcements of lockdowns-defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel-will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate

of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study in The Netherlands including 952 of 1183 consecutively hospitalized patients that were admitted to participating hospitals between March 2nd, 2020, and May 22nd, 2020. Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters upon admission and during hospitalization were collected until July 1st. RESULTS: The median age was 69 years (IQR 58-77 years) and 605 (63.6%) were male. Cardiovascular disease was present in 558 (58.6%) patients. The median time of onset of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 7 days (IQR 5-10). A non ICU admission policy was applicable in 312 (32.8%) patients and in 165 (56.3%) of the severely ill patients admitted to the ward. At admission and during hospitalization, severely ill patients had higher values of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer with higher neutrophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts. Overall in-hospital mortality was 25.1% and 183 (19.1%) patients were admitted to ICU, of whom 56 (30.6%) died. Patients aged &#8805;70 years had high mortality, both at the ward (52.4%) and ICU (47.4%). The median length of ICU stay was 8 days longer in patients aged &#8805;70 years compared to patients aged &#8804;60 years. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged &#8805;70 years had high mortality and longer ICU stay compared to patients aged &#8804;60 years.

Elderly people have higher risk factors associated with acute ischemic stroke or embolization vascular events, and advanced age is strongly associated with severe COVID-19 and death. We reported, instead, a case of an ischemic stroke in a young woman during her hospitalization for COVID-19-related pneumonia. A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department of our institution with progressive respiratory distress associated with a 2-day history of fever, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where she underwent a tracheostomy for mechanical ventilation due to her severe clinical condition and her very low arterial partial pressure of oxygen. The nasopharyngeal swab test confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory tests showed neutrophilic leucocytosis, a prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. After 18 days, during her stay in the ICU after suspension of the medications used for sedation, left hemiplegia was reported. Central facial palsy on the left side, dysarthria, and facial drop were present, with complete paralysis of the ipsilateral upper and lower limbs. Computed tomography (CT) of the head and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the presence of lesions in the right hemisphere affecting the territories of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, consistent with ischemic stroke. Pulmonary and splenic infarcts were also found after CT of the chest.

This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020.

The importance of mitochondria in inflammatory pathologies, besides providing energy, is associated with the release of mitochondrial damage products, such as mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA), which may perpetuate inflammation. In this review, we aimed to show the importance of mitochondria, as organelles that produce energy and intervene in multiple pathologies, focusing mainly in COVID-19 and using multiple molecular mechanisms that allow for the replication and maintenance of the viral genome, leading to the exacerbation and spread of the inflammatory response. The evidence suggests that mitochondria are implicated in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which forms double-membrane vesicles and evades detection by the cell defense system. These mitochondrion-hijacking vesicles damage the integrity of the mitochondrions membrane, releasing mt-DNA into circulation and triggering the activation of innate immunity, which may contribute to an exacerbation of the pro-inflammatory state. Conclusions. While mitochondrial dysfunction in COVID-19 continues to be studied, the use of mt-DNA as an indicator of prognosis and severity is a potential area yet to be explored.","output":"Mitochondria and Mitochondrial DNA: Key Elements in the Pathogenesis and Exacerbation of the Inflammatory State Caused by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue- and cell-specific expression patterns are highly variable within and across individuals, leading to altered host responses after acute virus infection. Unraveling key tissue-specific response patterns provides novel opportunities for defining fundamental mechanisms of virus-host interaction in disease and the identification of critical tissue-specific networks for disease intervention in the lung. Currently, there are no approved therapeutics for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients, and little is understood about how lung cell types contribute to disease outcomes. MERS-CoV replicates equivalently in primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (MVE) and fibroblasts (FB) and to equivalent peak titers but with slower replication kinetics in human airway epithelial cell cultures (HAE). However, only infected MVE demonstrate observable virus-induced cytopathic effect. To explore mechanisms leading to reduced MVE viability, donor-matched human lung MVE, HAE, and FB were infected, and their transcriptomes, proteomes, and lipidomes were monitored over time. Validated functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that MERS-CoV-infected MVE were dying via an unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated apoptosis. Pharmacologic manipulation of the UPR in MERS-CoV-infected primary lung cells reduced viral titers and in male mice improved respiratory function with accompanying reductions in weight loss, pathological signatures of acute lung injury, and times to recovery. Systems biology analysis and validation studies of global kinetic transcript, protein, and lipid data sets confirmed that inhibition of host stress pathways that are differentially regulated following MERS-CoV infection of different tissue types can alleviate symptom progression to end-stage lung disease commonly seen following emerging coronavirus outbreaks.","output":"Unfolded Protein Response Inhibition Reduces Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the extensive use of e-learning in higher educational institutions in many countries leads us to apprehend the reality, precisely the key success/failure factors of the implementation, of e-learning systems in these institutions.

Parent support groups can help parents to promote health-related behaviours during this crucial period. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of parents who participated in a parent support group (Parent-Child Meetings) which promoted health-related behaviours of their children, and to determine whether and how these meetings supported them in promoting these behaviours. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design. The parent support group consisted of weekly Parent-Child Meetings organized in a multi-ethnic, relatively low-income neighbourhood in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Data on the experiences of parents was collected through participatory observations, informal conversations (n = 30 sessions) and semi-structured interviews (n = 13) between April 2019 and March 2020. The data was analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Parents indicated that they experienced the parent-child meetings as enjoyable and as providing them with socio-emotional support. They reported that the meetings increased their parenting knowledge, skills and practices regarding healthy behaviours of their children and that they used this knowledge in their daily lives. They also appreciated the practical information and advice provided by experts in the meetings. Parents indicated that the positive attitude of the experts was crucial in accepting and adopting their advice. Additionally, parents valued the interactive and hands-on workshops, which integrated health-related behaviours and active play with children, as it enabled them to learn while they played with their children. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that parent-child meetings contributed to enhancing parental knowledge, skills and practices regarding healthy behaviours of their children. This could potentially benefit the health of children during the first 2 years of their lives. In particular, the peer support of other parents, the hands-on workshops, and the concrete advice and information provided in an informal setting were highly valued by parents. Future parent support groups could use these findings to improve their meetings or to start meetings that better suit the needs of parents with young children.

This paper develops a fully Bayesian approach to adjust observed prevalence estimates for sensitivity and specificity. Application to a seroprevalence survey conducted in New York State in 2020 demonstrates that this approach results in more realistic - and narrower - credible interval than the standard sensitivity analysis using confidence interval endpoints. In addition, the model permits incorporating data on the geographical distribution of reported case counts to create informative priors on the cumulative incidence to produce estimates and credible intervals for smaller geographic areas than often can be precisely estimated with seroprevalence surveys.","output":"Adjusting COVID-19 Seroprevalence Survey Results to Account for Test Sensitivity and Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the absence of a proven effective vaccine preventing infection by SARS-CoV-2, or a proven drug to treat COVID-19, the positive results of passive immune therapy using convalescent serum provide a strong lead.

Scientists from several areas in the world are still committed to this mission, as shown by the accelerated scientific production in the first half of 2020 with over 25,000 published articles related to the new coronavirus. Three great lines of publications related to COVID-19 were identified for building this article: The first refers to knowledge production concerning the virus and pathophysiology of COVID-19; the second regards efforts to produce vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 at a speed without precedent in the history of science; the third comprehends the attempts to find a marketed drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 by drug repurposing. In this review, the drugs that have been repurposed so far are grouped according to their chemical class. Their structures will be presented to provide better understanding of their structural similarities and possible correlations with mechanisms of actions.

Research conducted during past epidemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of this study was to investigate antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms during this pandemic in Greece. METHODS: All women receiving routine antenatal care, during a three-month period, starting one week after the total lockdown in Greece, in a University department, were asked to fill in two questionnaires, the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: Overall, 505 women (93.3% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The prevalence of antenatal depression (EPDS score&#8805;13) in the population of the study was 13.5%. Unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.447; 95% CI: 1.235-4.846), smoking (OR: 2.268; 95% CI: 1.166-4.411) and antenatal anxiety (OR: 5.074; 95% CI: 2.898-8.883) increased the risk of antenatal depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. State (current)-anxiety affected 34.1% of the participants, whereas Trait (lifetime)-anxiety affected 15.8%. The State-anxiety score (median) was significantly higher than the Trait-anxiety (median) (41 vs. 36; p<0.001), revealing an increase in the levels of anxiety in the pandemic, while there was also a positive linear correlation between the two scales (rho=0.592; p<0.001).

In this study, we described the dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural and urban counties in the U.S. METHODS: Using data from April 1 to November 12, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, we estimated COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates and conducted comparisons between urban and rural areas in three time periods at the national level, and in states with higher and lower COVID-19 incidence rates. RESULTS: Results at the national level showed greater COVID-19 incidence rates in urban compared to rural counties in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. at the beginning of the epidemic. However, the intensity of the epidemic has shifted to a rapid surge in rural areas. In particular, high incidence states located in the Mid-west of the country had more than 3,400 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people compared to 1,284 cases per 100,000 people in urban counties nationwide during the third period (August 30 to November 12). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the current epicenter of the epidemic is located in states with higher infection rates and mortality in rural areas.

Loneliness resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may also have negative implications on those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to identify the role of loneliness specific to the recent COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to the prevalence and severity of chronic pain in the geriatric population and to provide an overview for clinicians. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative review. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using combinations of relevant search terms. Databases included PubMed and relevant grey literature sources. Reference lists of selected articles were also searched for additional relevant literature. RESULTS: Recent literature supports that social isolation and loneliness stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic have negative implications on chronic musculoskeletal pain. Loneliness has been well documented to have deleterious effects on physical and mental health, and it is increasingly linked to worsening debility and pain interference for those with chronic musculoskeletal pain. This has been found to be most prominent in the geriatric population, who are at the greatest risk for social decline and loneliness. Loneliness has also been found to have negative effects on cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, and mental health, as well as cognitive decline. LIMITATIONS: Potential selection bias due to the narrative review design. Some included studies required the use of online questionnaires, which may not be accessible for the geriatric population, those without technology literacy, or low socioeconomic status populations. Future studies should emphasize screening patients for access to technological devices and reliable internet while partnering with community programs focused on digital literacy and resource access. CONCLUSIONS: A myriad of deleterious effects stemming from social isolation and loneliness have been documented, of which geriatric populations are especially susceptible. Both early identification of at-risk patients and safe interventions are essential to mitigate loneliness and stop the progression of debility. Further resources and research are necessary to illuminate how best to proceed, both in the setting of the ongoing pandemic and how interventions can be applied to alleviate suffering in those with limited ability to receive hospital or clinic-based care.","output":"The Impact of Isolation During COVID-19 on Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in the Geriatric Population: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On February 28, 2020, a case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in a woman resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington.* Epidemiologic investigation of facility A identified 129 cases of COVID-19 associated with facility A, including 81 of the residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died. Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death.

The comparison shows that the impact of racial and ethnic discrimination on pandemic policy outcomes is not unique to the United States. Health inequalities stemming in part from patterns of institutional racism and discrimination perversely help reproduce these societal inequities. We find that governments' initial responses have failed to mitigate the disproportionate impact of this health and economic crisis on minority communities because they did not acknowledge or address the particular challenges that these groups face. ?

The framework included behavior intentions and four psychological factors: awareness of consequence (persons understanding that actions have consequences), ascription of responsibility (duty to respond), self-efficacy (belief in own skills and capacity), personal norm (individuals' values to act by socially accepted rules and reduce food waste as a code of conduct and moral obligation). A total of 514 samples from different regions of China were collected through an online survey platform, and the research framework was tested by applying structural equation modeling (SEM). This study found that ascription of responsibility and self-efficacy can effectively activate personal norm to reduce food waste. Personal norm and self-efficacy had a significant positive effect on behavior intentions to reduce food waste. Specifically, self-efficacy had the greatest effect on personal norm, followed by ascription of responsibility, and on behavior intentions to reduce food waste, followed by personal norm. Interestingly, while ascription of responsibility and self-efficacy had an impact on personal norm, awareness of consequence did not significantly influence personal norm to reduce food waste, suggesting that emotional factors are more likely to trigger personal norms that motivate consumers to take action to reduce food waste than cognitive factors. Based on the findings, several suggestions are provided for more effective interventions by restaurants to promote food waste reduction behavior, such as information intervention strategies, displaying information related to food consumption, and reducing the size of plates for some meals.","output":"Understanding Consumers' Food Waste Reduction Behavior-A Study Based on Extended Norm Activation Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disaster epidemiology is not a new field, and the methods utilized to conduct disaster epidemiology studies are no different than the methods used in everyday applied public health research and investigations.

Gene exchange between virulent and avirulent viruses has shown that the nsP3 gene, which has essential 5' conserved domains and a non-essential hypervariable 3' domain, is one of the virulence determinants. This protein plays a role in subgenomic 26S and negative-strand RNA synthesis and is thought to function with nsP1 to anchor replication complexes to cell membrane structures. Studies to date have focused on analysing the effect of mutational changes spread over the whole gene on virulence of the virus. The virulent SFV4 virus, derived from an infectious clone, was utilized to analyse the effect on virulence of large deletions in the hypervariable domain of nsP3. Two viruses with different in-frame deletions that spanned this domain showed reduced rates of RNA synthesis and multiplication in cell culture. In adult BALB/c mice, these viruses were avirulent after intramuscular and intraperitoneal inoculation, and brains sampled from infected mice showed minimal or no evidence of pathology. These deleted viruses had greatly reduced virulence when administered by the intranasal route and brains from infected mice showed lesions that were much less severe than those seen in SFV4 infection. Mice surviving infection with the deleted viruses resisted challenge with the virulent L10 strain, indicating induction of protective immunity.

Despite great advances in the development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, relapse and metastasis in NPC patients remain major causes of mortality. Evidence accumulated over recent years indicates that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NPC and inhibition of EBV reactivation is now being considered as a goal for the therapy of EBV-associated cancers. With this in mind, a panel of dietary compounds was screened and emodin was found to have potential anti-EBV activity. Through Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometric analysis, we show that emodin inhibits the expression of EBV lytic proteins and blocks virion production in EBV- positive epithelial cell lines. In investigating the underlying mechanism, reporter assays indicated that emodin represses Zta promoter (Zp) and Rta promoter (Rp) activities, triggered by various inducers. Mapping of the Zp construct reveals that the SP1 binding region is important for emodin-triggered repression and emodin is shown to be able to inhibit SP1 expression, suggesting that it likely inhibits EBV reactivation by suppression of SP1 expression. Moreover, we also show that emodin inhibits the tumorigenic properties induced by repeated EBV reactivation, including micronucleus formation, cell proliferation, migration, and matrigel invasiveness. Emodin administration also represses the tumor growth in mice which is induced by EBV activation.

Given the potential implications of depression on surgery outcomes, presurgery psychiatric assessment is recommended to assess suitability for bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in detecting depression in bariatric surgery candidates. METHODS Bariatric surgery candidates (n = 244) completed the PHQ-9 and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as part of their presurgery psychiatric assessment. The operating characteristics of the PHQ-9 were examined. The study was replicated in an independent sample of bariatric surgery candidates (n = 275). RESULTS Rates of current and lifetime major depressive episodes were 1.6% to 3.8% and 33.8% to 35.5%, respectively, as assessed by the MINI. According to the PHQ-9, 52.5% to 54.9% of patients exceeded the cutoff for moderate depression (PHQ-9  10), and 27.6% to 29.1% for moderate severe depression (PHQ-9  15). The optimal dichotomization cutoff point on the PHQ-9 was 15 in both studies (sensitivity 75%, specificity 75% to 76%). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the PHQ-9 has adequate operating characteristics compared with a criterion standard measure. A PHQ-9 cutoff of 15 is recommended to identify bariatric surgery candidates who may require further assessment of depressive symptoms.","output":"Psychometric properties of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as a depression screening tool for bariatric surgery candidates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methanobrevibacter smithii is the main human methanogen almost always found in the digestive tract of adults.

In the presence of negative controls, 50/50 (100%) prospectively analysed newborn gastric juice specimens were PCR-positive for methanogens, all identified as M. smithii by sequencing. We succeeded in cultivating M. smithii in 35/50 (70%) newborn gastric juice specimens, while 15/50 specimens remained sterile. Further, M. smithii was observed by direct microscopic investigation using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Multispacer sequence typing found one of seven different genotypes per specimen, these genotypes having all been previously described in adult human stools. Methanobrevibacter smithii is an early inhabitant of the human stomach, colonising the gastric mucosa just after birth, and the mother's gut microbiota is a probable source of colonisation.","output":"Methanobrevibacter smithii, a methanogen consistently colonising the newborn stomach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has been attracting extensive attention from both practitioners and scholars.

Extreme poverty has still aggravated social determinants of health and financial barriers to healthcare. Little is known about the context-specific factors influencing access to healthcare in the crisis-affected population. Using a subset of data from Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoAA) 2019, this study analyzed 31,343 households data, which was collected between 17 July and 19 September 2019 throughout all 34 provinces in Afghanistan. The outcome measured was access to care in the healthcare facility, and multivariable binary logistic regression models were used to identify the specific factors associated with access to healthcare. Of 31,343 households exposed to complex emergencies in Afghanistan, 10,057 (32.1%) could not access healthcare facilities when one was needed in last three months. The access to healthcare was significantly associated with displacement status, economic factors such as employment status or total monthly income, and the distance to healthcare facilities. Significant increase in healthcare access was associated with factors related to communication and access to information, such as awareness of humanitarian assistance availability and mobile phone with a SIM card, while disability in cognitive function, such as memory or concentration, was associated with poorer healthcare access. Our findings indicate that the crisis-affected population remains vulnerable in access to healthcare, despite the recent improvements in health sectors.

Materials and Methods All COVID-19 cases reported in the state of Karnataka, India, till June 12, 2020, are included in the study. The epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Karnataka is studied through descriptive statistical analysis. Results The findings illustrate a gender-, age-, and region-based disparity in the susceptibility and fatality. There appears to be a male preponderance in the susceptibility, but a female preponderance in fatality. It is also found that the adults are more susceptible to the infection, while the elderly have the risk of high fatality. Further, infected individuals in the region with urbanization have a higher risk of fatality than other regions. The study shows that the chances of recovery for females are lower than males, and further, the chances of recovery are positively related to the age of the infected person. The chances of recovery are higher if the infected individual is younger and they diminish if the individual is older. The study also explores that the chances of recovery are affected by the patient's geographical location. It is also noted that individuals who returned from foreign travel have better chances of recovery than the locally transmitted individuals. Conclusion Though the risk of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection is equal to all, the burden of getting infected and the burden of fatality is unequally distributed among different demographic categories. To manage the contagious spread of epidemic, to reduce fatality, and to increase the chances of recovery, targeted policy actions are suggested to benefit the vulnerable demographic categories.","output":"Preliminary Evidence from a Cross-sectional Study on Epidemiology and Early Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19 in Karnataka State of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report weaning from mechanical ventilation with no coughing in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing demand for distance and online learning strategies to support and even replace learning experiences previously afforded by clinical placements and clerkships. An intriguing but under-researched modality is the use of medical reality television to provide authentic experiences of patient care. This strategy does not feature in published medical educational literature, though promising research is emerging from other disciplines. METHODOLOGY: A programme of learning using medical reality television clips to facilitate case-based learning was developed according to the principles of 'anchored instruction', a technology-based educational theory. Clips were taken from the UK television show '24 hours in A&E'. Medical students' learning experiences were investigated using a qualitative approach addressing the following research questions: - What is the perceived emotional experience of medical students when watching reality television in an educational context? - How do medical students relate their experience of watching reality television in a formal educational setting to their perceived learning needs in the clinical environment? A case study research methodology was adopted within the interpretivist paradigm. Data were triangulated from semi-structured interviews with students and non-participant observation of the teaching session. Field notes and transcripts were analysed through an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: In response to the medical reality television, a diverse range of emotions were expressed including: excitement, amusement, concern, nervousness, sadness and joy. Students identified gaps in their clinical knowledge such as interpreting results, practical aspects of prescribing and end of life care. Key themes were increased student engagement and a promotion of holistic care practices. DISCUSSION: Students perceived reality television as a highly realistic and relatable medium and an enjoyable, memorable way to contextualise learning from the classroom to real life, a finding mirrored in previous studies in other fields. The high degree of emotion expressed may explain the improved subjective memorability of the cases. CONCLUSION: Medical reality television offers a unique means of engaging students by providing authentic experiences of patient care and should be valued alongside other technology-enhanced learning strategies.","output":"Using medical reality television as a technology-enhanced learning strategy to provide authentic patient care experiences during clinical placements: a case study research investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From containment to harm reduction from SARS-CoV-2: a fabric mask for enhanced effectiveness, comfort, and compliance Previous article View latest articles Next article Article title: From containment to harm reduction from SARS-CoV-2: a fabric mask for enhanced effectiveness, comfort, and compliance Authors: Park, S , & Jayaraman, S Journal: The Journal of the Textile Institute DOI: http://dx doi org/10 1080/00405000 2020 1805971 The authors regret the inadvertent error made in the notation for the dimensions of one of the pattern parts in Figure 8, which has been corrected in the new figure The authors also provide additional information in the replacement figure to augment the easy creation of masks Below is the corrected image: Figure 8 Customization: measurement markers and mask pattern parts with dimensions Display full size","output":"Correction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Conflicting reports of increases and decreases in rates of preterm birth (PTB) and stillbirth in the general population during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic have surfaced.

While declines of most air pollutants have been globally evidenced in most cities worldwide, there is few detailed spatial knowledge at local scale. Therefore, we present here a high resolution mapping of the 2018-2020 evolution of human activities and air pollutants in Wuhan. Human activities were assessed by nighttime light radiance. We measured the air quality index (AQI) as the maximum value among air quality sub-indices of SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and particulate matter. We also compared mean monthly pollutant concentration during January-April in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Mapping results show that variations of nighttime light radiance were heterogenous at local scale, showing both rises and declines in the same district. The radiance decreased in eight districts located mostly in the city center, as a result of lower human activity, but the radiance increased in the five surrounding districts, as a consequence of people staying at home. AQI was low during lockdown, averaging at 57, but showed strong daily variations with a slight pollution around February 5 with AQI rising to 126. During this pollution event, particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO levels were positively correlated, suggesting common sources, but were not correlated with ozone; and particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO decreased with relative humidity, suggesting removal by precipitation. Comparison of 2020 data with previous years shows that particulate matter and NO2 were highly reduced, CO was less reduced due to ongoing power industries, SO2 first declined then increased to exceed 2018-19 values due to coal combustion, and ozone levels was more abundant due both to less NOx pollution and the weekend effect.

Understanding the effects on youth mental health is crucial to inform policies to support communities as they face the pandemic and future crises. This paper sought to report on mental health symptoms in Australian children and adolescents during the initial stages of the pandemic (May to November 2020) and to examine its association with child/family characteristics and exposure to the broad COVID-19 environment. Methods: An online longitudinal survey was completed by 1,324 parents and carers of Australian children aged 4 to 17 years. Parents/carers reported on their childs mental health using five measures, including emotional symptoms, conduct disorder problems, hyperactivity/inattention, anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Child/family characteristics and COVID-related variables were measured. Results: Overall, 30.5%, 26.3% and 9.5% of our sample scored in the high to very high range for emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention, respectively. Similarly, 20.2% and 20.4% of our sample scored in the clinical range for anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms respectively. A childs pre-existing mental health diagnosis, neurodevelopmental condition and chronic illness significantly predicted parent-reported youth mental health symptoms. Parental mental health symptoms, having a close contact with COVID-19 and applying for government financial assistance during COVID-19 were also significant predictors of youth mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings show that Australian youth experienced considerable levels of mental health symptoms during the initial phase of COVID-19, and highlight the need for targeted, effective support for affected youth and particularly for those with pre-existing vulnerabilities.","output":"Mental Health Symptoms in Children and Adolescents during COVID-19 in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that causes not only somatic health issues, but also frequently psychosocial burdens. The aims of this study were to investigate biopsychosocial factors that might further aggravate fear of COVID-19, and to establish a biopsychosocial model of severe fear of COVID-19. METHODS: 368 participants were included in this study. Biopsychosocial factors observed comprised biological factors (somatic risk), psychological factors (state/trait anxiety, physical symptoms of anxiety, severe health anxiety, specific phobias, depression), and psychosocial factors (social support, financial losses, social media consumption, social contacts with COVID-19 infected people). Psychometric questionnaires included State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Becks Anxiety Inventory, Whiteley-Index / Illness Attitude Scales, Specific Phobia Questionnaire, WHO-5 and Social Support Survey. RESULTS: 162/368 (44.0%) participants had almost no fear, 170/368 (46.2%) participants had moderate fear, and 45/368 (12.2%) participants had severe fear of COVID-19. Female participants showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than male participants (gender: 2 = 18.47, p<0.001). However, the level of fear of COVID-19 increased in male participants when they had contact with people who were infected with COVID-19, while in contrast the level of fear of COVID-19 decreased in female participants when they had such contacts [ANCOVA: fear of COVID-19 (contact x gender): F(1,363) = 5.596, p = .019]. Moreover, participants without relationships showed higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (marital status: 2 = 14.582, p = 0.024). Furthermore, financial losses due to the COVID-19 were associated with higher levels of fear of COVID-19 [ANCOVA: fear of COVID-19(financial loss x gender): F(1, 363) = 22.853, p< .001]. Multiple regression analysis revealed female gender, severe health anxiety (WI-IAS) and state /trait anxiety (STAI) as significant predictors of severe fear of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In this study significant predictors of severe fear of COVID-19 were female gender, pre-existing state and trait anxiety, as well as severe health anxiety. The finding of significant predictors of fear of COVID-19 might contribute to detect people who might suffer most from severe, overwhelming fear of COVID-19 at an early stage.","output":"A biopsychosocial model of severe fear of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused a persistent decline in childhood vaccination coverage, including Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, in some countries. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased Hib vaccination due to COVID-19 on invasive Hib disease burden in Japan. METHODS Using a deterministic dynamic transmission model (susceptible-carriage-infection-recovery model), the incidence rates of invasive Hib disease in under 5 year olds in rapid vaccination recovery and persistent vaccination declined scenarios were compared for the next 10 years after 2020. The national Hib vaccination rate after the impact of COVID-19 reduced to 87% and 73% in 2020 from approximately 97% each in 2013-2019 for primary and booster doses. RESULTS While the persistent decline scenarios revealed an increase in invasive Hib disease incidence to 0.50/100,000 children under 5 years old, the incidence of the rapid recovery scenario slightly increased with a consistent decline of incidence after 2021. The shorter the duration of the decline in vaccination rate was, the smaller the incremental disease burden observed in the model. Compared to the rapid recovery scenario, the permanent decline scenario showed a 296.87 cumulative incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALY) loss for the next 10 years. CONCLUSIONS The persistent decline of Hib vaccination rate due to COVID-19 causes an incremental disease burden irrespective of the possible decline of Hib transmission rate by COVID-19 mitigation measures. A rapid recovery of vaccination coverage rate can prevent this possible incremental disease burden.","output":"A model for the incremental burden of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b due to a decline of childhood vaccination during the COVID-19 outbreak: A dynamic transmission model in Japan."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the gold standard method for cortisol measurement, is expensive and not widely available in the developing countries.

In this study, we aimed to understand environmental factors leading to COVID-19-related mortality outside of Hubei province, in mainland China. Methods We collected spatial-temporal and environmental data of 99 cases of COVID-19-related deaths outside of Hubei province in Mainland China between January 22, 2020 and April 6, 2020. A descriptive analysis, including a spatial-temporal distribution of daily reported diagnosed cases and related deaths, was conducted. We analyzed the possible environmental factors that affect the provincial-level CFR of COVID-19 outside Hubei, China. Results Among the 99 reported deaths, 59 (59.6%) were male and 40 (40.4%) were female. The mean age at death was 71.30 (SD 12.98) years and 74 deaths were among those 65 years or older. The CFR was negatively correlated with temperature (r=-0.679, P < 0.001) and humidity (r=-0.607, P = 0.002), while latitude was positively correlated with the CFR (r = 0.636, P = 0.001). There were no statistically significant associations between CFR and the social environment factors. Conclusion Higher CFR of COVID-19 was associated with lower temperature, lower humidity, and higher latitude.

The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, the third COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the United States, uses a replication-incompetent human adenoviral type 26 vector platform* (2) and is administered as a single intramuscular dose, whereas the first two authorized vaccines use an mRNA platform and require 2 doses. On February 28, 2021, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued interim recommendations for use of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine among persons aged &#8805;18 years (3). During April 13-23, CDC and FDA recommended a pause in use of Janssen vaccine after reports of six cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150,000/L of blood) among Janssen vaccine recipients (4). Similar thrombotic events, primarily among women aged <60 years, have been described in Europe after receipt of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, which uses a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral vector (5-7). The U.S. CVST cases that prompted the pause in Janssen vaccination, as well as subsequently detected CVST cases, are described elsewhere (8). This report summarizes adverse events among Janssen vaccine recipients, including non-CVST cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), a passive surveillance system, and through v-safe, an active monitoring system. As of April 21, 2021, 7.98 million doses of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine had been administered. Among 13,725 VAERS reports reviewed, 97% were classified as nonserious and 3% as serious,? including three reports among women of cases of thrombosis in large arteries or veins accompanied by thrombocytopenia during the second week after vaccination. These three cases and the previously detected CVST cases are consistent with 17 cases of TTS, a newly defined condition. Approximately 338,700 Janssen COVID-19 vaccine recipients completed at least one v-safe survey during the week after vaccination; 76% reported a systemic reaction, 61% reported a local reaction, and 34% reported a health impact.? Fatigue and pain were commonly reported symptoms in both VAERS and v-safe. The overall safety profile is consistent with preauthorization clinical trials data. Prompt review of U.S. vaccine safety data detected three additional cases of non-CVST TTS, in addition to the previously recognized CVST cases that initiated the pause in use of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

Good correlation between radiologic and pathologic findings in early lung adenocarcinomas has been reported. We aimed to confirm limited resection efficacy as radical surgery in patients with high-resolution computed tomography-indicated minimally invasive lung cancer. The purpose of this interim analysis is to report the details of the patient and nodule characteristics, intraoperative cytology capability as a negative margin indicator, and patient outcome with the median follow-up period of 7 years and 4 months. METHODS Enrollment required patients with a tumor 2 cm, diagnosed or suspected as a cT1N0M0 carcinoma in the lung periphery and depicted on high-resolution computed tomography as a sub-solid nodule with tumor disappearance ratio 0.5. We performed a wedge or segmental resection as appropriate. The primary endpoint is 10 year local recurrence-free survival rate. RESULTS This study started in November 2003, and 101 patients were enrolled as of November 2009. Of them, 95 were eligible for analysis. There were 38 men and 57 women, aged 30-75, averaging 62 years. Tumor sizes ranged from 7 to 20 mm on computed tomography, averaging 15 mm. There were 11 Noguchi type A tumors, 54 type B tumors, 24 type C tumors, one malignant lymphoma and 5 non-cancerous lesions. All cancers showed no vessel invasion.

The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated morbidity and mortality makes vaccine development a priority. Methods. As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines (NCT01051661), RSV epidemiology in healthy children aged 6 months to <10 years at first vaccination with influenza-like illness (ILI) was evaluated in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between February 2010 and August 2011. Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year, with nasal and throat swabs analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence and incidence of RSV among ILI episodes were calculated. Results. A total of 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes with a respiratory sample available. RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.7C10.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12C23 or 24C35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6C11 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3C7.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1% [4.0C17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1C0.3] per 100 PY).

METHODOLOGY This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted on 87 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The patients were separated into two groups according to the admission in the ICU or in the ward. MIF was determined batchwise in plasma obtained as soon as the patients were admitted. Both groups were compared with respect to demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters and prediction of requirement to ICU admission. RESULTS Forty seven patients in ICU, and 40 patients in ward were included. With respect to MIF levels and biochemical biomarkers, there was a statistically significant difference between the ICU and ward patients (p< 0.024). In terms of ICU requirement, the cut-off value of MIF was detected as 4.705 (AUC:0.633, 95%CI:0.561-0.79, p= 0.037), D-dimer was 789 (AUC:0.779, 95%CI: 0.681-0.877, p= 0.000), troponin was 8.15 (AUC: 0.820, 95%CI:0.729-0.911, p= 0.000), ferritin was 375 (AUC: 0.774, 95%CI:0.671-0.876, p= 0.000), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 359.5 (AUC:0.843, 95%CI: 0.753-0.933, p= 0.000). According to the logistic regression analysis; when MIF level > 4.705, the patient's requirement to ICU risk was increased to 8.33 (95%CI: 1.73-44.26, p= 0.009) fold. Similarly, elevation of troponin, ferritin and, LDH was shown to predict disease prognosis (p< 0.05).

The Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometric (REIMS) technique reports tissue histology in real-time by analysing aerosolised tissue during electrosurgical dissection. METHODS Aerosol produced during diathermy of tissues was sampled with the REIMS interface. Histological diagnosis and mass spectra featuring complex lipid species populated a reference database on which principal component, linear discriminant and leave-one-patient-out cross-validation analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 198 patients provided 335 tissue samples, yielding 3384 spectra. Cross-validated OC classification vs separate normal tissues was high (974% sensitivity, 100% specificity). BOT were readily distinguishable from OC (sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 89.7%). Validation with fresh tissue lead to excellent OC detection (100% accuracy). Histological agreement between iKnife and histopathologist was very good (kappa 0.84, P < 0.001, z = 3.3). Five predominantly phosphatidic acid (PA(36:2)) and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE(34:2)) lipid species were identified as being significantly more abundant in OC compared to normal tissue or BOT (P < 0.001, q < 0.001).

Alginates is an option for the treatment of LPR with few adverse effects. The study aimed to investigate the non-inferiority of an alginate suspension (Gastrotuss(?)) compared to PPIs (Omeprazole) in reducing LPR symptoms and signs. METHODS: A non-inferiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Fifty patients with laryngopharyngeal symptoms (Reflux Symptom Index -RSI-  13) and signs (Reflux Finding Score -RFS-  7) were randomized in two treatment groups: (A) Gastrotuss(?)

With the ever-spreading of online purchasing websites, micro-blogging sites, and social media platforms, OM in online social media platforms has picked the interest of thousands of scientific researchers. Because the reviews, tweets and blogs acquired from these social media networks, act as a significant source for enhancing the decision making process. The obtained textual data (reviews, tweets, or blogs) are classified into three different class labels which are negative, neutral and positive for analyzing and extracting relevant information from the given dataset. In this contribution, we introduce an innovative MapReduce improved weighted ID3 decision tree classification approach for OM, which consists mainly of three aspects: Firstly We have used several feature extractors to efficiently detect and capture the relevant data from the given tweets, including N-grams or character-level, Bag-Of-Words, word embedding (GloVe, Word2Vec), FastText, and TF-IDF. Secondly, we have applied a multiple feature selector to reduce the high feature&#x2019;s dimensionality, including Chi-square, Gain Ratio, Information Gain, and Gini Index. Finally, we have employed the obtained features to carry out the classification task using an improved ID3 decision tree classifier, which aims to calculate the weighted information gain instead of information gain used in traditional ID3. In other words, to measure the weighted information gain for the current conditioned feature, we follow two steps: First, we compute the weighted correlation function of the current conditioned feature. Second, we multiply the obtained weighted correlation function by the information gain of this current conditioned feature. This work is implemented in a distributed environment using the Hadoop framework, with its programming framework MapReduce and its distributed file system HDFS. Its primary goal is to enhance the performance of a well-known ID3 classifier in terms of accuracy, execution time, and ability to handle the massive datasets. We have carried out several experiences that aims to assess the effectiveness of our suggested classifier compared to some other contributions chosen from the literature. The experimental results demonstrated that our ID3 classifier works better on COVID-19&#x005F;Sentiments dataset than other classifiers in terms of Recall (85.72 %), specificity (86.51 %), error rate (11.18 %), false-positive rate (13.49 %), execution time (15.95s), kappa statistic (87.69 %), F1-score (85.54 %), classification rate (88.82 %), false-negative rate (14.28 %), precision rate (86.67 %), convergence (it convergent towards the iteration 90), stability (it is more stable with mean deviation standard equal to 0.12 %), and complexity (it requires much lower time and space computational complexity).

The change in biophysical properties like the refractive index of blood plasma due to the production of antibodies during infection may be very helpful in estimating the level and intensity of infection and subsequent treatment based on blood plasma therapy. In this article, Fano resonance-based refractive index sensor using plasmonic nanomatryoshka is proposed for blood plasma sensing. The interaction between hybridized modes (bright and dark modes) in optimized nanomatryoshka leads to Fano resonance, which by virtue of steeper dispersion can confine the light more efficiently compared with Lorentzian resonance. We propose the excitation of Fano resonances in sub 100-nm size nanomatryoshka based on newly emerging plasmonic materials ZrN and HfN, and one of the most widely used conventional plasmonic material, Au. Fano resonance-based plasmonic sensors leads to sensitivity = 188.5 nm/RIU, 242.5 nm/RIU, and 244.9 nm/RIU for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively. The corresponding figure of merit (nm/RIU) is ~ 3.5 [Formula: see text] 10(3), 3.1 [Formula: see text] 10(3), and 2.8 [Formula: see text] 10(3) for Au, ZrN, and HfN, respectively.

We implement our analysis from three key concerns of the hospital in the presence of a pandemic: the differences in medical consumption and reimbursement between in-person and telemedicine modalities and the effort cost of infection reduction resulting from the pandemic. We find that in the absence of the pandemic, the hospital prefers to introduce telemedicine when the differences in medical consumption and reimbursement are both small. In the presence of the pandemic, we find that the introduction of telemedicine does not always benefit the hospital and that it is better not to introduce telemedicine in some cases since it may exacerbate the negative influence of the pandemic on the hospitals total costs. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the hospital may set greater in-person capacity but less telemedicine capacity in response to the outbreak of the pandemic under certain conditions, which contradicts public beliefs. Finally, we show that social welfare can be improved by introducing telemedicine when the effort cost of infection reduction and the difference in reimbursement are both of moderate size.

The immense challenges for clinicians and hospitals as well as the strain on many healthcare systems has been unprecedented. The majority of patients present with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, 5C8% become critically ill and require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually leads to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. At this point bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). So far, remdesivir and dexamethasone have shown clinical effectiveness in severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. The main goal of supportive treatment is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Invasive mechanical ventilation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients. Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand hygiene) and correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of aerosols should be carried out with utmost precaution and preparation.","output":"Recommendations for treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19: Version 3 S1 guideline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In 2019, the Veteran's Health Administration began its journey in pursuit of becoming an enterprise-wide High Reliability Organization (HRO). Improving the delivery of safe, high quality patient care is a central focus of HROs. Requisite to meeting this goal is the timely identification and resolution of problems. This is best achieved by empowering and engaging both clinical and non-clinical staff across the healthcare organization through the promotion of robust collaboration and communication between various disciplines. Improved care coordination and increased accountability are two important subsequent outcomes. One method for accomplishing this is through the implementation of tiered huddles. MATERIALS AND METHODS An extensive review of the current literature from 2013 until June 2021 was conducted for evidence highlighting the experiences of other healthcare organizations during implementation of huddles. Following the review, a tiered huddle proposal was developed and presented to the executive leadership team of a healthcare system for approval. Pilot testing of the tiered huddle implementation plan began in October 2021 over a 12-week period with three services. On average, the pilot services had between three to four tiers from frontline staff to the executive level of leadership. RESULTS Over the 12-week period, out of the possible 120 tiered huddles that could have been conducted, 68% (n = 81) were completed. Of the tiered huddles conducted, 99% (n = 80) started and ended on time. During the pilot test, seven issues were identified by frontline staff: coordination of pre-procedural coronavirus testing, equipment/computer issues, rooms out of service, staffing levels, and lack of responsiveness from other departments. Issues related to staffing, unresponsiveness from other departments, and equipment concerns required elevation to a higher-level tier with no issues remaining open. Delays in patient care, or prolongation of shift hours for staff because of tiered huddles, was low at 2.5% (n = 2). For the duration of the pilot test, a total of 75 minutes accounted for shifts being extended among five staff members. CONCLUSIONS The success of this initiative demonstrates the importance of thoughtfully creating a robust process when planning for the implementation of tiered huddles. The findings from this initiative will be of immense value with the implementation of tiered huddles across our healthcare system. We believe that this approach can be used by other healthcare institutions along their journey to improving patient safety and quality.","output":"Creating a Process for the Implementation of Tiered Huddles in a Veterans Affairs Medical Center."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Philippines declared a public health emergency owing to the rapid increase in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) cases Given the highly infectious and severe nature of COVID 19, many individuals were infected and cost of care was higher compared to usual cases of influenza or pneumonia Majority of cases were admitted to private hospitals where balance billing is usually practiced, leaving many patients saddled with huge hospital bills The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) was tasked to cover for health care costs of COVID 19 cases in the country Objectives: Design benefit packages for COVID 19 Methods: Costing the benefit package involved defining a basic clinical profile and pathway for COVID 19 using available guidelines and consultations with experts Designing the package took into consideration the full continuum of care and available financing from government Cost estimates and design features were periodically reviewed as guidelines were evolving guidelines Development of the packages was also expedited Results: Benefit packages for testing, community quarantine and pneumonia (mild, moderate, severe and critical) were developed along with their corresponding case rates Cost drivers differed across package types (e g PCR procedure for testing;drugs and treatment procedures for pneumonia admissions) To deal with the uncertainty in costs and clinical profile of COVID 19 cases, PhilHealth initially decided to cover the full cost of care during the quarantine period prior to introducing case rates Rules on eligibility for benefits and claims processes were likewise relaxed to ensure access and adequate financial risk protection Conclusions: Benefit development during emergencies such as with the COVID 19 pandemic can be undertaken quickly even with limited information Given uncertainty in costs and clinical profiles, social insurance agencies may opt to be liberal in granting benefits Periodic reviews will be necessary to update the packages and ensure the sustainability of the fund","output":"PIN44 Benefit Design Considerations during Emergencies: Lessons from Covid 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Industry 4 0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are paradigms that are driving current industrial revolution by connecting to the Internet industrial machinery, management tools or products so as to control and gather data about them The problem is that many IIoT/Industry 4 0 devices have been connected to the Internet without considering the implementation of proper security measures, thus existing many examples of misconfigured or weakly protected devices Securing such systems requires very specific skills, which, unfortunately, are not taught extensively in engineering schools This article details how Industry 4 0 and IIoT cybersecurity can be learned through practical use cases, making use of a methodology that allows for carrying out audits to students that have no previous experience in IIoT or industrial cybersecurity The described teaching approach is blended and has been imparted at the University of A Coru?a (Spain) during the last years, even during the first semester of 2020, when the university was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown Such an approach is supported by online tools like Shodan, which ease the detection of vulnerable IIoT devices The feedback results provided by the students show that they consider useful the proposed methodology, which allowed them to find that 13% of the IIoT/Industry 4 0 systems they analyzed could be accessed really easily In addition, the obtained teaching results indicate that the established course learning outcomes are accomplished Therefore, this article provides useful guidelines for teaching industrial cybersecurity and thus train the next generation of security researchers and developers","output":"Use Case Based Blended Teaching of IIoT Cybersecurity in the Industry 4.0 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has demonstrated variable oxygenation and respiratory-system mechanics without investigation of transpulmonary and chest-wall mechanics.

METHODS: Data was collected from forty patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Esophageal balloons were placed to estimate pleural and transpulmonary pressures. Clinical characteristics, respiratory-system, transpulmonary, and chest-wall mechanics were measured over the first week. RESULTS: Patients had moderate-severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) 123[98C149]) and were critically ill (APACHE IV 108 [94C128] and SOFA 12 [11C13]).

Transthoracic echocardiography is an ideal imaging modality for goal-directed assessment and optimization of cardiac function and volume status. Prone positioning, while demonstrated to improve oxygenation, offload the right ventricle, and reduce short-term mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome, has previously precluded transthoracic echocardiography on these patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability to perform focused transthoracic echocardiography examinations on acute respiratory distress syndrome patients in the prone position. Design: We performed a cross-sectional study of critically ill patients hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Setting: This study was conducted in medical and surgical intensive units in a tertiary hospital. Patients: We examined 27 mechanically ventilated and prone patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019. Participants were examined at the time of enrollment in an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04306393), and no patients were excluded from echocardiographic analysis. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: We were able to perform transthoracic echocardiography and obtain satisfactory images for quantitative assessment of right ventricular function in 24 out of 27 (88.9%) and left ventricular function in 26 out of 27 (96.3%) of patients in the prone position, including many who were obese and on high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (&#8805; 15 cm H2O).

The purified antibodies were used in Western analysis of cell lysates and in indirect immunofluorescence experiments on cultured cells. On Western blots, the antibodies recognized the 165 kDa MNK protein in CHO cells and human fibroblasts. No MNK signal could be detected in fibroblasts from a patient with Menkes disease or in Hep3B hepatocellular carcinoma cells, confirming the specificity of the antibodies. Immunocytochemical analysis of CHO cells and human fibroblasts showed a distinct perinuclear signal corresponding to the pattern of the Golgi complex. This staining pattern was similar to that of -mannosidase II which is a known resident enzyme of the Golgi complex. Using brefeldin A, a fungal inhibitor of protein secretion, we further demonstrated that the MNK protein is localized to the trans-Golgi network. This data provides direct evidence for a subcellular localization of the MNK protein which is similar to the proposed vacuolar localization of Ccc2p, the yeast homolog of MNK and WND (ATP7B), the Wilson disease gene product. In light of the proposed role of MNK both in subcellular copper trafficking and in copper efflux, these data suggest a model for how these two processes are linked and represent an important step in the functional analysis of the MNK protein.","output":"Immunocytochemical Localization of the Menkes Copper Transport Protein (ATP7A) to the Trans-Golgi Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nursing is a physically and emotionally demanding profession.

The objective of the present study was to investigate this question with the rate of R0 resection and long-term survival as endpoints. METHODS This retrospective observational study included prospectively collected data from 40 patients operated laparoscopically with curative intent for exocrine pancreatic malignancies identified among 250 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreatic operations since 1997. All 40 patients had histologically verified exocrine pancreatic carcinoma. RESULTS Ten patients (25%) with typical ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were deemed nonresectable by laparoscopic staging. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed in 29 patients; 8 resections were combined with resections of adjacent organs and 1 removal of a malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm what appeared to be ectopic pancreatic tissue. In 1 patient, the resection was completed by hand-assisted technique, and 1 procedure was converted to open resection. Postoperative morbidity was 23% (n = 7). The median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 1-30). The rate of R0 resections was 93%. Postoperative 3-year survivals rates were 36% for the entire cohort (n = 30) and 30% in typical ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 21).

Methods: : In this cross-sectional study, the COVID-19 was diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction test, clinical signs and radiologic findings. Patients with previously received COVID-19 treatment was determined as COVID-19 group and the age and sex-matched healthy subjects were served as control group. The optical biometric measurements including corneal astigmatism, keratometry, astigmatic axis, central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth and axial length were obtained using Nidek optical biometry (AL-Scan;Nidek Co., Ltd., Japan). Results: : The measurements of keratometry(p=0,47), corneal astigmatism(p=0,42), axial length(p=0,78), anterior chamber depth(p=0,46) and central corneal thickness(p=0,43) were similar between the COVID-19 and control groups. The astigmatic axis type taken from 2.4 mm of the cornea showed statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0,01), while the measurements taken from 3 mm of the cornea were similar(p=0,15). In the subgroup analysis, axial lenght, anterior chamber depth and central corneal thickness measurements were found statistically significantly higher in the male gender of the COVID-19 group (p= 0,03;p= 0,01;p=0,03, Mann Whitney U). Conclusion: Changing in the optical biometric measurements can be seen as a result of the fact that COVID-19 is more frequent and severe in male gender and SARS-CoV-2 can attach to the cornea via ACE-2 receptors.

METHODS: Individuals from Los Angeles were tested for COVID-19, and a group positive for COVID-19 chose to have follow-up testing. Associations between symptoms and demographic factors, viral burden measured by cycle threshold (CT) value, and duration of PCR positivity were analyzed. RESULTS: 18.8% of patients were positive for COVID-19. Asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients were significantly younger that symptomatic patients (2.6 years, p<0.001). There were no differences in average CT between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The estimated median duration of COVID-19 PCR positivity was 23 days.

Despite the large numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, information on the phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is limited. Here, we studied 10 COVID-19 patients who required admission to an intensive care unit and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 10 out of 10 and 8 out of 10 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with 'common cold' coronaviruses. The strongest T-cell responses were directed to the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Furthermore, we studied T-cell kinetics and showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present relatively early and increase over time. Collectively, these data shed light on the potential variations in T-cell responses as a function of disease severity, an issue that is key to understanding the potential role of immunopathology in the disease, and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.","output":"Phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many changes that have influenced the lives of people around the world and have left their mark in the world of sports, as well.

On the basis that the uniformity of the current distribution affects the variation, a novel micro-gap parallel plate electrode (PPE) was developed, where two planar electrodes with edges covered with a SiO(2) layer were placed face to face. The structure provides a uniform current distribution over the planar electrode surface and maximizes the contribution of the planar electrode surface to sensing. For a comparative study, we also fabricated a micro-structured interdigitated electrode (IDE) that has been widely adopted for high-sensitivity measurement, although its current is highly concentrated on the electrode edge corner. Protein G (PrG) molecules were immobilized on both electrodes to prepare an immunoglobulin G (IgG) biosensor on which the specific binding of PrGCIgG can occur. We demonstrated that the IgG sensor with the PPE has small device-to-device variations, in strong contrast to the sensor with the IDE having large device-to-device variations. The results indicate that the current distribution on the electrode surface is important to fabricating electrochemical impedance spectroscopy biosensors with small device-to-device variations. Furthermore, it was found that the PPE allows ultrasensitive detection, that is, the sensor exhibited a linear range from 1  10(C13) to 1  10(C7) mol/L with a detection limit of 1  10(C14) mol/L, which is a record sensitivity at low concentrations for EIS-based IgG sensors.","output":"Toward a Practical Impedimetric Biosensor: A Micro-Gap Parallel Plate Electrode Structure That Suppresses Unexpected Device-to-Device Variations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an increasing need for better understanding of the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) A few pilot studies have investigated COVID-19 infections in NMOSD, but few studies have addressed disease activity and immune status of these patients during the pandemic We carried out a cross-sectional study to examine immune status, relapses, and COVID-19 infections in a cohort of NMOSD patients using an electronic patient registry (MSNMOBase) for multiple sclerosis and related disorders An online questionnaire was administered to all NMOSD patients in the registry from January 1, 2011, to June 1, 2020 Clinical demographic characteristics, immune status, relapses, treatments, COVID-19 infections, and preventive measures were evaluated Of the 752 registered patients, 535 (71 1%) with qualified data were included A total of 486 used preventive therapies during the pandemic, including mycophenolate mofetil (71 2%), azathioprine (13 3%), and other immunosuppressants (6 4%) Neither median immune cell counts nor immunoglobulin levels (p &gt; 0 05) were significantly different between patients with or without immunosuppression During the pandemic, no patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and the majority (&gt;95%) took one or more effective protective measures (e g , wearing a mask and social distancing) However, a significantly higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) was observed in the 33 patients with treatment interruptions due to the pandemic compared to before it (p 0 05) Interruption frequency was significantly higher in patients with relapses compared to those without (34 9 vs 15 7%, p &lt; 0 01) For stable NMOSD patients during the pandemic, the risk of relapse due to treatment interruption may be higher than the risk of COVID-19 infection when protective measures are used, and continuous relapse-prevention treatments may be necessary","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Patients With Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Beyond Infection Risk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Amongst all other educational institutions, medical schools suffered the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study aimed to assess the role of different frequencies of roguing of symptomatic trees combined with different chemical control programs of the sharpshooters' on CVC temporal progress. The experimental area was set up in October 2005 and had a 3 X 3 factorial design. Symptomatic tree removal intervals were every 28, 56, and 112 days until May 2012. Vector control treatments were no control, programs A (PA), and B (PB). Contact insecticides were sprayed every 28 (PA) or 14 (PB) days. Trees within both treatment programs were treated with systemic and foliar insecticides until October 2008. After this, the systemic insecticides were discontinued and only foliar treatments were applied. The number of diseased trees and sharpshooter population were assessed until April 2015. RESULTS The detection of the first symptomatic trees was similar for all treatments and occurred, on average, at the 50th month after planting. Sharpshooter population and cumulative disease incidence were similar for all roguing intervals and between vector control programs, differing in plots with no control. We observed a reduction over 85% of disease incidence for both PA and PB, compared to no control.

Quick estimates of the outbreak size are required to assess the necessary testing, contact tracing and potential containment effort. Using general branching processes and assuming that epidemic parameters (including the basic reproductive number) are constant over time, we characterize the distribution of the first hospitalization time and of the epidemic size at this random time. We find that previous estimates either overestimate or largely underestimate the actual epidemic size. In addition, we provide upper and lower bounds for the number of infectious individuals of the local outbreak over time. The upper bound is the cumulative epidemic size, and the lower bound is a constant fraction of it. Lastly, we compute the number of detectable cases if one were to test the whole local outbreak at a single point in time. In a growing epidemic, most individuals have been infected recently, which can strongly limit the detection of infected individuals when there is a delay between an infection and its potential detection.

Design: Publicly available UK government data and clinical evidence on the time between first positive PCR test and death are used to determine the relationships between reported cases and deaths, according to age groups and across regions in England. Main Outcome Measures: Estimates of case fatality rates and their variations over time. Results: Throughout October and November 2020, deaths in England can be broadly understood in terms of CFRs which are approximately constant over time. The same CFRs prove a poor predictor of deaths when applied back to September, when prevalence of the virus was comparatively low, suggesting that the potential effect of false positive tests needs to be taken into account. Similarly, increasing CFRs are needed to match cases to deaths when projecting the model forwards into December. The growth of the S gene dropout VOC in December occurs too late to explain this increase in CFR alone, but at 33% increased mortality, it can explain the peak in deaths in January. On our analysis, if there were other factors responsible for the higher CFRs in December and January, 33% would be an upper bound for the higher mortality of the VOC. From the second half of January, the CFRs for older age groups show a marked decline. Since the fraction of the VOC has not decreased, this decline is likely to be the result of the rollout of vaccination. However, due to the rapidly decreasing nature of the raw cases data (likely due to a combination of vaccination and lockdown), any imprecisions in the time-to-death distribution are greatly exacerbated in this time period, rendering estimates of vaccination effect imprecise. Conclusions: The relationship between cases and deaths, even when controlling for age, is not static through the second wave of coronavirus in England. An apparently anomalous low case-fatality ratio in September can be accounted for by a modest 0.4% false-positive fraction. The large jump in CFR in December can be understood in terms of a more deadly new variant B1.1.7, while a decline in January correlates with vaccine roll-out, suggesting that vaccine reduce the severity of infection, as well as the risk.","output":"Evolution of case fatality rates in the second wave of coronavirus in England: effects of false positives, a Variant of Concern and vaccination."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, China reported several cases of a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Understanding oxidative stress and the molecular inflammation mechanisms contributing to COVID-19 progression to severe phenotypes such as sepsis is a current clinical need in the effort to improve therapies in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. This article aims to review the molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with oxidative stress and inflammation, which can contribute to sepsis progression. We also provide an overview of potential antioxidant therapies and active clinical trials that might prevent disease progression or reduce its severity.","output":"Oxidative Stress and Inflammation in COVID-19-Associated Sepsis: The Potential Role of Anti-Oxidant Therapy in Avoiding Disease Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The super-cyclonic storm\\"Amphan\\"hit Eastern India, specifically the state of West Bengal, Odisha and parts of Bangladesh in May 2020, and caused severe damage to the regions. In this study, we aim to understand the self-reported effects of this natural disaster on residents of the state of West Bengal. To that end, we conducted an online survey to understand the effects of the cyclone. In total, 201 participants (spanning five districts) from the worst-affected state of West Bengal participated in the survey. This report describes our findings from the survey, with respect to the damages caused by the cyclone, how it affected the population in various districts of West Bengal, and how prepared the authorities were in responding to the disaster. We found that the participants were most adversely affected in this disaster due to disruption of services like electricity, phone and internet (as opposed to uprooting of trees and water-logging). Furthermore, we found that receiving responses to Amphan-related queries is highly positively correlated with the favorable perception of people about preparedness of authorities. Additionally, we study the usage of online social media by the affected population in the days immediately after the disaster. Our results strongly suggest how social media platforms can help authorities to better prepare for future disasters. In summary, our study analyzes self-reported data collected from grassroots, and brings out several key insights that can help authorities deal better with disaster events in future.","output":"A Survey on Disaster: Understanding the After-effects of Super-cyclone Amphan and Helping Hand of Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To answer long-standing questions about how plants use and regulate water, an affordable, non-invasive way to determine local root water uptake is required. Here, we present a sensor, the Soil Water Profiler (SWaP), which can determine local soil water content () with a precision of 6.10-5 cm3cm-3, an accuracy of 0.002 cm3cm-3, a temporal resolution of 24 minutes and a one-dimensional spatial resolution of 1 cm. The sensor comprises two copper sheets, integrated into a sleeve and connected to a coil, thereby forming a resonant circuit. A vector network analyzer, inductively coupled to the resonant circuit, measures the resonance frequency, against which  was calibrated. The sensors were integrated into a positioning system, which measures  along the depth of cylindrical tubes. When combined with modulating light (4-hour period) and resultant modulating plant transpiration, the SWaP enables quantification of the component of root water uptake distribution that varies proportionally with total plant water uptake, and distinguishes it from soil water redistribution via soil pores and roots. Additionally, as a young, growing maize (Zea mays) plant progressively tapped its soil environment dry, we observed clear changes in plant-driven root water uptake and soil water redistribution profiles. Our SWaP setup can measure the root water uptake and redistribution of sandy soil water content with unprecedented precision. The SWaP is therefore a promising device offering new insights into soil-plant hydrology, with applications for functional root phenotyping in non-saline, temperature controlled conditions, at low cost.","output":"Spatially resolved root water uptake determination using a precise soil water sensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric complications are soaring. There is an urgent need to understand the link between COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric disorders. To that end, this article addresses the premise that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in gut dysbiosis and an altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis that in turn contributes to the neuropsychiatric ramifications of COVID-19. Altered MGB axis activity has been implicated independently as a risk of neuropsychiatric disorders. A review of the changes in gut microbiota composition in individual psychiatric and neurological disorders and gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients revealed a shared microbial signature characterized by a lower microbial diversity and richness and a decrease in health-promoting anti-inflammatory commensal bacteria accompanied by an increase in opportunistic proinflammatory pathogens. Notably, there was a decrease in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producing bacteria. SCFAs are key bioactive microbial metabolites with anti-inflammatory functions and have been recognized as a critical signaling pathway in the MGB axis. SCFA deficiency is associated with brain inflammation, considered a cardinal feature of neuropsychiatric disorders. The link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, gut dysbiosis, and altered MGB axis is further supported by COVID-19-associated gastrointestinal symptoms, a high number of SARS-CoV-2 receptors, angiotensin-cleaving enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in the gut, and viral presence in the fecal matter. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the receptor results in ACE-2 deficiency that leads to decreased transport of vital dietary components, gut dysbiosis, proinflammatory gut status, increased permeability of the gut-blood barrier (GBB), and systemic inflammation. More clinical research is needed to substantiate further the linkages described above and evaluate the potential significance of gut microbiota as a diagnostic tool. Meanwhile, it is prudent to propose changes in dietary recommendations in favor of a high fiber diet or supplementation with SCFAs or probiotics to prevent or alleviate the neuropsychiatric ramifications of COVID-19.","output":"Neuropsychiatric Ramifications of COVID-19: Short-Chain Fatty Acid Deficiency and Disturbance of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis Signaling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic required many school districts and teacher preparation programs to make major changes to student teaching placements. Preservice students who completed student teaching during the academic year 2019- 2020 are now employed as first year teachers, yet the impact these changes had on teachers self-efficacy is not clear. First-year teachers (N=162) responded to a survey which included items from the teachers sense of self-efficacy scale (TSES) to understand how teacher self-efficacy differed based on disruptions to student teaching placements and current teaching modality (hybrid, virtual, in-person). Participant responses to quantitative survey items were analyzed using a two-way MANOVA, while a qualitative survey item was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results from the two-way MANOVA show a significant interaction at the p<.05 level between current teaching modality and change in student teaching placement on overall teacher self-efficacy (p=.003), student engagement (p=.005), and instructional strategies (p=.001).

Therefore, we sought to determine whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CLARITY IBD is a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. Antibody responses in participants treated with infliximab were compared to a reference cohort treated with vedolizumab, a gut-selective anti-integrin 47 monoclonal antibody that is not associated with impaired vaccine responses or increased susceptibility to systemic infections. 6935 patients were recruited from 92 UK hospitals between (22)nd September and (23)rd December 2020. Nucleocapsid anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies were measured using the Roche Elecsys assay. Clinical data and serum were collected every 8 weeks. Durability was defined as nonreduction in antibody level by at least 50% from baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, rates of symptomatic and proven SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar between groups. Seroprevalence was lower in infliximab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (3.4% [161/(4685)], vs 6.0% [134/(2250)], p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed that infliximab (vs vedolizumab; odds ratio [OR] 0.66 [95% CI 0.51C0.(87)], p=0.0027) and immunomodulator use (OR 0.70 [95% CI 0.53C0.(92)], p=0.012) were independently associated with lower seropositivity (Fig 1). In patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconversion was observed in fewer infliximab- than vedolizumab-treated patients (48% [39/(81)], vs 83% [30/(36)], p=0.00044) and the magnitude of anti-SARS-CoV2 reactivity was lower (median 0.8 cut off index (COI) [0.2C5.(6)] vs 37.0 [15.2C76.(1)], p<0.0001). An initial increase in anti-SARS-Cov2 antibody reactivity was observed four weeks after a positive PCR test, in vedolizumab-(47.2 COI [IQR 24.1 - 113.(0)] vs 14.5 COI [IQR 0.4 C 30.(7)], p=0.0079), but not infliximab-treated patients (0.7 COI [IQR 0.2 - 7.(5)] vs 1.1 COI [IQR 0.4 - 4.(5)], p=0.70) (Fig 2). Antibody responses after an initial positive reading were also less durable in infliximab-treated patients (hazard ratio 5.15 [95%CI 2.95C9.(00)]; Fig 3), but durability was not influenced by immunomodulator use. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence, seroconversion in PCR-confirmed cases, and the magnitude and durability of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies were reduced in infliximab- compared with vedolizumab-treated patients. Serological testing and virus surveillance should be considered in patients treated with anti-TNF drugs to detect suboptimal vaccine responses, persistent infection, and viral evolution to inform public health policy.","output":"OP03 Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody responses are attenuated in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease treated with infliximab"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Essential hypertension (EH) is a multifactorial and complex disease with high rate of incidence and associated co-morbidities. Previous studies do not provide unanimous results for the risk of hypertension and association with Fok I genotype frequency and serum vitamin D levels. Hence, this study was undertaken to determine the status of Fok I vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism along with vitamin D levels and blood pressure in patients with EH. Four hundred (200 controls and 200 cases of essential hypertension) participants from general Indian population were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood samples were collected for genotyping Fok I-VDR gene polymorphism using PCRCRFLP method whereas 25-OH vitamin D levels in serum were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Significantly reduced 25-OH vitamin D levels were observed in patients with EH (24.04  8.62 vs 50.46  15.46) compared to control subjects (p = 0.0001). Homozygous recessive genotype ff frequency was increased by 8.06 fold (CI: 3.71C17.47, p = 0.0001) in patients with EH compared to dominant FF genotype frequency. In conclusion, recessive ff genotype frequency correlates with reduced serum vitamin D levels and results in significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures leading to predisposition of EH.","output":"Status of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphism and 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D Deficiency with Essential Hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Several brain complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported. It has been moreover speculated that this neurotropism could potentially cause a delayed outbreak of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases of neuroinflammatory origin. A propagation mechanism has been proposed across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, from the nose to the olfactory epithelium, and possibly afterwards to other limbic structures, and deeper parts of the brain including the brainstem. Methods: : Review of clinical examination, and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of 18 F-FDG PET metabolism in comparison to healthy subjects (p-voxel<0.001, p-cluster<0.05), of two patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia explored at the post-viral stage of the disease. Results: : Hypometabolism of the olfactory/rectus gyrus was found on the two patients, especially one with 4 weeks prolonged anosmia. Additional hypometabolisms were found within bilateral amygdala, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, thalamus, pons and medulla brainstem in the other patient who complained of delayed onset of an atypical painful syndrome. Conclusion: These preliminary findings reinforce the hypotheses of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism through the olfactory bulb, and the possible extension of this impairment to other limbic structures and to the brainstem. 18 F-FDG PET hypometabolism could constitute a cerebral quantitative biomarker of this involvement. Post-viral cohort studies are required to specify the exact relationship between limbic/brainstem hypometabolisms and the possible persistent disorders, especially involving cognitive or emotion disturbances, residual respiratory symptoms or painful complaints.","output":"18F-FDG brain PET metabolism in post-SARS-CoV-2 infection: substrate for persistent/delayed disorders?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was reported by Nigeria on February 27, 2020.

To capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries, a line list was developed from publicly available data on institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts. The availability of indicators-gender, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected-for each imported case was assessed. We evaluated the relationship between the time to first reported importation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) overall score; 13,201 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 48 countries in SSA during the 54 days following the first known introduction to the region. Of the 2,516 cases for which travel history information was publicly available, 1,129 (44.9%) were considered importation events. Imported cases tended to be male (65.0%), with a median age of 41.0 years (range: 6 weeks-88 years; IQR: 31-54 years).

Overall, obesity gives rise to a higher susceptibility to infectious pathogens, but the pathogenetic process is not clearly defined. Whereas, viral infections often show a more severe course in obese patients, the same patients seem to have a survival benefit during bacterial infections. In particular, we summarize the main mechanical impairments in the pulmonary tract caused by obesity. Moreover, we outline the main secretory changes within the expanded adipose tissue mass, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation.

METHODS: We examined 3115 hospital discharges to a national cohort of 1068 adult care homes and subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring between 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics, including size and type of provision. RESULTS: A total of 330 homes experienced an outbreak, and 544 homes received a discharge over the study period. Exposure to hospital discharge was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.47, P = .29) after adjusting for care home characteristics. Care home size was the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison with homes of <10 residents were as follows: 3.40 (1.99, 5.80) for 10-24 residents; 8.25 (4.93, 13.81) for 25-49 residents; and 17.35 (9.65, 31.19) for 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison with periods when homes were unexposed.

Despite its high prevalence, a sound understanding of the mechanisms underlying this type of diffuse brain injury remains elusive. It is, however, well established that concussions cause significant functional deficits; that children and youths are disproportionately affected and have longer recovery time than adults; and that individuals suffering from a concussion are more prone to experience additional concussions, with each successive injury increasing the risk of long term neurological and mental health complications. Currently, the most significant challenge in concussion management is the lack of objective, clinically- accepted, brain-based approaches for determining whether an athlete has suffered a concussion. Here, we report on our efforts to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural network that is able to distinguish between non-concussed and acute post-concussed adolescent athletes using only short (i.e. 90 s long) samples of resting state EEG data as input. The athletes were neither required to perform a specific task nor expected to respond to a stimulus during data collection. The acquired EEG data were neither filtered, cleaned of artefacts, nor subjected to explicit feature extraction. The LSTM network was trained and validated using data from 27 male, adolescent athletes with sports related concussion, benchmarked against 35 non-concussed adolescent athletes. During rigorous testing, the classifier consistently identified concussions with an accuracy of > 90% and achieved an ensemble median Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC/AUC) equal to 0.971. This is the first instance of a high-performing classifier that relies only on easy-to-acquire resting state, raw EEG data.

However, given the temporary closure of UK stop smoking services and vape shops, smokers attempting to quit may instead seek out mobile health support, such as smartphone apps. OBJECTIVE: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free. METHODS: Data were from daily and nondaily adult smokers in the United Kingdom who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020 (secondary analysis). The outcome variable was the number of downloads aggregated at the 12-hourly (primary analysis) or daily level (secondary analysis). The explanatory variable was the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, operationalized as March 1, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 15, 2020 (secondary analysis). Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted. RESULTS: Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users. In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

It also affects economic growth and more importantly our social fabrics. Due to its extensive impacts governments especially in low-middle-income countries are facing tremendous challenges in mitigating COVID-19. In Indonesia the governments efforts in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 have been criticized for being inadequate, ineffective, and too late. The number of COVID-19 victims has surpassed 70000 cases and economic growth is contracted significantly. One important element of the governments effort during the pandemic is mobilizing social capital to support the governments efforts. Theoretically community-based activities and mobilization of social capital during outbreaks are positive attributes. The emergence of volunteers and mutual aid initiatives are generally considered good examples of social capital mobilization. However, this article highlights a different angle to the relationship between social capital community-based resource mobilization and the pandemic. Looking at the implementation of the Jogo Tonggo program in Central Java we argue that state mobilization does not always lead to positive resource mobilization in coping with the impact of COVID-19. We employ discourse network analysis to examine the implementation of the Jogo Tonggo program through news from a local newspaper in Central Java. From our research we argue that despite the ambitious vision of Jogo Tonggo it does not appear to be the main discourse at the societal level.

Data are needed regarding the effect of the booster dose on the rate of confirmed coronavirus 2019 disease (Covid-19) and the rate of severe illness. METHODS: We extracted data for the period from July 30 through August 31, 2021, from the Israeli Ministry of Health database regarding 1,137,804 persons who were 60 years of age or older and had been fully vaccinated (i.e., had received two doses of BNT162b2) at least 5 months earlier. In the primary analysis, we compared the rate of confirmed Covid-19 and the rate of severe illness between those who had received a booster injection at least 12 days earlier (booster group) and those who had not received a booster injection (nonbooster group). In a secondary analysis, we evaluated the rate of infection 4 to 6 days after the booster dose as compared with the rate at least 12 days after the booster. In all the analyses, we used Poisson regression after adjusting for possible confounding factors. RESULTS: At least 12 days after the booster dose, the rate of confirmed infection was lower in the booster group than in the nonbooster group by a factor of 11.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.4 to 12.3); the rate of severe illness was lower by a factor of 19.5 (95% CI, 12.9 to 29.5).

As UKR surgery is less invasive, this potentially allows patients to be discharged quicker than those patients undergoing total knee replacement. During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective surgeries were postponed and new ways of working were required to restart procedures. In order to minimise the risk of exposure to COVID-19, we established a new multicomponent recovery pathway (MRP) for patients undergoing UKR to facilitate earlier discharge. Objective: To evaluate the impact of the MRP on length of stay. Methods: The MRP was introduced in August 2020 to provide day-case surgery where possible. All patients undergoing UKR at St Cross Hospital, Rugby were eligible for inclusion in the trial. Exclusion criteria was lack of support at home and uncontrolled co-morbidities. Patients who were assessed preoperatively, but unsuitable for the day-case service followed all other aspects of the enhanced recovery pathway (ERP). The ERP included a new anaesthetic protocol of prilocaine spinal anaesthesia, limiting tourniquet use, and multimodal postoperative analgesia. From a physiotherapy perspective, new individualised pre-operative assessment and education sessions were introduced, with mobilisation commencing on the day of surgery. Patients were discharged with their knee in full extension and returned at day 4 for postoperative review and initiation of flexion. Data was collected prospectively for patients receiving the MRP and compared to a historical cohort from the previous year. Primary outcome was hospital length of stay (LOS). LOS data was assessed for normality and analysed using the students t-test. Results: Following introduction of the MRP 30 patients underwent UKR and were included in the analysis. Patients in the MRP group were significantly older (65.6 vs. 60.1 years, p < 0.05), although no other baseline differences were observed. Whilst there was a reduction in the use of general anaesthesia (30% vs 59%, p = 0.0917) and tourniquets (53% vs 68%, p = 0.3925), this did not reach statistical significance although there was a significant increase in the use of Prilocaine (30% vs 0%, p < 0.01). Following the introduction of the MRP, LOS reduced significantly (1.4 vs 2.9 days, p < 0.001), with no significant differences observed in joint range of motion (ROM) between groups. Within the MRP group, 9 patients (30%) received all key components (prilocaine spinal anaesthesia, no tourniquet and enhanced physiotherapy), 8 of which were discharged as day-case. Conclusion(s): The MRP was successful in reducing LOS in patients undergoing UKR, with no impact on joint ROM. The biggest impact was observed for those patients who received all components. Future work should explore methods to improve compliance with the pathway to maximise patient benefit. Impact: The positive results seen through introducing the MRP has a number of potential benefits. Alongside a reduction in LOS with benefits to patients and cost savings to the trust, the additional bed capacity released will allow increased throughput of patients which could be significant for the waiting list accrued as a result of the cessation of elective surgery due to Covid-19.

As immune checkpoint inhibitors directly affect the immune system, concerns have arisen about the safety of immunotherapy during this pandemic. However, data on the immune response in oncology patients treated with immunotherapy are still lacking. Here, we present the adaptive immune response in a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient who was treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced renal cell cancer. To evaluate the immune response in this patient, the number of T cells and their major subsets were measured according to expression of markers for co-signalling, maturation, and chemotaxis at baseline, during therapy, and during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, plasma samples were analyzed for IgM and IgG antibodies and the ability of these antibodies to neutralise SARS-CoV-2. Despite several risk factors for an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2, both T- and B-cell responses were observed. Moreover, after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a sufficient cellular and humoral immune response was achieved in this SARS-CoV-2 infected patient. These findings warrant renewed discussion on withholding of immune checkpoint inhibitors during an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Case Report: Adequate T and B Cell Responses in a SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patient After Immune Checkpoint Inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical value of tocotrienols is increasingly appreciated because of the unique therapeutic effects that are not shared by tocopherols. However, their effect on metabolic syndrome is not well-established. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) from palm oil in high-fat-diet-treated rats. Male, post-weaning Sprague Dawley rats were provided high-fat (60% kcal) diet for eight weeks followed by a TRF (60 mg/kg) treatment for another four weeks. Physical, metabolic, and histological changes were compared to those on control and high-fat diets respectively. High-fat feeding for eight weeks induced all hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. The TRF reversed systolic and diastolic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, impaired antioxidant defense, and myeloperoxidase hyperactivity triggered by the high-fat diet. It also conferred an inhibitory effect on protein glycation to reduce glycated hemoglobin A1c and advanced glycation end products (AGE). This was accompanied by the suppression of the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) expression in the liver. The treatment effects on visceral adiposity, glycemic control, triglyceride level, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  and  expression were negligible.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed demographic, laboratory and clinical indicators as predictors for severe courses of COVID-19. METHODS: This systematic review was registered at PROSPERO under CRD42020177154. We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, MedRvix and bioRvix) for publications from December 2019 to May 31(st) 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate pooled odds ratios and differences of medians between (1) patients admitted to ICU versus non-ICU patients and (2) patients who died versus those who survived. We adapted an existing Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool for outcome studies. RESULTS: Of 6,702 unique citations, we included 88 articles with 69,762 patients. There was concern for bias across all articles included. Age was strongly associated with mortality with a difference of medians (DoM) of 13.15 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.37 to 14.94) between those who died and those who survived. We found a clinically relevant difference between non-survivors and survivors for C-reactive protein (CRP; DoM 69.10 mg/L, CI 50.43 to 87.77), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; DoM 189.49 U/L, CI 155.00 to 223.98), cardiac troponin I (cTnI; DoM 21.88 pg/mL, CI 9.78 to 33.99) and D-Dimer (DoM 1.29mg/L, CI 0.9 to 1.69). Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease was the co-morbidity most strongly associated with mortality (Odds Ratio 3.45, CI 2.42 to 4.91) and ICU admission (Odds Ratio 5.88, CI 2.35 to 14.73). DISCUSSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis found age, cerebrovascular disease, CRP, LDH and cTnI to be the most important risk-factors that predict severe COVID-19 outcomes and will inform clinical scores to support early decision-making.","output":"Can we predict the severe course of COVID-19 - a systematic review and meta-analysis of indicators of clinical outcome?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background After a slow start due to an effective lockdown, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in India has been raging at a rapid pace, posing a formidable challenge to the healthcare system in the country. The personal protective equipment (PPE) undoubtedly provides a shield of protection for the healthcare workers (HCWs) fighting the disease as a valuable asset to the nation. However, there have been various problems associated with the PPE, ranging from its shortage to problems arising from heat, dehydration, etc while wearing them. There is a need to assess these problems faced by HCWs both qualitatively and quantitatively for their timely and effective redressal. Methods An electronic questionnaire survey was conducted among a cohort of HCWs who had performed COVID-19 duties and used PPE kits. The cohort consisted of different categories of doctors, nursing personnel, and other paramedical staff. Results The most common problems associated with using PPE kits was excessive sweating (100%), fogging of goggles, spectacles, or face shields (88%), suffocation (83%), breathlessness (61%), fatigue (75%), headache due to prolonged use (28%), and pressure marks on the skin at one or more areas on repeated use (19%). Occasional problems reported were skin allergy/dermatitis caused by the synthetic material of the PPE kit, face shield impinging onto the neck during intubation, and nasal pain, pain at the root of the pinna, and slipperiness of shoe covers. Various ways and means have been employed by the HCWs to actively address and solve these problems.

We aim to investigate healthcare staffs mental health issues and the associated predictors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this paper aims to identify some unique predictors of healthcare staffs mental health issues in Iran, the second country after China to experience a major COVID-19 crisis. Methods: An online survey of 280 healthcare staff in all 31 provinces of Iran assessed staffs mental distress (K6), depression, and anxiety (PHQ-4) during April 5C 20, 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis. Results: Nearly a third of healthcare staff surpassed the cutoff for distress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Females or more educated healthcare staff were more likely to experience distress. Those who were unsure whether they had COVID-19 were more likely to experience distress and depression symptoms. The number of COVID-19 cases among a healthcare workers colleagues or friends positively predicted the workers anxiety symptoms. Amongst healthcare staff, doctors were less likely than radiology technologists to experience distress and anxiety symptoms. Technicians and obstetrics staff experienced fewer anxiety symptoms. The age and the weekly working days of healthcare staff interacted such that age is asignificant predictor of mental health issues among younger but not older healthcare staff.

METHOD: This observational cohort study included all index hospitalisations with laboratory-proven COVID-19 aged 18 years across 21 Australian hospitals. Patients with suspected, but not laboratory-proven COVID-19, were excluded. Registry data were analysed for in-hospital mortality in patients with comorbidities including hypertension, and baseline treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. RESULTS: 546 consecutive patients (62.919.8 years old, 51.8% male) hospitalised with COVID-19 were enrolled. In the multivariable model, significant predictors of mortality were age (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.09, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.12, p<0.001), heart failure or cardiomyopathy (aOR 2.71, 95% CI 1.13 to 6.53, p=0.026), chronic kidney disease (aOR 2.33, 95% CI 1.02 to 5.32, p=0.044) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aOR 2.27, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.85, p=0.035). Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (49.5%) but was not independently associated with increased mortality (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.77, p=0.81).

The epidemiology was investigated based on infection rate, death rate, case fatality rate, Gender, Age group, and Medical conditions (Comorbid and Symptomatic). The overall median age of infected male was 58a?years and of female was 45a?years. While average mortality age in male was 60a?years and of female was 65a?years which is greater than the global average of 50a?years. The results also report that specially after age of 40a?years in both men and women, chances of infection are more while comorbidities increase the infection rate. The men are more susceptible to infection than women. In case of asymptomatic distribution trend was vice versa with 69.4% women and 30.6% in men.

We retrospectively analyzed the biochemical panel of immune system markers and the tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS-MS) measured vitamin D, in the serum samples of patients with SARS-CoV-2 studied in all aspects of clinical relevant parameters. RESULTS between 18th March and 20th April 2020 we enrolled 29 consecutive patients with COVID-19. They were 17 (58.6%) males and 12 (41.4) females, and the median age was 79 (69C88) years. Mean 25OHD was 17.32.1 ng/ml, with a median of 15.7 1 ng/ml (i.r. 6.7C25). Twenty-five patients (86.2%) had 25OHD levels <30 ng/ml, 18 patients (62.0%) had 25OHD levels <20 ng/ml and 10 patients (34.5%) had severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml).

All patients who dead for COVID-19 during hospitalization (n=6) had 25OHD30 ng/ml and 5/6 had 25OHD20 ng/ml. IL-6 and CRP were measured in all patients and were considered surrogate markers of cytokines storm. The majority of patients had levels of IL-6 (n=22, 75.8%) and CRP (n=25, 86.2%) above the upper limit of the reference range of our laboratory (IL6 6.59 and CRP 1 mg/dl) and the median was IL 6=16.1 (i.r. 7.3C36.3) and CRP=6.67 (2.64C11.52). Patients with 25OHD <20 ng/ml had higher levels of IL-6 (p=0.004; 19.9 vs 10.4) and CRP (p=0.009, 9.85 vs 1.40) and did not differ for the other clinical and biochemical variables. If we considered as 25OHD cut-off the mean value in our population (17.3 ng/ml), patients with lower levels of 25OHD had higher age (p=0.033) and higher levels of IL6 (p=0.016), CRP (p=0.04), troponin (p=0.04) and D-dimer (p=0.017), compared to the others. An inverse correlation was found between 25OHD levels and IL-6, CRP, and troponin. In a univariate regression analysis hypovitaminosis D (<20 ng/ml) was a predictive factor for IL6 (expressed as LnIL6) levels (=0.57, P=0.003) and for PCR levels (=0.42, P=0.034).

Compared to PCR and serology tests, SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays are underdeveloped, despite their potential to identify active infection and monitor disease progression. METHODS: We used Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. We studied plasma from 64 COVID-19 positive patients, 17 COVID-19 negative patients, and 34 pre-pandemic patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we quantified changes in 31 SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers in 272 longitudinal plasma samples obtained for 39 COVID-19 patients. Data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and were compared to longitudinal RT-PCR test results and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 S1 and N antigens were detectable in 41 out of 64 COVID-19 positive patients. In these patients, full antigen clearance in plasma was observed a mean  95%CI of 5  1 days after seroconversion and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests reported positive results for 15  5 days after viral antigen clearance.

Radiologically, it is characterized by symmetrical lesions; however, atypical findings have sometimes been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 79-year-old woman experienced subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) a year and a half previously before this hospitalization. She presented with sudden-onset coma, dacryorrhea, and moderate right hemiparesis and was taken to our hospital. Computed tomography showed no apparent abnormal acute lesions. Electroencephalography confirmed periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges in the left hemisphere. First, based on the findings, she was diagnosed with nonconvulsive status epilepticus and started antiepileptic therapy. Six days after admission, however, multiple asymmetric lesions were confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. Considering that findings subsequently improved, we finally diagnosed her with asymmetric PRES secondary to epilepsy occurring in the chronic phase of SAH. Aphasia and right hemispatial neglect persisted as sequelae and she was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital with a modified Rankin scale of 3. CONCLUSION: Excessive elevation of blood flow in the hemisphere is inferred to lead to bloodCbrain barrier collapse and subsequent asymmetric PRES.","output":"Asymmetric posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome secondary to epilepsy occurring in the chronic phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is growing interest in evaluating the effects of establishing protected areas (PAs). However, the mechanisms through which the establishment of PAs achieved significant positive effects remain unclear, and how different conservation mechanisms have achieved significant positive social and ecological benefits has also not been sufficiently studied. In this study, we systematically reviewed exemplary cases from Asia, Africa, and South America, using panel data to assess the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves and national parks. By surveying 629 literature samples reported in 31 studies, we found that the establishment of PAs has positive influences on poverty reduction, family incomes, household expenditure, employment, forest cover, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and a reduction in forest fragmentation. Furthermore, we analyzed the specific aspects that influence the publication of a paper in a high-impact journal. We found that publication is more likely when the research uses panel data, matching methods of data analysis, large samples, and plots or PAs as research units and has significant evaluation results. Our results suggest that future studies should use panel data and matching method analysis to assess the impacts of PAs from multiple perspectives and focus on the effectiveness of specific conservation mechanisms in achieving positive effects.","output":"Do Protected Areas Matter?

This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prioritizing vaccination to age groups within the 2-16 year old age range to mitigate the operational and resource challenges of the current strategy. We performed economic evaluations comparing the influenza vaccination program from 1995-2013 to seven alternative strategies targeted at low risk individuals along the school age divisions Preschool (2-4 years old), Primary school (5-11 years old), and Secondary school (12-16 years old). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on the status quo scenario (vaccinating subgroups at high risk of influenza-related complications and individuals 65+ years old). Impact of vaccination was assessed using a transmission model from a previously published study and updated with new data. At all levels of coverage, all strategies had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the current National Health Service threshold, 20,000/QALY gained. The incremental analysis demonstrated vaccinating Primary School children was the most cost-efficient strategy compared incrementally against others with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of 639 spent per QALY gained (Net Benefit: 404 M [155, 795]). When coverage was varied between 30%, 55%, and 70% strategies which included Primary school children had a higher probability of being cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels. Although children were the vaccine target the majority of QALY gains occurred in the 25-44 years old and 65+ age groups. Influenza strain A/H3N2 incurred the greatest costs and QALYs lost regardless of which strategy was used.

The inhibition of viral entry and thus spread is a plausible therapeutic avenue. SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor-mediated entry into a human host via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in lung tissue as well as the oral and nasal mucosa, kidney, testes and gastrointestinal tract. The modulation of ACE2 levels in these gateway tissues may be an effective strategy for decreasing disease susceptibility. Cannabis sativa, especially those high in the anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to alter gene expression and inflammation and harbour anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its effects on ACE2 expression remain unknown. Working under a Health Canada research license, we developed over 800 new C. sativa cultivars and hypothesized that high-CBD C. sativa extracts may be used to down-regulate ACE2 expression in target COVID-19 tissues. Using artificial 3D human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues, we identified 13 high-CBD C. sativa extracts that decrease ACE2 protein levels. Some C. sativa extracts down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, another critical protein required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. While our most effective extracts require further large-scale validation, our study is important for future analyses of the effects of medical cannabis on COVID-19.

Among the most pressing questions is how individuals adjust to the pandemic. This paper examines the emotional responses to the pandemic in a repeated-measures design. Data (n = 1698) were collected in April 2020 (during strict lockdown measures) and in April 2021 (when vaccination programmes gained traction). We asked participants to report their emotions and express these in text data. Statistical tests revealed an average trend towards better adjustment to the pandemic. However, clustering analyses suggested a more complex heterogeneous pattern with a well-coping and a resigning subgroup of participants. Linguistic computational analyses uncovered that topics and n-gram frequencies shifted towards attention to the vaccination programme and away from general worrying.

In the first test, the obtained results showed that the F8 filter blocks SARS-CoV-2 propagation if it encounters a flow devoid of liquid phase, i.e., a biphasic flow that can wet the filtering material. On the contrary, as shown in the second test, the SARS-CoV-2 virus propagates through the F8 filter if the droplet content in the air flow is enough to wet it. In these operational conditions, i.e., when the filter is wet by a flow with a high droplet content, the absolute H14 filter was also shown to fail to stop the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

It is well known that despite the ease of bedside insertion, the use of nontunneled dialysis catheters (NTDCs) is associated with increased complications compared to tunneled dialysis catheters (TDCs). Our objective was to develop a strategy for TDC placement at the bedside to provide effective dialysis access, conserve resources and decrease personnel exposure at our medical center in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A technique for bedside TDC insertion with ultrasound and plain radiographs in the intensive care unit was developed. Test or clinically COVID-19-positive patients requiring RRT were evaluated for bedside emergent NTDC or nonemergent TDC placement. Patients who underwent NTDC placement were monitored for ongoing RRT needs and were converted to TDC at the bedside after 3-5 days. We prospectively collected patient data focusing on complications and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 36 consultations for dialysis access in COVID-positive patients from March 19 through June 5, 2020, a total of 24 bedside TDCs were placed. Only one patient developed a complication, which was pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade during line placement. In-hospital mortality in the cohort was 63.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Bedside TDC placement has served to conserve resources, prevent complications with transport to and from the operating room, and decrease personnel exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, a roundworm endemic to the tropics and subtropics, especially areas where sanitation is suboptimal Autochthonous transmission has been documented in rural areas of the USA and Europe. Humans are infected when larvae penetrate the skin or are ingested. Autoinfection, in which larvae generated in the host go on to re-infect the host, leads to a state of chronic asymptomatic infection often with eosinophilia. Hyperinfection syndrome may develop when patients develop immune suppression, due to medications such as corticosteroids or following solid-organ transplantation. Hyperinfection is characterized by exponential increase in parasitic burden, leading to tissue invasion and life-threatening disease and associated bloodstream infections due to enteric organisms. Cases following use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 pneumonia have been described. Strongyloidiasis can be diagnosed by direct visualization of larvae in stool or other body fluids, or by serology.

SETTING: COVID-19 surveillance and laboratory centres in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory reporting data to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who were investigated for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time PCR testing during the study period 27 FebruaryC8 June 2020. METHODS: COVID-19 positivity and subsequent mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with both outcome variables, and findings are presented as adjusted ORs (aORs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 36 496 patients were tested for COVID-19, with 10 517 confirmed cases. Of 3215 confirmed cases with available clinical outcomes, 295 died. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 positivity were older age (p value for trend<0.0001), male sex (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18) and the following presenting symptoms: cough (aOR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.32), fever (aOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.71), loss of smell (aOR 7.78, 95% CI 5.19 to 11.66) and loss of taste (aOR 2.50, 95% CI 1.60 to 3.90).

After such individuals have cleared the virus, only the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory can reveal the exposure, and hopefully the establishment of immune protection. With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with Common Cold coronaviruses (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that, by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Deconvoluting the T Cell Response to SARS-CoV-2: Specificity Versus Chance and Cognate Cross-Reactivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to examine the role of the obsession with COVID-19 thoughts and coronaphobia in the relationship of death anxiety with burnout among staff working at infectious diseases hospitals in the front-line of the fight against COVID-19.

Analysis of the selection patterns of PEDV isolated in Korea indicated positive selection of nine nonsynonymous sites in the S and N proteins and negative selection at 97 sites for all of the proteins. Interestingly, eight nonsynonymous mutations in S showed no significant pattern change over the 15-year period, and one of eight mutation sites was found only in IC05TK, GN05DJ, and KNU0802 in the epidemic years 2005 and 2008.

ETAS?50, a standardized extract of Asparagus officinalis stem, is a unique functional food that elicits anti-photoaging effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling in hydrogen peroxide- and ultraviolet B-exposed skin fibroblasts. To elucidate its potential in preventing excessive inflammation in COVID-19, we examined the effects of ETAS?50 on pro-inflammatory responses in S1-stimulated murine peritoneal exudate macrophages. Co-treatment of the cells with ETAS?50 significantly attenuated S1-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 in a concentration-dependent manner without reducing cell viability. ETAS?50 also markedly suppressed the S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1. However, among the TLR4 signaling proteins, ETAS?50 did not affect the degradation of inhibitor B, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-B p65 subunit, and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase p54 subunit after S1 exposure. In contrast, ETAS?50 significantly suppressed S1-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt. Attenuation of S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1 by the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126 was greater than that by the Akt inhibitor perifosine, and the effects were potentiated by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors. These results suggest that ETAS?50 attenuates S1-induced IL-6 and IL-1 production by suppressing p44/42 MAPK and Akt signaling in macrophages.

DESIGN: A prospective, observational study. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Singleton pregnancies with COVID\\\\19 at >20+0 weeks. METHODS: 42 consecutive pregnancies were recruited and classified into two groups: severe and nonsevere COVID\\\\19, according to the occurrence of severe pneumonia. Uterine artery pulsatility index (UtAPI) and angiogenic factors (soluble fms\\\\like tyrosine kinase\\\\1/placental growth factor [sFlt\\\\1/PlGF]) were assessed in women with suspected PE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of signs and symptoms related to PE, such as hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, abnormal UtAPI and increased sFlt\\\\1/PlGF. RESULTS: 34 cases were classified as nonsevere and 8 as severe COVID\\\\19. Six (14.3%) women presented signs and symptoms of PE, all six being among the severe COVID\\\\19 cases (75.0%). However, abnormal sFlt\\\\1/PlGF and UtAPI could only be demonstrated in one case. Two cases remained pregnant after recovery from severe pneumonia and had a spontaneous resolution of the PE\\\\like syndrome.

In Europe, over 2 million confirmed cases have been reported, while nearly 200K people have died from the disease. Despite strict containment measures in Spain and Italy after the first reported COVID-19 patient, these two countries have remained in the top five European nations with the highest mortality rate for over two months. We hypothesised that a genetic mechanism could partially explain the poor survival outcome observed in these two countries. Methods An extensive literature search to identify human candidate genes linked to SARS-CoV infection, host immune evasion and disease aggressiveness was carried out. Pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to select the most significantly associated canonical signalling pathways with the genes of interest. The genetic variants at these genes with 1Mb flanking region was extracted (GRCh37/hg19 built). Over 80 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analysed in genome-wide data of 2,504 individuals (1000 genomes, phase III, https://www.internationalgenome.org/). Principal component (PC) analysis was performed, ancestry by the whole genome was inferred and subsets of the regions of interest were extracted (PLINK v1.9b, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). PC1 to PC20 values from five European ancestries, including the Spanish and Italian populations, were used for PC analysis. Gene function predictions were run with our genes of interest as a query to the GeneMANIA Cytoscape plugin (https://genemania.org/). Results A total of 437 candidate genes associated with SARS were identified, including 21 correlated with COVID-19 aggressiveness. The two most significant pathways associated with all 437 genes (Caveolar-mediated Endocytosis and MSP-RON Signalling) did not show any segregation at the population level. However, the most significant canonical pathway associated with genes linked to COVID-19 aggressiveness, the Hepatic Fibrosis and Hepatic Stellate Cell Activation, showed population-specific segregation. Both the Spanish and Italian populations clustered together from the rest of Europe. This was also observed for the Finnish population but in the opposite direction. These results suggest some of the severe COVID-19 cases reported in Spain and Italy could be partially explained by a pre-existing liver condition (especially liver cancer) and/or may lead to further COVID-19 related liver complications.","output":"Genes associated with liver damage signalling pathways may impact the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in Spanish and Italian populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The Postgraduate Virtual Learning Environment (PGVLE) is a digital platform developed by HEEWM in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to deliver a virtual teaching programme to surgical trainees. The programme is delivered through the BigBlueButton; an integrated virtual classroom. All teaching sessions are recorded and archived to allow trainees to review content at their convenience. We performed a contemporaneous study to review the effectiveness and quality of the platform in delivering teaching and suggest its future role in the surgical curriculum. METHOD: Anonymised feedback was gathered of trainees perspective of the platform experience, the quality of teaching and the archived content. All trainees were General Surgery higher trainees (HST) (ST3-ST8). The data from sequential teaching days was analysed. RESULTS: Of 90 HST, on average 40 attended each monthly training day (consistent with pre-COVID attendance). 122 trainee responses were completed. 68% of respondents were between ST3-ST5. 91% rated the administration and delivery of the teaching sessions as excellent or very good. 16% of trainees watched the archived sessions after the teaching day of which 46% felt it met their educational expectations. CONCLUSIONS: The PGVLE is an effective platform for the delivery of a virtual surgical teaching programme. It met with high levels of trainee satisfaction in the context of the pandemic. The archived content provides advantages to consolidation of learning. It is thought that the PGVLE platform will become a key feature of the surgical training programme in a hybrid learning model, related to relevant curricula, in the future.","output":"TP8.2.7 The Post Graduate Virtual Learning Environment: an effective platform for the delivery of a surgical teaching programme in the West Midlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mobile health apps are becoming increasingly popular amongst users who are turning to digital platforms to aid their mental wellbeing.

Recently novel timing of prone positioning was described with the use of high-frequency nasal cannula (HFNC) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in patients of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to avoid the intubation. Here we would like to share a case of severe ARDS where prone positioning was used in a step further ahead. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 38-year-old gentleman presented with the complaints of progressive breathlessness, dry cough and fever for 7 days. Patient was diagnosed as a case of H1N1 pneumonia with severe ARDS. Patient was initially managed with invasive mechanical ventilation according to ARDS-Net protocol. Despite persistent hypoxia he was put on prone positioning for consecutive 4 days. Patient was extubated after 10 days of mechanical ventilation and put on HFNC in view of persistent high oxygen requirement. At this point of time, we attempted prone positioning in addition to HFNC. Patient was comfortable on prone position and put himself in the same condition for prolonged periods. His oxygenation showed a remarkable improvement from PaO(2) of 63 (before prone positioning) to 136 mm Hg (after prone positioning). Oxygen supplementation was later tapered off and subsequently, he improved and was shifted to ward. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning is a harmless and still extremely effective intervention which can and should be utilized at all steps of ARDS-management.

The topic is restrictive housing, often termed solitary confinement, and defined as separating prisoners from the general population and holding them in cells for an average of 22 hours or more per day for 15 continuous days or more. This report estimates that between 55,000 and 62,500 prisoners in the United States were held in restrictive housing as of the summer of 2019. Time-In-Cell 2019 is based on survey responses from thirty-nine state prison systems providing data on 825,473 prisoners. These states reported housing a total of 31,542 individualsor 3.8% of the total prison population in those jurisdictionsin solitary confinement. Across the set of thirty-nine states, percentages of the prisoners held in isolation varied from 11% to none, as four states said they no longer keep anyone in those conditions. The length of time individuals spent in restrictive housing varied widely. In the thirty-three states that captured this information, they reported that 46% of the individuals held in solitary confinement were there for three months or less. At the other end of the spectrum, almost 3,000 peopleor 11% of all the people for which statistics were providedhad been kept in solitary confinement for more than three years. Two areas of special concern are the impact of mental illness and race on placement in restrictive housing. Using their own definition of serious mental illness, 33 states reported a total of more than 3,000 SMI prisoners in solitary confinement. Six jurisdictions reported that more than 10% of their prisoners in solitary confinement had a serious mental illness. Aggregating the numbers from 32 states and disaggregating by gender, Black and Hispanic men were somewhat more likely to be put into restrictive housing than white men: 43% of Black men and 17% of Hispanic men were in restrictive housing, compared to 40% and 15% respectively in the total male custodial population. Black women were much more likely to be placed in isolation: 42% of women reported to be in solitary confinement were Black, as compared to 22% of the total female custodial population. The report also provides an overview of litigation, legislation, and policy developments regarding the use of restrictive housing since 2018 both within and beyond the United States. Many of these changes focus on limiting the use of isolation for pregnant women, juveniles, and seriously mentally ill individuals.Time-In-Cell 2019 compares the responses of the 33 prison systems that answered the CLA-Liman surveys in 2015, 2017, and 2019.

In analysing the administrative strategy, the article emphasises the role that the current system of constitutional separation of powers plays in emergency management and how this system can impact health risk assessment. An explanation of the risk management system in Italian and European Union (EU) law is provided and the following key legal issues are addressed: (1) the notion and features of emergency risk regulation from a pandemic perspective, distinguishing between risk and emergency; (2) the potential and limits of the precautionary principle in EU law; and (3) the Italian constitutional scenario with respect to the main provisions regulating central government, regional and local powers. Specifically, this article argues that the administrative strategy for effectively implementing emergency risk regulation based on an adequate and correct risk assessment requires power sharing across the different levels of government with the participation of all of the institutional actors involved in the decision-making process: Government, Regions and local authorities.

Remote, technology-based tools have shown recent promise in assessing changes in older adults daily activities and mood, which may serve as indicators of underlying health-related changes (e.g., cognitive decline). This study examined changes in older adults driving, computer use, mood, and travel events prior to and following the COVID-19 emergency declaration using unobtrusive monitoring technologies and remote online surveys. As an exploratory aim, the impact of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on these changes was assessed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 59 older adults (41 Cognitively Intact, 18 MCI) enrolled in a longitudinal aging study. Participants had their driving and computer use behaviors recorded over a five-month period (75 days pre- and 76 days post-COVID emergency declaration) using unobtrusive technologies. Measures of mood, overnight guests, and frequency of overnight travel were also collected weekly via remote online survey. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, and education, participants showed a significant decrease in daily driving distance, number of driving trips, highway driving, and nighttime driving, post-COVID-19 as compared to pre-COVID-19 (p <0.001) based on generalized estimating equation models. Further, participants spent more time on the computer per day post-COVID-19 (p = 0.03). Participants endorsed increases in blue mood (p <0.01) and loneliness (p <0.001) and decreases in travel away from home and overnight visitors (p < 0.001) from pre- to post-COVID-19. Cognitive status did not impact these relationships. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: From pre- to post-COVID-19 emergency declaration, participants drove and traveled less, used their computer more, had fewer overnight visitors and reported greater psychological distress. These results highlight the behavioral and psychological effects of stay-at-home orders on older adults who are cognitively intact and those with MCI.","output":"Older Adults Daily Activity and Mood Changes Detected During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Remote Unobtrusive Monitoring Technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since early 2020, the world has been dealing with a raging pandemic outbreak: COVID-19. A year later, vaccines have become accessible, but in limited quantities, so that governments needed to devise a strategy to decide which part of the population to prioritize when assigning the available doses, and how to manage the interval between doses for multi-dose vaccines. In this paper, we present an optimization framework to address the dynamic double-dose vaccine allocation problem whereby the available vaccine doses must be administered to different age-groups to minimize specific societal objectives. In particular, we first identify an age-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemic model including an extension capturing partially and fully vaccinated people, whereby we account for age-dependent immunity and infectiousness levels together with disease severity. Second, we leverage our model to frame the dynamic age-dependent vaccine allocation problem for different societal objectives, such as the minimization of infections or fatalities, and solve it with nonlinear programming techniques. Finally, we carry out a numerical case study with real-world data from The Netherlands. Our results show how different societal objectives can significantly alter the optimal vaccine allocation strategy. For instance, we find that minimizing the overall number of infections results in delaying second doses, whilst to minimize fatalities it is important to fully vaccinate the elderly first.","output":"Optimizing Vaccine Allocation Strategies in Pandemic Outbreaks: An Optimal Control Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research's aim was to verify the readiness of companies in the field of tourism for the changes caused by the pandemic Covid-19.

Immediate laboratory efforts in four of these patients have identified a tentative pathomechanism underlying this syndrome termed initially vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) and renamed recently vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). It encompasses the presence of platelet-activating antibodies to platelet factor-4/heparin complexes, possibly emulated by polyanionic constituents of AZD1222, and thus resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Because these immune complexes bind and activate platelets via Fc?3 receptor IIA (Fc?3RIIA), high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin G has been suggested for treatment of VITT in addition to non-heparin anticoagulants. Here we propose inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) approved for B cell malignancies (e.g., ibrutinib) as another therapeutic option in VITT, as they are expected to pleiotropically target multiple pathways downstream of Fc?3RIIA-mediated Btk activation, for example, as demonstrated for the effective inhibition of platelet aggregation, dense granule secretion, P-selectin expression and platelet-neutrophil aggregate formation stimulated by Fc?3RIIA cross-linking. Moreover, C-type lectin-like receptor CLEC-2- and GPIb-mediated platelet activation, the interactions and activation of monocytes and the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, as encountered in HIT, could be attenuated by Btk inhibitors. As a paradigm for emergency repurposing of approved drugs in COVID-19, off-label use of Btk inhibitors in a low-dose range not affecting haemostatic functions could thus be considered a sufficiently safe option to treat VITT.","output":"Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT): Targeting Pathomechanisms with Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), aimed at reducing the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, have dramatically influenced our everyday behaviour.

We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines, also reducing person-to-person contacts. Moreover, we find that the individual patterns of visits are influenced by the strength of the NPIs policies, the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the peoples mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions. Finally, despite the gradual recovery in visit patterns, we find that individuals continue to keep person-to-person contacts low.

To efficiently deliver CRISPR-chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano-biohybrid complexes (F-TBIO) are constructed by one-step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF-TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF-TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid-, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg-AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg-AD mice are still significantly improved.

Adult patients with lymphoma admitted for Covid-19 to 16 French hospitals in March and April, 2020 were included. Length of in-hospital stay was analyzed as a competitor vs death. The study included 111 patients. The median age was 65 years (range, 19-92). Ninety-four patients (85%) had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the 12 months prior to hospitalization for Covid-19, 79 patients (71%) were treated for their lymphoma. Among them, 63 (57%) received an anti-CD20 therapy. Fourteen patients (12%) had relapsed/refractory disease. The median LOS was 14 days (range, 1-235). After a median follow-up of 191 days (3-260), the 6-month overall survival was 69%. In multivariable analyses, recent administration of anti-CD20 therapy was associated with prolonged LOS (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.42-3.6, p < 0.001) and higher risk of death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.52, p = 0.039).

It was clear that this viral disease exhibited a clear predilection for and danger to older persons. Informal contacts began with senior officials from the country's Ministry of Health, the Israel Medical Association, and the country's largest health fund; this was done to plan an approach to the possible coming storm. A group was formed, comprising three senior geriatricians, a former dean, a palliative care specialist, and a lawyer/ethicist. The members made every effort to ensure that their recommendations would be practical while at the same time taking into account the tenets of medical ethics. The committee's main task was to think through a workable approach because intensive care unit/ventilator resources may be far outstripped by those requiring such care. Recommendations included the approach to older persons both in the community and in long\\\\term care institutions, a triage instrument, and palliative care. Patient autonomy was emphasized, with a strong recommendation for people of all ages to update their advance directives or, if they did not have any, to quickly draw them up. Considering the value of distributive justice, with respect to triage, a soft utilitarian approach was advocated with the main criteria being function and comorbidity. Although chronological age was rejected as a sole criterion, in the case of an overwhelming crisis, biological age would enter into the triage considerations, but only in the case of distinguishing between people with equal nonCage\\\\related deficits. The guideline emphasized that no matter what, in the spirit of beneficence, anyone who fell ill must receive active palliative care throughout the course of a COVD\\\\19 infection but especially at the end of life. Furthermore, in the spirit of nonmaleficence, the frail, very old, and severely demented would be actively protected from dying on ventilation.","output":"Israel Ad Hoc COVID\\\\19 Committee: Guidelines for Care of Older Persons During a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic biology aims to create functional devices, systems and organisms with novel and useful functions on the basis of catalogued and standardized biological building blocks.

Although the symptoms of most COVID-19 patients are mild or self-curable, most of severe patients have sepsis caused by cytokine storms, which greatly increases the case fatality rate. Moreover, there is no effective drug that can limit the novel coronavirus thus far, so it is more needed to develop antiviral drugs for the SARS-CoV-2. In our research, we employed the techniques of molecular docking to screen 35 flavonoid compounds among which 29 compounds have Z-scores lower than ? 6. Then, ( ?)-gallocatechin gallate, ( +)-gallocatechin and baicalein were identified to have potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with IC(50) values of 5.774  0.805 M, 13.14  2.081 M and 5.158  0.928 M respectively by FRET assay. Molecular docking results also showed that ( ?)-gallocatechin gallate, ( +)-gallocatechin and baicalein can non-covalently bind to M(pro) through - stacking and hydrogen bonds in the Cys145 catalytic site. We further evaluated the effect of ( ?)-gallocatechin gallate and baicalein on cytokine storms using a mouse model of sepsis. ( ?)-Gallocatechin gallate and baicalein significantly reduced sepsis of mouse models on weight, murine sepsis score, and survival rate and reduced the inflammatory factor levels, such as TNF-, IL-1, IL-4, and IL-10.

Localization of sensor nodes in WSNs plays a significant role in several applications such as detecting the enemy movement in military applications. The major aim of localization problem is to find the coordinates of all target nodes with the help of anchor nodes. In this paper, two variants of bat optimization algorithm (BOA) are proposed to localize the sensor nodes in a more efficient way and to overcome the drawbacks of original BOA, i.e. being trapped in local optimum solution. The exploration and exploitation features of original BOA are modified in the proposed BOA variants 1 and 2 using improved global and local search strategies. To validate the efficiency of the proposed BOA variants 1 and 2, several simulations have been performed for various numbers of target nodes and anchor nodes, and the results are compared with original BOA and other existing optimization algorithms applied to node localization problem. The proposed BOA variants 1 and 2 outperform the other algorithms in terms of mean localization error, number of localized nodes and computing time. Further, the proposed BOA variants 1 and 2 and original BOA are also compared in terms of various errors and localization efficiency for several values of target and anchor nodes. The simulations results signify that the proposed BOA variant 2 is superior to the proposed BOA variant 1 and existing BOA in terms of several errors. The node localization based on the proposed BOA variant 2 is more effective as it takes less time to perform computations and has less mean localization error than the proposed BOA variant 1, BOA and other existing optimization algorithms.","output":"Localization of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks using bat optimization algorithm with enhanced exploration and exploitation characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters for supplemental aerosol mitigation during exercise testing is unknown and might be relevant during COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of portable HEPA filtering on aerosol concentration during exercise testing and its efficiency in reducing room clearance time in a clinical exercise testing laboratory? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were six healthy volunteers aged 20 to 56 years. In the first experiment, exercise was performed in a small tent with controlled airflow with the use of a stationary cycle, portable HEPA filter with fume hood, and particle counter to document aerosol concentration. Subjects performed a four-stage maximal exercise test that lasted 12 minutes plus 5 minutes of pretest quiet breathing and 3 minutes of active recovery. First, they exercised without mitigation then with portable HEPA filter running. In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722  1,484/L vs 96  124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 m), 1,339  1,281/L vs 76  104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 m), and 333  209/L vs 17  19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 m) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96%  2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Mitigation of Aerosols Generated During Exercise Testing With a Portable High-Efficiency Particulate Air Filter With Fume Hood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound global impact on governments, health care systems, economies, and populations around the world. Within the East Asia and Pacific region, some countries have mitigated the spread of the novel coronavirus effectively and largely avoided severe negative consequences, while others still struggle with containment. As the second wave reaches East Asia and the Pacific, it becomes more evident that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed to track recent shifts, rates of increase, and persistence associated with the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk, persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and those countries who are managing the pandemic successfully. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed. We provide novel indicators to measure disease transmission. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 330 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in East Asia and the Pacific as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: The standard surveillance metrics for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar were concerning as they had the largest new caseloads at 4301, 2588, and 1387, respectively. When looking at the acceleration of new COVID-19 infections, we found that French Polynesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines had rates at 3.17, 0.22, and 0.06 per 100,000. These three countries also ranked highest in terms of jerk at 15.45, 0.10, and 0.04, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Two of the most populous countries in East Asia and the Pacific, Indonesia and the Philippines, have alarming surveillance metrics. These two countries rank highest in new infections in the region. The highest rates of speed, acceleration, and positive upwards jerk belong to French Polynesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and may result in explosive growth. While all countries in East Asia and the Pacific need to be cautious about reopening their countries since outbreaks are likely to occur in the second wave of COVID-19, the country of greatest concern is the Philippines. Based on standard and enhanced surveillance, the Philippines has not gained control of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is particularly troubling because the country ranks 4th in population in the region. Without extreme and rigid social distancing, quarantines, hygiene, and masking to reverse trends, the Philippines will remain on the global top 5 list of worst COVID-19 outbreaks resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The second wave will only exacerbate existing conditions and increase COVID-19 transmissions.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Wave Two Surveillance in East Asia and the Pacific: Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Conventional osteosarcoma (OS) is a high-grade intraosseous malignancy with production of osteoid matrix; however, a deeper dive into the underlying genetics reveals genomic complexity and instability that result in significant tumor heterogeneity.

The gold standard for COVID-19 detection is the use of RT-PCR tests. However, due to the high demand for tests, these can take days or even weeks in some regions of Brazil. Thus, an alternative for detecting COVID-19 is the analysis of Digital Chest X-rays (XR). Changes due to COVID-19 can be detected in XR, even in asymptomatic patients. In this context, models based on deep learning have great potential to be used as support systems for diagnosis or as screening tools.

Easy way of insertion and good long-term patency make them competitive to fistulas in some groups of patients. METHODS Late complications and survival of 180 tunneled catheters inserted from June 2010 to December 2013 in 171 unselected hemodialysis patients were analyzed. RESULTS The cumulative time of observation was 2103.5 patient-months and median observation was 9 months (range of 0.5-45 months). Only 19 out of 180 catheters were removed due to complications (12 for infections, 4 due to malfunction and 3 because of mechanical damage). Majority of catheters were removed electively: 27 after maturation of arterio-venous fistula (AVF), 4 after kidney transplant, 5 after transfer to peritoneal dialysis and 3 due to the recovery of renal function. At the end of the observation, 58 catheters were still in use and 64 patients had died with functioning catheter. When censored for elective catheter removal and patient death, 88.2% of catheters survived for 1 year. Catheter survival was significantly better in older patients (over 65 years, in comparison to patients < 65 years, p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS Nearly 90% of all inserted catheters gave reliable dialysis access as long as it was needed. Among them, over 30% of the inserted catheters were in use at the end of the observation period, and over 30% of patients had died with a functioning catheter.

The study aimed to identify factors associated with anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers involved in COVID-19 response in Nepal. Methods: This was a cross-sectional web-based survey conducted between April 26 and May 12, 2020. A total of 475 health workers participated in the study. Anxiety and depression were measured using a 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: 0- 21) and insomnia was measured by using a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI: 0-28). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to determine the risk factors of mental health outcomes. Results: Overall, 41.9% of health workers had symptoms of anxiety, 37.5% had depression symptoms and 33.9% had symptoms of insomnia. Stigma faced by health workers was significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 2.47;95% CI: 1.62-3.76), depression (AOR: 2.05;95% CI: 1.34-3.11) and insomnia (AOR: 2.37;95% CI: 1.46-3.84). History of medication for mental health problems was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 3.40;95% CI:1.31-8.81), depression (AOR: 3.83;95% CI: 1.45-10.14) and insomnia (AOR: 3.82;95% CI: 1.52-9.62) while inadequate precautionary measures in the workplace was significantly associated with higher odds of exhibiting symptoms of anxiety (AOR: 1.89;95% CI: 1.12-3.19) and depression (AOR: 1.97;95% CI: 1.16-3.37). Nurses (AOR: 2.33;95% CI: 1.21-4.47) were significantly more likely to experience anxiety symptoms than other health workers. Conclusion: The study findings revealed a considerate proportion of anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms among health workers during the early phase of the pandemic in Nepal. Health workers facing stigma, those with history of medication for mental health problems, and those reporting inadequate precautionary measures in their workplace were more at risk of developing mental health outcomes.

MOV10 is widely expressed and has a key role in the cellular response to viral infection and in suppressing retrotransposition. Posttranslational modifications of MOV10 include ubiquitination, which leads to stimulation-dependent degradation, and phosphorylation, which has an unknown function. MOV10 localizes to the nucleus and/or cytoplasm in a cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific manner.

MOV10 is expressed throughout the organism; however, most studies have focused on germline cells and neurons. In the testes, the knockdown of Mov10 disrupts proliferation of spermatogonial progenitor cells.

Despite aquatic products' positive effects on human health, their consumption in Turkey has decreased over time and is currently lower than most countries with 6.3 kg per capita. The reason why fish consumption in Turkey is less than in other countries is the more preference for terrestrial production. Therefore, it was aimed to determine the consumption habits of consumers in Turkey's coastal region. Design/methodology/approach: This study was carried out between Feb-March 2018 to determine the consumption habits of aquatic products;28 areas in the coastal regions of Turkey random were selected, 650 volunteer consumers were randomly selected to answer a set of 25 questions. The survey results were evaluated by Chi-square analysis. Findings: From the survey results, 81.4% of the respondents prefer to consume fish from the natural environment. Additionally, from the consumers, there was no statistical difference between natural (81.4%) and aquaculture (85.4%) fish taste (p = 0.05). It was found that 63% of the participants consumed fish meat once a week, with an average per capita consumption of 17.50 +or- 2.34 and 10.50 +or- 1.66 kg for fish and other seafood consumption, respectively. As a result, it was estimated that fish products were consumed at the desired level in the provinces examined. Accordingly, individuals need to be more conscious and encouraged to increase the consumption of seafood. Research limitations/implications: Because Turkey's seafood consumption is still held in coastal regions in this article are the limitations of this article results. In the future, the difference between inland and coastal regions for fish consumption needs to be explored further. Practical implications: The article says exports of fish/fisheries products have gradually decreased due to the global COVID-19 crisis, but producers/markets will have to target the domestic market more and sales with TL will come to the fore. As a result, it was estimated that fish products were consumed at the desired level in the studied provinces. Accordingly, it has been revealed that individuals should be more conscious and encouraged to increase their consumption of seafood. Social implications: Through this research, the consumption of fisheries consumption preferences of individuals in Turkey's coastal regions uncovered. Originality/value: On the other hand, since Turkey's aquaculture and fisheries sector attaches great importance to foreign sales (exports), domestic consumption amounts are low, and the issue of increasing this is an issue that has remained in the background for the producer. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic period, it was well understood that the closing of the customs gates partially and/or completely and the export figures becoming scanty will cause the end of 2020 and 2021 to be more troublesome in this sense.

In this review, we discuss multiple aspects of rDNA function including the relationship between Pol I transcription and proliferative capacity, the role of Pol I transcription in mediating nucleolar structure and integrity, and rDNA/nucleolar interactions with the genome and their influence on heterochromatin and global genome stability.

Although eukaryotic circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses were originally thought to only infect plants and vertebrates, recent studies have identified these viruses in a number of invertebrates. To further explore CRESS-DNA viruses in the marine environment, this study surveyed CRESS-DNA viruses in various marine invertebrate species. A total of 27 novel CRESS-DNA genomes, with Reps that share less than 60.1% identity with previously reported viruses, were recovered from 21 invertebrate species, mainly crustaceans. Phylogenetic analysis based on the Rep revealed a novel clade of CRESS-DNA viruses that included approximately one third of the marine invertebrate associated viruses identified here and whose members may represent a novel family. Investigation of putative capsid proteins (Cap) encoded within the eukaryotic CRESS-DNA viral genomes from this study and those in GenBank demonstrated conserved patterns of predicted intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which can be used to complement similarity-based searches to identify divergent structural proteins within novel genomes. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of CRESS-DNA viruses associated with invertebrates and explores a new tool to evaluate divergent structural proteins encoded by these viruses.","output":"Novel circular single-stranded DNA viruses identified in marine invertebrates reveal high sequence diversity and consistent predicted intrinsic disorder patterns within putative structural proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Reovirus is an enteric virus comprising eight structural proteins that form a double-layered capsid. During reovirus entry into cells, the outermost capsid layer (composed of proteins 3 and 1C) is proteolytically processed to generate an infectious subviral particle (ISVP) that is subsequently uncoated to produce the transcriptionally active core particle. Kinetic studies suggest that protein 3 is rapidly removed from virus particles and then protein 1C is cleaved. Initial cleavage of 1C has been well described and generates an amino (N)-terminal  peptide and a carboxyl (C)-terminal  peptide. However, cleavage and removal of 3 is an extremely rapid event that has not been well defined. We have treated purified reovirus serotype 1 Lang virions with a variety of endoproteases. Time-course digestions with chymotrypsin, Glu-C, pepsin, and trypsin resulted in the initial generation of two peptides that were resolved in SDSCPAGE and analyzed by in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Most tested proteases cut 3 within a hypersensitive region between amino acids 217 and 238. In addition, to gain a better understanding of the sequence of subsequent proteolytic events that result in generation of reovirus subviral particles, time-course digestions of purified particles were performed under physiologic salt conditions and released peptide fragments ranging from 500 to 5000 Da were directly analyzed by MALDI-Qq-TOFMS. Trypsin digestion initially released a peptide that corresponded to the C-terminus of 1C, followed by a peptide that corresponded to amino acids 214C236 of the 3 protein. Other regions of 1C were not observed until protein 3 was completely digested. Similar experiments with Glu-C indicated the hypersensitive region of 3 was cut first when virions were treated at pH values of 4.5 or 7.4, but treatment of virions with pepsin at pH 3.0 released different 3 peptides, suggesting acid-induced conformational changes in this outer capsid protein. These studies also revealed that the N-terminus of 3 is acetylated.","output":"Digestion pattern of reovirus outer capsid protein 3 determined by mass spectrometry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic wearing a mask in public has been recommended in some settings and mandated in others. How often this advice is followed, how well, and whether it inadvertently leads to more disease transmission opportunities due to a combination of improper use and physical distancing lapses is unknown. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study performed in JuneCAugust 2020. SETTING: Eleven outdoor and indoor public settings (some with mandated mask use, some without) each in Toronto, Ontario, and in Portland, Oregon. PARTICIPANTS: All passers-by in the study settings. OUTCOME MEASURES: Mask use, incorrect mask use, and number of breaches (ie, coming within 2 m of someone else where both parties were not properly masked). RESULTS: We observed 36 808 persons, the majority of whom were estimated to be aged 31C65 years (49%). Two-thirds (66.7%) were wearing a mask and 13.6% of mask-wearers wore them incorrectly. Mandatory mask-use settings were overwhelmingly associated with mask use (adjusted OR 79.2; 95% CI 47.4 to 135.1). Younger age, male sex, Torontonians, and public transit or airport settings (vs in a store) were associated with lower adjusted odds of wearing a mask. Mandatory mask-use settings were associated with lower adjusted odds of mask error (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.73), along with female sex and Portland subjects. Subjects aged 81+ years (vs 31C65 years) and those on public transit and at the airport (vs stores) had higher odds of mask errors. Mask-wearers had a large reduction in adjusted mean number of breaches (rate ratio (RR) 0.19; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.20). The 81+ age group had the largest association with breaches (RR 7.77; 95% CI 5.32 to 11.34). CONCLUSIONS: Mandatory mask use was associated with a large increase in mask-wearing. Despite 14% of them wearing their masks incorrectly, mask users had a large reduction in the mean number of breaches (disease transmission opportunities).

Here we established BCoV serology based on a recombinant immunofluorescence assay for cattle, goats and sheep, and studied the seroprevalence of BCoV in these species in four different locations in the Greater Accra, Volta, Upper East, and Northern provinces of Ghana. The whole sampling and testing was organized and conducted by a veterinary school in Kumasi, Ashanti Region of Ghana. Among sampled sheep (n = 102), goats (n = 66), and cattle (n = 1495), the seroprevalence rates were 25.8 %, 43.1 % and 55.8 %. For cattle, seroprevalence was significantly higher on larger farms (82.2 % vs 17.8 %, comparing farms with >50 or <50 animals; p = 0.027). Highest prevalence was seen in the Northern province with dry climate, but no significant trend following the north-south gradient of sampling sites was detected.

This protein belongs to a group of viral cysteine-type proteinases and has been shown previously to catalyze proteolysis between a Gly-Gly dipeptide. The amino acid sequence requirements surrounding the HC-Pro C-terminal cleavage site of the tobacco etch virus polyprotein have been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro expression systems. A total of 51 polyprotein derivatives, each differing by the substitution of a single amino acid between the P5 and P2 positions, were tested for autoproteolytic activity. Substitutions of Tyr (P4), Val (P2), Gly (P1), and Gly (P1) were found to eliminate or nearly eliminate proteolysis. Substitutions of Thr (P5), Asn (P3), and Met (P2), on the other hand, were permissive for proteolysis, although the apparent processing rates of some polyproteins containing these alterations were reduced. These results suggest that auto-recognition by HC-Pro involves the interaction of the enzymatic binding site with four amino acids surrounding the cleavage site. Comparison of the homologous sequences of five potyviral polyproteins revealed that the residues essential for processing are strictly conserved, whereas the nonessential residues are divergent. The relationship between HC-Pro and other viral and cellular cysteine-type proteinases is discussed.","output":"Characterization of the potyviral HC-pro autoproteolytic cleavage site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Insufficient data are available on comprehensive evaluation of demographics, symptoms or signs, laboratory findings, and disease course in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

We engaged educators in a collaborative design (co-design) process that foregrounded two components: (1) contemplative practice and (2) developing skill in how social interactions are embedded within wider systems through individual and joint inquiry. We analyzed the ways educators developed awareness of social suffering and set intentions to alleviate suffering. We examined how co-design fostered an understanding of compassion and new ideas about how to respond skillfully to suffering in schools. METHODS: Using qualitative methods, we analyzed data from educators who participated in co-design, including their written reflections, field notes, semi-structured interviews, and surveys. RESULTS: Educators identified multiple opportunities for acting with compassion, including approaching school-based interactions with compassion, cultivating compassion for themselves, and envisioning school change through a lens of compassion. Educators experiences in co-design directly informed how they imagined compassionate action in their schools. Specific elements highlighted were contemplative practice, reflection, and individual and joint inquiry. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptation of a general program on compassion training can benefit from attending to how to show compassion in the context of concrete interactions in schools, and this can support educators in developing skillful means of care. Our analyses provide insight into the components that supported educators to offer compassion and suggest that educators skillful means of care can be cultivated through both contemplative practice and inquiry into social suffering.

OBJECTIVE This study examines the extent of sufficient long-term pain relief and functional improvement in patients with SIJ syndrome that are treated with thermocoagulation. Some patients treated with thermocoagulation noted initial improvement, but the functionality and pain relief had limited duration and efficacy. Patients with insufficient improvement were recommended to undergo fusion surgery as an option for better and longer lasting results. METHOD Patients with a long history of back or pelvic problems were selected for the study. Endoscopic thermal coagulation of the SIJ was carried out. The follow-up examinations took place after 1, 3, 6, 12 months. In patients with insufficient pain relief and functionality after thermocoagulation, a fusion surgery was performed. The results of the fusion surgery were documented over a 12-month follow-up period. To carry out the statistical evaluation visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI) and the consumption of opioids were recorded. RESULTS Forty-eight patients were included. The mean VAS values 12 months after thermocoagulation were 68.9. The ODI after 12 months was very near or somewhat higher than their baseline prior to the thermocoagulation. Thus, a fusion surgery was recommended. Thirty-three patients agreed to the fusion operation. The VAS values 12 months after fusion surgery decreased to 53.1. Analogous to the VAS values, the Oswestry index (ODI) showed a significant improvement after the fusion operation. CONCLUSION The success of surgical intervention in 88% of the SIJ syndrome patients with inadequate results 12 months after thermocoagulation proves the superiority of SIJ fusion surgery. This study showed long-lasting pain relief by an average of 65% and a median improvement in functional impairments of 60%. In view of these results, fusion surgery should be considered for patients without sufficient success of thermocoagulation.","output":"One-year results of minimally invasive fusion surgery of the sacroiliac joint as an alternative treatment after failed endoscopic thermal coagulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Much of the control over the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been achieved by mass vaccination against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent that causes COVID-19.

We describe a case of fungal sacroiliitis complicating severe COVID-19 pneumonia following a prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Candida albicans sacroilitis is a rarely reported infection with few case reports in the literature. Candida osteoarticular infections can present as septic arthritis, with knee involvement in 75% of cases, or osteomyelitis. The latter presentation differs based on age - vertebral involvement (51%) is more common in adults while children are more likely to present with infection in the long bones, ribs, or sternum. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old Afro-Caribbean gentleman with a history of hypertension and obesity was admitted to the ICU with clinical, laboratory and radiographic features of COVID-19 infection despite persistently negative swabs. Whilst in ICU he required mechanical ventilation. His stay was further complicated by multiple infections, pulmonary emboli, and the presence of a cavitating lesion in the left lung. Cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage and a central venous catheter line grew Serratia Mascense, candida glabrata and pseudomonas were isolated from his urine. He was treated with multiple antibiotics including meropenem, tazocin, ceftazidime and avibactam. After 61 days in the ICU he was transferred to the ward. He developed severe pain in his right hip which was worse on movement. This was followed by urinary incontinence and sensory deficit in the right L2/L3 dermatome. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his spine and sacroiliac joints which showed right sided sacroiliitis and oedema around the iliopsoas muscle. He was started on vancomycin, later changed to ceftazidime avibactam and metronidazole. An echocardiogram did not show any vegetations. He underwent a biopsy of his sacroiliac joints which confirmed the presence of leucocytes, extended cultures yielded candida albicans in one out of two biopsy specimens. Considering ongoing pyrexia, pain and inflammatory markers, intravenous fluconazole was added to his antibiotic regimen which resulted in a marked improvement in mobility. After four weeks, ceftazidime, metronidazole and avibactam were stopped, and fluconazole was administered as oral tablets. 6 days later he became febrile and IV fluconazole was restarted. A repeat chest CT showed resolution of the cavity but ongoing changes suggestive of organising pneumonia. A repeat MRI of the sacroiliac joints revealed minor improvement. Intravenous Fluconazole was continued for a total of 8 weeks and was changed to tablets for complete a total of 12 weeks. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This is a severe case of COVID-19 infection who despite 9 negative PCR tests, on day 53, had positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirming our clinical suspicion. Particularly in the ICU setting, individuals are approximately ten times more likely to have secondary bacterial/fungal infections with more frequent detection of multidrug-resistant Gram- negative pathogens. This case highlights several difficulties. Urine cultures had confirmed candida albicans, likely to be related to catheter related urinary tract infections, and a possible source for our patient but also a resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa species. Furthermore, cultures were positive for Serratia Mascense, candida glabrata. He had also already been treated with prolonged, broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment. Considering this, establishing the aetiology of the septic sacroiliitis was challenging. The rarity of candida sacroiliitis and presence of the organism in just one specimen made this more difficult. This led to the decision of a repeat sacroiliac biopsy to supply sufficient samples for further microbial analyses such as 16S, 18S and mycobacteria culture, all of which were negative. He became febrile after the discontinuation of antimicrobials and a switch to oral fluconazole therapy. He was extensively re-investigated and despite resolution of the lung cavity, there were changes which could have been consistent with an organising pneumonia. At this point he was neutropenic, mildly eosinophilic, and therefore a drug reaction was also considered. Repeat MRI revealed resolving muscle inflammation and minimal change at the bone site, with erosions and possible reactive bone marrow oedema. Following discussion with microbiology the decision was made to persist with intravenous Fluconazole. He continued to improve, and his inflammatory markers normalised after 8 weeks of treatment. Prednisolone was started for COVID-19 related pneumonitis. Long-term antifungal treatment is advisable, and we aim to complete 12 weeks of treatment. Case report - Key learning points: 1. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly those requiring ICU admission were at risk of developing superinfections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria or fungal infections. 2. Candida albicans sacroiliitis is rare therefore early aspiration/biopsy is essential for the management. 3. Longer treatment is needed in osteoarticular candida infections, even up to 6 or 12 months, therefor long-term close monitoring of this patients is essential. 4. The utility and timing of reimaging patients following such infections is still unclear. 5. Close multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary team collaboration is essential in the management of this complex patients.","output":"EP13 A case of candida albicans septic sacroiliitis complicating severe COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study seeks to explore the use of humor during the period of isolation caused by lockdown measures imposed in Italy as a result of the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: The study is based on a non-clinical sample. The ad hoc questionnaire measures people's readiness to search for, publish and distribute humorous material during lockdown. It investigates the intentions behind sending content via social media (WhatsApp or similar) and the emotions experienced on receiving such content. RESULTS: The responses have been analyzed quantitatively, and using Excel's IF function they have been analyzed qualitatively. In the present sample of 106 Italian respondents, searching for content was less common than publishing it (yes 44.34%, no 54.72%). Positive emotions were more frequently the motivation (total 61.32%). A high percentage sent amusing content via social media or SMS (79%). Responses demonstrating a desire to lessen the situation's negative impact or a desire for cohesion were common. Receiving material was similarly associated with positive emotions and a sense of being close to others.

The ability of COVID-19 to cause chronic illness, sarcopenia, and physical deconditioning may be underestimated and go beyond the anticipated respiratory sequelae. Myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia are common symptoms even in mild to moderate cases and have the potential to exacerbate frailty. How this impacts on risk-stratification for patients requiring surgery for time-critical conditions, such as malignancy, requires further urgent investigation. MAIN BODY: The deleterious effect of sarcopenia and poor physical capacity are well recognised in cancer surgery. This review commentary highlights current evidence which suggests skeletal muscle as an under recognised cause of COVID-19-related functional deconditioning. The mechanisms behind this are via direct (viral induced myositis, nutritional decline, cytokine-mediated myopathy) and indirect mechanisms (social isolation, inactivity, and psychological consequences).

However, the uncontrollable self-administered measure can be easily affected by insouciantly or deceptively answering, and producing the different results with the clinician-administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically, facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered evaluations. In this work, we collect a novel dataset of 200 subjects to evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity. Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority of our framework to the conventional state-of-the-art temporal modeling methods.","output":"Interpreting Depression From Question-wise Long-term Video Recording of SDS Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to provide an updated report in regards to the correlation between vaccines and anaphylaxis and the related risk in the population. RECENT FINDINGS: Initial reports showed higher incidence of anaphylaxis following messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with 'routine' vaccinations, likely influenced by the great attention paid to these 'new' vaccines. However, anaphylaxis has still to be considered quite rare and its incidence will be systematically reconsidered in the light of additional data collected. SUMMARY: Adverse reactions to vaccines are commonly reported but most of them are nonspecific mild events, whereas vaccine-related anaphylaxis is considered a rare event, with an incidence rate equal to 1.3 cases per million vaccine doses administered. As anaphylaxis reports usually start to be reported to passive pharmacovigilance during postmarketing surveillance, the first data are used to be influenced by under- and over-reporting and lack of denominators and following studies are needed to confirm the causal relationship. This might create an initial overcautiously approach to new immunization practices but, being anaphylaxis a potential life-threatening event, every suspected contraindication has to be deepened to maximize effectiveness and safety profile and constantly redefined not to exclude an overestimated population group who could receive the vaccine uneventfully.","output":"Immunization practices and risk of anaphylaxis: a current update, comprehensive of COVID-19 vaccination data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts, meets 3 times per year to develop recommendations for vaccine use in the United States.

This study compared markers between hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and those with bacterial sepsis. METHODS: This retrospective single-centre cohort study included 50 patients with COVID-19 clinical stages II and III and 24 patients with bacterial sepsis. Both groups were treated according to the country's official standards. Leukocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and D-dimer were registered at the time of patient's admission and 24, 48, and 72 h after initiating intrahospital treatment. RESULTS: Upon admission, marker levels were high, with a significant decrease at 72 h after antibiotic therapy in the sepsis group. The leukocyte count was higher in deceased patients with sepsis. The mean ferritin levels were 1105 mcg/dl for COVID-19 and 525 mcg/dL for sepsis. Higher ferritin levels in COVID-19 (P = 0.001) seemed to be a predictor of higher mortality. Upon admission, the median D-dimer level was 0.68 mg/L for COVID-19 and 3 mg/L for patients with sepsis, whether recovered or deceased. As D-dimer, procalcitonin levels were higher in patients with sepsis (P = 0.001). CRP levels were equally elevated in both entities but higher in deceased patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Ferritin was the main inflammatory marker for COVID-19, and leukocytes, procalcitonin, and D-dimer were the main markers of sepsis. Markers that were most affected in deceased patients were CRP for COVID-19 and leukocyte for sepsis.

Various technologies have been developed for Kcr prediction. Sequence-based features are typically adopted in existing methods, in which only linearly neighboring amino acid composition was considered. However, modified Kcr sites are neighbored by not only the linear-neighboring amino acid but also those spatially surrounding residues around the target site. In this paper, we have used residue-residue contact as a new feature for Kcr prediction, in which features encoded with not only linearly surrounding residues but also those spatially nearby the target site. Then, the spatial-surrounding residue was used as a new scheme for feature encoding for the first time, named residue-residue composition (RRC) and residue-residue pair composition (RRPC), which were used in supervised learning classification for Kcr prediction. As the result suggests, RRC and RRPC have achieved the best performance of RRC at an accuracy of 0.77 and an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.78, RRPC at an accuracy of 0.74, and an AUC value of 0.80. In order to show that the spatial feature is of a competitively high significance as other sequence-based features, feature selection was carried on those sequence-based features together with feature RRPC. In addition, different ranges of the surrounding amino acid compositions' radii were used for comparison of the performance. After result assessment, RRC and RRPC features have shown competitively outstanding performance as others or in some cases even around 0.20 higher in accuracy or 0.3 higher in AUC values compared with sequence-based features.","output":"Residue-Residue Contact Can Be a Potential Feature for the Prediction of Lysine Crotonylation Sites."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We performed a comparative evaluation of the immune status, focused on the T-cell system, of euthymic rat strains in which the nude mutation had been introduced.

We analyzed weight of body, spleen and thymus; antibody response and delayed-type hypersensitivity response to ovalbumin immunization; and (immuno)histopathology of spleen, lymph nodes, and lymphoid tissue along the gastrointestinal tract. In the spleen morphometric analysis was done of the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheath (using the antibody R73 recognizing the alpha beta-T-cell receptor) and of the red pulp (using the antibody ED2 recognizing red pulp macrophages).

Second, we use the automatically labeled data for supervised training of a neural network to predict reply sentiment from the original tweets. The resulting classifier is evaluated on the new RETWEET dataset, showing promising results, especially considering that it has been trained without any manually labeled data.

The number of patients now undergoing laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery for colorectal cancer has rapidly increased. We herein report a rectal cancer patient with PDM who safely underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection (RLAR).

Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a type 2 lesion of the rectum. Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed based on the results of a histopathological examination. Preoperative contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography showed abnormalities in the colonic course and characteristic vascular courses, suggesting rectal cancer with PDM. RLAR was performed. DISCUSSION In surgery, it is important to initially perform adhesiolysis accurately in order to reconstruct the original shape of the colonic mesentery and confirm/dissect vascular bifurcations due to the risk of marginal arterial injury.

As there is no any drug to treat this pandemic, the healthcare professionals are disproportionately at higher risk. The mental health outcome is expected to be high. Anxiety is expected to have a significant impact on health professionals, especially among those who work without adequate resources for self-protection. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this research was to assess self-reported anxiety symptoms and associated factors among Ethiopian healthcare professionals in the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We have conducted an online cross-sectional study to collect information from healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during the early stage of the outbreak from April 7, 2020 to May 19, 2020. GAD-7 was used for measurement of anxiety. We have used a cut of point of 10 and above to report anxiety symptoms. We have used Google Forms for online data collection and SPSS-22 for analysis. To determine associated factors for anxiety, a binary logistic regression model was used. Variables with p-value < 0.2 during the bivariable binary logistic regression were exported for further analysis in the multivariable binary logistic regression. Finally, variables with p-value <0.05 were considered as significantly associated with the outcomes. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-eight healthcare professionals filled the online questionnaire; Majority (71.1%) were males. Significant number of respondents (78.9%) reported lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) at the work place. The prevalence of anxiety was 26.8%. Being female (AOR: 1.88; 95% C.I:1.11, 3.19), visiting/treating 30C150 patients per day (AOR: 3.44; 95% C.I:1.51, 7.84), those employed at private healthcare institutions (AOR: 2.40; 95% C.I:1.17, 4.90), who do not believe that COVID-19 is preventable (AOR: 2.04; 95% C.I:1.04, 4.03) and those who reported lack of PPE (AOR: 1.98; 95% C.I:1.04, 3.79) were more likely to be anxious. CONCLUSIONS: The anxiety prevalence among healthcare professionals in Ethiopia during early stage of COVID-19 pandemic was high. This study shows that lack of preventive equipment, being female, contact with many patients, low self-efficacy and working in private health facilities were risk factors for anxiety. Anxiety prevention among health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic requires a holistic approach including provision of sufficient PPE, improving self-efficacy and addressing problems both at public and private institutions and focusing more on female health professionals.","output":"Anxiety and associated factors among Ethiopian health professionals at early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite wide utilisation of severity scoring systems for case-mix determination and benchmarking in the intensive care unit, the possibility of scoring bias across ethnicities has not been examined. Recent guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources such as mechanical ventilation during the current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We investigated the performance of three severity scoring systems (APACHE IVa, OASIS, SOFA) across ethnic groups in two large ICU databases in order to identify possible ethnicity-based bias. METHOD: Data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care were analysed for score performance in Asians, African Americans, Hispanics and Whites after appropriate exclusions. Discrimination and calibration were determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups. FINDINGS: While measurements of discrimination - area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) - were significantly different among the groups, they did not display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. In contrast, measurements of calibration - standardised mortality ratio (SMR) - indicated persistent, and in some cases significant, patterns of difference between Hispanics and African Americans versus Asians and Whites. The differences between African Americans and Whites were consistently statistically significant. While calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently demonstrated a pattern of over-predicting mortality for African Americans and Hispanics. INTERPRETATION: The systematic differences in calibration across ethnic groups suggest that illness severity scores reflect bias in their predictions of mortality.

OBJECTIVES: Primarily, to investigate the value of POC-PCR in rapidly identifying RSV and influenza in the setting of ED triage. Additionally, to assess whether rapid knowledge of accurate test results would improve patient management by preventing nosocomial transmission and optimizing the prescription of antimicrobials for ARIs. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of consecutive ED patients with ARI symptoms during peak flu season was conducted. Patient nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested using a POC-PCR device; physicians and patients were blinded to results. Virus positive and negative groups were compared by ED patient room placement and antimicrobial therapy ordered. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated using laboratory-PCR as the gold standard. RESULTS: Of 119 participants, 52.9% were POC-PCR positive - Influenza A (42.9%), RSV (41.3%), influenza B (15.9%). Nearly 70% of virus positive patients were placed rooms shared with non-ARI patients. Antibiotics were prescribed for 27.3% of virus positive patients, and 77.8% of oseltamivir-eligible patients did not receive therapy. POC-PCR was 100% sensitive (95% CI, 80.5C100.0%) and 95.2% specific (95% CI, 76.2C99.9%).

Significant efforts to improving safety have beenemployed, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), preoperative COVID-19 testing, and recently the useof a modified surgical mask barrier. The objective of our cadaveric study is to reduce the risks of pathogen transmissionwith the use of readily available and innovative equipment as a means of creating a three-dimensional (3D) printed mask inaddition to a trocar system for use during endoscopic skull base surgery. Methods: Our study presents the ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask (VPM), a 3D-printed mask with ananterior aperture fitted with a surgical glove with ports designed to allow for surgical instrumentation and side ports toaccommodate suction ventilation and an endotracheal tube. As an alternative, a modified laparoscopic surgery trocar servedas a port for instruments, and, on the contralateral side, rubber tubing was used over the endoscrub sheath to create anairtight seal. On cadaveric models, various surgical approaches were performed which each device to assess for surgicalmaneuverability including septoplasty, maxillary antrostomy, total ethmoidectomy, frontal sinusotomy, and sphenoidotomy.Surgical freedom (SF) and aerosolization were tested in both modalities. Results: The VPM allowed the unimpeded performance of the above-mentioned surgical approaches, using both two- andfour-handed techniques, with excellent surgical maneuverability and access, while maintaining a continuous facial seal.Debris and smoke were ventilated with a size 8-Frazier tip suction, and ambient gas was additionally suctioned by thenegative-pressure VPM. SF with the VPM was equivalent (1.0 cm2 ) to the SF with no mask. With the presence of a posterior septectomy, the endoscopic endonasal trocar (EET) system was effective for posteriorsurgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures (clivus, sella, and tuberculum), and afforded asuperior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches. For thisreason, aerosolization studies were only performed in the posterior nasal cavity with the EET. SF was found to be reducedby 55% (SF = 0.45 cm2 ), and surgery anterior to the sphenoid rostrum was limited when using the trocar system. Aerosolization was reduced using both the VPM and EET. During anterior surgery, the VPM reduced particle spillage by 86%.During posterior surgery, the VPM reduced overall particle spillage by 71%, while the EET reduced spillage by 97%.Conclusion: The VPM mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a criticalrole in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era. The EET may be a useful alternative for binarial procedures in theposterior nasal cavity and in instances where 3D printing is not available. Additionally, considering the ongoing pandemic,PPE shortage is a serious concern. The VPM may serve as a renewable alternative with various applications.

We seek to systematically review the available evidence regarding the anticoagulation approach to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting venous thromboembolic events in patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving any type of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic). The pooled prevalence (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of VTE among patients receiving anticoagulant were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup pooled analyses were performed with studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and with studies reported mixed prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. We included twelve studies (8 Europe; 2 UK; 1 each from the US and China) in our systematic review and meta-analysis. All studies utilized LMWH or unfractionated heparin as their pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, either prophylactic doses or therapeutic doses. Seven studies reported on the proportion of patients with the previous history of VTE (range 0C10%). The pooled prevalence of VTE among ICU patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation across all studies was 31% (95% CI 20C43%). Subgroup pooled analysis limited to studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and mixed (therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation) reported pooled prevalences of VTE of 38% (95% CI 10C70%) and 27% (95% CI 17C40%) respectively.

Succinylacetone provides a sensitive and specific marker for the detection of TT1 but is not universally utilized in screening protocols for the disease. Here, we report an infant transferred to our facility for evaluation and management of hyperinsulinism who subsequently developed acute-onset liver, respiratory, and renal failure around one month of life.

This study aimed to examine the early PDV rate, identify the impact of PDV on dental caries and untreated dental caries, and explore the factors related to PDV among Chinese sampled children under seven years old. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five selected primary health care facilities in Chengdu, China, from May to August 2021. Parent-child dyads during regular systematic medical management were recruited to participate. Children's dental caries were identified through dental examinations and documented as decayed, missing and filled teeth index (dmft) by trained primary care physicians. Dental-related information was collected through a questionnaire. Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression was used to test the effect of early PDV on the dmft value, and logistic regression was used to analyse impact factors on the early PDV. RESULTS A total of 2028 out of 2377 parent-child dyads were qualified for analysis. Half of the children (50.4%) were male, with a mean age of 4.8 years. Among all the children, 12.1% had their first dental visit for preventive purposes, 34.4% had their first dental visit for symptomatic purposes, and more than half had never visited a dentist. The results showed that a lower dmft value (adjusted OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48-0.84), a higher rate of caries-free (aOR: 6.5, 95% CI: 3.93-10.58), and a lower rate of untreated dental caries (aOR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.21-0.76) were associated with early PDV utilization. Children who had a higher rate of PDV were positively associated with living in a family with better parental behaviours (aOR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.71-3.08), better parental oral health perception (aOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.06-1.32), fathers who had no untreated caries (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47-0.97), families with higher socioeconomic status (aOR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.16), and dental health advice received from well-child care physicians (aOR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.08-2.00).

Most of this research has focused on maternal behavioral and socio-demographic characteristics. However, the full magnitude of the racial/ethnic gap remains inadequately understood. Studies now point to the role of racial discrimination in producing PTB inequities, but limitations exist, namely the use of a single, dichotomous item to measures discrimination and the limited generalizability of most studies which have been conducted in single cities or states. METHODS: In this commentary we briefly review extant research on explanations for racial/ethnic inequities in PTB, and the role of racial discrimination in producing the racial/ethnic gap in adverse birth outcomes such as PTB. RESULTS: The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a state-level, population-based survey, annually collects data from 51 states and cities (states) on maternal behaviors and experiences in the perinatal period. The questionnaire consists of mandatory Core questions, and optional Standard questions. Currently 22 states include a Standard question on discrimination; 29 do not. PRAMS offers a unique opportunity to systematically assess discrimination among a diverse, population-based sample across the US.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19Crelated measures on partner relationships and sexual and reproductive health in China. METHODS: From May 1 to 5, 2020, 3500 young Chinese individuals were recruited through WeChat or Weibo to participate in a survey to obtain information on sexual and reproductive health (eg, sexual desire, frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual satisfaction, etc). The questionnaire also collected demographic data (eg, age, race, education, current financial status, sexual orientation, relationship status, etc). RESULTS: In total, 967 participants were included in the sexual health analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, 22% of participants (n=212) reported a decrease in sexual desire; 41% (n=396) experienced a decrease in the sexual intercourse frequency; 30% (n=291) reported an increase in the frequency of masturbation; 20% (n=192) reported a decrease in alcohol consumption before or during sexual activities, and 31% (n=298) reported a deterioration in partner relationships during the pandemic. The logistic regression analysis indicated that the following influenced partner relationships: accommodations during the pandemic (P=.046; odds ratio [OR] 0.59; 95% CI 0.30-0.86); exclusive relationship status (yes or no) (P<.001; OR 0.44; 95 % CI 0.27-0.73); sexual desire (P=.02; OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.38-2.97); and sexual satisfaction (P<.001; OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.54-2.50). COVID-19 also caused disruptions in reproductive health services such as prenatal and postnatal care, childbirth and abortion services, contraception availability, and the management of sexually transmitted infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that many young people have wide-ranging issues affecting their sexual and reproductive health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures. Strategies and guidelines are needed to safeguard the sexual and reproductive health of young people during this pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Partner Relationships and Sexual and Reproductive Health: Cross-Sectional, Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid\\\\19 epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern. It poses a massive risk for the human race across the planet, calling for the need to take measures at the local, regional, national, and global levels.

The sgRNA is introduced to the CRISPRa/i plasmids from a double stranded oligonucleotide by in vivo homology-directed repair, allowing rapid transcriptional modulation of new target genes without cloning. The CRISPRa/i toolkit was characterized by alteration of expression of fluorescent protein-encoding genes under two different promoters allowing expression alterations up to ~ 2.5-fold. Furthermore, we demonstrated the usability of the CRISPRa/i toolkit by improving the tolerance towards wheat straw hydrolysate of our industrial production strain.

However, the generalizability of this finding is understudied outside of well-sampled, highly connected regions such as Europe. In this study, we investigated the relative contributions of regional and intercontinental connectivity to the source-sink dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for Jordan and the wider Middle East. By integrating genomic, epidemiological and travel data we show that the source of introductions into Jordan was dynamic across 2020, shifting from intercontinental seeding from Europe in the early pandemic to more regional seeding for the period travel restrictions were in place. We show that land-based travel, particularly freight transport, drove introduction risk during the period of travel restrictions. Consistently, high regional connectivity and land-based travel also disproportionately drove Jordan's export risk to other Middle Eastern countries. Our findings emphasize regional connectedness and land-based travel as drivers of viral transmission in the Middle East. This demonstrates that strategies aiming to stop or slow the spread of viral introductions (including new variants) with travel restrictions need to prioritize risk from land-based travel alongside intercontinental air travel to be effective.","output":"Regional connectivity drove bidirectional transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East during travel restrictions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to high rice consumption, food insecurity can negatively impact health; hence, food diversification is considered an appropriate solution for achieving national food security.

The Italian Constitution, in article 32, states the right to health without specifications about the parameter of sex, assuming that this fundamental right is property of women and men indiscriminately. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the right to health has actually been achieved in an equal way from the standpoint of sex, and whether a hypothetically \\"neutral\\" approach is actually convincing and profitable in this context. METHODS: This paper analyzes the topic of gender medicine from a scientific and legal perspective, based on current medical literature and its implementation in the Italian and European legal systems. RESULTS: Gender medicine is the only credible response to sex- and gender-based inequalities affecting the right to health, as it provides tools to address persisting inequalities in prevention and treatment, thus pursuing health for all: women and men. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of this path was underlined also by the Summit and the Rome Declaration of 21 May 2021, acknowledging that the topic of sex and gender can no longer be overlooked in focusing a correct and equal healthcare approach.","output":"Gender medicine as a tool for implementing the right to health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial is aimed at addressing the urgent need to find effective treatments for patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The trial has had many successes, including discovering that dexamethasone is effective at reducing COVID-19 mortality, the first treatment to reach this milestone in a randomised controlled trial. Despite this, it continues to use standard or \`fixed randomization (FR) to allocate patients to treatments. We assessed the impact of implementing response adaptive randomization (RAR) within RECOVERY using an array of performance measures, to learn if it could be beneficial going forward. This design feature has recently been implemented within the REMAP-CAP trial. Methods: Trial data was simulated to closely match the data for patients allocated to either standard care or dexamethasone in the RECOVERY trial from March-June 2020, representing two out of five arms tested throughout this period. Two forms of FR and two forms of RAR were tested. Randomization strategies were performed at the whole trial level as well as within three pre-specified patient subgroups defined by patients respiratory support level. Results: RAR strategies led to more patients being given dexamethasone and a lower mortality rate in the trial. Subgroup specific RAR reduced mortality rates even further. RAR did not induce any meaningful bias in treatment effect estimates, but reduced statistical power compared to FR, with subgroup level adaptive randomizations exhibiting the largest power reduction. Conclusions: Using RAR within RECOVERY could have resulted in fewer deaths in the trial. However, a larger trial would have been needed to attain the same study power. This could potentially have prolonged the time to full approval of the drug, unless RAR itself led to an increased recruitment rate. Deciding how to balance the needs of patients within a trial and future patients who have yet to fall ill is an important ethical question of our time. RAR deserves to be considered as a design feature in future trials of COVID-19 and other diseases.","output":"Should RECOVERY have used Response Adaptive Randomization?

METHODS: Twenty-six patients whose treatment had been completed and who had no previous hearing or balance complaints were included in the study. Patients diagnosed with the disease by PCR were included in the study. Patients with at least one month of illness were included in the study. The hearing of patients was evaluated with transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and pure-tone audiometry. Bedside tests, the European Evaluation of Vertigo scale (EEV), Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT), Ocular Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (oVEMP), Cervical Vestibular Myogenic Evoked Potential (cVEMP) and Videonystagmography (VNG) tests were applied to evaluate the vestibular system.

We trained (n=250) and tested (n=500) an NLP-based program with 19 measurements that encompass colonoscopy quality measures and surveillance interval determination, using blinded, paired, annotated expert manual review as the reference standard. The remaining 41,819 nonannotated documents were processed through the NLP system without manual review to assess performance consistency. The primary outcome was system accuracy across the 19 measures. RESULTS A total of 176 (23.5%) documents with 252 (1.8%) discrepant content points resulted from paired annotation. Error rate within the 500 test documents was 31.2% for NLP and 25.4% for the paired annotators (P=0.001). At the content point level within the test set, the error rate was 3.5% for NLP and 1.9% for the paired annotators (P=0.04). When eight vaguely worded documents were removed, 125 of 492 (25.4%) were incorrect by NLP and 104 of 492 (21.1%) by the initial annotator (P=0.07). Rates of pathologic findings calculated from NLP were similar to those calculated by annotation for the majority of measurements. Test set accuracy was 99.6% for CRC, 95% for advanced adenoma, 94.6% for nonadvanced adenoma, 99.8% for advanced sessile serrated polyps, 99.2% for nonadvanced sessile serrated polyps, 96.8% for large hyperplastic polyps, and 96.0% for small hyperplastic polyps.

Methods and analysis COG-UK HOCI (COG-UK Consortium Hospital-Onset COVID-19 Infections study) is a multicentre, prospective, interventional, superiority study. Eligible patients must be admitted to hospital with first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test result >48h from time of admission, where COVID-19 diagnosis was not suspected upon admission. The projected sample size for 14 participating sites covering all study phases over winter-spring 2020/2021 in the United Kingdom is 2,380 patients. The intervention is the return of a sequence report, within 48 hours in one phase (rapid local lab) and within 5-10 days in a second phase (mimicking central lab use), comparing the viral genome from an eligible study participant with others within and outside the hospital site. The primary outcomes are the incidence of Public Health England (PHE)/IPC-defined SARS-CoV-2 hospital-acquired infection during the baseline and two interventional phases, and proportion of hospital-onset cases with genomic evidence of transmission linkage following implementation of the intervention where such linkage was not suspected by initial IPC investigation. Secondary outcomes include incidence of hospital outbreaks, with and without sequencing data; actual and desirable changes to IPC actions; periods of healthcare worker (HCW) absence. A process evaluation using qualitative interviews with HCWs will be conducted alongside the study and analysis, underpinned by iterative programme theory of the sequence report. Health economic analysis will be conducted to determine cost-benefit of the intervention, and whether this leads to economic advantages within the NHS setting.

In this study, an analysis of the key parameters of the kerosene caustic wash process was conducted to improve the total performance of the treatment process. The investigated parameters are caustic concentration (from 0.03 to 3.0 wt%), caustic volume (from 110% of theoretical to 250%), number of treatment stages (one and two stages), wash water type (demineralized water and alkaline soft water), and wash water volume (10% and 30% of kerosene feed volume). Results revealed that the reaction between sodium hydroxide and naphthenic acids is a diffusion-controlled chemical reaction. The diluted caustic solutions (0.5 wt%) are better than the concentrated ones (3 wt%). Higher excess caustic volume has a slight effect on kerosene acidity. Performing the caustic treatment process in one stage is sufficient, and the two-stage process has no effect on acidity. Washing caustic-treated kerosene with demineralized water (pH=7) has a slight adverse effect on kerosene acidity. Increasing the demineralized water volume results in a slight increase in the acidity of the treated kerosene. Wash water should be slightly alkaline (pH 7.5C8) to prevent the reverse reaction of sodium naphthenates back into naphthenic acid.

It is therefore important to assess the usability of online learning methods, and to determine their feasibility and adequacy for medical students. We aimed to provide an overview of the situation experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of medical students regarding electronic medical education. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with medical students from more than 13 medical schools in Libya. A paper-based and online survey was conducted using email and social media. The survey requested demographic and socioeconomic information, as well as information related to medical online learning and electronic devices; medical education status during the COVID-19 pandemic; mental health assessments; and e-learning knowledge, attitudes, and practices. A total of 3,348 valid questionnaires were retrieved. Most respondents (64.7%) disagreed that e-learning could be implemented easily in Libya. While 54.1% of the respondents agreed that interactive discussion is achievable by means of e-learning. However, only 21.1% agreed that e-learning could be used for clinical aspects, as compared with 54.8% who disagreed with this statement and 24% who were neutral. Only 27.7% of the respondents had participated in online medical educational programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 65% reported using the internet for participating in study groups and discussions. There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet. As such, the pandemic will undeniably continue to disrupt medical education and training. As we face the prospect of a second wave of virus transmission, we must take certain measures and make changes to minimize the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical education and on the progression of training. The time for change is now, and there should be support and enthusiasm for providing valid solutions to reduce this disruption, such as online training and virtual clinical experience.

The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case zero that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R(0))and the effective reproduction number (R(e)) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. METHODS: To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the effective per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R(0) and the evolution of the effective reproduction number R(e). To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to forecast the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. RESULTS: Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R(0) was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy. Furthermore the model predicted that until May 4, around 20% of the population in Lombardy has recovered (interquartile range: 10% to 30%).","output":"Tracing day-zero and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy: A compartmental modelling and numerical optimization approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was responsible for over 4 million confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, of which more than 300,000 cases were confirmed to be dead as of May 2020. The virulent endocytotic activities of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Previous studies on the viral activation of TMPRSS2 focused most often than not on the isoform 2 of TMPRSS2, but the isoform 1 (529 residues) has also been shown to be expressed in target cells and contribute to viral activation in host. The inhibition of TMPRSS2 has been reported to grossly reduce the pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV-2 endocytotic activities. In this study therefore, we developed two machine learning models using random forest classifier (RFC) and neural networks (NNs) based on 2251 serine protease inhibitors to screen a database of 21,000,000 virtual compounds. We screened the hit compounds using absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties and finally docked the filtered compounds into the predicted binding site of TMPRSS2 isoform 1 homology model to determine their corresponding binding affinity and plausible molecular interactions. One (ASONN) and four (ASOIRFC1C4) lead compounds were obtained from the ADME-NN and RFC filtered hits, respectively, having better binding affinity and lead-likeness properties than those of camostat; this could be due to extensive hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions.","output":"Identification of lead inhibitors of TMPRSS2 isoform 1 of SARS-CoV-2 target using neural network, random forest, and molecular docking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on summarizing the factors that influence consumers purchasing of fruits and vegetables, by establishing the theoretical framework that describes the factors influencing the behavior of purchasing enterprise brand fruits, designing the questionnaire, collecting data, and analyzing the data of 312 consumers by binary logistic regression, this article finds that there are mainly 6 factors influencing the behavior of purchasing enterprise brand fruits, namely, gender, the convenience of purchase, taste, evaluation after tasting, tasted or not, and whether relatives or friends buy.

Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 g/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro. Intranasal administration of LL37 to C57 mice infected with adenovirus expressing human ACE2 either before or after pseudovirion invasion decreased lung infection.

The way in which MSMEs deal with crises and the extent to which environmental performance is beneficial when the market suffers a negative shock is relatively unexplored in the literature. We consider three aspects of financing -- firm level liquidity, bank credit and bankruptcy probabilities -- and argue that it pays for firms to show commitment to environmental responsibilities in a global pandemic. Through an examination of 3,356 MSMEs, we find that firms with better environmental performance reduce their probability of bankruptcies and their liquidities decreasing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, analysis shows that the impact of a firms environmental performance is more pronounced in sensitive industries (hospitality and retail). The results are robust based on a series of robustness checks, including propensity score matching and the Heckman two-stage sample selection model.

Serologic assays detecting antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid proteins have been developed to advance our understanding of the prognosis and clinical course of the COVID-19 disease. We recently developed a red cell agglutination-based assay to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. This assay uses peptide fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to label red cells (C19-kodecytes). We performed a clinical evaluation of this C19-kodecyte assay in COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors previously assessed with 2 commercial immunoassays and a virus neutralizing assay. Methods. Red cells were coated with peptide fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We tested plasma samples from 140 CCP donors. The results were compared with those of a virus neutralizing assay and 2 commercial chemiluminescent antibody tests: anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (IgG, IgM and IgA) assay and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Ortho). Inter-rater agreement between the different assays was measured using Cohen's kappa. Specificity was tested with 150 plasma samples, collected in 2008, more than a decade before the COVID-19 outbreak and with 125 plasma samples, collected in 2020 from consecutive healthy volunteer donors, who tested negative for the Ortho Total assay. Testing was performed using the column agglutination technique commonly employed for blood typing. Results. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the C19-kodecyte assay reached 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93 - 0.97) with sensitivity of 92.8% (95% CI: 86.9% - 96.3%) and specificity of 96.3% (95% CI: 93.2% - 98.1%). In almost all of the 40 CCP donors with longitudinal data, the antibody concentration decreased during the follow-up, which ranged from 7 to 44 weeks. In the 140 CCP donors, we compared the C19-kodecyte score to the antibody concentrations from the 2 FDA authorized assays (Ortho Total and Ortho IgG) and the titer in the neutralizing assay. There was a positive relationship between the results of all 4 assays. The Spearman's correlation of our assay was 0.20 with the neutralizing assay (0.49 with IgG, and 0.41 with Total assays). Conclusions. Sensitivity and specificity of the C19-kodecyte assay were within the minimum performance range required by the FDA for EUA authorization of serology tests. The limited correlation in assay reaction strengths suggested that the assays may be influenced by different antibody specificities. Unlike the other 84 FDA authorized serologic tests for SARS-CoV-2, this C19-kodecyte assay is a simple and rapid test that can be easily established in any blood typing laboratory worldwide using its routine setup for column agglutination or tube technique. The technique could vastly improve assay capacity, particularly in resource limited hospital blood banks.

We show that while all channel protonation states are surprisingly stable, only systems with two or more charged histidines are appreciably conductive. The structural switch, from a uniprotonated to a biprotonated channel, causes an electrostatic repulsion between the charged histidines that pushes the helices apart.

In this study, we determined the crystal structure of 3CLpro with the C-terminal prosequence and the catalytic-site C145A mutation, in which the enzyme binds the C-terminal prosequence of another molecule. Surprisingly, Phe at the P3' position [Phe(P3')] is snugly accommodated in the S3' pocket. Mutations of Phe(P3') impaired the C-terminal autoprocessing, but did not affect N-terminal autoprocessing. This difference was ascribed to the P2 residue, Phe(P2) and Leu(P2), in the C- and N-terminal sites, as follows. The S3' subsite is formed by Phe(P2)-induced conformational changes of 3CLpro and the direct involvement of Phe(P2) itself. In contrast, the N-terminal prosequence with Leu(P2) does not cause such conformational changes for the S3' subsite formation. In fact, the mutation of Phe(P2) to Leu in the C-terminal autoprocessing site abolishes the dependence on Phe(P3'). These mechanisms explain why Phe is required at the P3' position when the P2 position is occupied by Phe rather than Leu, which reveals a type of subsite cooperativity. Moreover, the peptide consisting of P4-P1 with Leu(P2) inhibits protease activity, whereas that with Phe(P2) exhibits a much smaller inhibitory effect, because Phe(P3') is missing. Thus, this subsite cooperativity likely exists to avoid the autoinhibition of the enzyme by its mature C-terminal sequence, and to retain the efficient C-terminal autoprocessing by the use of Phe(P2).","output":"SARS-CoV 3CL protease cleaves its C-terminal autoprocessing site by novel subsite cooperativity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In India and global mental health, a key component of the care gap for people with mental health problems is poor system engagement with the contexts and priorities of community members. This study aimed to explore the nature of community mental health systems by conducting a participatory community assessment of the assets and needs for mental health in Uttarkashi, a remote district in North India. METHODS The data collection and analysis process were emergent, iterative, dialogic and participatory. Transcripts of 28 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with key informants such as traditional healers, people with lived experience and doctors at the government health centres (CHCs), as well as 10 participatory rural appraisal (PRA) meetings with 120 people in community and public health systems, were thematically analysed. The 753 codes were grouped into 93 categories and ultimately nine themes and three meta-themes (place, people, practices), paying attention to equity. RESULTS Yamuna valley was described as both 'blessed' and limited by geography, with bountiful natural resources enhancing mental health, yet remoteness limiting access to care. The people described strong norms of social support, yet hierarchical with entrenched exclusions related to caste and gender, and social conformity that limited social accountability of services. Care practices were porous, pluralist and fragmented, with operational primary care services that acknowledged traditional care providers, and trusted resources for mental health such as traditional healers (malis) and government health workers (accredited social health activists. ASHAs). Yet care was often absent or limited by being experienced as disrespectful or of low quality. CONCLUSION Findings support the value of participatory methods, and policy actions that address power relations as well as social determinants within community and public health systems. To improve mental health in this remote setting and other South Asian rural locations, community and public health systems must dialogue with the local context, assets and priorities and be socially accountable.","output":"Exploring Community Mental Health Systems - A Participatory Health Needs and Assets Assessment in the Yamuna Valley, North India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the United States, bioethicist Arthur L.

Recent clinical data has highlighted that COVID-19 is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications ranging from microvascular thrombosis, venous thromboembolic disease and stroke. Importantly, thrombotic complications are markers of severe COVID-19 and are associated with multi-organ failure and increased mortality. The evidence to date supports the concept that the thrombotic manifestations of severe COVID-19 is due to the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to invade endo?thelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed on the endothelial cell surface. However, in patients with COVID-19 the subsequent endothelial inflammation, complement activation, thrombin generation, platelet and leukocyte recruitment, and the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses culminate in immunothrombosis, ultimately causing (micro)thrombotic compli?cations such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and stroke. Accordingly, the activation of coagulation (e.g. as measured with plasma D-dimer) and thrombocytopenia have emerged as prognostic markers in COVID-19. Given thrombotic complications are central determinants of the high mortality rate in COVID-19, strategies to prevent thrombosis are of critical importance. A number of antithrombotic drugs have been proposed as potential therapies to prevent COVID-19-associated thrombosis, including, heparin, FXII inhibitors, fibrinolytic drugs, nafamostat and dipyridamole, many of which also possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory or anti-viral effects. The growing awareness and mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic state of COVID-19 patients is driving efforts to more stringent diagnostic screening for thrombotic compli?cations and to the early institution of antithrombotic drugs, for both the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. The shifting paradigm of diagnostic and treatment strategies holds significant promise to reduce the burden of thrombotic complications and ultimately improve the prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","output":"The Emerging Threat of (Micro)Thrombosis in COVID-19 and Its Therapeutic Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent theories stress the role of situational information in understanding others' behaviour.

Then, this path became blocked, and for test trials only the other path was passable. Results demonstrated that in test trials younger and older adults anticipated that the agent would take the continuous path, indicating that they took the situational constraints into account. In contrast, 2- and 5-year-olds anticipated that the agent would take the blocked path, indicating that they still relied on the agent's previous observed behaviour and-contrary to claims by the teleological stance theory-did not take the situational constraints into account.

This study examines time to first specialist outpatient visit following ED discharge for AFF. METHODS: Alberta residents aged  35 years with ED presentations for AFF ending in discharge during 2017-2018 were extracted and linked with hospitalizations and physician claims. A spatial scan and multinomial logistic regression were performed. Regression model predictors included demographics, prior diagnoses, and prior health service use. RESULTS: ED presentations for 4387 patients (54% male; mean age 68 years) were analyzed. Two geographic areas were identified as clusters that had longer times than would be expected by chance: a north cluster of northern areas with an estimated median time of 98 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 82,139), and an east cluster of eastern areas with a median of 57 days (95% CI 47, 68). Patients in the north cluster were more likely to be younger (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.76 per 5 years, 95% CI 0.62, 0.93) and have prior histories of AFF (aOR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.11, 1.90), congestive heart failure (aOR=1.51, 95% CI 1.15, 1.98), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aOR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.55, 2.65), and diabetes (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.00, 1.67).

Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA).

METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature to identify all COVID-19 serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples collected by February 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analysed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible. RESULTS: In most locations in developing countries, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age cohorts, underscoring the limited capacity that these nations have to protect older age groups. Age-specific IFRs were roughly 2 times higher than in high-income countries. The median value of the population IFR was about 0.5%, similar to that of high-income countries, because disparities in healthcare access were roughly offset by differences in population age structure. CONCLUSION: The burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare.

Design/methodology/approach The paper utilizes qualitative research approach based on six exploratory case studies. The in-depth interviews in two phases were conducted with owners/mangers of ethnic minority entrepreneurial restaurants. Findings The findings reveal that all studied case firms undertook quick adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, staff working hours were reduced through mutual consultation, and readjustments to the supply chain were made so that critical ingredients remain available despite the forced lockdown and supply chain bottlenecks. However, the readjustment of the supply chain was not visible in all case firms. Some of the owner-managers who were interviewed decided to keep doing business with the ethnic minority suppliers, despite some transportation problems due to lockdowns, especially in the early phases of COVID-19. Findings also suggest that the support grants announced by the state appeared not to be particularly useful for these restaurants due to restrictive eligibility criteria that many microbusinesses potentially fail to meet. Finally, the sample microbusinesses (restaurants) entrepreneurs recognize the importance of home delivery for their business survival, although they were critical of online food delivery service providers (apps) due to their high charges. Some of the case restaurants gave customers incentives for directly ordering from them, as an alternative strategy. Originality/value This paper is one of the first studies to specifically highlight the peculiarities of ethnic minority entrepreneurship and survival dynamics in northern Finland, where running the restaurant operations, including ensuring the supply chain management, is more complex than in the case of ethnic minority restaurants in more well-connected European countries and cities with an established history of immigrant businesses.

In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if Vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance.

Mediation analyses further revealed that human mobility only statistically influenced infection rate but not case-fatality ratio, and such mediation effects varied substantially among racial/ethnic compositions. Last, robustness check of racial gradient at census block group level documented consistent associations but greater magnitude. Taken together, these findings suggest that US residents responses to COVID-19 are subject to an entrenched and consequential racial/ethnic divide.","output":"Do racial and ethnic disparities in following stay-at-home orders influence COVID-19 health outcomes?

We assessed the prevalence and disparities of economic hardships and their impact on health deterioration in Japan. METHODS: Data were obtained from a nation-wide, cross-sectional, internet-based, self-reported survey conducted during AugustCSeptember, 2020 with individuals aged 15C79 years in Japan (n = 25,482). Economic hardships and changes in various physical and mental health status were measured using sample-weighted data. Adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) were estimated to investigate the associations between economic hardships and health outcomes. RESULTS: During AprilCSeptember, 2020 in Japan, 25.0%, 9.6%, 7.9%, and 3.1% of the respondents experienced income loss, money shortage, financial anxiety and financial exploitation, respectively, with higher prevalence among workers (vs non-workers). Stratifying by sex and working status, income loss was associated with physical health deterioration (APRs ranged from 1.45C1.95), mental health deterioration (APRs ranged from 1.47C1.68), and having serious psychological distress (APRs ranged from 1.41C2.01) across all strata. Shortage of money and financial anxiety were also associated with increased likelihood of all adverse health outcomes assessed, regardless of whether the hardships were pre-existing or experienced first time. Among non-working individuals, financial exploitation was associated with physical health deterioration among males (APR 1.88) and mental health deterioration among both males (APR 1.80) and females (APR 2.23), while such associations were not observed among working individuals. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, COVID-19-related economic hardships were associated with physical and mental health deterioration in Japan, particularly among the vulnerable populations. Timely and prompt responses are warranted to mitigate both economic and health burdens.","output":"Economic Hardships and Self-reported Deterioration of Physical and Mental Health Under the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Study, 2020, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study identified the factors associated with the Quality of Nursing Work Life (QNWL) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Although outbreaks have emerged amongst communities of international migrant workers worldwide, little is known about how they perceive the government's response or their exposure to rumors. Methods: Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, we surveyed 1011 low-waged migrant workers involved in dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Participants reported their confidence in the government; whether they had heard, shared, or believed widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors; and their socio-demographics. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with confidence and rumor exposure. Results: 1 in 2 participants (54.2%, 95% CI: 51.1-57.3%) reported that they believed at least one COVID-19 rumor. This incidence was higher than that observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). Nonetheless, most participants (90.0%, 95% CI: 87.6-91.5%) reported being confident that the government could control the spread of COVID-19. Age was significantly associated with belief in rumors, while educational level was associated with confidence in government.

The seasonality of exacerbations varies with latitude, and is greater in more temperate climates, where there may be less protection from outdoor and indoor cold exposure. The precise causes of the seasonality are unknown, but thought to be partly due to the increased prevalence of respiratory viral infections circulating in cold, damp conditions.

COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal; while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine two factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread and the risks of basing strategy on untested claims, such as potential protective value of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine. Results: Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. An early study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are would have informed policy on nonpharmaceutical interventions but could still be of value to understand containment during vaccine roll out. Conclusions: When a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread.

Healthcare professionals (HCP) who deal with dementia and related disorders face enormous challenges in delivering healthcare using digital devices, and Covid-19 pandemic showed these pitfalls should be addressed. Technology solutions in elder people are being developed, not every HCP is heard, and we lack information about what these professionals think about this. METHODS Using structured questionnaires and asynchronous electrotonic data capture, we asked experienced (84.3% postgraduate degrees) HCP with different backgrounds (8 practice areas) about what they think of technology use among their patients and carers. The average person in our sample (N = 51) was a highly skilled (22.2 study-years) female (70.6%) medical doctor (62.8%) aged 39.1 years old (27 to 77 years), highly exposed to digiTech (68.6% mobile devices usage 4 hours/day). Neurologists (37.3%), neuropsychologists (15.7%), psychiatrists (13.7%), geriatricians (11.8%) were the most represented groups. This observational cross-sectional study is part of a Brazilian pilot study to explore technology usage in higher risk dementia adults (DigiTAU Project). RESULTS Although HCP consider asking patients and carers about technology use to be theoretically important (90.2%) and useful in practice (94.2%), they often do not do it (45.1%). There is incongruity when they feel safe to offer interventions by digital means (58.8%) but commonly agree, on average, that HCP are not prepared to use digiTech (51.0%). Despite having positive views towards benefits in adopting digiTech for patients (98.1%), they think they bring more benefits to families and caregivers than to patients themselves (56.9%). HCP consider digiTech will change their practice in the short term within 1 year (58.8%) and within 5 years (88.3%). None of the 8 options suggested as the most \\"promising\\" technology in 10 years reaches more than 25% of the choices. CONCLUSIONS HCP have conflicting views about the usage of technologies by their patients and caregivers but expect some positive changes in their work practice.

This study aims to research the relationship between lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and prognosis in AIS patients treated with intravenous rtPA. METHOD: This study (a Multicenter Clinical Trial of Revascularization Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke, TRAIS) included 527 AIS patients in 5 cooperative medical institutions in China from January 2018 to February 2021. The primary outcome was major disability and death within 3 months (mRS score of 3C6), and the secondary outcomes were early neurological improvement (ENI), early neurological deterioration (END), moderate-severe cerebral edema (CE), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). RESULTS: The mean age of the 527 patients was 65.6  11.7 years, and the median baseline NIHSS score was 4 (interquartile range, 2C7). The median serum LDH level was 184 U/L (interquartile range, 163C212 U/L). In total, 287 (54.5%) patients acquired ENI, 68 (13.0%) patients suffered END, 53 (12.1%) patients were observed with moderate-severe CE, and 28 (6.2%) patients showed sICH. Within 3 months, 127 (25.15%) patients experienced the primary outcome and 42 (8.3%) patients died. Serum LDH levels before thrombolysis showed an independent association with the risk of primary outcome [adjusted odds ratio, 3.787; (95% CI, 1.525C9.404); P = 0.014]. When log-transformed LDH increased each standard deviation, the risk of primary outcome was raised by 80.1% (95% CI, 28.9C251.7%). A positive linear dependence between the risk of primary outcome and serum LDH levels (P of linearity = 0.0248, P of non-linearity = 0.8284) was shown in multivariable-adjusted spline regression models. Pre-thrombolysis LDH quartile also provided a conventional risk model and significant improvement of the prediction for clinical outcomes, with a net reclassification improvement index (NRI) = 41.86% (P < 0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) = 4.68% (P < 0.001).

This questionnaire study aims to evaluate Canadian critical care and emergency department nurses readiness to follow IPC guidelines in their workplace, and to understand their perceptions of trust in organizational preparedness, communication, and infection risk. METHODS: We adapted an internationally distributed survey for the Canadian context. This cross-sectional questionnaire, incorporating validated scales for items including institutional trust, was distributed by email to nurses via the Canadian Association of Critical Care Nurses and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians networks between 16 March and 25 May 2020. We evaluated intensive care unit and emergency department nurses adherence to IPC protocols, barriers and facilitators to IPC guideline adherence, and their level of institutitonal trust. RESULTS: Three hundred and nineteen nurses responded to the survey. There was higher trust in organizational preparedness among nurses who were older (B = 0.31, P < 0.001) and more experienced (F = 18.09, P < 0.001), and particularly among those with previous experience working in outbreak settings (F = 7.87, P = 0.005). Compared with those without experience working in outbreak settings, respondents with this experience reported higher levels of fear of becoming ill and fear of providing care for COVID-19 patients ((2) = 21.48, P = 0.002 and (2) = 12.61, P = 0.05, respectively). Older and more experienced nurses reported greater comfort with IPC skills and easier access to personal protective equipment. While the vast majority (96%) of respondents reported using masks and gloves, only 83% had access to isolation facilities for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Canadian nurses had strong self-reported adherence to IPC measures and personal protective equipment use. There were high levels of trust in health system leadership to ensure protective measures are present and reliable. Trust was particularly high among older and more experienced nurses despite these populations reporting higher levels of fear of personal illness.

The goal of this study was to investigate the replication and transmission of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs. Following direct intranasal inoculation of animals, the virus was detected in nasal washes of infected animals during the first 7 days postinfection. High viral titers were obtained from nasal turbinates and lung tissues of directly inoculated animals. Further, bovine FLUDV was able to transmit from the infected guinea pigs to sentinel animals by means of contact and not by aerosol dissemination under the experimental conditions tested in this study. Despite exhibiting no clinical signs, infected guinea pigs developed seroconversion and the viral antigen was detected in lungs of animals by immunohistochemistry. The observation that bovine FLUDV replicated in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs was similar to observations described previously in studies of gnotobiotic calves and pigs experimentally infected with bovine FLUDV but different from those described previously in experimental infections in ferrets and swine with a swine FLUDV, which supported virus replication only in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lower respiratory tract, including lung. Our study established that guinea pigs could be used as an animal model for studying this newly emerging influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel emerging pathogen with bovine as its primary host. The epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus are not yet known. FLUDV also spreads to swine, and the presence of FLUDV-specific antibodies in humans could indicate that there is a potential for zoonosis. Our results showed that bovine FLUDV replicated in the nasal turbinate and lungs of guinea pigs at high titers and was also able to transmit from an infected animal to sentinel animals by contact. The fact that bovine FLUDV replicated productively in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of guinea pigs, similarly to virus infection in its native host, demonstrates that guinea pigs would be a suitable model host to study the replication and transmission potential of bovine FLUDV.","output":"Replication and Transmission of the Novel Bovine Influenza D Virus in a Guinea Pig Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the changes in vertical equity across different types of tax filing families during the span of a series of drastic personal income tax reforms in Taiwan. The newly enacted 2016 Taxpayer Rights Protection Act has brought unprecedented challenges to the tax authoritys distributional goal and revenue stability. Utilizing the administrative tax return data collected by the Ministry of Finances Fiscal Information Agency between 2016 and 2018, we show that while the income tax has contributed to improving equality in income distribution, the effects, however, were limited and even declined slightly in recent years. We also found that distributions of tax benefits are generally regressive, especially among itemized and special deductions. It is also shown that the personal exemption and the adjustments of basic living expenses provided comparably more relief to households with dependents than to those claiming no dependents. According to our two-parameter metric encompassing the usage rates and the tax-benefit distributions for each deduction, we found that itemized deductions and special deductions, in general, are regressive. Specifically, we calculate and compare different representative families tax payments before and after the reform. While the tax reform has helped reduce many tax-filing families tax liabilities, most tax benefits generated from the expansion of exemptions and deductions would likely be enjoyed by families with higher incomes. In a broader reform-minded context, the analysis cautions the tax authority in Taiwan and equity pursuing policy makers in other countries not to prioritize an overarching short-term equity goal over long-term revenue stabilization. Phasing out or capping some of the itemized deductions such as donations and special deductions related to discretionary purchasing decisions looks to be a promising reform path toward improving equity and restoring revenue stability.","output":"Which Families Benefited from the Recent Personal Income Tax Reform in Taiwan: Evidence from the Administrative Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of trace protein biomarkers is essential in the diagnostic field.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of race and ethnicity with COVID-19 outcomes and to examine the association between race, ethnicity, COVID-19 outcomes, and socioeconomic determinants. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Embase, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 databases was performed for studies published from January 1, 2020, to January 6, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that reported data on associations between race and ethnicity and COVID-19 positivity, disease severity, and socioeconomic status were included and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Studies that did not have a satisfactory quality score were excluded. Overall, less than 1% (0.47%) of initially identified studies met selection criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Associations were assessed using adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs), combined prevalence, and metaregression. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main measures were RRs, ORs, and combined prevalence values. RESULTS: A total of 4 318 929 patients from 68 studies were included in this meta-analysis.

Pathogen reduction can mitigate this risk; thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) pathogen reduction technology on the functional properties of COVID-19 CP (CCP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: COVID-19 convalescent plasma units (n = 6) from recovered COVID-19 research donors were treated with R + UV. Pre- and post-treatment samples were tested for coagulation factor and immunoglobulin retention. Antibody binding to spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), S1 and S2 epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by ELISA. Neutralizing antibody (nAb) function was assessed by pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RESULTS: Mean retention of coagulation factors was &#8805;70%, while retention of immunoglobulins was 100%. Starting nAb titres were low, but PRNT50 titres did not differ between pre- and post-treatment samples. No statistically significant differences were detected in levels of IgG (P &#8805; 03665) and IgM (P &#8805; 01208) antibodies to RBD, S1 and S2 proteins before and after treatment.

This gender brilliance stereotype emerges early and may undermine women's engagement in many prestigious careers. However, past research on its acquisition has focused almost exclusively on American children's beliefs of White people's intellectual talents. Therefore, less is known about how this stereotype develops in non-Western cultures and whether children consider other social identities such as race in forming this stereotype. To address these issues, the present research (a) provided the first cross-cultural test examining its development in 5- to 7-year-old Chinese and American children and (b) compared children's gender brilliance stereotype of White people with that of Asian people. Studies 1 (N = 96; Chinese children) and 2 (N = 96; Chinese children) revealed that, similar to American children, Chinese children associated brilliance with White men (vs. White women) around the age of 6. In contrast, Studies 3 (N = 96; Chinese children) and 4 (N = 96; American children; 76.9% White) showed that 5- to 7-year-old children from both cultures associated brilliance with Asian women (vs. Asian men). The results suggest that the gender stereotype about brilliance has a racial component and may be culturally consistent. Overall, these findings add to our knowledge of children's acquisition of the gender stereotype about brilliance in non-Western cultural contexts and highlight the importance of considering multiple social identities to understand the acquisition of stereotypes.

METHODS: 148 symptomatic and 144 asymptomatic adults were included. A nasal swab was collected for testing by Quidel Sofia SARS IFA (Sofia) as point of care. A nasopharyngeal swab was also collected and transported to the laboratory for testing by Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV RT-PCR (Cepheid). RESULTS: Overall, Sofia had good agreement with Cepheid (> 95%) in adults, however was less sensitive. Sofia had a sensitivity of 87.8% and 33.3% for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, respectively. Among symptomatic patients, testing > 5 days post symptom onset resulted in lower sensitivity (82%) when compared with testing within 5 days of symptom onset (90%). Of the four Sofia false-negative results in the asymptomatic cohort, 50% went on to develop COVID-19 disease within 5 days of testing. Specificity in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Sofia has acceptable performance in symptomatic adults when tested < 5 days of symptom onset. Caution should be taken when testing patients with  5 days of symptoms. The combination of low prevalence and reduced sensitivity results in relatively poor performance of in asymptomatic patients.

The objective of this study is to gain insight into the behavioral intention of nurses, i.e. chinese nurses of the future, to use a mobile nursing application. This study adopted an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to examine Chinese nurses acceptance of a mobile nursing application. METHODS: A total of 1207 nurses participated in the cross-sectional survey. The majority of nurses were female (96.2%). The mean age of the participants was 34.18 (SD 7.39). The hypothesized relationships were tested using AMOS structural equation model. RESULTS: All constructs exhibited an acceptable level of reliability and validity with C and CR > 0.7 and AVE > 0.5. An extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model had good explanatory power for nurses behavioral intention of a mobile nursing application. Although effort expectancy and perceived risks had a surprisingly insignificant effect on nurses behavioral intention to use a mobile nursing application, performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, self-efficacy, and perceived incentives demonstrated significant influence with  = .259, p < .001,  = .296, p < .001,  = .063, p = .037,  = .344, p < .001,  = .091, p = .001, respectively.

RESULTS: In surviving cases, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels decreased significantly on admission as compared with the levels before infection; the LDL levels remained constantly low during the disease progression and resumed to the original levels when patients recovered (pre-infection: 3.5 (3.0-4.4); on admission: 2.8 (2.3-3.1), pa?<a?0.01; progression: 2.5 (2.3-3.0); discharge: 3.6 (2.7-4.1); median (IQR), in mmol/L). In non-surviving patients, LDL levels showed an irreversible and continuous decrease until death (1.1 (0.9-1.2), pa?=a?0.02 versus the levels on admission). The ratio changes of LDL levels inversely correlated with ratio changes of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.

Providers often rely on syndromic management due to prolonged test turnaround times which can result in inappropriate treatment. METHODS This study retrospectively evaluated chlamydia and gonorrhea treatment accuracy of adults, men and women, aged 18 and older in four urgent cares in Northeast Iowa, using standard NAAT in a 6-month timeframe through medical records review. Seven hundred twenty-two visits were evaluated. RESULTS 25.8% (n=186/722) of patients were treated at the time of their visit, resulting in 68.8% (n=128/186) over-treatment and 8.2% (n=44/536) under-treatment. Logistic regression analysis found that treatment prescribed without diagnostic test results and the patient-collected vaginal swabs were predictors of inappropriate treatment. Patients who were treated in the clinic were significantly less likely to be treated appropriately compared to patients who were treated later based on test results (OR 0.04, CI 0.02-0.06). Patients that self-collected vaginal swabs had significantly lower odds of being treated appropriately (OR 0.04, CI 0.09-0.80).

The article was marked as recommended. Introduction: The abrupt discontinuation of medical student-patient contact due to the covid-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid change to virtual teaching. Student education was restructured to include online cases, small group discussions, synchronous and asynchronous lectures, and modified problem-based learning and team-based learning sessions. However, the key focus of the clerkship experience, contact with patients, was missing. Process: The Psychiatry Clerkship directors have previously provided complex simulated encounters to students using video-taped encounters of physician-simulated patient interactions to teach and assess student note writing skills. This concept was adapted to a live encounter for individual students on the psychiatry clerkship. Students reviewed the patient chart, performed the encounter, provided an oral patient presentation to faculty, and wrote a patient note. Individualized feedback was provided for each step of the process. Outcomes: The process was well received by students and faculty and provided an opportunity to directly observe student skills despite distancing from direct patient care. The simulated patients had a very positive experience and appreciated the opportunity to advance their own skills while contributing to student's education. Discussion: Removing students from clinical sites stimulated the rapid development of a process to observe learners involved in patient encounters. These educational sessions allowed direct observation of skills required in the initial evaluation of a patient presenting to psychiatry for care.","output":"Introducing Telepsychiatry to Medical Students with Simulated Patients: An Innovation by Necessity (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"If you have traveled internationally the past 2 months, you may have encountered them: health officers briefly pointing a thermometer gun at your forehead or watching as you go by to check for signs of a cough or difficulty breathing Many countries are now watching arriving and departing air passengers who might suffer from the viral disease COVID-19;some require passengers to fill out health declarations (Some also simply ban or quarantine those who have recently been in outbreak hot spots ) Exit and entry screening may look reassuring, but experience with other diseases shows its exceedingly rare for screeners to detect infected passengers Just last week, eight passengers who later tested positive for COVID-19 arrived in Shanghai from Italy and passed the airport screeners unnoticed, for example And even if screeners do find the occasional case, it has almost no impact on the course of an outbreak","output":"Why airport screening wont stop the spread of coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to the reports of microcephaly as a consistent outcome in the fetuses of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Brazil, Zika virus (ZIKV)microcephaly etiomechanistic relationship has recently been implicated. Researchers, however, are still struggling to establish an embryological basis for this interesting causal handcuff. The present study reveals robust evidence in favor of a plausible ZIKV-microcephaly cause-effect liaison. The rationale is based on: (1) sequence homology between ZIKV genome and the response element of an early neural tube developmental marker retinoic acid in human DNA and (2) comprehensive similarities between the details of brain defects in ZIKV-microcephaly and retinoic acid embryopathy. Retinoic acid is considered as the earliest factor for regulating anteroposterior axis of neural tube and positioning of structures in developing brain through retinoic acid response elements (RARE) consensus sequence (5CAGGTCAC3) in promoter regions of retinoic acid-dependent genes. We screened genomic sequences of already reported virulent ZIKV strains (including those linked to microcephaly) and other viruses available in National Institute of Health genetic sequence database (GenBank) for the RARE consensus repeats and obtained results strongly bolstering our hypothesis that ZIKV strains associated with microcephaly may act through precipitation of dysregulation in retinoic acid-dependent genes by introducing extra stretches of RARE consensus sequence repeats in the genome of developing brain cells. Additional support to our hypothesis comes from our findings that screening of other viruses for RARE consensus sequence repeats is positive only for those known to display neurotropism and cause fetal brain defects (for which maternal-fetal transmission during developing stage may be required). The numbers of RARE sequence repeats appeared to match with the virulence of screened positive viruses. Although, bioinformatic evidence and embryological features are in favor of our hypothesis, additional studies including animal models are warranted to validate our proposition. Such studies are likely to unfold ZIKV-microcephaly association and may help in devising methods to combat it.","output":"A Possible Mechanism of Zika Virus Associated Microcephaly: Imperative Role of Retinoic Acid Response Element (RARE) Consensus Sequence Repeats in the Viral Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The net effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on this northeastern, urban healthcare system during March, April and May 2020 was the redirection of virtually all resources to the care of the affected population. Conversion of the majority of the hospitals assets, including staff and infrastructure, to COVID care created a large reduction in resources for other clinical problems. The burn service was among those few essential disciplines that continued to receive acutely affected individuals during the crisis. The preservation of the burn centers ability to continue its mission within the walls of a COVID hospital is the subject of this review. METHODS: All of the hospitals ICU rooms, including all those on the burn unit, post anesthesia care units, some step-down units, and over 90% of the operating rooms (ORs) converted to COVID care ICUs. These vital actions by hospital administration enabled an increase in ICU beds from 114 to 270. Staff were redeployed to cover the massive influx of critical COVID patients. Burn inpatients during the transition were categorized by severity and age for disposition consideration. Of the 17 inpatients, 4 pediatric patients discharged home and 1 transferred to our associated childrens hospital; 7 adults discharged home, 2 transferred to our associated inpatient psychiatric hospital, 1 to inpatient rehab, and 2 transferred to a neighboring orthopedic hospital converted into an adult acute care hospital. The commitment to keep the burn center operational for both children and adults was facilitated by protecting the burn ICU hydrotherapy room, a large patient care space in the center of the burn ICU. Children, initially admitted and cared for in the hydrotherapy room until stable, transferred to our network Childrens hospital for continued care. Critical adult burns were admitted to the inpatient ICU with the COVID patients, acute burns were housed on the few remaining medical surgical units. Burn care was performed in the patients rooms to keep the hydrotherapy room clean. RESULTS: During the 3-month period described the burn service admitted and cared for 92 adult and 25 pediatric patients while maintaining a full ICU census. Although 3 admitted burn patients were COVID +, no burn patients housed in the ICU became COVID + during their stay. CONCLUSIONS: The commitment to protect the burn hydrotherapy space for burn triage and care from the top level of administration was critical and notable given the widespread conversion of the subspecialty ICUs and most other patient care areas to COVID care units. Strict adherence to infection prevention guidelines and protection of the hydrotherapy room allowed burn patients to receive timely and appropriate care during a pandemic.","output":"43 COVID Crisis: A Burn Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In SARS-COV-2 disease, anosmia and dysgeusia are symptoms that are usually detected together.

Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the association of mandatory mask-wearing policies with behaviors associated with the transmission of COVID-19. Objective: To assess the association of mask wearing with face-touching behavior among the general population in public areas. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used videos recorded in public transportation stations, streets, and parks among the general population in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe (ie, England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), and the US to analyze mask-wearing and face-touching behavior in public areas. Videos before the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded from January 2018 to October 2019, and those during the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded during February 2020 to March 2020 in China, Japan, and South Korea and during March 2020 in Western Europe and the US. Individuals who clearly displayed their face and face-touching behavior were included, and those whose behaviors were influenced by filming or public events were excluded. Exposures: Mandatory mask-wearing policies enacted at various time points in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, and the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of individuals wearing masks and incidence of face touching. Results: This study included 4699 individuals before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2887 individuals during the pandemic. During the periods studied, mask wearing increased in all regions except the US, from 20 of 1745 individuals (1.1%) to 1090 of 1097 individuals (99.4%) in mainland China (P < .001), 44 of 1422 individuals (3.1%) to 346 of 893 individuals (38.7%) in Japan (P < .001), 6 of 717 individuals (0.8%) to 277 of 324 individuals (85.5% ) in South Korea (P < .001), 1 of 546 individuals (0.2%) to 6 of 379 individuals (1.6%) in Western Europe (P = .02), and 1 of 269 individuals (0.4%) to 4 of 194 individuals (2.1%) in the US (P = .17). Surgical masks were predominant in China (989 masks [89.1%]), and fabric masks were predominant in the other regions (Japan: 371 masks [95.1%]; South Korea: 240 masks [84.8%]; Western Europe: 6 masks [85.7%]; US: 5 masks [100%]). Face-touching behaviors decreased from before COVID-19 to during COVID-19 among individuals in China (72 incidences of 1745 observations [4.1%] to 12 incidences of 1097 observations [1.1%]; P < .001), South Korea (80 incidences of 717 observations [11.2%] to 7 incidences of 324 observations [2.2%]; P < .001), and Europe (62 incidences of 546 observations [11.4%] to 23 incidences of 379 observations [6.1%]; P = .01). Logistic regression found that mask wearing was associated with a reduction in face touching in China (odds ratio [OR], 3.91; 95% CI, 2.11-7.24) and South Korea (OR, 6.69; 95% CI, 2.69-16.69) and of touching the nose, mouth, and eyes (China: OR, 8.60; 95% CI, 2.65-27.86; South Korea: OR, 29.27; 95% CI, 1.79-478.22). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that mandatory mask-wearing policies were associated with increased mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mask wearing was associated with reduced face-touching behavior, especially touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which may prevent contact transmission of COVID-19 among the general population in public areas.","output":"Comparison of Face-Touching Behaviors Before and During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has gravely affected societies around the world.

At Salisbury Foundation Trust (SFT), during phase one of the NHS response to Covid-19, the decision to treat upper limb trauma patients in-person or remotely was made using clinical screening criteria. For many patients, audio-visual appointments offered a practical, time efficient way of accessing their reconstructive team for assessment, advice and post-operative care. However, a subset of patients was identified by the team as requiring at least one in-person consultation to minimize perceived clinical risk and to optimize quality outcomes. In order to understand more fully the challenges and successes of technology-enabled care to date, a national survey of practice across hand units in the UK was conducted.

This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of adolescents. METHODS: A cohort study with schoolchildren from southern Brazil was conducted. Data on adolescents' OHRQoL were collected from December 2019 to February 2020 (T1), before the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak. Posteriorly, the data were collected again in June and July of 2020 (T2), under the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak. The OHRQoL was assessed using the Brazilian short version of the CPQ11-14. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the degree of social distancing were also assessed. Changes in OHRQoL between T1 and T2 were evaluated by adjusted Multilevel Poisson regression models for repeated measures. RESULTS: From 290 individuals evaluated at T1, 207 were reevaluated at T2 (response rate of 71.3%). The overall CPQ11-14 mean score was significantly lower during the pandemic, reducing from 10.8 at T1 to 7.7 at T2. This significant reduction was also observed for all CPQ domains, indicating a lower negative impact of oral conditions on adolescents' quality of life during the pandemic. Adolescents from families that had a middle or low degree of social distancing during the pandemic and whose parents were harmed in employment had higher CPQ11-14 scores. CONCLUSION: Overall and specific-domains CPQ-14 scores were significantly lower during the Brazilian Covid-19 outbreak, indicating a decrease in the perception of oral health problems by adolescents over that period.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic reduces the negative perception of oral health-related quality of life in adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acquired somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (clonal hematopoiesis or CH) are associated with advanced age, increased risk of cardiovascular and malignant diseases, and decreased overall survival. 1-4 These adverse sequelae may be mediated by altered inflammatory profiles observed in patients with CH. 2,5,6 A pro-inflammatory immunologic profile is also associated with worse outcomes of certain infections, including SARS-CoV-2 and its associated disease Covid-19. 7,8 Whether CH predisposes to severe Covid-19 or other infections is unknown.

To understand the pathogenicity and antigenic potential of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop therapeutic tools, it is essential to profile the full repertoire of its expressed proteins. The current map of SARS-CoV-2 coding capacity is based on computational predictions and relies on homology with other coronaviruses. As the protein complement varies among coronaviruses, especially in regard to the variety of accessory proteins, it is crucial to characterize the specific range of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in an unbiased and open-ended manner. Here, using a suite of ribosome-profiling techniques2-4, we present a high-resolution map of coding regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which enables us to accurately quantify the expression of canonical viral open reading frames (ORFs) and to identify 23 unannotated viral ORFs. These ORFs include upstream ORFs that are likely to have a regulatory role, several in-frame internal ORFs within existing ORFs, resulting in N-terminally truncated products, as well as internal out-of-frame ORFs, which generate novel polypeptides. We further show that viral mRNAs are not translated more efficiently than host mRNAs; instead, virus translation dominates host translation because of the high levels of viral transcripts.

Methods: The target population was all Iranian people aged six years and older in the country. A stratified random sampling design was used to select 28,314 subjects from among the individuals registered in the electronic health record systems used in primary health care in Iran. Venous blood was taken from each participant and tested for the IgG antibody against COVID-19. The prevalence of COVID-19 was estimated at provincial and national levels after adjusting for the measurement error of the laboratory test, non-response bias, and sampling design. Results: Of the 28,314 Iranians selected, 11,256 (39.75%) participated in the study. Of these, 5406 (48.0%) were male, and 6851 (60.9%) lived in urban areas. The mean (standard deviation) participant age was 35.89 (18.61) years. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until August 20, 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.3%, 15.2%), which was equal to 11,958,346 (95% confidence interval: 11,211,011-12,746,776) individuals. The prevalence of infection was 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7%, and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population, and individuals 60 years of age and older, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan, and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence, and Alborz, Hormozgan, and Kerman provinces had the lowest. Conclusions: Based on the study results, a large proportion of the Iranian population had not yet been infected by COVID-19.

MethodsBetween 22 June to 11 October 2020, we surveyed 1011 low-waged migrant workers involved in dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Participants reported their confidence in the government; whether they had heard, shared, or believed widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors; and their socio-demographics. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with confidence and rumor exposure. Results1 in 2 participants (54.2%, 95% CI: 51.1-57.3%) reported that they believed at least one COVID-19 rumor. This incidence was higher than that observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). Nonetheless, most participants (90.0%, 95% CI: 87.6-91.5%) reported being confident that the government could control the spread of COVID-19.

In this study pathology services were investigated as a proxy for cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment delays to assess the effect of the pandemic on oncology services. In order to quantify the impact of COVID-19 we reviewed all pathology reports from January 1 through November 30 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 from 5 central registries in the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Using the SEER Data Management System and SAS, pathology reports were counted by cancer site (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, other), patient age category (<50, 50-64, 65-74, >75 years), bi-weekly collection interval, and registry. Only pathology laboratories with monthly electronic reporting to their central registry throughout the study period were included. The reporting counts from 2020 were compared to those of the prior two years. In comparison to the 2019 baseline volume, March through November 2020 had an 11.2% decrease in pathology volume (48,779 fewer reports) in the 5 central registries. Over 75% of this decrease in volume occurred over a 10-week period, March through May 2020, with 30.2% fewer (37,127 reports) than expected pathology reports during this initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum bi-weekly decrease observed was 41.7% (>10,000 reports) from the 2019 baseline, which occurred in April 2020. During this 10-week period the decrease in volume by age category ranged 29.6-32.2%, cancer site ranged 27.5-39.1% and central registry ranged 26.1-36.8%. Two additional periods of volume decrease also occurred, both of shorter duration and magnitude, mid-July through August and mid-October through mid-November. Since the onset of the pandemic there remains a deficit (>11%) in the expected pathology volume compared to 2019, reflecting the continued impact of COVID-19 across oncology services. The majority of the pathology volume decrease in 2020 occurred during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This period of decreased reporting volume along with two smaller decreases align with the 3 peaks of COVID-19 new cases reported by the CDC COVID Data Tracker. Prior to the onset of the pandemic the 2020 volume started at a bi-weekly rate greater than 2019, and the 2019 volume was consistently greater than 2018. Therefore, the 2020 expected values would be greater than those of the 2019 comparison year, i.e., the volume decreases reported would likely represent conservative estimates of the actual volume decrease. Continued longitudinal monitoring and the addition of more registries to this analysis are planned as well as pathology report type categorization (screening, surveillance, or treatment). This study also demonstrates the ability of the NCI SEER program to assist with near real time reporting of cancer data in quantifying the effect on the healthcare system of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care: Pathology volume change in SEER cancer registries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 COVID-19 crisis can spur research on firms corporate finance decisions and their macroeconomic implications, similar to the wave of important research on banking and household finance triggered by the 2008 financial crisis.

Much of this cost stems from potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Peer mentorship has been used effectively to improve outcomes for patients with complex chronic diseases. We propose testing the efficacy of peer mentorship on hospitalization rates among patients receiving hemodialysis. METHODS: This is a multicenter parallel group randomized controlled pragmatic trial of patients treated at hemodialysis facilities in Bronx, NY and Nashville, TN. The study has two phases. Phase 1 will enroll and train 16 hemodialysis patients (10 in Bronx, NY and 6 in Nashville TN) to be mentors using a program focused on enhancing self-efficacy, dialysis self-management and autonomy-supportive communication skills. Phase 2 will enroll 200 high risk adults receiving hemodialysis (140 in Bronx, NY and 60 in Nashville, TN), half of whom will be randomized to intervention and half to usual care. Intervention participants are assigned to weekly telephone calls with trained mentors (see Phase 1) for a 3-month period. The primary outcome of Phase 1 will be engagement of mentors with training and change in knowledge scores and autonomy skills from pre- to post-training. The primary outcome of Phase 2 will be the composite count of ED visits and hospitalizations at the end of study follow-up in patient participants assigned to intervention as compared to those assigned to usual care. Secondary outcomes for Phase 2 include the change over the trial period in validated survey scores measuring perception of social support and self-efficacy, and dialysis adherence metrics, among intervention participants as compared to usual care participants. DISCUSSION: The PEER-HD study will test the feasibility and efficacy of a pragmatic peer-mentorship program designed for patients receiving hemodialysis on ED visit and hospitalization rates. If effective, peer-mentorship holds promise as a scalable patient-centered intervention to decrease hospital resource utilization, and by extension morbidity and cost, for patients receiving maintenance in-center hemodialysis.

METHOD In June 2020, 11 databases, including PubMed, were searched from inception through May 31, 2020. Eligible studies included the use of G-theory to explore reliability in the context of assessment of medical and surgical technical skills. Descriptive information on study, assessment context, assessment protocol, participants being assessed, and G-analyses were extracted. Data were used to map G-theory and explore variance components analyses. A meta-analyses was conducted to synthesize the extracted data on the sources of variance and reliability. RESULTS Forty-four studies were included; of these, 39 had sufficient data for meta-analysis. The total pool included 35,284 unique assessments of 31,496 unique performances of 4,154 participants. Person variance had a pooled effect of 44.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] [36.8%-51.5%]).

CONCLUSIONS G-theory is increasingly being used to examine reliability of technical skills assessment in medical education but more rigor in reporting is warranted. Contextual factors can potentially affect variance components and thereby reliability estimates and should be considered, especially in high-stakes assessment. Reliability analysis should be a best practice when developing assessment of technical skills.","output":"Use of Generalizability Theory for Exploring Reliability of and Sources of Variance in Assessment of Technical Skills: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The administration of propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI) for procedural sedation is standard in a range of hospital settings except for the Emergency Department (ED).

This study investigated the psychological and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of students who responded to a survey in Grades 7 and 8 (ages 12C14) in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The objectives of this study were (i) to provide an overview on early adolescents' experiences and social-emotional well-being during the pandemic; and (ii) to examine whether changes in social experiences as well as feeling safe from getting COVID-19 at school were associated with changes in well-being outcomes over the course of a year. METHODS: A sample of n = 1,755 students from a large public school district self-reported on their life satisfaction, optimism, and symptoms of sadness across two time points: First, in their Grade 7 year (pre-pandemic; January to March, 2020) and then 1 year later in their Grade 8 year (during the pandemic; January to March, 2021). In Grade 8, students also reported on pandemic-specific experiences, including changes in mental health, social relationships, and activities, as well as coping strategies and positive changes since the pandemic. Data were collected online using the Middle Years Development Instrument (MDI), a population-based self-report tool that assesses children's social-emotional development and well-being in the context of their home, school, and neighborhood. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between pandemic-related changes in relationships and perceived safety from getting COVID-19 at school with changes in well-being outcomes. RESULTS: Students reported a range of experiences, with a large proportion reporting moderate concerns and impacts of the pandemic, including worries about their mental health and missing school activities. Students reported significantly lower optimism, lower life satisfaction, and higher sadness compared to the previous year. Within the sample, improvements in relationships with parents and other adults at home was associated with higher well-being during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: Results from this study can inform decision making of policy-makers, educators, and practitioners working with youth, by providing information on students' experiences during the pandemic and identifying factors that may be protective for students' mental health during and beyond the pandemic.","output":"Early Adolescents' Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Changes in Their Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) triggered a worldwide rise in the prevalence of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) and surfaced as a universal wellbeing matter.

Our preliminary data indicate these deficits are substantial and functionally limiting in patients with severe paresis. METHODS: We have designed an intervention (IPSI) to remediate the hemisphere-specific deficits in the ipsilesional arm, using a virtual-reality platform, followed by manipulation training with a variety of real objects, designed to facilitate generalization and transfer to functional behaviors encountered in the natural environment. This is a 2-site (primary site C Penn State College of Medicine, secondary site C University of Southern California), two-group randomized intervention with an experimental group, which receives unilateral training of the ipsilesional arm throughout 3 one-hour sessions per week for 5 weeks, through our Virtual Reality and Manipulation Training (VRMT) protocol. Our control group receives a conventional intervention on the contralesional arm, 3 one-hour sessions per week for 5 weeks, guided by recently released practice guidelines for upper limb rehabilitation in adult stroke. The study aims to include a total of 120 stroke survivors (60 per group) whose stroke was in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) resulting in severe upper-extremity motor impairments.

Inflammatory processes are thought to contribute to mental ill-health, but their role in experiences of psychological distress during the pandemic has not been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that elevated inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity plasma C-reactive protein [CRP] and plasma fibrinogen) measured pre-pandemic would be positively predictive of increased depressive symptoms experienced during the pandemic. Data were analysed from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), with 3574 individuals aged >50 for CRP and 3314 for fibrinogen measured in waves 8 (2016/17) or 9 (2018/19). Depressive symptoms were measured with a short version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre-pandemic (2016C2019) and during the pandemic (June/July 2020). Participants with higher baseline CRP concentrations had 40% higher odds of developing depressive symptoms during the pandemic (OR(adjusted) = 1.40, 95% CI 1.12C1.73, p = 0.003) after full adjustment. Fibrinogen concentrations were also associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic (OR(adjusted) = 1.23, 95% CI 1.04C1.46, p = 0.019), but this association was no longer significant after controlling for lifestyle factors (smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity).

The resulting reductions in anthropogenic activity represent an unprecedented event that yields a glimpse into a future where emissions to the atmosphere are reduced. Furthermore, the abrupt reduction in emissions during the lockdown periods led to clearly observable changes in atmospheric composition, which provide direct insight into feedbacks between the Earth system and human activity. While air pollutants and greenhouse gases share many common anthropogenic sources, there is a sharp difference in the response of their atmospheric concentrations to COVID-19 emissions changes, due in large part to their different lifetimes. Here, we discuss several key takeaways from modeling and observational studies. First, despite dramatic declines in mobility and associated vehicular emissions, the atmospheric growth rates of greenhouse gases were not slowed, in part due to decreased ocean uptake of CO(2) and a likely increase in CH(4) lifetime from reduced NO(x) emissions. Second, the response of O(3) to decreased NO(x) emissions showed significant spatial and temporal variability, due to differing chemical regimes around the world. Finally, the overall response of atmospheric composition to emissions changes is heavily modulated by factors including carbon-cycle feedbacks to CH(4) and CO(2), background pollutant levels, the timing and location of emissions changes, and climate feedbacks on air quality, such as wildfires and the ozone climate penalty.","output":"Societal shifts due to COVID-19 reveal large-scale complexities and feedbacks between atmospheric chemistry and climate change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The shift in the national focus and allocation of resources to the management of COVID19 has led to significant changes to surgical practice including the delay of elective surgery. The aim of this study was to explore the implications of such changes on surgeons. METHOD: Using a qualitative study design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with general surgery consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors from a major tertiary hospital in the Dublin region between March-May 2020. Data collection proceeded iteratively using a thematic analysis approach with quality controls such as memoing and collaborative analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen surgeons (8 male, 6 female) were interviewed. The majority (n = 11, 78.6%) were NCHDs. Significant themes determined included 'impacts' on a variety of constructs such as performance, self-reported fatigue and wellbeing. Training themes elucidated included the effects of the cancellation of elective admissions on reduced operative exposure for trainees. Senior surgical staff were particularly focused on increased complexity in patient management. New policy requirements such as personal protective equipment use and novel rotas have had implications for aspects of work engagement. The pandemic and subsequent national restrictions imposed has afforded opportunities for improved well-being but also resulted in greater solitude in surgeons.

METHODS: A web-administered cross-sectional survey was sent to general surgeons registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario on May 19, 2020. Surgeons were surveyed regarding their practices in pre-operative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing, use of intra-operative personal protective equipment (PPE) given a patients COVID-19 status, and management of common general surgical emergencies with COVID-19 patients. Responses were compared between surgeons from high- and low-prevalence public health units (PHUs) in Ontario using chi-square tests. RESULTS: There were 81 respondents (rate: 81/271, 30%), 48 (59%) of whom were from a PHU in the top quartile of COVID-19 prevalence. Surgeons from low-prevalence PHUs reported pre-procedural COVID-19 testing rates similar to those reported in high-prevalence PHUs for elective (36% versus 55%), urgent (36% versus 54%), and emergent (20% versus 33%) surgeries. Seventy-eight percent of surgeons with COVID-19-negative patients limited trainees in the operating room compared with 96% of surgeons with COVID-19-positive patients. Use of N95 respirators was 17% for surgeons with COVID-19-negative patients, which dramatically increased to 62% for surgeons with patients whose COVID-19 status was unknown.

MAIN BODY: The tracheotomy procedure is highly aerosol generating and directly exposes the entire surgical team to the viral aerosol plume and secretions, thereby increasing the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. As such, we believe extended endotracheal intubation should be the standard of care for the entire duration of ventilation in the vast majority of patients.

Metabolic diseases impact all systems of the body and despite current therapies that offer some protection through tight serum glucose control, ultimately such treatments cannot block the progression of disability and death realized with metabolic disorders. As a result, novel therapeutic avenues are critical for further development to address these concerns. An innovative strategy involves the vitamin nicotinamide and the pathways associated with the silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1), the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and clock genes. Nicotinamide maintains an intimate relationship with these pathways to oversee metabolic disease and improve glucose utilization, limit mitochondrial dysfunction, block oxidative stress, potentially function as antiviral therapy, and foster cellular survival through mechanisms involving autophagy. However, the pathways of nicotinamide, SIRT1, mTOR, AMPK, and clock genes are complex and involve feedback pathways as well as trophic factors such as erythropoietin that require a careful balance to ensure metabolic homeostasis.

Protecting HCWs is of paramount importance to maintain continuous patient care and keep healthcare systems functioning. Used alongside administrative and engineering control measures, personal protective equipment (PPE) is the last line of defense and the core component of protection. Current data suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. Airborne transmission may occur during aerosol-generating procedures. However, the modes of transmission still remain uncertain, especially regarding the possibility of airborne transmission when aerosol-generating procedures are not performed. Thus, there are some inconsistencies in the respiratory protective equipment recommended by international and national organizations. In Korea, there have been several modifications to PPE recommendations offering options in choosing PPE for respiratory and body protection, which confuses HCWs; they are often unsure what to wear and when to wear it. The choice of PPE is based on the risk of exposure and possible modes of transmission. The level of protection provided by PPE differs based on standards and test methods. Thus, understanding them is the key in selecting the proper PPE.

This is a theoretical and a mathematical model. Real material of this model are both Coronaviruses and host cells. METHODS: In this model, the cellular DNA and viral RNA are formed from charged particles and by their motions, some electromagnetic waves are emerged. In fact, they act like the inductors within speakers/microphones and produce some magnetic fields. These fields interact with charges around nuclear and viral membranes and produce some currents along them. In these conditions, membranes act like the magnet within speakers/microphones and emit some new magnetic fields. These fields interact with DNA and viral inductors, move them and produce some extra magnetic waves, These waves move charges along viral and nuclear membranes, vibrate them and produce some sound waves.

RESULTS Thirty-three patients with subcapsular hemangiomas were treated with a laparoscopic approach, and 11 patients with lesions in the liver parenchyma were treated with a combined laparoscopy and an ultrasound-guided percutaneous approach. No conversion to open surgery or two-step surgery occurred during the study period. Patients with small hemangiomas (< 7 cm) required a significantly shorter operating time (71.1  20.18 min vs. 106  23.55 min, p = 0.000) and fewer punctures compared with patients with large hemangiomas (> 7 cm) (4.61  1.09 vs. 6.73 1.01, P < 0.05). According to the Dindo-Clavien classification, 15 patients experienced 34 Grade 1 complications, and two had complications of Grade 3a. All complications were resolved by conservative treatment. Forty-three (86.0%) HHs in 38 patients were completely ablated after RFA, and 7 (14.0%) HHs in 6 patients were incompletely ablated. All patients were followed up for 6-24 months (mean 15  6 months). CONCLUSION The data showed that laparoscopic RFA is an effective treatment for small (< 10 cm) HHs. While the incidence of postoperative complications remains high, the majority of complications are minor.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of stress and anxiety in physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and assess their associated factors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan Region, from March 28 to April 15, 2020. An online self-administered survey questionnaire was used to collect data from physicians working in specialized COVID-19 centers and other healthcare facilities. The level of stress was measured based on the 10-items Perceived Stress Scale. The level of anxiety was measured based on the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Results: A total of 370 participants responded to the perceived stress component of the survey, of whom 57 (15.4%) had low perceived stress, 249 (67.3%) had moderate stress, and 64 (17.3%) had high stress. Being female was significantly associated with having moderate/high stress (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.40 (95% CI 1.31-4.39)). A total of 201 participants responded to the generalized anxiety disorder component of the survey, of whom 19 (9.5%) had no anxiety, 57 (28.4%) had mild anxiety, 79 (39.3%) had moderate anxiety, and 46 (22.9%) had severe anxiety.

This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of diverse migrant communities and to assess risk factors and correlations with major European peaks in incidence of key VPDs over time. Methods We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health January 2000 to October 2019) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on VPD outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, N meningitidis, and H influenzae) in migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland. Results 45 studies were included, reporting on 47 distinct VPD outbreaks across 13 countries (26 [55%] were reported between 2010 and 2020, including 16 [34%] since 2015). Most reported outbreaks involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6578 total cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 596 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1510 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases) and mumps (n=2; 295 cases). 19 (40%) of outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary camps or shelters for asylum seekers and refugees. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, 82% were associated with adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=12) were associated with migrants from Eastern European countries, often involving migrants of Roma ethnicity. Conclusions Migrants represent one of several under-immunised groups involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe, with adult and child refugees and asylum seekers residing in shelters or temporary camps at particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and individual demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring strategies for implementing catch-up vaccination to specific groups, alongside the strengthening of routine data collection, in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets. Better understanding vaccine uptake and demand issues in migrant groups, and reducing the barriers they face to accessing vaccination services, is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery at the current time. Strengthening vaccine delivery to migrant populations will require a greater focus on co-designing vaccine uptake strategies in close collaboration with affected communities.

Thousands of patients with acute respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 are daily hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) around the world. Many of these patients require full mechanical respiratory support and long-term ventilator use. Using different ventilators and calculating important variables can be helpful in meeting therapeutic needs of patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of expiratory time constant (RCEXP) on the course of treatment and duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure hospitalized in ICU. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 60 patients with acute respiratory failure who were hospitalized in the ICU and underwent mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 in the first six months of 2020. The variables of RCEXP, lung compliance and lung resistance in all patients were recorded daily and analyzed. Then, based on clinical outcome, the patients were divided into two groups: the patients with wean outcome (N = 40) and those with death outcome (N = 20). RESULTS: The mean  SD of lung compliance in patients who were separated from ventilator and patients with death outcome were 74.73 (18.58) mL/cm H(2)O and 36.92 (10.56) mL/cm H(2)O, respectively, which was statistically significant (P = 0.001). The mean  SD of lung resistance in patients who were separated from ventilator and patients with death outcome were calculated at 9.25 (4.62) and 14 (6.5), respectively, which was statistically significant (P = 0.015). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of mean  SD of RCEXP (0.67 (0.23) vs. 0.49 (0.19), P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, there was a significant difference between high resistance, low compliance, RCEXP, and weaning success of intubation in patients hospitalized in the ICU.","output":"Investigating the Effect of Expiratory Time Constant on Outcome in Intubated Patients with Acute Respiratory Failure Caused by COVID-19 in Critical Care Unit: A Research Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), affects thousands of people every day worldwide.

Thus, this study surveyed the SARS-CoV-2 genome and proteome and evaluated its mutation characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genes and proteins show three major clades and one minor clade (P6810S; ORF1ab). The overall frequency and densities of mutations in the genes and proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were observed. Nucleocapsid exhibited the highest mutation density among the structural proteins while the spike D614G was the most common, occurring mostly in genomes outside China and United States. ORF8 protein had the highest mutation density across all geographical areas. Moreover, mutation hotspots neighboring and at the catalytic site of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were found that might challenge the binding and effectivity of remdesivir. Mutation coldspots may present as conserved diagnostic and therapeutic targets were found in ORF7b, ORF9b, and ORF14.

However, excessive use may have adverse health effects, possibly partially mediated by disruptions to sleep. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the social predictors of digital technology use and their cross-sectional association with BMI z scores and being overweight in a large sample of adolescents. METHODS: We used baseline data from a subset of a large adolescent cohort from 39 schools across Greater London who participated in the Study of Cognition, Adolescents and Mobile Phones (n=1473). Digital technology use included phone calls, internet use on mobile phones, and video gaming on any device. Multilevel regression was used to assess the associations between digital technology use and age-specific and sex-specific BMI z scores and being overweight (including obesity). Measurements were derived from height and weight, obtained by the Tanita BC-418 Body Composition Analyzer. We examined whether these associations were mediated by insufficient sleep. RESULTS: Generally, participants with lower socioeconomic status reported more use of digital technology. Controlling for socioeconomic status, internet use on mobile phones for more than 3 hours per day was associated with higher BMI z scores (adjusted =.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.48) and greater odds of being overweight (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.09-2.34), compared with low use (30 minutes). Similar associations were found between video gaming and BMI z scores and being overweight. The BMI z score was more strongly related to weekday digital technology use (internet use on mobile phones and video gaming) than weekend use. Insufficient sleep partly mediated the associations between digital technology use and BMI z scores (proportion of mediation from 8.6% to 17.8%) by an indirect effect. CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between digital technology use and BMI in adolescents, partly mediated by insufficient sleep, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be multifactorial.

Increasing the testing capacity and tracing contacts are essential steps to control the pandemic. However, high-cost commercial reagents subject to shortage and poor scalability have hindered the use of these technologies and their adoption for a wide population-scale testing, being even more critical in developing countries.

Both were tested on synthetic RNA and clinical samples, observing a good correlation when compared to commercial RT-qPCR kits. Nevertheless, the best results were obtained using M-MLV RT combined with Taq DNA polymerase in a probe-based RT-qPCR assay, allowing successful discrimination between positive and negative samples with accuracies comparable to a CDC-recommended commercial kit.

Similar observations have been made for concomitant influenza infections. The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the clinical courses of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in patients with hematological malignancies. Methods: In this retrospective, single center analysis all patients with hematological malignancies aged 18 years and older were included with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A or B infection who were admitted or were already under treatment at the Department of Oncology and Hematology or at the Department of Stem Cell Transplantation at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, between January 2012 and January 2021. Primary and secondary endpoints of this study are the rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and virus-associated 30- and 90-day mortalities. The retrospective data collection was performed in accordance with local legal requirements and was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Council of Hamburg. Results: A total of 79 patients were included in this study. 29 patients had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 50 patients had influenza A or B infection. 69% in the COVID-19 group and 68% in the influenza group were male. Median age in the COVID-19 group were 59 years vs 58.5 years in the influenza group. Distribution of hematological malignancies in the COVID-19 group was as follows: 59% had acute leukemia (AL), 24% malignant lymphoma, 14% multiple myeloma (MM) and 3% myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 89% of the patients with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were currently under treatment with chemotherapy, CD20 or CD38 antibody-therapy, underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) or received CAR-T-cells shortly before (< 2 months) or during SARS-CoV-2 positivity. In the influenza group, 60% had AL, 8% lymphoma, 24% MM and 8% MDS or myeloproliferative neoplasm. 84% of these patients were under treatment with chemotherapy, CD33-, CD38- or SLAMF7-directed antibodies or underwent allogeneic SCT shortly before or during infection with seasonal influenza. At the time of infection, 41% of all SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were in refractory or relapsed setting compared to 42% in the influenza group whereas 28% in the COVID-19 and 36% in the influenza cohort were in complete remission. At the time of SARS-CoV-2 detection 38% of patients had grade IV neutropenia (defined as neutrophil count <0.5 x 10 9/L) with a median duration of 3.5 days which is comparable to 33% of patients and a median neutropenia duration of three days in the influenza group. The incidence of ARDS was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group compared to the influenza group (48% vs. 14%, p = 0.001). Furthermore, virus infection related 30-day and 90-day mortality was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (28% vs. 8%, p = 0.026 and 41% vs. 12%, p = 0.005). In the COVID-19 group, a duration of aplasia  7 days had no negative impact on 90-day mortality or development of an ARDS (p = 0.599 and 0.982 respectively) whereas in the patients infected with influenza A or B, an aplasia  7 days had a negative impact on 90-day mortality and development of ARDS (p < 0.001 each). Conclusion: Based on our results, we conclude that comparable to the general population, infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in a significantly higher rate of ARDS and a significantly higher 30- and 90-day mortality compared to influenza A or B infections in patients with underlying hematological malignancies.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective matched case-control study from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2013, in a tertiary hepatobiliary referral center. Patients who underwent partial hepatic resection (OH or LH) for benign or malignant disease were matched first by extent of resection, then by pathological diagnosis, and finally by age and sex to the extent possible. EXPOSURE Partial hepatectomy for liver disease. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day morbidity and mortality rates. RESULTS After the matching process, we included 104 patients (52 undergoing LH and 52 undergoing OH) in the study. Patients were evenly matched with respect to age, sex, extent of resection, and diagnosis. Cirrhosis was present in 17 patients (33%) in each group. We found no difference in positive margin status (1 patient [2%] for LH vs 2 patients [4%] for OH; P > .99). Although the estimated blood loss differed significantly between groups (237 mL for LH vs 387 mL for OH; P = .049), we found no difference in the rate of perioperative blood transfusion (1 patient [2%] for LH vs 5 [10%] for OH; P = .20). Operative time (219 minutes for LH vs 198 minutes for OH; P = .16), hospital length of stay (5 days for LH vs 6 days for OH; P = .13), and readmission rate (4 patients [8%] for LH vs 5 [10%] for OH; P = .70) were similar in both groups. The rates of major complications (4 patients [8%] for LH vs 4 patients [8%] for OH; P = 10), overall 30-day morbidity (22 patients [42%] for LH vs 19 [37%] for OH; P = .70), and 30-day mortality (1 patient [2%] for LH vs 2 [4%] for OH; P > .99) were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients who undergo LH have similar short-term outcomes when compared with those who undergo OH. Laparoscopic hepatectomy was associated with lower intraoperative blood loss, although the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain given the lack of difference in perioperative transfusion or morbidity rates.

To prevent and avoid the cross-infection of the infection to dental professionals or the patients attending the dental clinic, good knowledge of the infection and its prevention mechanisms is mandatory among the professionals. Until to date, there is no pooled estimate on the knowledge,attitude and practice (KAP) of dental professionals to COVID-19 in the globe. Hence, this study aimed to determine the pooled estimate of KAP of dental professionals in this pandemic disease. Methods: Article search was done electronically using Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, SciELO and Google Scholar from June 1, 2020 to August 20, 2020. All studies that assessed the KAP of dental professionals to COVID-19 were searched and included in this review after passing the inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of their knowledge (sign and symptom, mode of transmission and prevention mechanisms), attitude (their concern, intention to treat suspected patients) and practice (face mask usage, hand washing and alcohol based hand rub usage, handshaking practice, deferred procedures and checkup of patients temperature) was computed using RevMan 5.3 and random effect model was used. The presence of publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot. Results: Twelve articles with a total of 5,362 study participants were included in this study. The pooled estimate revealed that 59.91% of the dental professionals had good knowledge of the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Two-third of dental professionals know the prevention mechanisms of the infection, and 70.13% had enough knowledge of the transmission modalities of the infection. The professional attitude revealed that only 36.43% of the participants had intention to treat a patient with cough or suspected COVID-19 (36.43%, 95%CI: 8.57, 64.29). Moreover, 47.85% of the dentists were concerned about their life, and the fate of their profession due to this pandemic disease (47.85%, 95%CI: 26.74, 68.97).

Results: : 56.8% of the patients stated that they would go to the hospital in case of emergency and 28.3% expressed that they did not want to go to the hospital even in this case. 50% of the patients said that they did not want to go to the hospital under any circumstances during the pandemic process. As a result of the correlation analysis, there were inverse correlation between the anxiety-depression levels and encountering COVID patient and having a relative with COVID (p=0.001). Inverse correlation was found between intention to go to hospital and encountering COVID patient (p=0.001). Conclusion: It was revealed that chronic patients did not have any intentions to go to hospital during the COVID-19 pandemia and only half of people were willing to go to hospital in case of emergency. Anxiety and depression levels were found to increase when COVID patient was encountered or a relative had COVID.","output":"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Anxiety Depression And Intention To Go To Hospital in Chronic Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to systematically review the literature and test the dose-response relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and values of bone mineral density (BMD) in adults. METHODS: Relevant observational studies were selected through searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to March 4, 2021. A random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was performed to estimate the change in total and regional-specific BMD for a 2-point increment in the score of adherence to the MedDiet, and to clarify the shape of these associations. RESULTS: Seven cross-sectional and one cohort studies with a total number of 13,209 participants were included in the final analyses. Each 2-point increment in the score of adherence to the MedDiet was associated with 0.009 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.016; I2 = 34%, n = 7), 0.006 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.012; I2 = 34%, n = 7), 0.005 (95% CI: 0.003, 0.007; I2 = 1%, n = 4), 0.005 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.008; I2 = 0%, n = 3), and 0.007 (95% CI: 0.005, 0.009; I2 = 0%, n = 4) gr/cm2 higher BMD of lumbar spine, femoral neck, hip, trochanter, and whole body, respectively. There was a positive linear relationship between the MedDiet adherence score and BMD of hip and trochanter. A nonlinear relationship was seen for lumbar spine, femoral neck, and whole body, with sharper increase in the BMD at lower MedDiet scores. The associations remained significant after controlling for important confounders including body weight, physical activity, smoking status, and energy intake. CONCLUSION: Greater adherence to the MedDiet was associated with a small but important increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, hip, trochanter, and whole body. Adopting a Mediterranean-style eating pattern may have modest beneficial effects on bone health.","output":"Mediterranean dietary pattern and bone mineral density: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: In Tunisia, a total confinement was imposed from March 20 until May 4, 2020. The aim of our work was to assess the impact of this 2-month confinement on the clinical and biological profile of diabetic patients hospitalized in diabetology. Patients and Methods: This is a cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study that involved 110 diabetic patients hospitalized in department A of the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology of Tunis (Tunisia) from June 1 until June 30, 2020. Results : The mean age of the patients was 49.7211.99years with ranges ranging from 16 to 77 years old;63.6% of patients were female and 73.6% of patients were type 2. The average duration of diabetes was 11.538.62years, with extremes ranging from 0to24 years. The mean level of glycated hemoglobin was 12.033.97% and the Body-Mass-Index was 29.44kg/m2 with extremes ranging from 16.26to40.19kg/m2. Weight gain was reported in 73% of patients with an average of 4.771.98kg within 2 months of confinement, with extremes ranging from 2to11kg. Two patients (1.8%) were hospitalized for inaugural diabetic ketosis. The others were admitted for an imbalance(81.8%) or an acute decompensation of their diabetes(16.4%). The factors of imbalance or decompensation were: a poor compliance with hygienic-dietetic measures(90.9%);a medication poor compliance(41.8%), more than half of which(54.3%) was due to the inability of the patient to go to the local health center to obtain his medication;lipodystrophies(42.7% of patients on insulin);a stomatological infection(8.2%);an urinary tract infection(4.5%) and an acute coronary syndrome(0.9%). Conclusions : The diabetic patient is at high risk of a severe form of Covid-19. However, the confinement imposed by the pandemic seems to be one of the factors of diabetes imbalance (in particular by weight gain and poor adherence to therapy). It is therefore essential to strengthen the education and treatment of diabetic patients.","output":"Impact of the MarchCMay 2020 Confinement on the Clinical-Biological Profiles of Diabetic Patients Hospitalized in Diabetology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the levels of awareness and knowledge regarding COVID-19 among healthcare professionals and students in Kuwait and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Materials and Methods: An online cross-sectional survey using a previously validated questionnaire was used to assess the awareness and knowledge levels of COVID-19 in this study, which was distributed via various online platforms to include as many participants as possible. The study targeted medical doctors, dentists, medical students, and dental students from the GCC region. Participants were at least 18 years old, voluntarily consented to complete the questionnaire, and were assured that their responses would remain anonymous. Permission was obtained using a previously validated and applied questionnaire to assess their level of awareness and knowledge regarding COVID-19. To compare the proportional responses between groups in descriptive statistics, a proportion Z-test was used to find any significant differences, with a statistical significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: A total of 1621 participants responded to our questionnaire. Almost two-thirds of the respondents were female (64.4%), and the majority were less than 25 years old (67.2%). Dentists accounted for 12.6% of the total population, and their clinical experience ranged from 0.25 to 52 years (median: 3 years, IQR: 1-10 years). Meanwhile, medical doctors accounted for 24.5% of the responses, and their clinical experience ranged from 0 to 50 years (median: 13 years, IQR: 3-23 years). Among the dental students, 42.3% were in the pre-clinical years, while 57.7% were in the clinical years of study. However, among medical students, 57.5% were in the pre-clinical years, while 42.5% were in the clinical years of study. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that dental students, medical doctors, and medical students exhibited higher odds of having satisfactory COVID-19 perception scores than dentists.","output":"Knowledge and Perceptions of COVID-19 Among Health Care Professionals, Medical Students, and Dental Students in the GCC Region: A Cross-Sectional Correlational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For usual uncertain heat equations, it is challenging to acquire their analytic solutions.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who have previously sought treatment for a mental health disorder. METHODS: This study uses the newly developed Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) survey. This tool was designed to assess tangible impacts of epidemics and pandemics across personal and social life domains. From November 9, 2020, to February 18, 2021, a total of 245 adults recruited from a mental health clinic completed the consent form and responded to the survey link from the Siyan Clinical Corporation and Siyan Clinical Research practices located in Santa Rosa, California, USA. RESULTS: We found that the least affected age group included individuals aged 75 years or older. This was followed closely by the 65- to 75-year-old age group. People with children under the age of 18 years also reported both more negative indicators associated with the pandemic and more positive indicators compared to those without children at home. Gender queer, nonconforming, and transgender individuals may also be at higher risk for more negative impacts associated with the pandemic. When respondents were assessed with regard to their mental health diagnosis, no differences were noted. Substance use also increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the data collected here may serve as foundational research in the prevention, care, and treatment of mental health disorders during pandemics such as COVID-19. Populations such as those with previously diagnosed mental health disorders are particularly at risk for negative effects of pandemic-related stressors such as social isolation, especially if they have children in the household, are part of a younger age group, or have substance use disorder. Gender may also be a factor. Further, the EPII survey may prove to be a useful tool in understanding these effects. Overall, these data may be a critical step toward understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations with a mental health diagnosis, which may aid mental health practitioners in understanding the consequences of pandemics on their patients overall well-being.

Although international guidelines address the mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) response to emergencies, regional recommendations on COVID-19 are still insufficient. We identified emerging mental health problems, strategies to address them, and opportunities to reform mental health systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in South America. Methods An anonymous online questionnaire was sent to mental health decision-makers of Ministries of Health in 10 South American countries in mid-April 2020. The semi-structured questionnaire had 12 questions clustered into 3 main sections: emerging challenges in mental health, current and potential strategies to face the pandemic, and, key elements for mental health reform. We identified keywords and themes for each section through summative content analysis. Findings An increasing mental health burden and emerging needs are arising as direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic among health care providers and the general population. National lockdowns challenge the delivery and access to mental health treatment and care. Strategies to meet these health needs rely heavily on timely and adequate responses by strengthened mental health governance and systems, availability of services, virtual platforms, and appropriate capacity building for service providers. Short- and medium-term strategies focused on bolstering community-based mental health networks and telemedicine for high-risk populations. Opportunities for long-term mental health reform entail strengthening legal frameworks, redistribution of financial resources and collaboration with local and international partners. Interpretation Mental health and psychosocial support have been identified as a priority area by South American countries in the COVID-19 response. The pandemic has generated specific needs that require appropriate actions including: implementing virtual based interventions, orienting capacity building towards protection of users and health providers, strengthening evidence-driven decision making and integrating MHPSS in high-level mechanisms guiding the response to COVID-19.

Information on stroke care during the pandemic in Belgium is lacking. This study aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on acute stroke care in eight Belgian stroke centers. This Belgian study is part of an international observational and retrospective study in 70 countries and 457 stroke centers. We compared volumes of COVID-19 and stroke hospitalizations, intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment rates, acute treatment time intervals and functional outcome at 90 days during the first wave of the pandemic to two control intervals (March-May 2019 and December-February 2020). From March 2020 to May 2020, 860 stroke patients were hospitalized. In the same time period, 2850 COVID-19 patients were admitted, of which 37 (1.3%) were diagnosed with a stroke. Compared to the months prior to the pandemic and the same time epoch one year earlier, stroke hospitalizations were reduced (relative difference 15.9% [p = 0.03] and 14.5% [p = 0.05], respectively). Despite a reduction in absolute volumes, there was no difference in the monthly proportion of thrombolysis or endovascular treatment provided to the overall stroke hospitalizations. Acute treatment time metrics did not change between COVID-19 pandemic and control time epochs. We found no difference in 90-day functional outcomes nor in mortality after stroke between patients admitted during the pandemic versus control periods. We found a decline in the volume of stroke hospitalizations during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium.

With the recently FDA-approved peanut product, Palforzia, the goal of this article is to review the most recent data from clinical trials, discuss recent trends, and anticipate future developments. RECENT FINDINGS: The latest research suggests that peanut OIT could be a promising option for peanut-allergic patients, with the majority of participants in research studies achieving the primary efficacy endpoint of desensitization, as well as sustained unresponsiveness in select populations. Some studies also showed improvements in food allergy-related quality of life. However, peanut OIT is not without risk or side effects, including potentially serious allergic reactions.

Here, we show that TET2 deficiency leads to DNA hypermethylation of regulatory elements in GC B cells, associated with silencing of the respective genes. This hypermethylation affects the binding of transcription factors including those involved in exit from the GC reaction and involves pathways such as B cell receptor, antigen presentation, CD40, and others. Normal GC B cells manifest a typical hypomethylation signature, which is caused by AID, the enzyme that mediates somatic hypermutation. However, AID-induced demethylation is markedly impaired in TET2-deficient GC B cells, suggesting that AID epigenetic effects are partially dependent on TET2. Last, we find that TET2 mutant DLBCLs also manifest the aberrant TET2-deficient GC DNA methylation signature, suggesting that this epigenetic pattern is maintained during and contributes to lymphomagenesis.","output":"TET2 deficiency reprograms the germinal center B cell epigenome and silences genes linked to lymphomagenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patient safety should be at the heart of any healthcare service.

We summarize and evaluate published curricula for health professionals on ACEs and TIC. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsychInfo, and MedEdPORTAL through January 2021. Studies meeting the following criteria were included: Described teaching interventions on ACEs, TIC, and child abuse and maltreatment; included health care providers or trainees as learners; were written in English; included an abstract; and described a curriculum and evaluation. We reviewed 2264 abstracts, abstracted data from 79 studies, and selected 51 studies for qualitative synthesis. RESULTS Studies focused on ACEs/TIC (27), child abuse (14), domestic/intimate partner violence (6), and child maltreatment/parental physical punishment (4). Among these 51 studies, 43 were published since 2010. Learners included a mix of health professionals (34) and students (17). Duration, content, and quality of the 51 curricula were highly variable. An analysis of 10 exemplar curricula on ACEs and/or TIC revealed high and very high quality for methods and moderate to very high quality for curriculum evaluation, suggesting that they may be good models for other educational programs. Four of the 10 exemplars used randomized controlled trials to evaluate efficacy. Studies were limited to English language and subject to publication bias.

DESIGN: Real-world prospective observational study. SETTING: VH remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (postaccident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or postinpatient admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care during VH follow-up and for 2 weeks post-VH discharge. RESULTS: 900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 postinpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced clinical deterioration (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of clinical deterioration were increase in age (OR 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 (95% CI 1.41 to 5.82)), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 (95% CI 1.02 to 3.04)), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30=9.09 (95% CI 2.01 to 41.09)) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.11 to 3.60)).
