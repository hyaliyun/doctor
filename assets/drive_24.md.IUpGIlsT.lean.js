Novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages P.1 and P.2, first identified respectively in Manaus and Rio de Janeiro, have been associated with potentially higher transmission rates and antibody neutralization escape. In this study, we performed a whole-genome sequencing of 185 samples isolated from three out of the five Brazilian regions, including Amazonas (North region), Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and Bahia (Northeast region), and Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) aiming to identify SARS-CoV-2 mutations that could be involved in the surge of COVID19 cases in Brazil. Here, we showed a widespread dispersion of P.1 and P.2 across Brazilian regions. Except for Manaus, P.2 was the predominant lineage identified country-wise. P.2 lineage was estimated to have originated in February, 2020 and has diverged into new clades. Interstate transmission of P.2 was detected since March, but reached its peak in December, 2020 and January, 2021. Transmission of P.1 was also high in December. P.1 origin was inferred to have happened in August 2020. We also confirmed the presence of the variant under investigation (VUI) NP13L recently described in the southernmost region of Brazil to have spread across the Northeastern states. P.1, P.2 and NP13L are descended from the ancient B.1.1.28 strain, although during the first phase of the pandemic in Brazil presence of B.1.1.33 strain was also reported. Here, for the first time, we investigate the possible occurrence of a new variant of concern descending from B.1.1.33 that also carries the E484K mutation. Indeed, the recurrent report of many novel SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants in Brazil could be due to the absence of effective control measures resulting in high SARS-CoV2 transmission rates. Altogether, our findings provided a landscape of the critical state of SARS-CoV-2 across Brazil and confirm the need to sustain continuous sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide in order to early identify novel variants of concern and to monitor for vaccine effectiveness.","output":"Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 tracks early interstate transmission of P.1 lineage and diversification within P.2 clade in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the Italian health system is regionally based, COVID-19 emergency actions are based on a general lockdown imposed by national authority and then management at local level by 21 regional authorities. Therefore, the pandemic response plan developed by each region led to different approaches. The aim of this paper is to analyze whether differences in patient management may have influenced the local course of the epidemic. The analysis on the 21 Italian regions considers the strategies adopted in terms of hospitalization, treatment in the ICU and at home. Moreover, an in-depth analysis was carried out on: Lombardia, which adopted a hospitalization approach; Veneto, which tended to confine patients at home; and Emilia Romagna, which adopted a mixed hospitalization-home based approach. The majority of regions implemented a home-based approach, while the hospital approach was followed in three regions (Lombardia, Piemonte, and Lazio), mainly limited to the first period of the outbreak. All regions in the later phases tended to reduce hospitalization, preferring to confine patients at home. This comparison, highlighting the different phases of the pandemic, outlined that the adoption of home-based practices contributed to limiting infection rates among patients and health professionals as well as decreasing the number of deaths.","output":"Analysis of the Different Approaches Adopted in the Italian Regions to Care for Patients Affected by COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A record outbreak of community-spread COVID-19 started on 10 May 2021, in Taiwan.

The challenges of patient evaluation in the emergency department (ED) using ICT are seldom discussed in the literature. The objective of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the utility of ICT for patient assessment in emergency settings during the pandemic. The patient flow protocol and the ED layout were modified and regionalized into different areas according to the patients risk of COVID-19 infection. Nine iPads were stationed in different zones to aid in virtual patient assessment and communication between medical personnel. A focus group study was performed to assess and analyze the utility of the ICT module in the ED. Eight emergency physicians participated in the study. Of them, four (50%) had been directly involved in the development of the ICT module in the study hospital. Three main themes that influenced the application of the ICT module were identified: setting, hardware, and software. The setting theme included six factors: patient evaluation, subspecialty consultation, patient privacy and comfortableness, sanitation, cost, and patient acceptability. The hardware theme included six factors: internet connection, power, quality of image and voice, public or personal mode, portable or fixed mode, and maintenance. The software theme included six factors: platform choices, security, ICT accounts, interview modes, video/voice recording, and time limitation.

Of the serial pharmacokinetic investigations we designed to facilitate identifying LianhuaQingwen compounds that are likely to be therapeutically important, the current investigation focused on the component Glycyrrhiza uralensis roots (Gancao). Besides its function in COVID-19 treatment, Gancao is able to induce pseudoaldosteronism by inhibiting renal 11-HSD2. Systemic and colon-luminal exposure to Gancao compounds were characterized in volunteers receiving LianhuaQingwen and by in vitro metabolism studies. Access of Gancao compounds to 11-HSD2 was characterized using human/rat, in vitro transport, and plasma protein binding studies, while 11-HSD2 inhibition was assessed using human kidney microsomes. LianhuaQingwen contained a total of 41 Gancao constituents (0.01C8.56 mol/day). Although glycyrrhizin (1), licorice saponin G2 (2), and liquiritin/liquiritin apioside (21/22) were the major Gancao constituents in LianhuaQingwen, their poor intestinal absorption and access to colonic microbiota resulted in significant levels of their respective deglycosylated metabolites glycyrrhetic acid (8), 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid (M2(D); a new Gancao metabolite), and liquiritigenin (27) in human plasma and feces after dosing. These circulating metabolites were glucuronized/sulfated in the liver and then excreted into bile. Hepatic oxidation of 8 also yielded M2(D). Circulating 8 and M2(D), having good membrane permeability, could access (via passive tubular reabsorption) and inhibit renal 11-HSD2.

Impact of sudden suspension of human activities on air pollution was analyzed by studying the change in satellite retrieved NO 2 concentrations and top-down NOx emission over the urban and rural areas around Delhi. NO 2 was chosen for being the most indicative of emission intensity due to its short lifetime of the order of a few hours in the planetary boundary layer. We present a robust temporal comparison of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrieved NO 2 column density during the lockdown with the counterfactual baseline concentrations, extrapolated from the long-term trend and seasonal cycle components of NO 2 using observations during 2015 to 2019. NO 2 columns in the urban area of Delhi experienced an anomalous relative change ranging from 60.0% decline during the Phase 1 of lockdown (March 25-April 13, 2020) to 3.4% during the post-lockdown Phase 5. In contrast, we find no substantial reduction in NO 2 concentrations over the rural areas. To clarify the quantitative impact of the lockdown measures, weekly top-down NOx emissions were estimated from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) retrieved NO 2 by accounting for horizontal advection derived from the steady state continuity equation. NOx emissions from urban areas and power plants exhibited a mean decline of 72.19% and 53.4% respectively in Phase 1 compared to the pre-lockdown business-as-usual phase. Due to absence of confounding emission source activity during lockdown, emission estimates over urban areas and power-plants were validated with respective electricity generation reports and Googles mobility reports. A higher anomaly in emission estimates suggests that comparison of only concentration change, without accounting for the dynamical and photochemical conditions, may mislead evaluation of lockdown impact. Our results are also useful for optimizing bottom-up emission inventories.","output":"Nitrogen Oxides Concentration and Emission Change Detection During COVID-19 Restrictions in North India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The time-concentrated nature of the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in England in March and April 2020 provides a natural experiment to measure changes in antibody positivity at the population level before onset of the second wave and initiation of the vaccination programme.

Findings Overall, 17,576 people had detectable antibodies, a prevalence of 4.9% (95% confidence intervals 4.9, 5.0) when adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England. The prevalence declined from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1), to 4.8% (4.7, 5.0) and 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), over the three rounds of the study a difference of -26.5% (-29.0, -23.8). The highest prevalence and smallest overall decline in positivity was in the youngest age group (18-24 years) at -14.9% (-21.6, -8.1), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (&gt;74 years) at -39.0% (-50.8, -27.2).

Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities.

Therefore, in addition to antibody-inducing vaccines, novel vaccines developed on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the nonstructural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were first predicted as epitope candidates based on bioinformatics. Fifty-four of the 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were active as CTL epitopes because of the induction of gamma interferon (IFN-)-producing CD8(+) T cells. Of the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10-peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides.

It is notable that these last two conditions have recently been reported to be a complication in some people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A paradigm for practical neurological workup of symptomatic pilots and astronauts will be discussed, as will the controversial notion of pre-emptive radiological screening (vs. not screening) in asymptomatic or clinically occult situations.

Health care workers (HCW) are one of the first groups to receive vaccinations, so it is important to consider their attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination to better address barriers to widespread vaccination acceptance. This study aimed to evaluate variables that are linked with the recommendation of vaccines and intention to take-up vaccination against COVID-19 among the HCWs, in the context of the current pandemic. The study was conducted during the first week of the vaccination campaign dedicated to Italian HCWs, beginning in December 2020, and it involved all doctors in a public hospital in Sicily. The following questionnaires were administered: (1) The perceived vaccine trust questionnaire, measuring the degree of trust in vaccines by healthcare professionals both in general and for the protection of healthcare professionals themselves and patients;(2) the positive and negative affect scale-state (PANAS), for assessing positive and negative emotions in relation to their work as frontline care providers;(3) The locus of control of behaviour (LCB) to measure the extent to which subjects perceive responsibility for their personal behaviour (internal vs. external);(4) recommendation vaccines item, referring to the intention to recommend vaccination. The findings suggest that socio-demographic control variables (age, gender, and seniority) showed little or no predictive power in vaccine recommendation, while vaccine confidence, positive emotions, and internal locus of control were excellent predictors of vaccine recommendations by doctors.

COVID-19 is now known as a pandemic threat to global public health. It possesses a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to mild, moderate, and ultimately severe pneumonia accompanied by multi-organ system dysfunction that can cause the death of the afflicted patients. The host immune system plays a critical role in defending against potentially pathogenic microorganisms such as coronaviruses, and it eliminates and eradicates these invading agents by triggering effective immune responses.

The net benefit of transplantation in a T2 HCC patient in a usual situation varied from 0 life months with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 15, to 34 life months with a MELD score of 40, while it progressively decreased with acute organ shortage during a pandemic (i.e., with a 50% decrease in organs, the net benefit varied from 0 life months with MELD 30, to 12 life months with MELD 40). Our study supports the continuation of transplantation for T2 HCC patients during crises such as COVID-19; however, the focus needs to be on those T2 HCC patients with the highest net survival benefit.","output":"Liver Transplantation for T2 Hepatocellular Carcinoma during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Novel Model Balancing Individual Benefit against Healthcare Resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Image guided biopsies are an integral part of prostate cancer evaluation. The effect of delaying biopsies of suspicious prostate mpMRI lesions is uncertain and clinically relevant during the COVID-19 crisis. We evaluated the association between biopsy delay time and pathologic findings on subsequent prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval we reviewed the medical records of 214 patients who underwent image-guided transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate biopsy between 2017 and 2019. Study outcomes included clinically significant (ISUP grade group &#8805;2) and any prostate cancer on biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between biopsy delay time and outcomes while adjusting for known predictors of cancer on biopsy. RESULTS: The study cohort included 195 men with a median age of 68. Median delay between mpMRI and biopsy was 5 months, and 90% of patients had a &#8804;8 months delay. A significant association was found between PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies and shorter delay time. Delay time was not associated with clinically significant or any cancer on biopsy. A higher risk of significant cancer was associated with older age (Pa?=a?0.008), higher PSA (0.003), smaller prostate volume (<0.001), no previous biopsy (0.012) and PI-RADS 5 lesions (0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that under current practice, where men with PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies undergo earlier evaluation, a delay of up to 8 months between imaging and biopsy does not affect biopsy findings. In the current COVID-19 crisis, selectively delaying image-guided prostate biopsies is unlikely to result in a higher rate of significant cancer.","output":"The effect of delaying transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate for patients with suspicious MRI findings-Implications for the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues to have devastating effects across the globe.

The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) encourages the use of telemedicine for patients with respiratory symptoms. This study therefore purposes automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a deep learning framework with self-taken throat images. METHODS: A dataset composed of two classes of 131 throat images with pharyngitis and 208 normal throat images was collected. Before the training classifier, we constructed a cycle consistency generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to augment the training dataset. The ResNet50, Inception-v3, and MobileNet-v2 architectures were trained with transfer learning and validated using a randomly selected test dataset. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). RESULTS: The CycleGAN-based synthetic images were reflected the pragmatic characteristic features of pharyngitis. Using the synthetic throat images, the deep learning model demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of the pharyngitis diagnosis. ResNet50 with GAN-based augmentation showed the best ROC-AUC of 0.988 for pharyngitis detection in the test dataset. In the 4-fold cross-validation using the ResNet50, the highest detection accuracy and ROC-AUC achieved were 95.3% and 0.992, respectively. CONCLUSION: The deep learning model for smartphone-based pharyngitis screening allows for fast identification of severe pharyngitis with a potential of the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 151 women with breast cancer. Participants completed measures of knowledge about COVID-19, perceived threat, sense of mastery, social support, precautionary behavior, and socio-demographic questionnaires. A multivariate regression model was calculated with precautionary behavior as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The mean of precautionary behavior score was relatively high. Participants perceived their health as relatively good, had relatively high knowledge about COVID-19, and moderate perceived threat. Sense of mastery was relatively moderate and perceived social support was relatively high. In the multivariate regression analysis, after controlling for the background variables, knowledge about COVID-19 (F(2,149) = 8.68, p < 0.001; beta = 0.36) was significantly associated with precautionary behavior.

The study aimed to comparatively evaluate the role of H and PMR on anxiety, heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SPO(2)), blood pressure (BP), pain, and analgesic requirement during extraction in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty children aged 8C12 years undergoing primary molar extractions were randomly allocated to three groupsH, PMR, and control (C). The anxiety (proposed Visual Facial Anxiety scale), HR, and SPO(2) were measured pre/post-operatively with/without interventions (H, PMR, C) at 4 intervals. The BP and pain (Wong-Baker faces pain scale) were recorded pre- and post-operatively. Need for analgesic post-operatively was assessed. RESULTS: Statistically significant reduction in anxiety was noted post-extraction in H (0.30  0.80), PMR (0.50  0.69) (p < 0.001*). HR showed a statistically significant drop after H, PMR application. (p < 0.001*) No significant difference in SPO(2) was noted in the three groups (p > 0.05). Pain control was well achieved using H (85%), PMR (70%); BP was well-regulated in the H, PMR compared to C group (p < 0.001*). Need for analgesics was reduced in H (45%), PMR (50%) versus C (100%). Both techniques H, PMR were comparable in all measures.

METHODS A 22-year-old female presented to our clinic with blurred right vision. The history revealed that she had experienced a COVID-19 infection one month ago. Redness and stinging of the right eye had started at the same time and she had been prescribed topical antibiotic drops and ointments. The redness in the right eye had decreased but blurred vision had then developed. RESULTS Slit lamp examination revealed a normal left eye. Several tiny subepithelial infiltrates without fluorescein staining of the cornea were present in the right eye. The anterior chamber, lens and fundus were bilaterally normal. IVCM revealed irregular corneal epithelial cells with bright borders in addition to scattered inflammatory cells and cell debris in the right eye. There were activated dendritic cells in the subbasal epithelial area with a significant decrease in the subbasal corneal nerve plexus. Clusters of highly reflective cells with an irregular shape were seen in the anterior corneal stroma together with foci of activated keratocytes. The corneal endothelial cell layer was normal. The left eye IVCM findings were all within normal limits. The right eye also showed decreased corneal sensitivity compared to the left. CONCLUSIONS The possible role of corneal infiltrates as a trigger for COVID-19 could be explained with an immune-mediated mechanism.

Moreover, ZE had anti-bacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, which was 30-50% lower than that of tetracycline. After feeding the fish with diets supplemented with 0 (CT, 1 (ZE1), 2 (ZE2), and 3 (ZE3) g/kg ZE for eight weeks, there were no significant differences in growth performance and feed efficiency among the treatments; however, the fish in ZE2 and ZE3 treatments showed significantly higher survival than the fish in CT treatment. Blood leukocyte counts, plasma globulin, total immunoglobulin, lysozyme and bactericidal activity against A. hydrophila in ZE2 and ZE3 groups were significantly higher than that of CT group. All the ZE-treated groups had higher plasma complement activity compared to the CT group. Mucosal lysozyme and bactericidal activities of the ZE2 fish were significantly higher than the other treatments. Expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and lysozyme genes increased in head kidney of the fish treated with ZE; the highest increases were related to the ZE2 treatment.

This study attempts to quantify the age-specific transmissibility using a mathematical model. METHODS: An epidemiological model with five compartments (susceptibleCexposedCsymptomaticCasymptomaticCrecovered/removed [SEIAR]) was developed based on observed transmission features. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were divided into four age groups: group 1, those  14 years old; group 2, those 15 to 44 years old; group 3, those 45 to 64 years old; and group 4, those  65 years old. The model was initially based on cases (including imported cases and secondary cases) collected in Hunan Province from January 5 to February 19, 2020. Another dataset, from Jilin Province, was used to test the model. RESULTS: The age-specific SEIAR model fitted the data well in each age group (P < 0.001). In Hunan Province, the highest transmissibility was from age group 4 to 3 (median: (43) = 7.71  10(? 9); SAR(43) = 3.86  10(? 8)), followed by group 3 to 4 (median: (34) = 3.07  10(? 9); SAR(34) = 1.53  10(? 8)), group 2 to 2 (median: (22) = 1.24  10(? 9); SAR(22) = 6.21  10(? 9)), and group 3 to 1 (median: (31) = 4.10  10(? 10); SAR(31) = 2.08  10(? 9)). The lowest transmissibility was from age group 3 to 3 (median: (33) = 1.64  10(? 19); SAR(33) = 8.19  10(? 19)), followed by group 4 to 4 (median: (44) = 3.66  10(? 17); SAR(44) = 1.83  10(? 16)), group 3 to 2 (median: (32) = 1.21  10(? 16); SAR(32) = 6.06  10(? 16)), and group 1 to 4 (median: (14) = 7.20  10(? 14); SAR(14) = 3.60  10(? 13)). In Jilin Province, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 4 (median: (43) = 4.27  10(? 8); SAR(43) = 2.13  10(? 7)), followed by group 3 to 4 (median: (34) = 1.81  10(? 8); SAR(34) = 9.03  10(? 8)).

Protein changes and distribution of SH3RF2 were evaluated by western blot assays and immunofluorescence. Lentivirus and adeno-associated virus were used to regulate the expression of genes. Nonoxid-HMGB1-enriched exosomes were constructed and used to treat TBI rats. Neurological function was evaluated by OF test and NOR test. Results demonstrated that nonoxid-HMGB1 and fr-HMGB1, but not ds-HMGB1, promoted neurite outgrowth and axon elongation. RNA-seq and western blot assay indicated a significant increase of SH3RF2 in neurons after treated with nonoxid-HMGB1 or fr-HMGB1. Notably, the beneficial effects of nonoxid-HMGB1 were attenuated by downregulation of SH3RF2. Furthermore, nonoxid-HMGB1 ameliorated cognitive impairment in rats post-TBI via SH3RF2.

The production of cytokines is regulated by activated nuclear factor-kB and involves downstream pathways such as Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators transcription. Protein expression is also regulated by post-translational modification of chromosomal markers. Lysine residues in the peptide tails stretching out from the core of histones bind the sequence upstream of the coding portion of genomic DNA. Covalent modification, particularly methylation, activates or represses gene transcription.

Nevertheless, each year 800,000 people die of suicide in the world. While there is evidence indicating that suicide rates de-crease during times of crises, they are expected to increase once the immediate crisis has passed. The COVID-19 pandemic affects risk and pro-tective factors for suicide at each level of the socio-ecological model. Economic downturn, augmented barriers to accessing health care, increased access to suicidal means, inappropriate media reporting at the societal level; deprioritization of mental health and preventive activities at the community level; interpersonal conflicts, neglect and violence at the relationship level; unemployment, poverty, loneliness and hopelessness at the individual level: all these variables contribute to an increase of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, harmful use of alcohol, substance abuse, and ultimately suicide risk. Suicide should be prevented by strengthening universal strategies directed to the entire population, including mitigation of unemployment, poverty and inequalities; prioritization of access to mental health care; responsible media reporting, with information about available support; prevention of increased alcohol intake; and restriction of access to lethal means of suicide. Selective interventions should continue to target known vulnerable groups who are socio-economically disadvantaged, but also new ones such as first responders and health care staff, and the bereaved by COVID-19 who have been deprived of the final contact with loved ones and funerals.

OBJECTIVE The objective was (1) to measure rates of successful resolution of dysphagia in patients after undergoing surgical intervention for diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH); and (2) to determine if older age, longer duration of preoperative symptoms, or increased severity of disease was correlated with unsuccessful surgical intervention. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA DISH, also known as Forestier disease, is an enthesopathy affecting up to 35% of the elderly population. Many patients develop osteophytes of the anterior cervical spine, which contribute to chronic symptoms of dysphagia causing debilitating weight loss and possibly resulting in the placement of a permanent gastrostomy feeding tube. For patients that fail conservative medical management, an increase in surgical interventions have been reported in the literature in the last 2 decades. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Studies measuring outcomes after surgical intervention for patients with dysphagia from DISH were selected for inclusion. Two independent reviewers screened and assessed all literature in accordance with Cochrane systematic reviewing standards. RESULTS In total, 22 studies reporting 119 patients were selected for inclusion. Successful relief of dysphagia was obtained in 89% of patients after surgical intervention. Failure to relieve dysphagia was associated with increased length of symptoms preoperatively (P<0.01) using logistic regression. Patients with more severe preoperative symptoms also seem to have an increased risk for treatment failure (risk ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.85; P=0.02). Treatment failure was not associated with patient age, use of intraoperative tracheostomy, implementation of additional fusion procedures, level of involved segments, or number of involved segments. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing surgical intervention have a higher likelihood of failing surgery with increasing preoperative symptom length and increased preoperative symptom severity.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients who tested positive for COVID-19 with PCR via nasopharyngeal swabs. Conjunctival swabs were collected for each patient and subjected to RT-PCR assay. Demographic data and clinical history of patients were investigated and analysed. RESULTS: In this study, 4.9% of the patients tested positive with conjunctival swabs for COVID-19; 29.9%, 28.7%, 20.1%, and 12.2% of the patients had fever, shortness of breath, cough, and red eye, respectively. Among all patients, 18.9% and 73.2% had a history of traveling and contact with positive COVID-19 cases, respectively. There were significant correlations between the conjunctival results and diabetes (P=0.049) and hypertension (P=0.002). Traveling was a risk factor for positive conjunctival swab testing (P=0.016). The sensitivity of the conjunctival swab was 4.8%. CONCLUSION: Among all positive cases of COVID-19, a small percentage had positive results when tested using a conjunctival swab. Conjunctival swabs have very low sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19. However, tears could still be a mode of disease transmission, especially from patients to eye care specialists.","output":"Testing the Sensitivity of Conjunctival Swabs from Confirmed COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Since the eye is in close proximity to the oro-nasal cavity, transmission of SARS CoV-2 is higher during ophthalmic surgical procedures, it is vital to ensure the safety of the healthcare team by pre-operative Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA of all patients planned for elective or emergency surgery. Hence, understanding the profile of pre-operative RAT and real-time RT-PCR among patients planned for various ophthalmic procedures, will help us make better decisions for future guidelines, for optimal planning of ophthalmic elective or emergency surgeries, keeping in mind the current scenario. Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study conducted on patients planned for elective or emergency ophthalmic surgeries, who had no COVID-19-related symptoms pre-operatively and were subjected to preoperative RAT and real-time RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for SARS CoV-2 viral RNA. Data was compiled and statistically analysed. Results: 204 patients underwent pre-operative RAT and RT-PCR testing; of which, 85 were females and 119 were males. Mean age of the study population was 51.44  16.501 years. Among the 204, 2 tested positive for SARS CoV-2 with Rapid Antigen testing as well as RT-PCR and 10 patients tested positive via RT-PCR after a negative RAT result of the same sample. Conclusion: Pre-operative testing for COVID-19 disease is indispensable as there is a high chance of transmission from patient to healthcare workers. RAT has the advantage of quick results and may play a role in case of emergency procedures. However, it is prudent to perform the more sensitive real-time RT-PCR before any elective, non-emergency procedures or surgeries to avoid any undue risk to the healthcare team.","output":"Pre-Operative SARS CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction: A conundrum in surgical decision making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microplastics are man-made pollutants which have been detected in surface water and groundwater.

The authors conducted a nationwide survey of residency program directors (PDs) to assess their confidence in using a virtual platform to holistically evaluate applicants during the 2020-2021 Match cycle and their desire to continue virtual recruitment during forthcoming interview seasons. METHOD: This prospective study was conducted by email questionnaire administered through the survey tool Survey Monkey to residency PDs from March 7, 2021-March 27, 2021. The residency PDs surveyed represented these subspecialties: internal medicine, general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and other. Email addresses of PDs were collected from a public list developed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Surveys contained demographic questions, 4-point Likert scale questions evaluating several factors regarding the interview and matching process, and free-response questions. RESULTS: A total of 463 surveys were sent; response rate was 402 /463 (86.8%). Most PDs were less confident assessing an applicant's interpersonal skills (247, 61.4%) and professionalism (239, 59.5%) using a virtual platform. Assessment of an applicant's \\"fit\\" into the program was also challenging: 44.3% (178) of those surveyed disagreed with the statement that they could do so confidently. Additionally, 73.9% (297) of PDs found it challenging to gauge an applicant's genuine interest and only 41.3% (166) strongly agreed or agreed that they could accurately represent their own program using a virtual platform. More than half of PDs (220, 54. 7%) found it more difficult to rank interviewees compared to previous in-person Match cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Most residency PDs found virtual interviews convenient.

In vitro and animal studies indicate that high and disseminated viral replication is important for disease pathogenesis(3,4,5). Laboratory experiments suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation may contribute to disease severity(6,7,8,9). To assess the relevance of these findings for human disease, we performed virological and immunological studies in 18 individuals with H5N1 and 8 individuals infected with human influenza virus subtypes. Influenza H5N1 infection in humans is characterized by high pharyngeal virus loads and frequent detection of viral RNA in rectum and blood. Viral RNA in blood was present only in fatal H5N1 cases and was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. We observed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died, and these correlated with pharyngeal viral loads. Genetic characterization of H5N1 viruses revealed mutations in the viral polymerase complex associated with mammalian adaptation and virulence. Our observations indicate that high viral load, and the resulting intense inflammatory responses, are central to influenza H5N1 pathogenesis. The focus of clinical management should be on preventing this intense cytokine response, by early diagnosis and effective antiviral treatment.

The results show that CO2 concentrations (1039 and 934  386 ppm, as average and median, during rush hours but with average reduced occupancy due to the fair to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the measurement period, and measured in the middle of the busses) are in the lower range of values recorded in the literature for public buses, however an improvement in ventilation is required in a significant proportion of the journeys. Thus, we found better ventilation in the older Euro 3+ (retrofitted with filter traps and selective catalytic reduction) and Euro 5 buses (average 918  257 ppm) than in the hermetically closed new Euro 6 ones (1111  432 ppm). The opening of the windows in the older buses yielded higher ventilation rates (778  432 ppm). The opening of all doors at all stops increases the ventilation by causing a fall in concentrations of 200-350 ppm below inter-stop concentrations, with this effect typically lasting 40-50 s in the hermetically closed new Euro 6 hybrid buses. Based on these results a number of recommendations are offered in order to improve ventilation, including measurement of CO2 and occupancy, and installation of ventilation fans on the top of the hermetically closed new buses, introducing outdoor air when a given concentration threshold is exceeded. In these cases, a CO2 sensor installed in the outdoor air intake is also recommended to take into account external CO2 contributions.","output":"How can ventilation be improved on public transportation buses?

Rhinoviruses (RVs), respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), and coronaviruses are highly prevalent respiratory pathogens, but because of the lack of reliable animal models, their differential pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare infections by respiratory viruses isolated from clinical specimens using reconstituted human airway epithelia. METHODS: Tissues were infected with RV-A55, RV-A49, RV-B48, RV-C8, and RV-C15; respiratory EV-D68; influenza virus H3N2; RSV-B; and human coronavirus (HCoV)COC43. Replication kinetics, cell tropism, effect on tissue integrity, and cytokine secretion were compared. Viral adaptation and tissue response were assessed through RNA sequencing. RESULTS: RVs, RSV-B, and HCoV-OC43 infected ciliated cells and caused no major cell death, whereas H3N2 and EV-D68 induced ciliated cell loss and tissue integrity disruption. H3N2 was also detected in rare goblet and basal cells. All viruses, except RV-B48 and HCoV-OC43, altered cilia beating and mucociliary clearance. H3N2 was the strongest cytokine inducer, and HCoV-OC43 was the weakest. Persistent infection was observed in all cases. RNA sequencing highlighted perturbation of tissue metabolism and induction of a transient but important immune response at 4 days after infection. No majority mutations emerged in the viral population. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the differential in vitro pathogenesis of respiratory viruses during the acute infection phase and their ability to persist under immune tolerance. These data help to appreciate the range of disease severity observed in vivo and the occurrence of chronic respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts.","output":"Propagation of respiratory viruses in human airway epithelia reveals persistent virus-specific signatures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surfactants, whose existence has been recognized as early as 2800 BC, have had a long history with the development of human civilization.

The aim of this study was to analyse the postoperative outcomes after DO. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 56 consecutive patients who underwent Whipple's procedure from January 2007 to December 2014 in a tertiary Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplant Unit. After pancreatic resection in open surgery, we performed DO of the Wirsung duct with Cyanoacrylate glue independently from the stump characteristics. The mean follow-up was 24.5 months. Results: In total, 29 (60.4%) were men and 19 were (39.6%) women with a mean age of 62.79 (SD  10.02) years. Surgical indications were in 95% of cases malignant diseases. The incidence of POPF after DO was 31 (64.5%): 10 (20.8%) patients had a Grade A fistula, 18 (37.5%) Grade B fistula, and 3 (6.2%) Grade C fistula. No statistical differences were demonstrated in the development of POPF according to pancreatic duct diameter groups (p = 0.2145).

Therefore, as long as a substantial proportion of the population remains susceptible to infection, the potential for new epidemic waves persists even in settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, unless sufficient countermeasures are in place. In this study, we examine the Australian state of New South Wales, a setting with prolonged low transmission, high mobility, non-universal mask usage, and a well-functioning test-and-trace system. We investigate how vulnerable the state would be to resurgences in COVID-19 transmission under variations in the levels of testing, tracing, and mask usage. Methods: We use a stochastic agent-based model, calibrated to the New South Wales epidemic and policy environment, to simulate possible epidemic outcomes over October 1 to December 31, 2020, under a range of assumptions about contact tracing efficacy, testing rates, and mask uptake. Results: We find that the relative impact of masks is greatest when testing and tracing rates are lower (and vice versa). With very high testing rates (90% of people with symptoms, plus 90% of people with a known history of contact with a confirmed case), we estimate that the epidemic would remain under control until at least the end of 2020, with as little as 70-110 new infections estimated over October 1 to December 31 under high mask uptake scenarios, or 340-1400 without masks, depending on the efficacy of community contact tracing. However, across comparable levels of mask uptake and contact tracing, the number of infections over this period would be up to 6 times higher if the testing rate was 80% instead of 90%, 17 times higher if the testing rate was 65%, or more than 100 times higher with a 50% testing rate. Conclusions: Our work suggests that testing, tracing and masks can all be effective means of controlling transmission in dynamic community settings. A multifaceted strategy that combines all three, alongside continued hygiene and distancing protocols, is likely to be the most robust means of controlling community-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Robust test and trace strategies can prevent COVID-19 resurgences: a case study from New South Wales, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this article is to analyse the civil responsibilities of the animal owner due to any damage it may have caused.

Often people rough sleeping or staying in temporary accommodation live chaotic lifestyles and find it difficult to access healthcare in a traditional sense and when they do can experience discrimination and a lack of empathy and understanding of their circumstances. There are currently no specific physiotherapy services dedicated to this population in Greater Manchester. In order to develop a physiotherapy service that is compatible with the needs of this population it is important to work with local drop in centres and charities. The aim of this project was to develop and pilot a student led physiotherapy drop in clinic as part of a hub and spoke placement at the Manchester Movement Unit. This would enhance student practice education whilst providing a service to a population who have historically experienced significant health inequalities. Methods: Physiotherapy students attended a drop in caf catering for a homeless and vulnerable population in Manchester. The services they provided included volunteering in the caf, having discussions with the service users about physiotherapy, illness, injury and health promotion and providing a physiotherapy drop in assessment and advice service and offering the opportunity for follow up appointments. The students were supported via long arm supervision by University staff. A retrospective audit of clinical case notes was undertaken. The experiences of two students were documented in a Podcast and another two students in a reflective presentation. Results: 34 people accessed the service an average of 1.3 times each. Two females and 32 males accessed the service with a mean age of 35 years. 19 of the service users were rough sleepers and 6 were in temporary accommodation. 21 accessed assessment and advice for chronic conditions that were predominantly musculoskeletal pain of spinal origin and one person had been diagnosed with MS some years ago but never accessed any treatment. Most of the service users were satisfied with education and reassurance about their condition, how best to self manage and didnt want to access follow up appointments. The physiotherapy students reported that they felt their confidence and ability to communicate and empathise with this population had improved and they had better understanding of the challenges faced in accessing healthcare. They also felt that they had a better understanding of the needs of the population and developed the ability to think creatively about how to support rough sleepers in the self management of conditions. Conclusion(s): Although this project was cut short due to Covid restrictions impacting access to the drop in centre the aim and objectives were met. Physiotherapy services can be adapted to suit the needs of the homeless population. Impact: The results of this pilot have demonstrated that physiotherapy students can have a fulfilling and diverse learning experience whilst providing bespoke and essential services to support this vulnerable community.

Unfortunately, revisional surgery is required in 20-30% of cases. Data comparing revisional and primary gastric bypass procedures are scarce. This study compared revisional malabsorptive laparoscopic very very long limb (VVLL) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) with primary VVLL RYGB and tested the hypothesis that one-stage revisional laparoscopic VVLL RYGB is an effective procedure after failed LAGB. METHODS In this study, 48 revisional VVLL RYGBs were matched one-to-one with 48 primary VVLL RYGBs. The outcome measures were operating time, conversion to open surgery, excess weight loss (EWL), and early and late morbidity. RESULTS Surgical and medical morbidities did not differ significantly. No conversions occurred. The revisional group showed an EWL of 41.8% after 12 months of follow-up evaluation and 45.1% after 24 months based on the pre-revisional weight. The total EWL based on the weight before the LAGB was calculated to be 54.3% after 12 months and 57.2% after 24 months. The EWL in the primary RYGB group was significantly higher for both types of calculation: 41.8%/54.3% versus 64.1 % (p < 0.001 and <0.01) after 12 months and 45.1%/57.2% versus 70.4% (p < 0.001 and <0.002) after 24 months.

Our investigation aims to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on the home duties and workplace productivity of academic radiologists with respect to gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 49-question survey was distributed to 926 members of Association of University Radiologists in October 2020. Several categories were addressed: demographics; workplace changes; stress levels and personal experiences with illness; time spent on domestic obligations; and perception of productivity during COVID-19. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). RESULTS: A total of 96 responses across 30 states, 53.1% male and 46.9% female were received. Women report spending more time on unpaid domestic duties than men prior to COVID-19, with men spending a median of 5-10 h/wk and women spending a median of 10-15 h/wk (p = 0.043). With pandemic onset, both genders reported that women did more of the homecare, when not split equally. Women with young children reported a significant decrease in work-from-home productivity compared to men with young children (p = 0.007). Men reported they had more time to be productive compared to women (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt the advancement of women in radiology leadership roles by creating disparate effects on productivity due to increased workloads at home for women. This could potentially lead to decreases in promotions and research productivity in years to come that far outlast the acute phases of the pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Radiology Faculty - An Exacerbation of Gender Differences in Unpaid Home Duties and Professional Productivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) workplace complaints rose by more than 15% between February and October 2020, with the majority revolving around unacceptable COVID-19 workplace conditions that essential workers had to endure1 however, this metric did not extend to the voices of incarcerated populations, who have been vital to the functioning of our society but have not received proper protection.

Current treatments are focused on systemic administration of immunomodulatory drugs, but they have a broad range of undesirable side-effects. RNA interference is a highly specific endogenous mechanism that regulates the expression of the gene at the transcript level, which can be repurposed using exogenous short interfering RNA [siRNA] to repress expression of the target gene. While siRNA therapeutics can offer an alternative to existing therapies, with a high specificity critical for chronically administrated drugs, evidence of their potency compared to chemical kinase inhibitors used in clinics is still lacking in alleviating an adverse inflammatory response. METHODS: We provide a framework to select highly specific siRNA, with a focus on two kinases strongly involved in pro-inflammatory diseases, namely JAK1 and JAK3. Using western-blot, real-time quantitative PCR and large-scale analysis, we assessed the specificity profile of these siRNA drugs and compared their efficacy to the most recent and promising kinase inhibitors for Janus kinases [Jakinibs], tofacitinib and filgotinib. RESULTS: siRNA drugs can reach higher efficiency and selectivity at lower doses [5 pM vs 1 M] than Jakinibs. Moreover, JAK silencing lasted up to 11 days, even with 6 h pulse transfection.

AM attenuated hepatocellular injuries and delayed both periportal and pericentral fibrosis in the TAA-treated rats. The comparison of findings at day 30 and 60 showed that TAA-induced fibrotic changes were progressive in time, and that the beneficial effects of AM only became apparent after prolonged treatment. The livers of rats treated with both TAA and AM had less space surrounding the portal vessels, improved preservation of the hepatic microvascular pattern, and minimally altered sinusoidal patterns with few signs of terminal portal venule remodeling. AM therefore partially protected the liver against hepatotoxin-induced fibrosis and the associated microvascular changes.

In addition, data regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), farm hygiene, and farm management were collected in order to identify possible risks for ESBL occurrence. Ten farms participated in the study with a median of 781 milking cows (319C1701). All calves investigated were younger than two weeks with an average age of 6.8 (3.9) days. The farms were visited and samples were collected twice at an interval of 7C11 months. Faecal samples diluted 1:10, were plated onto Brilliance(TM) ESBL agar in duplicates. After 24 hours at 37C, colonies were counted and total colony forming units (cfu)/ml calculated. Bacteria species were identified biochemically. ESBL-production was phenotypically confirmed using the MICRONAUT-S -Lactamases system. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using VITEK(?) 2 technology. Phylotyping of E. coli isolates and screening for bla genes was performed by PCR. ESBL-producing enterobacteria were detected on all farms and 96.5% of calves investigated shed ESBL-positive bacteria. Of all ESBL-producing isolates, the majority were E. coli (92.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (2.0%). The majority of E. coli isolates was clearly assigned to phylogroup C (25.0%), followed by phylogroups A (15.2%) and E (14.1%). CTX-M group 1 was most frequently detected (80.4%). E. cloacae contained bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM) or bla(SHV). K. pneumoniae harboured bla(SHV) only. Besides resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins, the majority of isolates was also resistant to one or more antibiotic classes, with a high proportion being resistant against fluoroqinolones. 52.5% of isolates were further characterised as threefold multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria (3MDR-GNB) according to the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention. None of the isolates were 4MDR-GNB, i.e. none revealed carbapenem-resistance. Penicillins were the most frequently administered antibiotics to calves on most farms and were the predominant substance class at herd level on all farms. Overall, the number of calves treated prior to sampling was rather low (11.7%). Analyses of data regarding the farm management identified weaknesses in biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection. Besides beta-lactam antibiotics being the most commonly used antibiotics no other risk factors could be identified. In summary, the prevalence of ESBL-carriers in dairy calves was exceptionally high and should be motivation to develop strategies for the reduction of multidrug-resistant bacteria in farm animals.","output":"Multidrug-resistant enterobacteria in newborn dairy calves in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective solutions are needed to decrease the greenhouse gases emissions of the transport sector, not only in terms of supply-side measures, but also including demand-side solutions. This paper focuses on the passenger demand related to daily commuting, either for work or study purposes. A bottom-up analysis is presented, which draws from detailed data for Lombardy, the most populous region in Northern Italy, to build an estimate of the annual energy consumption and emissions related to commuting. The potential of different measures to decrease emissions is evaluated, including the renovation of the vehicle stock, higher levels of remote working, and the deployment of carpooling schemes. The results show that the largest part of the current emissions from commuting is caused by car use, both due to its higher modal share and to the higher specific emissions, which are in turn also contributed by the low occupancy rates. The renewal of the current vehicle stock can lead to significant emission savings, thanks to both improved efficiency and higher shares of electrification. Remote working could also play a significant part, especially when it is applied to workers that face the longest commuting distances. Conversely, carpooling seems to be providing lower benefits, not so much because of lower effectiveness but more so because of constraints and barriers to its implementation.","output":"Assessing Commuting Energy and Emissions Savings through Remote Working and Carpooling: Lessons from an Italian Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the level of medical students self-directed learning (SDL) ability in mainland China and to identify its modifiable influencing factors for medical educators to take measures to improve medical professionals ability in SDL. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January and June 2019. SETTING: This study involved students from five medical colleges located in the cities of Shenyang, Binzhou, Xuzhou, Shanghai and Guangzhou of mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 365 medical students and residents sampled by the stratified clustered random method from five medical colleges. METHODS: The t-test, F-test and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to test the association between personal and contextual factors of medical students and SDL. RESULTS: The mean total SDL score was 76.12 (SD=10.96), implying that Chinese mainland medical students had moderate SDL ability. A univariate analysis found that the personal characteristics of confidence, students enjoyment of their specialty, utilisation of library resources, learning goals and habits and academic performance as well as the contextual factors of age, gender, learning resources, family income and group discussion were significantly associated with the total SDL score (p<0.05). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that academic performance, learning goals, confidence, learning resources, utilisation of library resources, family income and age were significantly associated with the total SDL score (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that the contextual factors of learning resources, family income and age as well as the personal factors of academic performance, learning goals, confidence and utilisation of library resources were associated with medical students SDL ability in mainland China.

Our data showed that 1,127, 999, 910, and 1,138 differentially expressed proteins were significantly altered at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after REV infection, respectively. Morphological analysis showed that REV infection reduced in cortical lymphocytes, bursal follicle atrophy, and nuclear damage. Bioinformatics analysis indicated these proteins were mainly involved with immune responses, energy metabolism, cellular processes, biological regulation, metabolic processes, response to stimuli, and multicellular organismal process. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway cluster analysis showed that post-infection, proteins were enriched in the cell cycle, Wnt signaling, antigen processing and presentation, cytokine receptor interaction, adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate signaling pathway, and NF-B signaling.

GOALS: The aim was to determine the prevalence of MAFLD among COVID-19 patients and its influence on the outcomes of COVID-19 by meta-analysis. METHODS: Our study protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021242243). The studies published on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science before March 11, 2021 were screened. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality scale were used to assess the quality of the studies. Pooled analysis was conducted using the software RevMan version 5.3 and Stata version 15.0 SE. The stability of the results was assessed by sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots, Egger test, and trim-and-fill analysis. RESULTS: Seven studies covering 2141 COVID-19 patients were included. It was confirmed that MAFLD increased the risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratios: 1.80, 95% confidence interval: 1.53-2.13, P<0.00001). No association was found between the presence of MAFLD and the occurrence of COVID-19 death. The pooled prevalence of MAFLD among COVID-19 patients was 36% (95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.49, P<0.00001). Sensitivity analysis confirmed that the initial results were stable.

As a result, many governments have resorted to widespread social distancing measures and mass quarantines ('lock-downs') to reduce transmission and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. However, such measures impose heavy human and societal costs. Automated or semi-automated digital contact tracing, in conjunction with scaled-up community testing, has been proposed as a key part of exit strategies from lockdowns. However, the effectiveness of these approaches to contact tracing is unclear, and to be effective, trusted, and widely adopted such technology must overcome several challenges. Methods and analysis We will perform a rapid systematic review to assess the effectiveness of automated and semi-automated digital tools for contact tracing, and identify key considerations for successful implementation, to inform the control of COVID-19.

Early sites of Lewy pathology are the olfactory bulb and enteric plexus of the stomach. We propose that a neurotropic pathogen, probably viral, enters the brain via two routes: (i) nasal, with anterograde progression into the temporal lobe; and (ii) gastric, secondary to swallowing of nasal secretions in saliva. These secretions might contain a neurotropic pathogen that, after penetration of the epithelial lining, could enter axons of the Meissner's plexus and, via transsynaptic transmission, reach the preganglionic parasympathetic motor neurones of the vagus nerve. This would allow retrograde transport into the medulla and, from here, into the pons and midbrain until the substantia nigra is reached and typical aspects of disease commence. Evidence for this theory from the perspective of olfactory and autonomic dysfunction is reviewed, and the possible routes of pathogenic invasion are considered.

First, we aim to investigate the cause of new infections despite all strategies of control followed in these countries including media reports, awareness, and treatment, self-distancing and quarantine, by estimating the number of these people who underestimate the lives and safety of citizens and put them at risk. To do this, we use real data of the COVID-19 in Italy and Morocco to estimate the parameters of the model, and then we predict the number of these populations. Second, we propose an optimal control strategy that could be the optimal and the efficient way for the Moroccan and Italian authorities and other countries to make the state of emergency more efficient and to control the spread of the COVID-19. The model is analyzed for both countries and then to compare the implications of the obtained results.

The discovery of autoantibodies, including anti-ganglioside GM1 antibodies in the axonal form of GBS, anti-neurofascin 155 and anti-contactin 1 antibodies in typical and distal forms of CIDP, and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies in neuromyelitis optica, contributed to the understanding of the disease process in a subpopulation of patients conventionally diagnosed with demyelinating diseases. However, patients with these antibodies are now considered to have independent disease entities, including acute motor axonal neuropathy, nodopathy or paranodopathy, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, because primary lesions in these diseases are distinct from those in conventional demyelinating diseases. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying demyelination caused by macrophages remain unclear. Electron microscopy studies revealed that macrophages destroy myelin as if they are the principal players in the demyelination process. Recent studies suggest that macrophages seem to select specific sites of myelinated fibers, including the nodes of Ranvier, paranodes, and internodes, for the initiation of demyelination in individual cases, indicating that specific components localized to these sites play an important role in the behavior of macrophages that initiate myelin phagocytosis.

However, in the US, this behavior was not universally adopted. In late March of 2020, we surveyed 2,500 US respondents to better understand the drivers of social distancing behavior. Our survey measured demographics, social distancing awareness, beliefs, barriers, and behaviors. We first used predictive modeling to identify a broad set of factors correlated with social distancing. However, it could not reveal which variables were the critical causal drivers of this behavior. We used Bayesian network (BN) to map the causal relationships between variables. Our BN pinpointed which variables were causal drivers of social distancing intentions and behavior: higher financial security, higher information seeking, and higher worry about the coronavirus. The BN cast doubt on the effectiveness of potential interventions that would have been suggested by the predictive model alone, such as interventions on community norms perceptions, as well as factors that have previously received attention in the media, such as religion and political affiliation. Finally, to more easily identify target groups for policy recommendations, we performed K-means clustering that distinguished population segments based on social distancing beliefs and behavior. We identified four segments ranging from a 'worried social distancers' (55.3% always social distanced), to 'uninformed skeptics' (25.9% always practiced). Taken together, our results demonstrate how a precision public health approach can help policymakers design more targeted and efficient public health interventions for social distancing.

This pattern of issue behavior is consistent with firms seeing unencumbered collateral as a form of insurance, to be used only in extremis.","output":"The Secured Credit Premium and the Issuance of Secured Debt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, due to the Nightingale year and COVID-19 crisis, nursing is in the public eye more than ever. Nurses often are being seen as compassionate helpers. The public image of nursing, however, also consists of stereotypes such as nursing being a 'doing' profession and care being a 'female' characteristic. Next to that, nursing is associated with images from the past, such as 'the lady with the lamp'. Therefore, in the public eye at least, the nursing identity seems a simple and straightforward enough construct, but nothing less is true. Looking at what a professional identity consists of, historic and social developments influence a group identity as a construct. In addition, individual, professional and contemporary societal moralities, including stereotypes, play its role. Nurses themselves reinforce stereotypes in order to fit into what is expected, even when they believe professional behaviour encompasses other features. They may do so individually as well as in a group context. But nursing actually seems to be better off when viewed upon as a diverse, autonomous profession. Moral values such as compassion motivate nurses to enter the profession. Research shows that if such values are addressed in daily practice, nursing could perhaps be saved from nurses leaving the profession because of feeling unfulfilled. Another aspect concerns the huge nursing body of knowledge. If seen as the ground on which nursing behaviour is standing, it would contribute to a different image of nursing than simplified stereotypes, which do not acknowledge the complex nature of the profession. This paper challenges the idea that the nursing identity is unchangeable and the notion that 'a nurse will always be a nurse'. By doing so, the paper contributes to a debate on the supposed 'true' nature of the nursing identity and opens a discussion on the need for it to change.","output":"What makes a nurse today?

The National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UA), especially its health-care/medical personnel, has been actively involved in the first line of state responses to COVID-19. To estimate the prevalence of antibodies (Igs) against SARS-CoV-2 among NKUA members, we designed a five consecutive monthly serosurvey among randomly selected NKUA consenting volunteers. Here, we present the results from the first 2500 plasma samples collected during JuneCJuly 2020. Twenty-five donors were tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs; thus, the overall seroprevalence was 1.00%. The weighted overall seroprevalence was 0.93% (95% CI: 0.27, 2.09) and varied between males [1.05% (95% CI: 0.18, 2.92)] and females [0.84% (95% CI: 0.13, 2.49)], age-groups and different categories (higher in participants from the School of Health Sciences and in scientific affiliates/faculty members/laboratory assistants), but no statistical differences were detected. Although focused on the specific population of NKUA members, our study shows that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Igs for the period JuneCJuly 2020 remained low and provides knowledge of public health importance for the NKUA members. Given that approximately one in three infections was asymptomatic, continuous monitoring of the progression of the pandemic by assessing Ig seroprevalence is needed.","output":"Seroprevalence of Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among the Personnel and Students of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece: A Preliminary Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic affecting all parts of the world is having huge implications for stroke care.

Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most promising candidates for combating this global epidemic, and scientists all over the world have made great efforts to this end. However, manipulation of the SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in the biosafety level 3 laboratory. This makes experiments complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, a safer system for working with this virus is urgently needed. Here, we report the construction of plasmid-based, non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 replicons with turbo-green fluorescent protein and/or firefly luciferase reporters by reverse genetics using transformation-associated recombination cloning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Replication of these replicons was achieved simply by direct transfection of cells with the replicon plasmids as evident by the expression of reporter genes. Using SARS-CoV-2 replicons, the inhibitory effects of E64-D and remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 replication were confirmed, and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) value of remdesivir and E64-D was estimated by different quantification methods respectively, indicating that these SARS-CoV-2 replicons are useful tools for antiviral drug evaluation.

The models that guide the management of these fisheries almost always assume reproduction is proportional to mass (isometry), when fecundity generally increases disproportionately to mass (hyperallometry). Judged against several management reference points, we show that assuming isometry overestimates the replenishment potential of exploited fish stocks by 22% (range: 2% to 78%) for 32 of the world's largest fisheries, risking systematic overharvesting. We calculate that target catches based on assumptions of isometry are more than double those based on assumptions of hyperallometry for most species, such that common reference points are set twice as high as they should be to maintain the target level of replenishment. We also show that hyperallometric reproduction provides opportunities for increasing the efficacy of tools that are underused in standard fisheries management, such as protected areas or harvest slot limits. Adopting management strategies that conserve large, hyperfecund fish may, in some instances, result in higher yields relative to traditional approaches.

However, it is a challenge to keep masks sealed during exercise, as ventilation can increase from 5 to 10 L/min at rest to up to 200 L/min so that masks may be blown away from the face. To reduce leakage e.g. during exercise, a face mask was developed that is taped onto the face. The aim of this study was to investigate during a graded exercise test the effect of a taped filter mask on the perception of breathlessness, heart rate, blood lactate concentration, and oxygen saturation when compared to a surgical mask and no mask. METHODS: Eight healthy trained participants (4 females), aged 24.5  3.3 years performed graded exercise test until volitional exhaustion under three conditions: (1) No mask/control, (2) surgical mask or (3) taped filter mask. During these tests, we measured perception of breathlessness, heart rate, blood lactate concentration and peripheral oxygen saturation and analysed the resultant data with one or two-way repeated measures ANOVAs. We also used a questionnaire to evaluate mask comfort and analysed the data with paired t-tests. RESULTS: When compared to wearing no mask, maximal workload was significantly reduced with a taped filter face mask by 12  6% (p < 0.001) and with a surgical mask by 3  6% (p > 0.05). Moreover, subjects perceive the sensation of \\"severe breathlessness\\" at a 12  9% lower workload (p = 0.012) with a taped face mask, and 7  13% lower workload with a surgical mask (p > 0.05) when compared to wearing no mask. Oxygen saturation at 65% of the maximal workload is 1.5% lower (p = 0.018) with a taped mask than no mask. Heart rate and blood lactate concentration are not significantly different in-between no mask, surgical mask and taped mask at any workload. When compared to wearing a surgical mask, wearing a taped filter face mask has a significantly better wearing comfort (p = 0.038), feels better on the skin (p = 0.004), there is a lower sensation of moisture (p = 0.026) and wearers perceive that less heat is generated (p = 0.021).

Clinical inertia may contribute, including patient-physician uncertainty about how variability in blood pressures impacts overall control. Better information display may support clinician-patient hypertension decision making through reduced cognitive load and improved situational awareness. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team employed iterative user-centered design to create a blood pressure visualization EHR prototype that included patient-generated blood pressure data. An attitude and behavior survey and 10 focus groups with patients (N = 16) and physicians (N = 24) guided iterative design and confirmation phases. Thematic analysis of qualitative data yielded insights into patient and physician needs for hypertension management. RESULTS: Most patients indicated measuring home blood pressure, only half share data with physicians. When receiving home blood pressure data, 88% of physicians indicated entering gestalt averages as text into clinical notes. Qualitative findings suggest that including a data visualization that included home blood pressures brought this valued data into physician workflow and decision-making processes. Data visualization helps both patients and physicians to have a fuller understanding of the blood pressure story and ultimately promotes the activated engaged patient and prepared proactive physician central to the Chronic Care Model. Both patients and physicians expressed concerns about workflow for entering and using home blood pressure data for clinical care. CONCLUSIONS: Our user-centered design process with physicians and patients produced a well-received blood pressure visualization prototype that includes home blood pressures and addresses patient-physician information needs. Next steps include evaluating a recent EHR visualization implementation, designing annotation functions aligned with users needs, and addressing additional stakeholders needs (nurses, care managers, caregivers). This significant innovation has potential to improve quality of care for hypertension through better patient-physician understanding of control and goals. It also has the potential to enable remote monitoring of patient blood pressure, a newly reimbursed activity, and is a strong addition to telehealth efforts.","output":"Home blood pressure data visualization for the management of hypertension: designing for patient and physician information needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 is a kind of viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Cholesterol depletion of cell membranes with methyl--cyclodextrin resulted in reduction of pseudovirus infection. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses resumed with cholesterol supplementation. Together, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, and endosomal acidification, are key steps of SARS-CoV-2 required for infection of host cells.

Most of the adverse events reported by the vaccine recipients were minor. However, autoimmune hematological complications such as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and TTP have also been reported post-COVID-19 vaccination. Given this, we sought to reflect on the existing cases of TTP, whether de novo or relapsing, reported after COVID-19 vaccination to further gain insight into any association, if present, and outcomes. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Ebsco databases for published individual case reports on the occurrence or relapse of TTP after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 23 articles (27 patients) were included in this qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The mean age for the patients who developed de novo TTP post-COVID-19 vaccination was 51.3 years. TTP episodes were seen mostly after BNT162b2 vaccine, followed by mRNA-1273 vaccine. All patients with immune TTP except one received plasma exchange (PLEX) and steroids. One patient passed away after two days of hospitalization, likely due to a sudden cardiovascular event.

PARTICIPANTS Subjects were 26 healthy control subjects, 14 patients with CFS but without FM (CFS alone), and 12 patients with CFS and FM (CFS+FM)-all women. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS We studied transition probabilities and rates between sleep stages (waking, rapid eye movement [REM] sleep, stage 1 [S1], stage 2 [S2], and slow-wave sleep [SWS]) and duration distributions of each sleep stage. We found that the probability of transition from REM sleep to waking was significantly greater in subjects with CFS alone than in control subjects, which may be the specific sleep problem for people with CFS alone. Probabilities of (a) transitions from waking, REM sleep, and S1 to S2 and (b) those from SWS to waking and S1 were significantly greater in subjects with CFS+FM than in control subjects; in addition, rates of these transitions were also significantly increased in subjects with CFS+FM.

Evidence suggests that cannabis smoking, as well as alternate methods of cannabis use (e.g., vaping, edibles) have become a prevalent mode of consumption among this population. Substance use or misuse peaks during emerging adulthood and may be influenced by extreme economic, social and community developments, such as policy changes, public health concerns, and significant global events such as pandemics. For instance, it is highly likely that cannabis consumption trends among at-risk populations were influenced by the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada, the declaration of the \\"e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury\\" or \\"EVALI\\" outbreak, and the \\"COVID-19\\" pandemic.

The positive predictive was value 71% and the negative predictive value 91%. The unexplained alert rate was 0.23 alerts/patient year and the false negative rate 0.17 alerts/patient year. True positive alerts [42 days (IQR 28C63)] lasted longer than false positive alerts [28 days (IQR 21C44)], p = 0.02. The maximal HeartLogic(TM) index was higher in true positive alerts [26 (IQR 21C34)] compared to false positive alerts [19 (IQR 17C24)], p < 0.01. Patients with higher HeartLogic(TM) indexes required more intense treatment (index height in outpatient setting 25 [IQR 20C32], day clinic treatment 28 [IQR 24C36] and hospitalized patients 45 [IQR 35C58], respectively), p < 0.01. CONCLUSION: The CIED-based HeartLogic(TM) algorithm facilitates early detection of impending fluid retention and thereby enables clinical action to prevent this at early stage. The current analysis illustrates that higher and persistent alerts are indicative for true positive alerts and higher index values are indicative for more severe fluid retention.","output":"Performance of a HeartLogic(TM) Based Care Path in the Management of a Real-World Chronic Heart Failure Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This living systematic review presents the monthly update of the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action Steering Committee. The aim of this study was to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to October 31th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action was applied. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases were searched, and papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The database search retrieved 2704 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1185 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 22 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence table, 17 studies (77%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (23%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies (N.=19; 86%) provided epidemiological data about the disease natural history/determining factor or the clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, while only two studies focused on health service organization and intervention efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The most recent published COVID-19 research relevant to rehabilitation primarily provides data on the clinical course and the clinical presentation of the pathology, rather than on rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, long-term monitoring, or new health service organization models are lacking.","output":"Rehabilitation and COVID-19: a rapid living systematic review 2020 by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field.

Currently, its antibacterial, antiviral, and fungicidal properties are highly desired in the food and cosmetic industries, in medicine, and pharmacology. Silver exhibits toxic effects not only on pathogenic organisms but also on healthy cells. Over the past 20 years, nanosilver, a new form of silver, has been introduced in various areas of industry. The transition to the nanoscale form results in the revision of standard approaches to items, including those based on this element, and the emergence of such a novel research area as nanosafety. In this review, we address the history of using different forms of silver, the mechanisms of its interaction with living cells, toxic properties, biokinetic parameters, capability for accumulation in different organs, effects on cognitive functions, and the clinically known argyrosis condition. Relevant publications are critically analyzed and conclusions are drawn.

Based on the data set provided by the Data Fountain platform, we evaluate the model and compare it with some typical models. Experimental results show that the Spatial Convolution Layer can merge features of the nodes and edges to reflect the spatial correlation, the Temporal Convolution Layer can extract the temporal dependence, and the Feature Component can enhance the importance of other attributes that affect the population density of the area.

Although the science of UVGI is well established, it can be difficult to determine in practice if sufficient levels of UVC has been irradiated to kill the target microbes in a room. This research presents the development of a low-cost wireless UVC sensor that can be used to systematically track the UV irradiation dose on target surfaces during a UV disinfection procedure.

The applicability of the system was assessed through an experiment where the devices were placed at 12 locations in a CT scan treatment room that was subject to a UVGI disinfection procedure using an autonomous UV robot. Over the course of three cleaning sessions, each lasting approximately 10 minutes, it was found that each site location received an average UVC dose of 13mJ/cm2, which is more than published D90 values for SARS-Cov-2, influenza, and a number of known pathogens that are commonly found in hospital settings.

Many faculty have not received IPE in their own training and struggle with interprofessional teaching. METHODS: To train faculty to conduct a peer-teaching observation and provide feedback focused on interprofessional teaching, we created a 3-hour didactic and skills practice workshop. The didactic portion considered ways interprofessional teaching differed from uniprofessional teaching, discussed elements of effective feedback, and reviewed the critical steps of a peer-teaching observation. In the skills practice portion, participants watched videos of different teaching scenarios and role-played as a peer observer providing feedback to the instructor in the videos. Participants completed a pre/post self-assessment and workshop evaluation form. RESULTS: Eighteen faculty from four professions (dentistry, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy) participated in the workshop from 2020 to 2021. On a 5-point scale (1 = poor, 5 = excellent), participants rated the overall workshop quality 4.9 and the likelihood of making a change in their teaching/professional practice 4.8. Workshop participants self-reported ability to provide feedback to a peer on their interprofessional teaching improved after workshop participation (preworkshop M = 2.9, postworkshop M = 3.8, p < .01).

Similar and different characteristics between KD and MIS-C have been reported in a variety of literature. We aimed to focus on reviewing clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of KD and MIS-C. METHODS: We searched articles in the electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library database, EMBASE, and MEDLINE with the keywords \\"multiple inflammatory syndrome\\" and/or \\"COVID-19\\" and/or \\"Kawasaki disease\\" and \\"children\\". RESULTS: Main presentations of MIS-C and KD include fever, rashes, mucous membrane involvement, conjunctivitis, hands and feet erythema/edema, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, compared with the highest incidence of KD among some Asian countries, MIS-C is common among Black and Hispanic children. MIS-C is common in older children and teenagers, whereas classic KD is common in children under five years of age. Gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and coagulopathy are common in MIS-C patients but are not common in classic KD. Cardiac manifestations are more common than KD, including myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms. Severe cases in MIS-C present with vasodilated or cardiogenic shock that requires fluid resuscitation, muscular support, and even mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), whereas KD rarely presents with these manifestations and requires these treatments. Increased serum ferritin, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common in MIS-C. However, thrombocytosis is a characteristic feature of KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and moderate-high dose aspirin are still a standard recommended treatment for KD. In addition to the above-mentioned medications, steroids and biological drugs are frequently used in patients with MIS-C. Most of the children with KD have a good prognosis; however, the long-term clinical outcomes of MIS-C are not clear. CONCLUSIONS: The overall presentation and treatment of MIS-C appear to overlap with KD. However, there are still great differences between the syndromes, and it is controversial to say whether MIS-C is a new entity or is a \\"severe type\\" of KD.","output":"Similarities and differences between multiple inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease: clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19-related stay-at-home orders threatened the operation of food markets, especially in cities, which are the areas where food demand is concentrated and which are dependent on a supply that is grown and processed outside their borders.

A direct consequence of this inflammatory state in the lungs is the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), frequently observed in severe COVID-19 patients. The \\"cytokine storm\\" is associated with severe forms of COVID-19 and poor prognosis for COVID-19 patients. Sulforaphane (SFN), one of the main components of Brassica oleraceae L. (Brassicaceae or Cruciferae), is known to possess anti-inflammatory effects in tissues from several organs, among which joints, kidneys and lungs. PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to determine whether SFN is able to inhibit IL-6 and IL-8, two key molecules involved in the COVID-19 \\"cytokine storm\\". METHODS: The effects of SFN were studied in vitro on bronchial epithelial IB3-1 cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein). The anti-inflammatory activity of SFN on IL-6 and IL-8 expression has been evaluated by RT-qPCR and Bio-Plex analysis. RESULTS: In our study SFN inhibits, in cultured IB3-1 bronchial cells, the gene expression of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2. This represents the proof-of-principle that SFN may modulate the release of some key proteins of the COVID-19 \\"cytokine storm\\". CONCLUSION: The control of the cytokine storm is one of the major issues in the management of COVID-19 patients.

Several classes of dendrimers have been found useful as transfection agents for the delivery of siRNA because their surface can readily be functionalized, and the size of the dendriplexes they form with siRNA is within the range of conventional nanomedicine. In this study, commercially available generation 3 poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer was investigated for pulmonary delivery of siRNA directed against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#945; for the treatment of acute lung inflammation. Delivery efficiency was assessed in vitro in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and efficacy was evaluated in vivo in a murine model of LPS-induced lung inflammation upon pre-treatment with TNF-&#945; siRNA. The PAMAM dendrimer-siRNA complexes (dendriplexes) displayed strong siRNA condensation and high cellular uptake in macrophages compared with non-complexed siRNA. Q-PCR analyses showed that the dendriplexes mediated efficient and specific TNF-&#945; silencing in vitro, as compared to non-complexed siRNA and dendriplexes with negative control siRNA. Also in vivo, the PAMAM dendriplexes induced efficacious TNF-&#945; siRNA inhibition, as compared to non-complexed siRNA, upon pulmonary administration to mice with LPS-induced lung inflammation. Hence, these data suggest that PAMAM dendrimers are promising for the local delivery of TNF-&#945; siRNA in the treatment of lung inflammation via pulmonary administration.","output":"Treatment of acute lung inflammation by pulmonary delivery of anti-TNF- siRNA with PAMAM dendrimers in a murine model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the interactions between people increases, the impending menace of COVID-19 outbreaks materialize, and there is an inclination to apply lockdowns.

Despite all the precautions taken, the pandemic attack continues and the rapid increase in the number of deaths suggest that this virus has entered the cell through different pathways and caused damage through different mechanisms. The main reason why the ACE2 pathway comes to the fore in all scientific studies is that this receptor is located at the entry point of basic mechanisms that provide alveolo-capillary homeostasis. SARS-CoV-2 has to use nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-kB), caveloae, clathrin, lipoxin, serine protease and proteasome pathways in addition to ACE2 to enter the target cell and initiate damage. For this reason, while new drug development studies are continuing, in order to be beneficial to patients in their acute period, it is imperative that we are able to come up with drugs that activate or inhibit these pathways and are currently in clinical use.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants), people with a long gown had less contamination than those with a coverall, and coveralls were more difficult to doff (low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort, and may therefore even lead to more contamination. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","output":"Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An epidemic that occurs worldwide, involving many countries and affecting a large population is called as a pandemic.

METHODS: We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. RESULTS: The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P-value <0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P-value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-4.25; P-value <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI (P-value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients with AGI III/IV had higher daily and mean D-dimer and CRP levels compared to AGI 0/I/II (P-value <0.0001).

Despite the progress made in the understanding of the SARS-CoV2 pathology and the clinical management of COVID-19, the viral illness is still a health concern since outbreaks continue to resurge due to the emergence of mutant variants of the virus that resist the vaccines. Therefore, there is an urgent need for therapeutics that can block SARS-CoV2 viral transmission and the progression from infection to severe symptomatic illness.

Here we present an overview of the natural products that possess SARS-CoV2 antiviral activity and the potential to benefit the management of COVID-19.","output":"Natural products as a source of novel drugs for treating SARS-CoV2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the concerns, current implementation status and correct usage, and factors inhibiting implementation and correct use of a COVID-19 contact tracing application among the ordinary citizens in Japan. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 2013 participants who were selected among registrants of an Internet research company between September 8 and 13, 2020. METHODS: Participants completed an online survey that included thoughts and concerns about the application, status of use, and questions about whether the application was being used correctly. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis to clarify the association between the use of the app and sociodemographic factors and user concerns. RESULTS: Of the 2013 respondents, 429 (21.3%) participants reported using this application, but only 60.8% of them used it correctly. The percentage of those having some concerns about the application ranged from 45.9% to 75.5%, with the highest percentage being doubts about effectiveness of apps for preventing spread of infection. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed, the main concerns inhibiting application use were insufficient knowledge of how to use it, privacy concerns, doubts about the effectiveness of the app, and concerns about battery consumption and communication costs. Additionally, the prevalence of the application was lower for lower-income individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that income may create inequalities in the efficacy and effectiveness of COVID-19 contact tracing applications. Awareness activity strategies to dispel such concerns and support low-income individuals may be needed.","output":"Survey on usage and concerns of a COVID-19 contact tracing application in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper provides a historical review of the interview research that has been used by science educators to investigate childrens basic astronomy knowledge.

The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.","output":"Statistical Decision Properties of Imprecise Trials Assessing COVID-19 Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endometrial stem/progenitor cells have been proved to exist in periodically regenerated female endometrium and can be divided into three categories: endometrial epithelial stem/progenitor cells, CD140b(+)CD146(+) or SUSD2(+) endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs), and side population cells (SPs). Endometrial stem/progenitor cells in the menstruation blood are defined as menstrual stem cells (MenSCs). Due to their abundant sources, excellent proliferation, and autotransplantation capabilities, MenSCs are ideal candidates for cell-based therapy in regenerative medicine, inflammation, and immune-related diseases. Endometrial stem/progenitor cells also participate in the occurrence and development of endometriosis by entering the pelvic cavity from retrograde menstruation and becoming overreactive under certain conditions to form new glands and stroma through clonal expansion. Additionally, the limited bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMDSCs) in blood circulation can be recruited and infiltrated into the lesion sites, leading to the establishment of deep invasive endometriosis. On the other hand, cell derived from endometriosis may also enter the blood circulation to form circulating endometrial cells (CECs) with stem cell-like properties, and to migrate and implant into distant tissues. In this manuscript, by reviewing the available literature, we outlined the characteristics of endometrial stem/progenitor cells and summarized their roles in immunoregulation, regenerative medicine, and endometriosis, through which to provide some novel therapeutic strategies for reproductive and cancerous diseases.","output":"Endometrial stem/progenitor cells and their roles in immunity, clinical application, and endometriosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the most abundant white blood cells, are recruited rapidly to sites of infection to exert potent anti-microbial activity.

METHODS: Participants were premenopausal women (N = 183). Path models evaluated whether early life trauma predicted early pubertal timing and thereby, adult epigenetic age acceleration (indexed via four epigenetic clocks: Horvath DNAm Age, Hannum DNAm Age, DNAm PhenoAge, and DNAm GrimAge). Secondary analyses explored the effects of type of trauma (abuse and neglect) and adult chronic stress status (caregiver of child with autism and non-caregiver). RESULTS: Early life trauma and earlier age at menarche independently predicted accelerated aging based on one of the four epigenetic clocks, DNAm GrimAge, though early life trauma was not associated with age of menarche. Childhood abuse, but not neglect, predicted faster epigenetic aging; results did not differ by chronic stress status. CONCLUSIONS: Early trauma and early menarche appear to exert independent effects on DNAm GrimAge, which has been shown to be the strongest epigenetic predictor of mortality risk. This study identifies a potential correlate or determinant of accelerated epigenetic aging-menarcheal age.

Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, measures of anticoagulation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, are used to assess the clinical status of a patient. These laboratory tests may be useful for the triage of people with potential COVID-19 to prioritize them for different levels of treatment, especially in situations where time and resources are limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: On 4 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included both case-control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID-19. The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) alone; RT-PCR plus clinical expertise or and imaging; repeated RT-PCR several days apart or from different samples; WHO and other case definitions; and any other reference standard used by the study authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study. They also assessed the methodological quality of the studies, using QUADAS-2. We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9.4 for the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta-analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies. To facilitate interpretation of results, for each meta-analysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVID-19 patients and 56,585 non-COVID-19 patients in total. Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests. Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID-19, the included studies used detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection through RT-PCR as reference standard. There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied. For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity. None of the studies had either low risk of bias on all domains or low concerns for applicability for all domains. Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50%. These were: increase in interleukin-6, increase in C-reactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease. Blood count Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 93% and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 8.0% to 27%; very low-certainty evidence). The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. Four studies evaluated a decrease in neutrophil count. Their median specificity was 93%, corresponding to a summary sensitivity of 10% (95% CI 1.0% to 56%; low-certainty evidence). The 11 studies that evaluated an increase in neutrophil count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of an increase in neutrophil percentage (4 studies) was 59% (95% CI 1.0% to 100%) at median specificity (38%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in monocyte count (4 studies) was 13% (95% CI 6.0% to 26%) at median specificity (73%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in lymphocyte count (13 studies) was 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) at median specificity (53%; low-certainty evidence). Four studies that evaluated a decrease in lymphocyte percentage showed a lower median specificity and lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of a decrease in platelets (4 studies) was 19% (95% CI 10% to 32%) at median specificity (88%; low-certainty evidence). Liver function tests The summary sensitivity of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (9 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (7 studies) was 29% (95% CI 17% to 45%) at median specificity (81%) (low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in albumin (4 studies) was 21% (95% CI 3% to 67%) at median specificity (66%; low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in total bilirubin (4 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3.0% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; very low-certainty evidence). Markers of inflammation The summary sensitivity of an increase in CRP (14 studies) was 66% (95% CI 55% to 75%) at median specificity (44%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in procalcitonin (6 studies) was 3% (95% CI 1% to 19%) at median specificity (86%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in IL-6 (four studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low-certainty evidence). Other biomarkers The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 6% to 19%) at median specificity (94%) (low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 1% to 37%) at median specificity (91%; low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated are useful for accurately ruling in or ruling out COVID-19 on their own. Studies were done in specific hospitalized populations, and future studies should consider non-hospital settings to evaluate how these tests would perform in people with milder symptoms.","output":"Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 global pandemic has shaken the status quo including the way university counseling and assessment centers provide training to graduate students and psychological services to the community.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study followed cross-sectional design. Whole blood specimen was collected in the morning and was used as source of genomic DNA and serum for retinol concentration determination. Fisher exact test was performed to determine whether genotype frequencies were associated to retinol concentrations/vitamin A deficiency status. A level of P < .05 was identified as significant. RESULTS A total of 693 Filipino children and adolescents were included. Of the 693, there were at least 7.6% who bears the combined mutations for R267S + A379V. Association analysis showed that an inverse relationship exists between the A379V TT variant and vitamin A status. Although the exact role of these identified polymorphisms on retinol/carotenoid metabolism need to be confirmed in dedicated functional studies. CONCLUSION This study has identified for the first time the presence of 2 nonsynonymous genetic variants/mutations in the coding region of BCMO1 gene. Interestingly, one of these two variants, the A379V T, was found to be associated with vitamin A status. It is, therefore, warranted to investigate the role of BCMO1 variants for the success of supplementation programs and fortification efforts among vulnerable populations in this region.

This is especially important for protection against viruses that enter the host through the respiratory tract. We show that targeting the OX40 costimulatory receptor (CD134) strongly promotes mucosal memory in the CD8 T cell compartment. Systemic injection of an agonist antibody to OX40 strongly enhanced development of polyfunctional effector CD8 T cells that were induced after intraperitoneal infection with a highly virulent strain of vaccinia virus. These cells were located in lymphoid organs and also the lung, and importantly, long-term memory CD8 T cells were maintained in the lung over 1 year. Anti-OX40 also boosted memory development when mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with viral peptide. These CD8 T cells were sufficient to provide protection from lethal respiratory infection with live vaccinia virus independent of CD4 T cells and antibody. Again, the CD8 T cell populations that were induced after secondary infection displayed polyfunctionality and were maintained in the lung for over a year.

For such a purpose, especially if we wish to draw some parallels between past epidemics and COVID-19, historical records seemed to be more suitable than literary works. Nonetheless, we have taken this approach relying on La Peste (Albert Camus, 1947), a novel based on a fictional epidemic of plague in the Algerian town of Oran. Far from creating a barrier separating fiction from reality, this reading allowed us to establish several links with our current situation. Recognising that context and solutions vary widely between the two scenarios, core matters concerning epidemics seemed to remain invariable. The important role of data and statistics, the leadership acquired by health authorities, the separations of relatives or the negative effects on trade and business are some issues which took place in Oran as well as nowadays.

In this in vitro study, we used spectrometry to explore these questions. The time-dependent effect of conventional airing on aerosol concentrations was also studied. Everyday patient treatment situations were modeled. The test setups were defined by the applied instrument and its spray direction (high-speed turbine with direct/indirect airspray or ultrasonic scaler with indirect airspray) and the applied aerosol control system (the conventional high-volume evacuator or a lately introduced aerosol exhaustor). Two parameters were analyzed: total number concentration in the entire measurement range of the spectrometer and total number concentration within the 60 to 384 nm range. The results suggest that instrument type and spray direction significantly influence the resulting aerosol concentrations. Aerosol generation by the ultrasonic scaler is easily controlled. As for the high-speed turbine, the efficiency of control might depend on how exactly the instrument is used during a treatment. The results suggest that scenarios where the airspray is frequently directed toward the air of the operatory are the most difficult to control. The tested control systems did not differ in their efficiency, but the study could not provide conclusive results in this respect. With conventional airing through windows with a standard fan, a safety airing period of at least 15 minutes between treatments is recommended.","output":"Aerosol generation and control in the dental operatory: An in vitro spectrometric study of typical clinical setups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus-induced pandemic has put great pressure on health systems worldwide. Nonemergency health services, such as cancer screening, have been scaled down or withheld as a result of travel restrictions and resources being redirected to manage the pandemic. The present article discusses the challenges to cancer screening implementation in the pandemic environment, suggesting ways to optimize services for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: The manuscript was drafted by a team of public health specialists with expertise in implementation and monitoring of cancer screening. A scoping review of literature revealed the lack of comprehensive guidance on continuation of cancer screening in the midst of waxing and waning of infection. The recommendations in the present article were based on the advisories issued by different health agencies and professional bodies and the authors' understanding of the best practices to maintain quality-assured cancer screening. RESULTS: A well-coordinated approach is required to ensure that essential health services such as cancer management are maintained and elective services are not threatened, especially because of resource constraints. In the context of cancer screening, a few changes in invitation strategies, screening and management protocols and program governance need to be considered to fit into the new normal situation. Restoring public trust in providing efficient and safe services should be one of the key mandates for screening program reorganization. This may be a good opportunity to introduce innovations (eg, telehealth) and consider de-implementing non-evidence-based practices. It is necessary to consider increased spending on primary health care and incorporating screening services in basic health package. CONCLUSION: The article provides guidance on reorganization of screening policies, governance, implementation, and program monitoring.","output":"Cancer Screening in the Coronavirus Pandemic Era: Adjusting to a New Situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has tremendous consequences for our societies. Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. METHODS: Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to May 3 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The first 20,640 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (CI: 0.8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 89 per 100,000 (CI: 72-211) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","output":"Estimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection fatality rate by real-time antibody screening of blood donors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Filoviruses cause severe and fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. Filovirus research has been extensive since the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Due to their high pathogenicity and mortality, live filoviruses require Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) facilities, which have restricted the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs. An HIV-based pseudovirus cell infection assay is widely used for viral entry studies in BSL-2 conditions. Here, we successfully constructed nine in vitro pseudo-filovirus models covering all filovirus genera and three in vivo pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models using Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lloviu virus as representative viruses. The pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed visualizing bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner. A bioluminescence peak in mice was reached on day 5 post-infection for Ebola virus and Marburg virus and on day 4 post-infection for Lloviu virus. Two known filovirus entry inhibitors, clomiphene and toremiphene, were used to validate the model. Collectively, our study shows that all genera of filoviruses can be well-pseudotyped and are infectious in vitro. The pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models can be used for in vivo activity evaluation of anti-filovirus drugs.

METHODS: An online curriculum in movement disorders was implemented across nine neurology residency programs (six intervention, three control), with the objective to determine feasibility, acceptability, and knowledge growth from the curriculum. Residents in the intervention group completed ten modules and a survey. All groups completed pre-, immediate post-, and delayed post-tests. RESULTS: Eighty-six of 138 eligible housestaff (62.3%) in the intervention group completed some modules and 74 completed at least half of modules. Seventy-four, 49, and 30 residents completed the pre-, immediate post-, and delayed post-tests respectively. Twenty-five of 42 eligible control residents (59.5%) completed at least one test. Mean pre-test scores were not significantly different between groups (6.33 vs. 6.92, p = 0.18); the intervention group had significantly higher scores on immediate post- (8.00 vs. 6.79, p = 0.001) and delayed post-tests (7.92 vs. 6.92, p = 0.01). Residents liked having a framework for movement disorders, appreciated the interactivity, and wanted more modules. Residents completed the curriculum over variable periods of time (1C174 days), and at different times of day. DISCUSSION: This curriculum was feasible to implement across multiple residency programs. Intervention group residents showed sustained knowledge benefit after participating, and residents took advantage of its flexibility in their patterns of module completion. Similar curricula may help to standardize certain types of clinical learning and exposure across residency programs. HIGHLIGHTS: Interactive online tools for resident didactic learning are valuable to residents. Residents learn from interactive online curricula, find the format engaging, and take advantage of the flexibility of online educational tools.

Some of its common symptoms are fever, cough, headache, and loss of taste and smell. It may cause severe medical complications, such as pneumonia, blood clots, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Though with low incidence in general, it can also result in pleural effusion. The use of deep learning architectures on diagnostic imaging has led researchers to detect and classify diseases of various kinds with performances comparable to the diagnostic accuracy of medical doctors. This paper uses deep learning architectures singly and jointly to classify COVID-19 and pleural effusion on chest radiographs. In general, when architectures are fused, the results are better than those obtained when each architecture is employed separately. However, such an improvement comes at the expense of system complexity.

The EFM data record the oscillation phase of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever as a function of the AFM tip position. In our experiments the relative dielectric constants ? of the sample are measured from the EFM phase shifts vs. the tip-surface separation, according to a simple analytical model describing the tip-surface interactions. We perform a comprehensive study of how the dielectric constant depends on the fiber diameter for both electrospun PLLA and MWCNT/PLLA fiber composites. Our measurements show that EFM can distinguish between dielectric properties of PLLA fibers and fiber composites with different diameters. Dielectric constants of both PLLA and MWCNT-PLLA composite fibers decrease with increasing fiber diameter. In the limit of large fiber diameters (D > 100 nm), we measure dielectric constants in the range: ?? = 3.4-3.8, similar to the values obtained for unoriented PLLA films:?? ??film = 2.4-3.8. Moreover, the dielectric constants of the small diameter MWCNT-PLLA composites are significantly larger than the corresponding values obtained for PLLA fibers. For MWCNT-PLLA nanofiber composites of small diameters (D < 50 nm), ?? approaches the values measured for neat MWCNT:?? ??CN = 12  2. These results are consistent with a simple fiber structural model that shows higher polarizability of thinner fibers, and composites that contain MWCNTs. The experimental method has a high-resolution for measuring the dielectric constant of soft materials, and is simple to implement on standard atomic force microscopes.

The questionnaire is composed of seven parts, each one includes multiple choice questions aimed to measure the impact of the pandemic on different aspect of daily activities namely: academic performance, social and family relationship, eating and smoking habits, sleep pattern, physical activity and the Depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). The last part was an open question where participants can state their comments about the experiences during the quarantine and how they affected their mental health.ResultA total of 1181 students from the six academic grades responded. Females and students in the third academic year showed the highest prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress. Overall, most respondents reported that the current pandemic had negative impacts on their academic performance (71%) and social relationship (67.5 %). The majority of the students stated that they became less physically active (74.6%) and 52.2% experienced a weight gain. Despite that 60% of the studied population rated their sleeping quality as very good and fairly good, 45.3% and 39.6% suffered from increased sleeping hours and disturbed sleep respectively. Based on students responses of the DASS-21, over half of the participants (62.2%) were experiencing moderate to extremely severe stress and over 33% were consistent with symptoms of extremely severe anxiety. In respect of depression, nearly half of the sample (46.4%) can be described as having extremely severe depression according to the cut-off points of the DASS-21.ConclusionThe current pandemic has increased the challenges and burdens on undergraduate medical students.

The RDT was performed onsite by a commercially available immune-chromatographic assay on the nasopharyngeal swab. The nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were examined for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RDT was 34.5% and the specificity was 99.8%.

Secondary endpoints were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital length of stay. Study design and Methods A retrospective observational study enrolling adult patients admitted to the ED of Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy, with ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia from March 18 th to April 18 th 2020, was conducted. Only patients who strictly followed a local CPAP protocol were enrolled. Results: A total of 52 patients were included in this study. 38 patients (73%) were judged eligible for ETI. 18 (34.6%) were intubated. 16 (30.8%) patients died: 7 (38.9%) and 9 (26.5%) in the ETI and non-ETI group respectively. The median hospital length of stay was different in ETI and non-ETI patients: 26 days [IQR 16-37] vs 15 days [IQR 9-17] (p=0.005). The median invasive mechanical ventilation time was 11 days [IQR 7-21] with an ICU length of stay of 14.5 days [IQR 10-28].

METHOD: Cross-sectional study utilizing data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other official organizations regarding global HB, ACB, ICU bed capacity, and confirmed COVID-19 cases/mortality. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were performed. RESULTS: A total of 183 countries were included with a mean of 307.1 HBs, 413.9 ACBs, and 8.73 ICU beds/100,000 population. High-income regions had the highest mean number of ICU beds (12.79) and HBs (402.32) per 100,000 population whereas upper middle-income regions had the highest mean number of ACBs (424.75) per 100,000.

Data for the study were generated through the administration of an online survey among 117 members of Home Owner Associations (HOAs) in the Tucson WUI. The results showed that the overwhelming majority of respondents were aware of buffelgrass, but their knowledge about buffelgrass control mechanisms appeared to be limited. Respondents also more frequently expressed concern about the risks posed by buffelgrass invasion to general targets, such as the Sonoran Desert ecosystem, native plants and wildlife than risks to their private property and neighborhoods. The results also showed that the level of involvement in HOAs, and leadership in HOAs had significant positive effects on homeowners' participation in buffelgrass control efforts. Homeowners' duration of residence also had a significant negative effect on participation in buffelgrass control efforts, suggesting that newcomers may be more involved than long-term residents. Similarly, the number of months respondents spent in Tucson per year had a negative effect on the number of hours spent on buffelgrass control efforts. Respondents perceived risk about buffelgrass invasion also had a positive effect on the hours spent on buffelgrass control as well as their level of involvement in fire risk mitigation efforts. These results highlight the importance of local institutions and community heterogeneity in social responses to threats in WUI communities.

The aim of the present work was to study if maternal IgG1 antibodies (Abs) to BCoV acquired by colostrum intake modulate the development of BCoV infection in calves reared in a dairy farm in Argentina. Thirty Holstein calves were monitored during their first 60 days of age. Animals were classified into two groups depending on their initial BCoV IgG1 Ab titers. The failure of passive transfer (FPT) group had significantly lower IgG1 Abs to BCoV than the acceptable passive transfer (APT) group of calves (log10 1.98 vs. 3.38 respectively) (p < 0.0001). These differences were also observed when the total protein levels in both groups were compared (p = 0.0081). Moreover, 71% (5/7) of calves from the FPT group showed IgG1 seroconversion to BCoV compared to 29.4% (5/17) of animals from the APT group. Regarding viral circulation, BCoV was detected in 10% (3/30) of all calves and BCoV IgG1 Ab seroconversion was detected in 42% of the total animals showing that almost half of the calves were infected with BCoV. In conclusion, calves with high titers of specific BCoV IgG1 (1024) were mostly protected against viral infection, while animals with low titers of IgG1 (<1024) were mostly infected with BCoV. IgG1 Abs from colostrum origin are critical for prevention of BCoV infection.","output":"Passive immunity to control Bovine coronavirus diarrhea in a dairy herd in Argentina"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers (IC) are often overshadowed by the attention required by the terminally ill. This study aims to reveal the estimated proportion of caregiver burden, psychological manifestations and factors associated with caregiver burden among IC in the largest specialized Palliative Care Unit (PCU) in Malaysia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study involving IC attending a PCU. Caregiver burden and psychological manifestations were measured using previously translated and validated Zarit Burden Interview and DASS-21 questionnaires respectively. Two hundred forty-nine samples were selected for analysis. RESULT: The mean ZBI score was 23.33  13.7. About half of the population 118(47.4%) was found to experienced caregiver burden whereby majority have mild to moderate burden 90(36.1%). The most common psychological manifestation among IC is anxiety 74(29.7%) followed by depression 51(20.4%) and stress 46(18.5%). Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that women who are IC to patients with non-malignancy were less likely to experience caregiver burden. IC who were highly educated and spent more than 14 h per day caregiving were at least twice likely to experience caregiver burden. Finally, those with symptoms of depression and anxiety were three times more likely to suffer from caregiver burden. CONCLUSION: Caregiver burden among IC to palliative patients is prevalent in this population. IC who are men, educated, caregiving for patients with malignancy, long hours of caregiving and have symptoms of depression and anxiety are at risk of developing caregiver burden.

However, DNA methylations in the peripheral blood tissues are usually measured at the bulk level based on a heterogeneous population of white blood cells. Using the bulk level DNA methylation data in mediation analysis might cause confounding bias and reduce study power. Therefore, it is crucial to get fine-grained results by detecting mediation CpG sites in a cell-type-specific way. However, there is a lack of methods and software to achieve this goal. We propose a novel method (Mediation In a Cell-type-Specific fashion, MICS) to identify cell-type-specific mediation effects in genome-wide epigenetic studies using only the bulk-level DNA methylation data. MICS follows the standard mediation analysis paradigm and consists of three key steps. In step1, we assess the exposure-mediator association for each cell type; in step 2, we assess the mediator-outcome association for each cell type; in step 3, we combine the cell-type-specific exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations using a multiple testing procedure named MultiMed [Sampson JN, Boca SM, Moore SC, et al. FWER and FDR control when testing multiple mediators. Bioinformatics 2018;34:2418-24] to identify significant CpGs with cell-type-specific mediation effects.

It is necessary to measure and evaluate the physical activity of older people. Implementing appropriate requires a valid and reliable tool. Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is the frequently used self-reported physical activity assessment for older adults. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the translation validity and reliability of the Persian version of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. METHODS: This study is a methodological, descriptive applied research was conducted on 300 older people. The translation process of the English version of PASE into Persian was carried out according to the process of translation and adaptation of scale recommended by the World Health Organization. The reliability of the scale was examined by calculating the Cronbachs alpha, Pearson, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The reliability and validity of the scale were evaluated by following the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. To assess the face and content validity, impact score (IS), the content validity ratio (CVR), and the content validity index (CVI) were determined. A confirmatory factor analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The experts approved the quality of the Persian version of PASE. The reliability was calculated with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.94, an ICC of 0.99, and a test-retest correlation coefficient of 0.94. The qualitative and quantitative face validity of all questions by expert judgment and IS of greater than 1.5 was considered. Also, CVR and CVI scores of all questions were higher than 0.6 and 0.79, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a good fit for the original three-factor structure.

Thus, DCs are productively infected only at very low levels with HIV-1, and this non-permissiveness of DCs is suggested to go along with viral evasion.

Efficient DC infection by HIV-C was also observed using single-cycle HIV-C, and correlated with a remarkable elevated SAMHD1 T592 phosphorylation but not SAMHD1 degradation. If SAMHD1 phosphorylation was blocked using a CDK2-inhibitor HIV-C-induced DC infection was also significantly abrogated. Additionally, we found a higher maturation and co-stimulatory potential, aberrant type I interferon expression and signaling as well as a stronger induction of cellular immune responses in HIV-C-treated DCs.

Respiratory viruses spread in humans across wide geographical areas in short periods of time, resulting in high levels of morbidity and mortality. We undertook a systematic review to assess the evidence that air, ground and sea mass transportation systems or hubs are associated with propagating influenza and coronaviruses. Methods. Healthcare databases and sources of grey literature were searched using pre-defined criteria between April and June 2014. Two reviewers screened all identified records against the protocol, undertook risk of bias assessments and extracted data using a piloted form. Results were analysed using a narrative synthesis. Results. Forty-one studies met the eligibility criteria. Risk of bias was high in the observational studies, moderate to high in the reviews and moderate to low in the modelling studies. In-flight influenza transmission was identified substantively on five flights with up to four confirmed and six suspected secondary cases per affected flight. Five studies highlighted the role of air travel in accelerating influenza spread to new areas. Influenza outbreaks aboard cruise ships affect 2C7% of passengers. Influenza transmission events have been observed aboard ground transport vehicles. High heterogeneity between studies and the inability to exclude other sources of infection means that the risk of influenza transmission from an index case to other passengers cannot be accurately quantified. A paucity of evidence was identified describing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission events associated with transportation systems or hubs. Conclusion. Air transportation appears important in accelerating and amplifying influenza propagation. Transmission occurs aboard aeroplanes, at the destination and possibly at airports. Control measures to prevent influenza transmission on cruise ships are needed to reduce morbidity and mortality. There is no recent evidence of sea transport accelerating influenza or coronavirus spread to new areas.

Allopurinol reduces serum uric acid and oxidative stress and improves endothelial function and may therefore reduce CBP and CIMT progression. This study sought to ascertain whether allopurinol reduces CBP, arterial stiffness and CIMT progression in patients with ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). METHODS We performed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, examining the effect of 1-year treatment with allopurinol (300 mg daily), on change in CBP, arterial stiffness and CIMT progression at 1 year and change in endothelial function and circulating inflammatory markers at 6 months. Patients aged over 18 years with recent ischaemic stroke or TIA were eligible. RESULTS Eighty participants were recruited, mean age 67.8 years (SD 9.4). Systolic CBP [-6.6 mm Hg (95% CI -13.0 to -0.3), p=0.042] and augmentation index [-4.4% (95% CI -7.9 to -1.0), p=0.013] were each lower following allopurinol treatment compared with placebo at 12 months. Progression in mean common CIMT at 1 year was less in allopurinol-treated patients compared with placebo [between-group difference [-0.097 mm (95% CI -0.175 to -0.019), p=0.015]. No difference was observed for measures of endothelial function. CONCLUSIONS Allopurinol lowered CBP and reduced CIMT progression at 1 year compared with placebo in patients with recent ischaemic stroke and TIA. This extends the evidence of sustained beneficial effects of allopurinol to these prognostically significant outcomes and to the stroke population, highlighting the potential for reduction in cardiovascular events with this treatment strategy.

Purpose To present DeepCOVID-XR, a deep learning AI algorithm for detecting COVID-19 on chest radiographs, trained and tested on a large clinical dataset. Materials and Methods DeepCOVID-XR is an ensemble of convolutional neural networks to detect COVID-19 on frontal chest radiographs using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a reference standard. The algorithm was trained and validated on 14,788 images (4,253 COVID-19 positive) from sites across the Northwestern Memorial Healthcare System from February 2020 to April 2020, then tested on 2,214 images (1,192 COVID-19 positive) from a single hold-out institution. Performance of the algorithm was compared with interpretations from 5 experienced thoracic radiologists on 300 random test images using the McNemar test for sensitivity/specificity and DeLong's test for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 5,853 patients (5819 years, 3,101 women) were evaluated across datasets. On the entire test set, DeepCOVID-XR's accuracy was 83% with an AUC of 0.90. On 300 random test images (134 COVID-19 positive), DeepCOVID-XR's accuracy was 82% compared to individual radiologists (76%-81%) and the consensus of all 5 radiologists (81%). DeepCOVID-XR had a significantly higher sensitivity (71%) than 1 radiologist (60%, p<0.001) and higher specificity (92%) than 2 radiologists (75%, p<0.001; 84% p=0.009).

Despite advances in the acute phase management of stroke patients, mortality and disability rates remain high. In aging populations and with different mortality between the sexes in general, the study of sex- and age-related differences becomes increasingly relevant for optimization of post-acute clinical care of stroke patients. METHODS We designed a cohort follow-up study with 13,932 consecutive ischemic stroke (IS) patients from 19 Spanish hospitals. Data was obtained from the Spanish Stroke Registry; transient ischemic attacks and ages <18 years were excluded. Patients were organised by age group and sex. We compared female and male patient cohorts within and across age groups univariately and used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders in differential in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The median (percentiles 2.5 and 97.5%) age was 78 (41-92) years old for women and 71 (41-92) for men. IS women were more likely to be older, to exhibit cardio-embolic aetiology, and less likely to have been admitted to a stroke unit or to have had a stroke code activated. Both pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at admission increased significantly with age and were higher in women than those in men. Differences in distributions of common risk factors for IS and of in-hospital outcomes between women and men actually changed with patient's age. It is to be noted here that although there were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between the sexes within any age group, in-hospital mortality appeared significantly higher in women than that in men when analysed overall, due to confounding. Death was more closely related to stroke in women than in men and occurred earlier. Although there were some age-specific sex differences between the predictors for in-hospital mortality, stroke severity measured by NIHSS was the main predictor of in-hospital mortality for both sexes. Topographic classifications - partial anterior circulatory infarct and total anterior circulatory infarct - were significant prognostic factors for men aged <60 years and for those in the 60-69 years range respectively. CONCLUSION Although most of our findings were consistent with previous studies, it is important to take into account and highlight differences in in-hospital mortality between the sex and age group. Not to account for age-related differences between the sexes can give false results that may mislead management decisions. As most deaths in women were related to stroke, it is important to improve their early management, stroke code activation, access to stroke units and/or revascularisation therapies, especially in the older age groups.","output":"Age- and Sex-Specific Risk Profiles and In-Hospital Mortality in 13,932 Spanish Stroke Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the development of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection from mild disease to severe disease, it can trigger a series of complications and stimulate a strong cellular and humoral immune response.

For these reasons, behavioral interventions that incorporate complex walking tasks and other activities of daily living appear to be especially helpful for improving mobility function. Other pharmaceutical interventions, such as oxytocin, and complementary and alternative interventions, such as massage therapy, may enhance physical function both through direct effects on biological mechanisms related to mobility, as well as indirectly through modulation of cognitive and socioemotional processes. Thus, the purpose of the present review is to describe evolving interventional approaches to enhance mobility and maintain healthspan in the growing population of older adults in the United States and countries throughout the world. Such interventions are likely to be greatly assisted by technological advances and the widespread adoption of virtual communications during and after the COVID-19 era.","output":"Innovations in Geroscience to enhance mobility in older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation and its myriad pathways are now recognized to play both causal and consequential roles in vascular brain health. From acting as a trigger for vascular brain injury, as evidenced by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, to steadily increasing the risk for chronic cerebrovascular disease, distinct inflammatory cascades play differential roles in varying states of cerebrovascular injury. New evidence is regularly emerging that characterizes the role of specific inflammatory pathways in these varying states including those at risk for stroke and chronic cerebrovascular injury as well as during the acute, subacute, and repair phases of stroke. Here, we aim to highlight recent basic science and clinical evidence for many distinct inflammatory cascades active in these varying states of cerebrovascular injury. The role of cerebrovascular infections, spotlighted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, and its association with increased stroke risk is also reviewed. Rather than converging on a shared mechanism, these emerging studies implicate varied and distinct inflammatory processes in vascular brain injury and repair. Recognition of the phasic nature of inflammatory cascades on varying states of cerebrovascular disease is likely essential to the development and implementation of an anti-inflammatory strategy in the prevention, treatment, and repair of vascular brain injury. Although advances in revascularization have taught us that time is brain, targeting inflammation for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease will undoubtedly show us that timing is brain.","output":"Inflammation and the Link to Vascular Brain Health: Timing Is Brain."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the world. Given the sharply increased infection rate, the number of pregnant women and children with COVID-19 is correspondingly on the rise. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through droplets; though hypothesized, other transmission routes have not been confirmed. As of now, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be transmitted from the mother to the fetus. Method: This study examines the medical records of 30 neonates born to women with COVID-19, the objective being to provide documented information on maternal-child transmission and infant outcomes. Results: Out of the 30 newborns, 28 had negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2; among their mothers, fifteen had fever, nine had cough and twenty had delivered by cesarean section. The median birth term was 37wk2dy, and twenty of the neonates were male. Most of them were asymptomatic, except for the three who presented with shortness of breath. Two of them were intubated and both died, the first because of severe sepsis and the second due to severe hyaline membrane disease. As regards the two infected neonates, the first represents a probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears unlikely in the second case. The outcome for both of them was good, without any complications. Conclusion: Maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 virus was not detected in the majority of the reported cases, although two of 30 neonates had positive qRT-PCR test results. Our study supports the hypothesis that though it seldom actually occurs, in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible.","output":"Outcomes of newborns to mothers with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To analyze factors associated with mortality at 3 months and readmissions, functional and cognitive decline, anorexia and affective disorders in patients aged > 70 years surviving after hospital admission for SARS-CoV-2.

In this article, we examine if and how the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the market for rental housing in the 49 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Using a unique data set of new rental listings gathered from Craigslist and localized measures of the pandemics severity we find that, from mid-March to early June, local spread of COVID-19 is followed by reduced median and mean rent. However, this trend is driven by dropping rents for listings in Black, Latino, and diverse neighborhoods. Listings in majority White neighborhoods experience rent increases during this time. Our analyses make multiple contributions. First, we add to the burgeoning literature examining the rental market as a key site of perpetuating sociospatial inequality. Second, we demonstrate the utility of data gathered online for analyzing housing.

Concretely, with the presence of the target miRNA, the CHA process was initiated and the signal probe was introduced to the electrode surface, producing abundant double-stranded H1-H2@Fe-MOFs-NH2. Then, the measurement and analysis of the prepared ratiometric electrochemical biosensor by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) showed that the introduction of the target miRNA led to an increase in the oxidation peak signal of Fe-MOFs (+0.8 V) and a decrease in the oxidation peak signal of MB (-0.23 V). Therefore, the peak current ratio of IFe-MOFs/IMB could be employed to accurately reflect the actual concentration of miRNA.

The limited use of healthcare services due to fear of COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic has raised concerns of delays in T1D diagnosis, among other diseases. This study investigates the presenting characteristics of newly diagnosed T1D patients assessed in our clinic during the pandemic and compares them with the pre-pandemic period. Materials and Method: For the purpose of this study, the first year of the pandemic is referred to as the \\"pandemic period\\", and the previous three years as the \\"pre-pandemic period\\". Patient files were reviewed retrospectively, the demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of the patients were recorded, and the findings from both periods were compared. Results: The number of patients diagnosed with T1D was 44 in the pandemic period, and 39 in 2017, 22 in 2018 and 18 in 2019 in the pre-pandemic period. The two groups were noted to have similar age, sex, pubertal stage and anthropometric characteristics (p > 0.05). Regarding the type of presentation, the frequency of DKA was significantly higher in the pandemic period (68.2%) than in the pre-pandemic period (40.5%) (p = 0.006), and this difference was also observed in the comparison by years (p = 0.016). The duration of symptoms (16.510.7 vs. 23.517.6 days) and the length of hospital stay (103.9 vs. 15.25.5 days) were significantly shorter in the pandemic period (p = 0.032, and p < 0.001, respectively). There was no difference in the frequency of severe DKA between the pandemic (46.7%) and the pre-pandemic (37.5%) periods (p > 0.05). However, pH (7.170.16 vs. 7.260.14) and bicarbonate (12.86.3 vs. 16.66.3) levels were significantly lower in the pandemic period (p < 0.005). Additional signs of infection on admission were less frequent in the pandemic period (9.1%) than in the pre-pandemic period (27.8%) (p = 0.027). The groups did not differ in terms of HbA1c, C-peptide, concurrent thyroid autoantibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibodies (p > 0.05). The rate of anti-GAD positivity was higher in the pandemic period (73.8% vs. 39.2%) (p = 0.001) while the frequency of other diabetes-associated autoantibodies was similar between the groups (p > 0.05). The PCR test for COVID-19 was negative in six patients with a history of contact. Conclusion: We observed an increased frequency and severity of DKA in children with newly diagnosed T1D in the pandemic period, and our findings justify our concerns related to the diagnosis of other diseases during the pandemic. Studies to raise awareness of diabetes symptoms during the pandemic should be continued regularly to reach all segments of society.

Two participants were excluded from per protocol analysis due to seroconversion between screening and inoculation. Eighteen (~53%) became infected, with viral load (VL) rising steeply and peaking at ~5 days post-inoculation. Virus was first detected in the throat but rose to significantly higher levels in the nose, peaking at ~8.87 log 10 copies/ml (median, 95% CI [8.41,9.53). Viable virus was recoverable from the nose up to ~10 days post-inoculation, on average. There were no serious adverse events. Mild-to-moderate symptoms were reported by 16 (89%) infected individuals, beginning 2-4 days post-inoculation. Anosmia/dysosmia developed more gradually in 12 (67%) participants. No quantitative correlation was noted between VL and symptoms, with high VLs even in asymptomatic infection, followed by the development of serum spike-specific and neutralising antibodies. However, lateral flow results were strongly associated with viable virus and modelling showed that twice-weekly rapid tests could diagnose infection before 70-80% of viable virus had been generated.

METHODS: A prospective randomized open-label study was designed to identify differences in the fitting performance between mask wearing methods in three different types of KF94 mask with ear loops between January to March 2021. General-fitting involved wearing an ear-loop-type KF94 mask, and tight-fitting involved wearing a mask aided by a clip connecting the ear loops. Each of the 30 participants wore three types of masks according to a randomly assigned order in both methods and performed a total of six quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) according to the occupational safety and health administration protocol. RESULTS: All fit factors (FFs) measured by the QNFT were significantly higher for tight-fitting method with the clip in all KF94 masks (P < 0.001). However, the total FFs were very low, with a median (interquartile range) of 6 (3C23) and 29 (9C116) for general-fitting and tight-fitting, respectively. When wearing tightly, the horizontal 3-fold type mask with adjustable ear-loop length had the highest FF, with a median of 125, and the QNFT pass rate (FF  100) increased significantly from 4 (13%) to 18 (60%). CONCLUSION: Even with sufficient filter efficiency, ear-loop-type-KF94 masks do not provide adequate protection.

Our secondary objective was to estimate the psychometric properties of a brief Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ). Methods We conducted patient-finding exercise in our study areas through various means to obtain subjects with idiopathic epilepsy. We carefully examined each patient through a detailed case-history examination. Following that, we evaluated fear related to epilepsy by using Bhalla-Gharagozli Fear in Epilepsy Questionnaire (BG-FEQ) across two broad domains: epilepsy and pharmacotherapy. Results The study obtained 52 subjects (39.0 years; 45.0% males, 70.0% married, 35.0% unqualified, 85.0% active epilepsy, 80.0% generalized seizures) with idiopathic epilepsy. The alpha coefficient was 92.8, with no item-specific coefficient of 0.91. The alpha coefficient was 0.90 and 0.93 for reporting a \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" to the items, respectively. We obtained a two-factor structure of BG-FEQ that provided a cumulative variance of 83.6%. The majority (65.0%) reported at least one fear. The per-patient mean number of the fear element was 2.1 (95% CI 1.1-3.3), which differed significantly for males and females (1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.6 and 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-4.6, respectively, p=0.03). The most frequent fear was that of addiction and the bad effects of anti-seizure medications (both 45.0%). Upon bootstrap regression after constraining gender, the fear elements were associated with illiteracy, difficulty in understanding epilepsy and sleeping in a prone position. The sample power was 99.0%. Conclusion There was a significant representation of fear among those with idiopathic epilepsy, especially among the females, particularly the fear of brain tumour, premature death and more frequent/severe seizures over time. At least 65.0% of idiopathic subjects are likely to be affected by at least one fear.

Due to its communicable nature, very stringent public health interventions have been put in place worldwide; yet, it still poses new emerging challenges, one of the most recent being a multisystem inflammatory condition with clinical features resembling Kawasaki-like disease and toxic shock syndrome in children and adolescents. The data on this novel condition are scarce which need to be reported to identify its clinico-epidemiological and geographical distribution. There is an urgent need to generate evidence for diagnosis and management of this condition in the midst of a pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review will be conducted using Medline database searched through PubMed, Embase, Ovid; and Google Scholar, ProQuest and EBSCO databases will also be searched along with grey literature with the aim to identify the clinical features, aetiopathology, laboratory findings, treatment modes and outcomes of Kawasaki-like disease among paediatric patients suffering from COVID-19. Original articles reporting Kawasaki-like disease in paediatric patients with COVID-19 will be retrieved after screening by two independent reviewers. Data will be extracted in a specially designed form and studies will be assessed independently for risk of bias. Data will be extracted for the following: author, journal title, publication year, study design, study setting, demographic characteristics, sample size, clinical features, aetiopathology, laboratory findings, modes and doses of treatment given, strength and weakness of studies.

Host defense strategies against infectious diseases are comprised of both host resistance, which is the ability of the host to prevent invasion or to eliminate the pathogen and disease tolerance, which is defined by limiting the collateral tissue damage. In this review we aim to examine the metabolic demands of the immune cells involved in both host resistance and disease tolerance; chiefly the macrophage and T-lymphocyte.

METHODS A systematic review of 5 databases was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Oral benzodiazepine safety and efficacy data were extracted from eligible articles. RESULTS A total of 43 articles and 4,060 subjects were included. Oral BZDs consistently imparted a positive anxiolytic effect and demonstrated superior or equivalent scores in patient satisfaction, surgeon satisfaction, pain, and anxiety to comparator groups in most studies. Thirty-five subjects experienced transient hypoxia, and 2 experienced transient hypertension. A total of 195 mild, self-limited adverse effects were reported. None of the studies addressed the risks of abuse and dependence in this clinical setting. CONCLUSION Short-term use of oral BZDs for periprocedural anxiolysis seems to be safe and effective.

METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study including women who underwent a hysterectomy with concomitant USLS or SCP with delayed-absorbable suture from January 2011 to December 2015 with 1-year follow-up. Successful anterior vaginal wall support was defined as Ba of less than 0. Successful apical support was defined as no apical descent (point C) greater than one half of the total vaginal length. In addition, 1-year QoL questionnaires were measured postoperatively. RESULTS A total of 282 women were identified. Sixty-two women (31 vaginal USLS and 31 SCP) met inclusion criteria. Demographics were similar between groups except for a higher body mass index in the USLS group (27.5  5.6 kg/m vs 24.1  3.3 kg/m, P < 0.05). Preoperative POP-Q was mostly stage II and III.

Study participants were HCWs who contacted their occupational physician between 1 May 2020 and 12 November 2020 with a request for the registration of COVID-19 as an occupational disease. All participants filled out our online Occupational COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers Questionnaire. The study included 59 HCWs (median age 45.0, interquartile range 36.0-56.0 years). Most (78 %) were nurses or laboratory technicians, and almost all (94.9 %) worked in hospitals. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three clusters of COVID-19-related symptoms: 1) elevated body temperature with general weakness and fatigue, 2) diarrhoea, and 3) headache, muscle and joint pain, anosmia, ageusia, and respiratory symptoms (nasal symptoms, burning throat, cough, dyspnoea, tachypnoea). Almost half (44.6 %) reported comorbidities.

METHOD: In this study, we developed a likelihood-based method using arrival times of infected cases in different countries to estimate R (0) for influenza pandemics. A simulation was conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. We further applied the method to the outbreak of the influenza pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico. RESULTS: In the numerical application, the estimated R (0) was equal to 1.69 with a 95% confidence interval (1.65, 1.73). For the simulation results, the estimations were robust to the decline of travel rate and other parameter assumptions. Nevertheless, the estimates were moderately sensitive to the assumption of infectious duration. Generally, the findings were in line with other relevant studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach as well as the estimate is potential to assist officials in planning control and prevention measures.

Currently, more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with over 2.4 million mortalities. The pandemic affects people of all ages but older individuals and those with severe chronic illnesses, including cancer patients, are at higher risk. PATIENT CONCERNS: The impact of cancer treatment on the progression of COVID-19 is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the effects of chemotherapy on COVID-19 outcomes for 2 cancer patients. On January 24, 2020, a level I response to a major public health emergency was initiated in Hubei Province, China, which includes Enshi Autonomous Prefecture that has a population of 4.026 million people. As of April 30, 2020, 252 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 11 asymptomatic carriers were identified in Enshi. DIAGNOSIS: Among the confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers, 2 patients were identified who were previously diagnosed with malignant tumors, including one with hepatocellular carcinoma and the other with cardia carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: These 2 patients were receiving or just completed chemotherapy at the time of their COVID-19 diagnosis. OUTCOMES: Both patients were followed and presented favorable outcomes. The positive outcomes for these 2 patients could be partially explained by their recent chemotherapy that impacted their immune status. Also, their relatively younger ages and lack of comorbidities were likely factors in their successful recovery from COVID-19.

Studies included in this analysis were comprised of adult patients living with HIV, receiving care for HIV via telemedicine with reported clinical outcomes or perceptions of using telemedicine in the management of their HIV care. Of the 179 studies identified, 12 met inclusion for this analysis. Only two studies provided data on clinical outcomes of HIV (virologic outcomes), one pre-pandemic and one during COVID-19. The study evaluating viral suppression during COVID-19 demonstrated lower rates of virologic suppression and lower rates of missed appointments when shelter-in-place orders were issued compared to before the start of the pandemic. The remaining studies focused on patient-related outcomes as they related to the usability and adoption of telehealth models. Many practices documented the benefits and limitations of telemedicine based on the rapid switch from traditional in-person clinics. Benefits included retention in care for patients who lived a far distance from clinic, privacy for patients not wanting to be seen attending an HIV clinic, and more flexibility in scheduling appointments. Some limitations included patients' access to technology, ability and willingness to use technology, and privacy of patients who are homeless and reside in a shelter where homelessness is 3 times greater in people living with HIV compared to the general population. Healthcare should be tailored to the individual patient by assessing their needs and limitations, particularly with patients who may be at risk for discontinuation of care, particularly in the homeless population. In addition, there are mixed data on factors such as age, sex, and race being limiting factors in willingness to use technology. From the studies reviewed, willingness to engage with technology did not differ by age, sex, or race but did differ by access and willingness to use technology. Greater limitations were access to appropriate devices for telemedicine and digital literacy. Although there have been difficulties with the switch to telemedicine in clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients have reported being satisfied with care and would be interested in continuing once the shelter-in-place order is lifted.

Vitamin D deficiency in critically ill individuals in intensive care has been linked to poor cardiovascular outcome and increased mortality.We report the vitamin D status of children with PIMS-TS admitted to a single tertiary paediatric hospital in the Midlands region of the United Kingdom (U.K).MethodsWe studied 25OHD levels in children admitted to a tertiary paediatric hospital in the U.K., fulfilling the case definition of PIMS-TS detailed by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Children were managed either on paediatric intensive care unit (PICU group) or on the wards (non-PICU group). 25OHD concentrations were measured by quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Statistical analysis used a two-sample t-test, assuming unequal variances.ResultsFifty children [median (range) age 8.8 (0.99 to 14.6) years, male = 24] met the case definition. The majority were of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) origin [78%, 39/50]. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were confirmed in 64% (32/50) and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by PCR in 6% (3/50) of the study population. Of those patients without serology or PCR data available, the majority had a confirmed Covid 19 positive contact.Eighty-two percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<30nmol/L). The mean 25OHD concentration was significantly lower when compared to the population mean from the 2015/16 National Diet and Nutrition Survey, a cohort of healthy children with no medical conditions, aged 4C10 years [22 vs 54nmol/L (95% CI: 15.9, 24.1);p<0.001]. Children from BAME backgrounds had reduced vitamin D levels compared to children from a white background [mean 25OHD concentration 17.7 vs 28.2;p=0.12]. The PICU group had lower mean 25OHD concentrations compared to the non-PICU group, although this was not statistically significant [16.9 vs 28 nmol/L;p=0.071].ConclusionsPIMS-TS has seen an over-representation of children from BAME background, who are also at greatest risk of vitamin D deficiency. Whilst any link between vitamin D deficiency and the severity of COVID-19 and related conditions, including PIMS-TS, requires further evidence, public health measures to improve vitamin D status of the U.K BAME population has been long overdue. Given the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation and the over-representation of BAME individuals with vitamin D deficiency and PIMS-TS, mandated year-round supplementation of all high-risk children should be the way forward.","output":"Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS) and Vitamin D deficiency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stimulation of AT1R (Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1) by Angiotensin II has, in addition to the effects on the renin-angiotensin system, also pro-inflammatory effects through stimulation of ADAM17 and subsequent production of INF-gamma and Interleukin-6.

This disease has a high spread rate and almost a quarter of infected individuals never develop symptoms. In this scenario, active surveillance is crucial to stop the virus propagation. Methods Between July 2020 and April 2021, 11580 oropharyngeal swab samples collected in closed and semi-closed institutions were processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection in pools, implementing this strategy for the first time in Cordoba, Argentina. Five-sample pools were constituted before nucleic acid extraction and amplification by rRT-PCR. Comparative analysis of cycle threshold (Ct) values from positive pools and individual samples along with a cost-benefit report of the whole performance of the results was performed. Results From 2314 5-sample pools tested, 158 were classified as positive (6.8%), 2024 as negative (87.5%), and 132 were categorized as indeterminate (5.7%). The Ct value shift due to sample dilution showed an increase in Ct of 2.6 {+/-}1.53 cycles for N gene and 2.6 {+/-}1.78 for ORF1ab gene. Overall, 290 pools were disassembled and 1450 swabs were analyzed individually. This strategy allowed correctly identifying 99.8% of the samples as positive (7.6%) or negative (92.2%), avoiding the execution of 7,806 rRT-PCR reactions which represents a cost saving of 67.5%.

In this article we leverage on defensive growth models to explain the complex relationships between these factors, and we put forward the idea of neo-humanism, a cultural movement grounded on evidence from quality-of-life studies. The movement proposes a new culture leading towards a socially and environmentally sustainable future. Specifically, neo-humanism suggests that prioritizing well-being by, for instance, promoting social relations, would benefit the environment, enable collective action to address public issues, which in turn positively affects productivity and health, among other behavioral outcomes, and thereby instills a virtuous cycle. Arguably, such a society would have been better endowed to cope with COVID-19, and possibly even prevented the pandemic. Neo-humanism proposes a world in which the well-being of people comes before the well-being of markets, in which promoting cooperation and social relations represents the starting point for better lives, and a peaceful and respectful coexistence with other species on Earth.","output":"Neo-humanism and COVID-19: Opportunities for a socially and environmentally sustainable world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The research used an online, convenience cross-sectional sample of adults aged 18 years old recruited from Shahroud County, Northeast of Iran.

Here, we argue that small RNA regulators of acetylcholine (ACh) signaling, including microRNAs (miRs) and transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) may tilt the balance between innate and adaptive immunity, avoid chronic inflammation and prevent the neuroinflammation-mediated exacerbation of many neurological diseases. While the restrictive permeability of the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from peripheral immune events, this barrier can be disrupted by inflammation and is weakened with age. The consequently dysregulated balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes may modify the immune activities of brain microglia, astrocytes, perivascular macrophages, oligodendrocytes and dendritic cells, leading to neuronal damage. Notably, the vagus nerve mediates the peripheral cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex and underlines the consistent control of bodyCbrain inflammation by pro-inflammatory cytokines, which affect cholinergic functions;therefore, the disruption of this reflex can exacerbate cognitive impairments such as attention deficits and delirium. RNA regulators can contribute to re-balancing the cholinergic network and avoiding its chronic deterioration, and their activities may differ between men and women and/or wear off with age. This can lead to hypersensitivity of aged patients to inflammation and higher risks of neuroinflammation-driven cholinergic impairments such as delirium and dementia following COVID-19 infection. The age- and sex-driven differences in post-transcriptional RNA regulators of cholinergic elements may hence indicate new personalized therapeutic options for neuroinflammatory diseases.","output":"Cholinergic blockade of neuroinflammation: from tissue to RNA regulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Extubation strategy for mechanically ventilated patients with Coronavirus Disease 19 is different from that for patients with other viral pneumonia. We reported 2 cases of Coronavirus Disease 19 receiving tracheal intubation twice during the hospitalization. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two elderly patients with onset of fever and upper respiratory tract infection were confirmed as Coronavirus Disease 19, 1 of whom had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease previously. With active antiviral and noninvasive respiratory supportive therapy, there was no improvement, thus mechanical ventilation (MV) was adopted. Combining with symptomatic and supportive treatment, their oxygenation recovered and then extubation was carried out. However, 96a??hours later, they underwent endotracheal intubation again due to their Coronavirus Disease 19 progression. DIAGNOSIS: Critically ill Coronavirus Disease 19 requiring tracheal intubation owing to respiratory failure with lung.javascript. INTERVENTIONS: Initial Strategy for respiratory failure included endotracheal intubation, MV, antiviral treatment and cortisol in both cases. When extubation criteria were satisfied, early discontinuation of MV was conducted, then rehabilitation exercise and nutritional support followed. However, 96a??hours later, the disease progressed leading to respiratory failure again, thus reintubation was performed. Later, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed owing to aggravation of respiratory failure, assisted by prone position treatment and sputum drainage, then status became stable and stepped into recovery stage. OUTCOMES: Both patients underwent reintubation, and their MV time and Intensive care unit residence time were prolonged. Through prone position treatment, sputum drainage and awake extracorporeal membrane oxygenation strategy, patient has been transferred to rehabilitation unit in Case 1, and patient in Case 2 has been in recovery stage as well with stable pulmonary status and was expected to receive evaluation in recent future. LESSONS: Course of Coronavirus Disease 19 is relatively longer, and failure rate of simple early extubation seemes higher. To reduce the likelihood of reintubation and iatrogenic injury, individualized assessment is recommended.","output":"Failure of early extubation among cases of coronavirus disease-19 respiratory failure: Case report and clinical experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates how Chinas COVID-19 aid efforts affected its soft power in Italy through analyzing data on Chinas COVID-19-related aid from Italys main national newspapers during the period MarchCApril 2020. Previous research has focused on Chinas mask diplomacy in relation to its impact in Europe, primarily discussing the geopolitical nature of Chinese aid and arguing that China manipulated the pandemic to change COVID-19 narrative. While these scholars provided significant insights into Chinas aid in Europe, their research failed to provide country specific studies and lack inquiry into the domestic role played by Chinas public diplomacy overseas. This article finds that, while Chinas COVID-19-related aid have often been negatively portraited in European media, this has not been the case for Italy, when analyzing the news reports on the arrival of Chinas aid in national newspapers during the period MarchCApril 2020. Through assessing secondary data collected from newspapers, this article argues that Chinas aid allowed the country to increase its visibility in Italy, especially during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if there is no direct correlation between higher visibility and increased soft power, this paper finds that increasing visibility in national newspapers allowed Italians to see China more positively. The paper concludes that Chinas understanding of soft power is still undergoing enormous changes and that one should not simply understand Chinas aid as a way to increase its soft power globally, but its overseas aid are considered a powerful tool to boost its domestic conviction that it is global responsible leader helping the world.","output":"COVID-19 and Chinas Changing Soft Power in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Psoriasis Foundation surveyed a stratified sample of 1,405 individuals with psoriatic disease in the United States.

Limited formal supervision and unpredictable timing of bad news delivery serve as barriers to the exchange of meaningful feedback. Purpose of study The goal of this educational innovation was to improve internal medicine residents' communication skills during challenging BBN encounters. A formal BBN training programme and innovative on-demand task force were part of this two-phase project. Study design Internal medicine residents at a large academic medical centre participated in an interactive workshop focused on BBN. Workshop survey results served as a needs assessment for the development of a novel resident-led BBN task force. The task force was created to provide observations at the bedside and feedback after BBN encounters. Training of task force members incorporated video triggers and a feedback checklist. Inter-rater reliability was analysed prior to field testing, which provided data on real-world implementation challenges. Results 148 residents were trained during the 2-hour communications skills workshop. Based on survey results, 73% (108 of 148) of the residents indicated enhanced confidence in BBN after participation. Field testing of the task force on a hospital ward revealed potential workflow barriers for residents requesting observations and prompted troubleshooting. Solutions were implemented based on field testing results. Conclusions A trainee-led BBN task force and communication skills workshop is offered as an innovative model for improving residents' interpersonal and communication skills in BBN.

We investigated whether LD was noninferior to I&D for abscess resolution and whether there was any difference in repeat ED visits or complication rates between these techniques. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial, using a convenience sample at an urban academic emergency department (ED). Subjects over 18 years who presented for first-time management of an abscess were eligible. Patients requiring specialist drainage or hospital admission or had previous treatment for the abscess were excluded. Enrolled subjects were seen 2 weeks after treatment for blinded reevaluation of abscess resolution, and the electronic medical record was reviewed for return ED visits/abscess complications. RESULTS: Of 2,889 patients screened, 238 subjects consented and were randomized to LD or I&D. Abscess resolution was achieved in 53/65 (81.5%) of patients in the I&D arm, compared to 66/75 (88%) in the LD arm. Fewer patients in the LD group compared to the I&D group returned to the ED for abscess-related management during the following 14 days (37.3% vs 67.1%, p = 0.002). Among returning subjects, there was a significant difference in mean visits per subject between LD and I&D groups (0.5 vs. 1.2, p = 0.001). There were fewer complications among LD than I&D subjects (9.3% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that LD is noninferior to I&D in achieving complete abscess resolution at 14 days and is associated with fewer return ED visits and fewer complications. This makes it an attractive alternative treatment option for abscesses.","output":"Loop Drainage Is Noninferior to Traditional Incision and Drainage of Cutaneous Abscesses in the Emergency Department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaping products containing cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis-derived compound used in wellness products and available in all 50 US states, were recently implicated in outbreaks of poisonings.

Many programs shifted from in-person to virtual interviews. We evaluated applicant perceptions of the various formats. METHODS All 2019-2020 cardiothoracic fellowship applicants received an electronic survey after completion of the match process. The survey assessed number of in-person/virtual interviews completed, perception of efficacy and likelihood of ranking a program based on format, and strengths/inadequacies of virtual interviews. RESULTS Response rate was 36% (48/133). Seventy-three percent (35/48) of respondents interviewed with more than 10 programs. Fifty-two percent (25/48) of respondents were able to schedule additional interviews once virtual formats were available. A slight majority (56%, 27/48) ranked a program at which they had an in-person interview as their first choice. Interviewing at more than 10 programs was associated with an increased likelihood of successfully matching at a program (p = 0.02). Overwhelmingly, respondents favored an in-person component to the interview process (96%, 46/48). Few respondents (29%, 14/48) felt they could adequately evaluate a program virtually. The factors which had the highest percentages of adequate portrayal during virtual interviews were the didactic schedule/curriculum (81%, 39/48) and case number/autonomy (58%, 28/48). The factors with the lowest percentages were culture/personality (19%, 9/48) and city/lifestyle (15%, 7/48).

We aimed to estimate the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 44 EDs across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected data from children attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020, and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment using the WHO algorithm, swine flu hospital pathway for children (SFHPC), Paediatric Observation Priority Score (POPS) and Childrens Observation and Severity Tool (COAST). We recorded 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. Results: We collected data from 1530 children, including 26 (1.7%) with an adverse outcome. C-statistics were 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.87) for the WHO algorithm, 0.80 (0.71-0.90) for POPS, 0.76 (0.67-0.85) for COAST, and 0.71 (0.59-0.82) for SFHPC. Using pre-specified thresholds, the WHO algorithm had the highest sensitivity (0.85) and lowest specificity (0.75), but POPS and COAST could optimise sensitivity (0.96 and 0.92 respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.25 and 0.38 respectively) by using a threshold of any score above zero instead of the pre-specified threshold. Conclusion: Existing triage tools have good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in children with suspected COVID-19.

Reports on the association of frailty with poor outcome have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to investigate the independent association between frailty and in-hospital mortality in older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. METHODS This was a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, including all patients aged 70 years, who were hospitalised with clinically confirmed COVID-19 between February and May 2020. Data were collected on demographics, co-morbidity, disease severity and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS A total of 1,376 patients were included (median age 78 years (interquartile range 74-84), 60% male). In total, 499 (38%) patients died during hospital admission. Parameters indicating presence of frailty (CFS 6-9) were associated with more co-morbidities, shorter symptom duration upon presentation (median 4 versus 7 days), lower oxygen demand and lower levels of C-reactive protein. In multivariable analyses, the CFS was independently associated with in-hospital mortality: compared with patients with CFS 1-3, patients with CFS 4-5 had a two times higher risk (odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-3.0)) and patients with CFS 6-9 had a three times higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.8-4.3)).

Injury impairs function, but it may impact psychological or behavioral well-being as well. Mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression can negatively affect an adolescents quality of life. As mental health disorders are being seen more frequently in the young population it is important to understand their relationship with injury. Athletes who are no longer able to participate in their normal activities due to injury may have elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression from this sudden lifestyle change. The purpose of this study was to determine if a musculoskeletal injury is associated with elevated anxiety and depression in adolescent athletes. METHODS: Adolescents between the ages of 12-18 from sports medicine clinics presenting with musculoskeletal injuries were age and sex matched to non-injured adolescents from high school health and weight training classes as well as adolescent medicine clinics. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess for anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Scores of 5 on each questionnaire were considered elevated. Chi-Square analyses analyzed the differences in proportions of elevated anxiety and depression in the injured and uninjured participants. RESULTS: Matched data was available for 108 participants, 54 in each group. Average age was 15.99 1.58 and 83% were females. Overall, 41% reported elevated anxiety symptoms and 36% reported elevated depressive symptoms. There were no differences in the proportion of injured adolescents that had elevated anxiety or depression compared to uninjured adolescents (p=.386 and p=.071, respectively). DISCUSSION: Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among injured and non-injured adolescents. High rates in our sample could be impacted by the predominance of female participants, as female are more likely to experience this symptomology than males. It is possible that the severity of the injury may influence anxiety and depression symptoms, which we did not assess. In addition, participants were enrolled during COVID-19, which may have influenced the rates of elevated anxiety and depression symptoms. Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with high levels of functional impairment.

All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results: Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001).

In this context, UV-based and photocatalytic oxidation (PCO)-based technologies (i.e., the combined action of ultraviolet (UV) light and photocatalytic materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO2)) represent the most widely utilized approaches at present because they are cost-effective and ecofriendly. The virucidal and bactericidal effect relies on the synergy between the inherent ability of UV light to directly inactivate viral particles and bacteria through nucleic acid and protein damages, and the production of oxidative radicals generated through the irradiation of the TiO2 surface. In this literature survey, we draw attention to the most effective UV radiations and TiO2-based PCO technologies available and their underlying mechanisms of action on both bacteria and viral particles.

RESULTS: The study cohort of 1112 patients included 33% women with a mean age of 56  10 years. Infections were common (20%), with respiratory and urinary tract infections the most frequent. We did not observe a difference in the incidence of infection on admission based on patient demographic factors such as race/ethnicity or estimated household income. Infections on admission were associated with greater short-term mortality (12% vs 4% in-hospital and 14% vs 7% 30-day), longer length of stay (6 vs 3 days), intensive care unit admission (28% vs 18%), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (10% vs 2%) (p < 0.01 for all). Nosocomial infections were relatively uncommon (4%), but more frequent among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Antibiotic resistance was common (38%), but not associated with negative outcomes. CONCLUSION: We did not identify demographic risk factors for infection, but did confirm its morbid effect among patients with cirrhosis in safety-net hospitals.

LAIV immunogenicity was not significantly impacted by B. bronchiseptica colonization, but protective efficacy against heterologous IAV challenge in the upper respiratory tract was impaired. Titers of IAV in the nose and trachea of pigs that received LAIV were significantly reduced when compared to non-vaccinated, challenged controls, regardless of B. bronchiseptica infection. Pneumonia scores were higher in pigs colonized with B. bronchiseptica and challenged with IAV, but this was regardless of LAIV vaccination status. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection against heterologous IAV challenge, the protection was not sterilizing and IAV replicated in the respiratory tract of all LAIV vaccinated pig. The interaction between IAV, B. bronchiseptica, and host led to development of acute-type B. bronchiseptica lesions in the lung. Thus, the data presented do not negate the efficacy of LAIV vaccination, but instead indicate that controlling B. bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between IAV and Bordetella on swine health.","output":"Bordetella bronchiseptica Colonization Limits Efficacy, but Not Immunogenicity, of Live-Attenuated Influenza Virus Vaccine and Enhances Pathogenesis After Influenza Challenge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emerging evidence for the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 infection emphasized the critical need for universal screening of pregnant women. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to present the prevalence of overall and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in pregnant women admitted to the hospital, and assess the diagnostic accuracy of maternal symptoms and lung ultrasound (LUS) findings in detecting the infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted at a single tertiary center in Istanbul, Turkey, for a month period starting from 27 April 2020. Women with a confirmed pregnancy regardless of the gestational week admitted to the obstetric unit with any indication were consecutively underwent LUS and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients were included for the final analysis. The universal screening strategy diagnosed 23 pregnant women (7.77%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 was found as 3.72% (n = 11) and 4.05% (n = 12), respectively. Four of nine women who underwent a second testing for SARS-CoV-2 upon abnormal LUS findings were found positive eventually (17.4%, n = 4/23). The asymptomatic pregnant women with LUS score of 1 and those with normal LUS findings were considered as likely to be normal. Symptomatic patients with LUS score of 1 and those with score of 2 or 3 were considered as abnormal. On a secondary diagnostic performance analysis, the positive predictive value and the sensitivity were found as 44% and 47.8% for the triage based on maternal symptoms and, 82.3% and 60.9% for the triage based on LUS, respectively. CONCLUSION: A one-month trial period of universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-PCR in pregnant women who admitted to the hospital showed an overall and asymptomatic infection diagnose rate of 7.77% and 4%, respectively.

Although the infection in natural hosts and zoonotic transmission to humans is asymptomatic, FVs can replicate well in human cells making it an attractive gene therapy vector candidate. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy and (cryo-)electron tomography ultrastructural data on purified prototype FV (PFV) and PFV infected cells. Mature PFV particles have a distinct morphology with a capsid of constant dimension as well as a less ordered shell of density between the capsid and the membrane likely formed by the Gag N-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic part of the Env leader peptide gp18(LP). The viral membrane contains trimeric Env glycoproteins partly arranged in interlocked hexagonal assemblies. In situ 3D reconstruction by subtomogram averaging of wild type Env and of a Env gp48(TM)- gp80(SU) cleavage site mutant showed a similar spike architecture as well as stabilization of the hexagonal lattice by clear connections between lower densities of neighboring trimers. Cryo-EM was employed to obtain a 9 ? resolution map of the glycoprotein in its pre-fusion state, which revealed extensive trimer interactions by the receptor binding subunit gp80(SU) at the top of the spike and three central helices derived from the fusion protein subunit gp48(TM). The lower part of Env, presumably composed of interlaced parts of gp48(TM), gp80(SU) and gp18(LP) anchors the spike at the membrane. We propose that the gp48(TM) density continues into three central transmembrane helices, which interact with three outer transmembrane helices derived from gp18(LP).

There are two types of narcolepsy: type 1 (with cataplexy) and type 2 (without cataplexy). Unlike type 1, for which hypocretin is a biomarker, type 2 narcolepsy has no adequate biomarker to identify the causality of narcoleptic phenomenon. Therefore, we aimed to establish new biomarkers for narcolepsy using the body's systemic networks. METHOD Thirty participants (15 with type 2 narcolepsy, 15 healthy controls) were included. We used the time delay stability (TDS) method to examine temporal information and determine relationships among multiple signals. We quantified and analyzed the network connectivity of nine biosignals (brainwaves, cardiac and respiratory information, muscle and eye movements) during nocturnal sleep. In particular, we focused on the differences in network connectivity between groups according to sleep stages and investigated whether the differences could be potential biomarkers to classify both groups by using a support vector machine. RESULT In rapid eye movement sleep, the narcolepsy group displayed more connections than the control group (narcolepsy connections: 24.47  2.87, control connections: 21.34  3.49; p = 0.022).

METHODS: We retrospectively identified 76 native kidney biopsies from patients with history of COVID-19 between March 2020 and April 2021. Presenting and outcome data were obtained for all 23 patients with collapsing glomerulopathy and for seven patients with noncollapsing podocytopathies. We performed APOL1 genotyping by Sanger sequencing, immunostaining for spike and nucleocapsid proteins, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The 23 patients with COVID-19-associated collapsing glomerulopathy were median age 57 years (range, 35-72), included 16 men, and were predominantly (91%) Black. Severity of COVID-19 was mild or moderate in most (77%) patients. All but one patient presented with AKI, 17 had nephrotic-range proteinuria, and six had nephrotic syndrome. Fourteen (61%) patients required dialysis at presentation. Among 17 patients genotyped, 16 (94%) were high-risk APOL1. Among 22 (96%) patients with median follow-up at 155 days (range, 30-412), 11 (50%) received treatment for COVID-19, and eight (36%) received glucocorticoid therapy for podocytopathy. At follow-up, 19 (86%) patients were alive, and 15 (68%) were dialysis free, including seven of 14 who initially required dialysis.

Although laparoscopic surgery in colon cancer has been proved to be safe and feasible with equivalent long-term oncological outcome compared to open surgery, safety and long-term oncological outcome of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remain controversial. Laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery might be efficacious, but indications and limitations are not clearly defined. Therefore, the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES) has developed this clinical practice guideline. METHODS An international expert panel was invited to appraise the current literature and to develop evidence-based recommendations. The expert panel constituted for a consensus development conference in May 2010. Thereafter, the recommendations were presented at the annual congress of the EAES in Geneva in June 2010 in a plenary session. A second consensus process (Delphi process) of the recommendations with the explanatory text was necessary due to the changes after the consensus conference. RESULTS Laparoscopic surgery for extraperitoneal (mid- and low-) rectal cancer is feasible and widely accepted. The laparoscopic approach must offer the same quality of surgical specimen as in open surgery. Short-term outcomes such as bowel function, surgical-site infections, pain and hospital stay are slightly improved with the laparoscopic approach. Laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer is not inferior to the open in terms of disease-free survival, overall survival or local recurrence. Laparoscopic pelvic dissection may impair genitourinary and sexual function after rectal resection, like in open surgery. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic surgery for mid- and low-rectal cancer can be recommended under optimal conditions. Still, most level 1 evidence is for colon cancer surgery rather than rectal cancer. Upcoming results from large randomised trials are awaited to strengthen the evidence for improved short-term results and equal long-term results in comparison with the open approach.","output":"Laparoscopic extraperitoneal rectal cancer surgery: the clinical practice guidelines of the European Association for Endoscopic Surgery (EAES)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endophytic actinobacteria, which reside in the inner tissues of host plants, are gaining serious attention due to their capacity to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites (e.g. antibiotics) possessing a wide variety of biological activity with diverse functions.

PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n = 73) with non-traumatic rotator cuff tears scheduled for repair were recruited and randomly allocated remotely prior to surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Early patient-directed rehabilitation (n = 37); advised to remove their sling as soon as able and move as symptoms allow. Standard rehabilitation (n = 36); sling immobilisation for four weeks. MEASURES: (1) Randomisation of 20% or more eligible patients. (2) Difference in time out of sling of 40% or more between groups. (3) Follow-up greater than 70%. RESULTS: 73/185 (39%) potentially eligible patients were randomised. Twenty participants were withdrawn, 11 due to not receiving rotator cuff repair.

This study aims to quantify the effect of these delays on visual acuity (VA) outcomes and optical coherence tomography (OCT) features for patients receiving treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), retinal vein occlusions (RVO) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) and correlate to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists guidelines (RCOphth). METHODS: A retrospective data analysis of an electronic medical record was performed on a random sample of eyes receiving anti-VEGF injections for nAMD, RVO or DMO. Data collected included age, sex, reason for injection, number of weeks delay if > 8 weeks from that planned, VA at baseline and follow-up and the OCT features, if delayed. For those eyes not delayed, a visual acuity at 20 weeks was recorded to provide a control group. RESULTS: A sample of 981 eyes (858 patients) were analysed. There was a delay in review of 8 weeks or more in 39.6% of patients of which 30.4% had since returned for review (28.4% nAMD, 37.6% RVO and 30.0% DMO). There was no demographic difference identified between the delayed and non-delayed patients; however, the delayed group was significantly more likely to have better vision in their non-treated eye (p = 0.0003). A statistically significant difference was found in the change in VA between the delayed and the not-delayed group for eyes with nAMD (p = 0.001) but not for RVO or DMO. For the delayed group, mean CMT increased by 33 and 100 m, respectively, for nAMD and RVO and decreased by 7.8 m for DMO. The VA of 89.7% of DMO eyes returned to baseline, compared to 74.6% and 76.9% of nAMD and RVO eyes. CONCLUSION: The RCOphth guidance to prioritise intravitreal injections for nAMD over DMO appears appropriate in this cohort but not for RVO.

The main function of those fields is to report the doctors line of thought, to remind oneself and his or her colleagues on follow-up actions, and to be accountable for clinical decisions. These fields contain rich information that can be complementary to that in coded fields, and until now, they have been hardly used for analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a prediction model to convert the free text information on COVID-19Crelated symptoms from out of hours care electronic medical records into usable symptom-based data that can be analyzed at large scale. METHODS: The design was a feasibility study in which we examined the content of the raw data, steps and methods for modelling, as well as the precision and accuracy of the models. A data prediction model for 27 preidentified COVID-19Crelevant symptoms was developed for a data set derived from the database of primary-care out-of-hours consultations in Flanders. A multiclass, multilabel categorization classifier was developed. We tested two approaches, which were (1) a classical machine learningCbased text categorization approach, Binary Relevance, and (2) a deep neural network learning approach with BERTje, including a domain-adapted version. Ethical approval was acquired through the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine and the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Antwerpen (ref 20/50/693). RESULTS: The sample set comprised 3957 fields. After cleaning, 2313 could be used for the experiments. Of the 2313 fields, 85% (n=1966) were used to train the model, and 15% (n=347) for testing. The normal BERTje model performed the best on the data. It reached a weighted F1 score of 0.70 and an exact match ratio or accuracy score of 0.38, indicating the instances for which the model has identified all correct codes. The other models achieved respectable results as well, ranging from 0.59 to 0.70 weighted F1. The Binary Relevance method performed the best on the data without a frequency threshold.

The advancement of scientific knowledge proved just the opposite, thus pushing health professionals to sustain the nutritional status and physical fitness of surgical patients. Nevertheless, the impoverishment of lifestyles and the lengthening of life expectancy have invariably contrasted the strength of constitution, giving rise to two of the most hazardous conditions for orthopedic patients: malnutrition and sarcopenia, often hiding nutrient deficits and poor body composition. These conditions are known to be negative prognostic factors in several areas of major surgery, including hip replacement, knee replacement, and spine surgery. Scoring systems to screen for malnutrition and physical inabilities exist, but disciplined management of the derived risks remains untested, potentially hindering the implementation of research findings into practice. A methodical approach of preoperative analysis, critical monitoring, and risk correction before surgery could lead to a substantial improvement of the prognosis while warranting the safety of patients and the efficiency of enhanced recovery after surgery pathways. The aim of this article is to discuss from a dietetic and exercise perspective the ideal nutritional and physical prehabilitation to lay the foundations for designing the appropriate integration of dietitians and physiotherapists in a preoperative enhanced recovery pathway.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the primary bacterial pathogens of otitis media and their loads predict clinical ear state. Our hypothesis is that antecedent respiratory viral infection increases bacterial density and progression to perforation. METHODS: A total of 366 nasopharyngeal swabs from 114 Indigenous children were retrospectively examined. A panel of 17 respiratory viruses was screened by PCR, and densities of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were estimated by quantitative real time PCR. Data are reported by clinical ear state. RESULTS: M. catarrhalis (96%), H. influenzae (91%), S. pneumoniae (89%) and respiratory viruses (59%) were common; including rhinovirus (HRV) (38%), polyomavirus (HPyV) (14%), adenovirus (HAdV) (13%), bocavirus (HBoV) (8%) and coronavirus (HCoV) (4%). Geometric mean bacterial loads were significantly higher in children with acute otitis media (AOM) compared to children without evidence of otitis media. Children infected with HAdV were 3 times more likely (p < 0.001) to have AOM with or without perforation. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a positive association between nasopharyngeal bacterial load and clinical ear state, exacerbated by respiratory viruses, in Indigenous children.

There are several clinical and laboratory parameters that can predict the course and the outcomes in this group of population. MethodsWe retrospectively collected the baseline demographic, clinical, in-hospital, and laboratory data of the patients with CKD on maintenance hemodialysis who were admitted to our COVID-19 hospital during the first and the second wave. ResultsWe obtained data for 35 patients from the first and 5 patients from the second wave. The analysis of the data for 35 patients from the first wave revealed shortness of breath (62.9%), and fever (54.3%) being the most common presenting symptoms, and the majority of the patients (57.2 %) presented with moderate to severe disease at admission with 57 % had bilateral lung infiltrates, and required oxygen support (65.7%) at admission. The comparison of clinical and laboratory markers between survivors (27 patients, 77.1%) and non-survivors (8 patients, 22.9%) revealed an older age, severe disease at presentation, invasive mechanical ventilation, baseline severe lymphocytopenia, high serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, blood urea, and inflammatory markers like Interleukin-6 and procalcitonin, fibrinogen and low albumin in non survivors.

However, the epidemiological features and outcomes of AKI among COVID-19 patients with ARDS are unknown. METHODS: We retrospectively recruited consecutive adult COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed with ARDS according to Berlin definition from 13 designated intensive care units in the city of Wuhan, China. Potential risk factors of AKI as well as the relation between AKI and in-hospital mortality were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 275 COVID-19 patients with ARDS were included in the study, and 49.5% of them developed AKI during their hospital stay. In comparison with patients without AKI, patients who developed AKI were older, tended to have chronic kidney disease, had higher Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment score on day 1, and were more likely to receive invasive ventilation and develop acute organ dysfunction. Multivariate analysis showed that age, history of chronic kidney disease, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and albumin level were independently associated with the occurrence of AKI. Importantly, increasing AKI severity was associated with increased in-hospital mortality when adjusted for other potential variables: odds ratio of stage 1 = 5.374 (95% CI: 2.147C13.452; p < 0.001), stage 2 = 6.216 (95% CI: 2.011C19.210; p = 0.002), and stage 3 = 34.033 (95% CI: 9.723C119.129; p < 0.001).

The specimen width w and the distance a of the suture bite from the specimen free edge emerge as the most influential geometrical parameters. A conservative approach for the quantification of suture retention strength is identified, based on the use of a camera to monitor the incipient failure and detect the instant of earliest crack propagation. The corresponding critical force, called break starting strength, is extremely robust against test parameter variations and its dependence on the specimen geometry becomes negligible when a 2mm and w 10mm. Comparison of suture retention and mode I crack opening tests reveals a linear correlation between break starting strength and tearing energy.

We aimed to analyze the relations between changes in PA during COVID-19 lockdowns and changes in body weight and a comprehensive set of lifestyle and psychological outcomes in patients who have undergone BS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In AprilCMay 2020 (lockdown#1), we performed an online survey in a cohort of 937 adults who underwent BS and were followed-up at our university medical center for at least one year. We assessed changes in PA, eating behavior, body weight, fatigue, and depression (PHQ-9). In NovemberCDecember 2020 (lockdown#2), we recorded body weight in 280 patients who had reported decreased PA during lockdown #1. RESULTS: During lockdown #1 (N = 420 patients included, 44% response rate), decreased PA was reported by 67% patients. Compared to those who reported increased or unchanged PA, patients with decreased PA were more likely to report a  5% weight gain (OR (95% CI): 3.15 (1.46C7.65), increased fatigue (2.08 (1.36C3.23)), a worsening of eating behavior (2.29 (1.47C3.58)), and moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (4.74 (2.14C11.76)). During lockdown #2 (N = 225 patients, 80% response rate), significant weight gain since before lockdown #1 was reported (+ 2.8 (95% CI: 1.7C3.8) kg, p < 0.001), with 36% patients reporting a  5% weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: PA may counteract detrimental effects of COVID-19 lockdown on post-BS weight trajectories and mental health outcomes. Follow-up measures are needed in this setting to assess the long-term impact of lockdown.

However, it remains unclear whether immune responses following natural infection can be sustained or potentially prove critical for long-term immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Here, we systematically mapped the phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in peripheral blood samples of 4 healthy donors and 13 convalescent patients with COVID-19, including moderate and severe cases, by single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: : The relative percentage of the CD8+ effector memory subset was increased in both convalescent moderate and severe cases, but NKT-CD160 and maginal zone B clusters were decreased. Innate immune responses were attenuated reflected by decreased expression of genes involved in interferon-gamma, leukocyte migration and neutrophil mediated immune response in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Functions of T cell were strengthened in convalescent COVID-19 patients by clear endorsement of increased expression of genes involved in biological processes of regulation of T cell activation, differentiation and cell-cell adhesion. In addition, T cell mediated immune responses were enhanced with remarkable clonal expansions of TCR and increased transition of CD4+ effector memory and CD8+ effector-GNLY in severe subjects. B cell immune responses displayed sophisticated and dual functions during convalescence of COVID-19, providing a novel mechanism that B cell activation was observed especially in moderate while humoral immune response was weakened. Interestingly, HLA class I genes displayed downregulation while HLA class II genes upregulation in both T and B cell subsets in convalescent individuals. Notably, some unique IGV genes in severe patients may facilitate the design of vaccines. Conclusions: : Our collective dataset showed that innate immunity was declined but SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were retained even strengthened whereas sophisticated and dual functions of B cells, including declined humoral immunity were presented at several months following infections, which provided insights into evaluation of possibility of reinfection of exposed individuals with COVID-19 and facilitation to design of effective therapeutics and vaccines.","output":"Immune Features of COVID-19 Convalescent Individuals Revealed by a Single-cell RNA Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the initiation of the current outbreak, humans' lives have been profoundly impacted by COVID-19 During the first months, no rapid and reliable detecting tool was readily available to sufficiently respond to the requirement of massive testing In this situation, when the development of an effective vaccine requires at least a few months, it is crucial to be prepared by developing and commercializing affordable, accurate, rapid and adaptable biosensors not only to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also to be armed to avoid the pandemic in the earliest stages in the future The COVID-19 diagnostic tools are categorized into two main groups of Nucleic Acid (NA)-based and protein-based tests To date, nucleic acid-based detection has been announced as the gold-standard strategy for coronavirus detection;however, protein-based tests are promising alternatives for rapid and large-scale screening of susceptible groups In this review, we discuss the current protein-based biosensing tools, the research advances and the potential protein-detecting strategies for COVID-19 detection This narrative review aims to highlight the importance of the diagnostic tests, encourage the academic research groups and the companies to eliminate the shortcomings of the current techniques and step forward to mass-producing reliable point-of-care (POC) and point-of-need (PON) adaptable diagnostic tools for large-scale screening in the future outbreaks","output":"COVID-19 Diagnostic Strategies Part II: Protein-Based Technologies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Respiratory Intensive Care Assembly of the European Respiratory Society organised the first Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation Conference in Berlin in February 2020.

However, organic systems are still facing several challenges related to animal health and the arising of goal conflicts due to management and practical implications. Greater possibilities to perform species-specific behaviours in organic production systems, however, indicate that the organic standards offer a good framework for high animal welfare management. For organic dairy farmers, the main health problems are similar to those of non-organic farms; especially mastitis and lameness need improvement. Parasites, together with mastitis and lamb mortality, are important welfare issues in organic sheep production. Piglet mortality, leg problems, parasite load and increasing respiratory problems are of major relevance in organic pig production.

However, reports of COVID-19-associated mortality frequently refer to mortality during the initial hospitalization or first month after diagnosis. METHODS: In a prospective, observational study, we have analyzed the long-term (one year follow-up) serological and clinical outcomes of 56 hemodialysis patients that were infected by SARS-CoV-2 during the first pandemic wave. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive PCR test (n = 37) or by the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (n = 19). RESULTS: After over one year of follow-up, 35.7% of hemodialysis patients infected by SARS-COV-2 during the first pandemic wave had died, 6 (11%) during the initial admission, and 14 (25%) died in the following months, mainly within the first 3 months after diagnosis. Overall, 30% of patients died from vascular causes, and 40% from respiratory causes. In adjusted analysis, positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for diagnosis (HR 5.18 [1.30C20.65] p = 0.020), higher baseline C reactive protein levels (HR 1.10 [1.03C1.16] p = 0.002) and lower hemoglobin levels (HR 0.62 [0.45C0.86] p = 0.005) were associated with higher one-year mortality. Mortality in the 144 patients that did not have COVID-19 was 21 (14.6%) over 12 months [hazard ratio for death for COVID-19 patients 3.00 (1.62C5.53), log-rank p = 0.00023].

Herein, a novel ultrasensitive and reliable UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantitation of D3 and its major metabolites in COVID-19 patients. The mass spectral sensitivity was augmented via controlled microwave-assisted derivatization reaction (CMDR) with 2-nitrosopyridine (Pyr-NO) at 65 C for 2 min. CMDR hyphenation with UHPLC-MS/MS improves detection sensitivity while shortening separation and derivatization reaction times. The precursor to product ion transitions for D3, 25-hydroxy D3 (25(OH)D3), 1,25-dihydroxy D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and calcipotriol (CPT) as an internal standard were m/z 493.4  231.3, m/z 509.4  231.3, m/z 525.4  247.3, and m/z 521.4  247.3; respectively. The separation of the formed derivatives was conducted using a gradient elution mode with mobile phase A: formic acid (0.1%) in water and mobile phase B: formic acid (0.1%) in acetonitrile. The elution started with 40% (v/v) of B for 0.3 min then increased linearly to 90% (v/v) at 2 min on an Agilent EclipsePlus C18 (50  2.1 mm, 1.8 m) column at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min(?1).

A structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical linear regression (HLR) analyses were conducted to examine all the considered research hypotheses. The results show that risk perception significantly affects perceived understanding and social distancing behaviors in a positive way. Perceived understanding has a significant positive correlation with social distancing behaviors and plays a mediating role in the relationship between risk perception and social distancing behaviors.

The dual-purpose wheelchair was developed to facilitate sitting and sleeping postures that are desirable in handling the challenges of COVID-19 paraplegic patients in homes, hospitals and rehabilitation centers. The documented anthropometry parameter of the 5th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentile distribution of Nigerian paraplegics were retrieved and used in the design. The developed wheelchair was powered by a battery that converts the system from the wheelchair mode (sitting mode) to the bed (sleeping/relaxation) mode or vice versa. The average conversion rate of the dual-purpose wheelchair from bed mode to sitting mode and sitting mode to bed mode at no load is about 149.7 s and 163.6 s respectively with a standard error of 0.2 s. Also, the average conversion rate from sitting mode to bed/sleeping mode and bed mode to sitting mode under load is about 150.4 s and 166 s respectively. The ergonomic suitability and comfortability were determined from the computed average acceleration (ARMS), vibration dose value (VDV), and weighted acceleration value (AWRMS). The result from the performance test shows that the average acceleration falls between the range of 0.10 m/s2 and 0.29 m/s2 and the vibration dose value (VDV) ranges between 0.01m/s1.75 and 1.35 m/s1.75. The weighted acceleration (Aweighted) was also computed and found to be between the range of 0.01 m/s2 and 0.35 m/s2 vibration value.

The work is motivated by the need to accelerate scientific image analysis pipelines in use by experimental science, such as at x-ray light sources, and is motivated by the need for platform-portable codes that perform well across many different computational architectures. The primary focus of this work and its main contribution is an in-depth study of shared-memory parallel performance of different implementations, which include those using alternative parallelization approaches such as C11-threads, OpenMP, and data parallel primitives (DPPs). Our results show that, for this complex data-intensive algorithm, the DPP implementation exhibits better runtime performance, but also exhibits less favorable scaling characteristics than the C11-threads and OpenMP counterparts. Based upon a set of experiments that collect hardware performance counters on multiple platforms, the reason for the runtime performance difference appears to be due primarily to algorithmic efficiency gains: the reformulation from the traditional C11-threads and OpenMP expression of the solution into that of data parallel primitives results in significantly fewer instructions being executed. This study is the first of its type to do performance analysis using hardware counters for comparing methods based on VTK-m-based data-parallel primitives with those based on more traditional OpenMP or threads-based parallelism.

We sought to investigate to what extent bleeding represents the unmasking of an occult cancer in patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulants. Methods and Results Using data from CardioCHUVI-AF (Retrospective Observational Registry of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation From Vigo's Health Area), 8753 patients with AF aged 75 years with a diagnosis of AF between 2014 and 2017 were analyzed. Of them, 2171 (24.8%) experienced any clinically relevant bleeding, and 479 (5.5%) were diagnosed with cancer during a follow-up of 3 years. Among 2171 patients who experienced bleeding, 198 (9.1%) were subsequently diagnosed with cancer. Patients with bleeding have a 3-fold higher hazard of being subsequently diagnosed with new cancer compared with those without bleeding (4.7 versus 1.4 per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.2 [95% CI, 2.6-3.9]). Gastrointestinal bleeding was associated with a 13-fold higher hazard of new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis (HR, 13.4; 95% CI, 9.1-19.8); genitourinary bleeding was associated with an 18-fold higher hazard of new genitourinary cancer diagnosis (HR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.5-26.2); and bronchopulmonary bleeding was associated with a 15-fold higher hazard of new bronchopulmonary cancer diagnosis (HR, 15.8; 95% CI, 6.0-41.3).

Some of these compounds are useful for human therapeutics. There are two major forms of honeybee venom used in pharmacological applications: manually (or reservoir disrupting) extracted glandular venom (GV), and venom extracted through the use of electrical stimulation (ESV). A proteome comparison of these two venom forms and an understanding of the phosphorylation status of ESV, are still very limited. Here, the proteomes of GV and ESV were compared using both gel-based and gel-free proteomics approaches and the phosphoproteome of ESV was determined through the use of TiO(2) enrichment. RESULTS: Of the 43 proteins identified in GV, < 40% were venom toxins, and > 60% of the proteins were non-toxic proteins resulting from contamination by gland tissue damage during extraction and bee death. Of the 17 proteins identified in ESV, 14 proteins (>80%) were venom toxic proteins and most of them were found in higher abundance than in GV. Moreover, two novel proteins (dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 11-like and histone H2B.3-like) and three novel phosphorylation sites (icarapin (S43), phospholipase A-2 (T145), and apamin (T23)) were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that venom extracted manually is different from venom extracted using ESV, and these differences may be important in their use as pharmacological agents. ESV may be more efficient than GV as a potential pharmacological source because of its higher venom protein content, production efficiency, and without the need to kill honeybee. The three newly identified phosphorylated venom proteins in ESV may elicit a different immune response through the specific recognition of antigenic determinants. The two novel venom proteins extend our proteome coverage of honeybee venom.","output":"Proteome and phosphoproteome analysis of honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom collected from electrical stimulation and manual extraction of the venom gland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objective There is a shortage of supplies for the protection of professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. 3D printing offers the possibility to compensate for the production of some of the equipment needed.

In this setting, inpatient and outpatient services had to rethink and reorganize their activities to meet the needs of patients during the lockdown. The Italian Association of Myology developed a survey to estimate the impact of these changes on patients affected by neuromuscular disorders and on specialized neuromuscular centers during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We developed an electronic survey that was sent to neuromuscular centers affiliated with the Italian Association of Myology, assessing changes in pharmacological therapies provision, outpatient clinical and instrumental services, support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) and clinical trials. RESULTS: 40% of surveyed neuromuscular centers reported a reduction in outpatient visit and examinations (44.5% of centers in Northern regions; 25% of centers in Central regions; 50% of centers in Southern regions). Twenty-two% of centers postponed in-hospital administration of therapies for neuromuscular diseases (23.4% in Northern regions; 13.0% in Central regions; 20% in Southern regions). Diagnostic and support services (physiotherapy, nursing care, psychological support) were suspended in 57% of centers (66/43/44% in Northern, Central and Southern centers respectively) Overall, the most affected services were rehabilitative services and on-site outpatient visits, which were suspended in 93% of centers. Strategies adopted by neuromuscular centers to overcome these changes included maintaining urgent on-site visits, addressing patients to available services and promoting remote contact and telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant disruption of clinical and support services for patients with neuromuscular diseases. Despite the efforts to provide telemedicine consults to patients, this option could be promoted and improved further. A close collaboration between the different neuromuscular centers and service providers as well as further implementation of telehealth platforms are necessary to ensure quality care to NMD patients in the near future and in case of recurrent pandemic waves.","output":"Estimating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on services provided by Italian Neuromuscular Centers: an Italian Association of Myology survey of the acute phase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant upheavals in the German economy through closings, the collapse of supply chains and demand and made structural problems more prominent In addition to the economic effects of the coronavirus, the political debate is still primarily about possible measures to combat pandemics As long as the virus is present, the containment of the infection process has priority But soon the question will have to be what economic lessons can be learned from the crisis The political decisions to be made then will have a significant and long-term influence on the competitiveness of Germany as a business location Here it will be important to set economic policy priorities that set the course for a sustainable economy as quickly as possible so that it is not left behind in the international competition for locations","output":"Digitale Infrastruktur verbessern!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smart environments and the use of interactive technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for the senior community as well as to support the connections among the senior community and the world outside their community.

An outline of the current potential of pantoprazole in treatment and prevention of upper gastrointestinal diseases. Key points. Pantoprazole is widely applied in gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, ZollingerEllison syndrome and for Helicobacter pylori eradication. It minimally inhibits the CYP2C19 isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole conditions a weaker drug interaction compared to other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which enables its use for gastrointestinal bleeding prevention in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. The new coronaviral pandemic of COVID-19 urges the selection of PPIs that minimise the drug interference, such as pantoprazole, in therapy and prevention of acid-related upper gastrointestinal diseases. Pantoprazole has a good tolerance and low side effect rate. Conclusion. Pantoprazole is considered among optimal PPIs for efficacy, safety and adherence on the basis of clinical trials for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal diseases, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. ? 2021 People's Military Medical Press.

A suite of 6 additional markers of systemic injury and inflammation were considered in secondary analyses. We adjusted for potential confounders and assessed effect modification of several cardiovascular-disease risk factors. The median (25th, 75th percentiles) 24-h-average personal PM2.5 concentration was 115 g/m3 (65,154 g/m3) for traditional stove users and 52 g/m3 (39, 81 g/m3) for Justa stove users; kitchen PM2.5 and BC had similar patterns. Higher concentrations of PM2.5 and BC were associated with higher levels of CRP (e.g., a 25% increase in personal PM2.5 was associated with a 10.5% increase in CRP [95% CI: 1.2-20.6]). In secondary analyses, results were generally consistent with a null association.

DESIGN AND METHODS Respondents were overweight women older than 40 years with type 2 diabetes who were given three main meals and three snacks six days a week for 12 weeks. Anthropometric and blood glucose control data were collected before and after the intervention. Diet and intake data before the intervention were obtained through a semi quantitate food frequency questionnaire. Intake data during the intervention were recorded using the 24-hour food record and analyzed using modified NutriSurvey 2007 software. RESULTS Brown rice intervention significantly reduced body weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and abdominal circumference (P <0.05), also in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (PBG), and HbA1c (P <0.05). From the Pearson's test results, an increase in fiber intake correlated with a decrease in BMI and abdominal circumference (P = 0.03; r = -0.511 and P = 0.006; r = -0.619, respectively).

This study examines factors associated with PrEP awareness and willingness, and identifies perceived barriers to PrEP among PWID. Methods: PWID were interviewed in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA from 2016 to 2018. We analyzed data from self-reported HIV-negative participants who had injected drugs within the past 6 months (n = 469). Questions on PrEP included awareness, willingness, barriers, and uptake. Multiple logistic regression models of factors associated with awareness of, and willingness to, take PrEP were developed. Descriptive statistics on perceived PrEP barriers are reported. Results: Among HIV-negative PWID, 40% were aware of PrEP, 59% reported willingness to take PrEP, and 2% were currently taking PrEP. In multivariable analysis, PrEP awareness was associated with study site and sexual minority status, higher educational attainment, and HIV testing in the last 6 months. Willingness to take PrEP was associated with self-reported risk (paying sex partner in the last 6 months, sharing drug paraphernalia, and being injected by another PWID) and perceived HIV risk. The most common perceived barriers to PrEP were copays, concerns about increased HIV or sexually transmitted risk with PrEP, and concerns about reduction of medication efficacy without daily use. Conclusion: PrEP awareness among PWID remains inadequate. Willingness to take PrEP was moderate and was most desired by PWID who engaged in high-risk behaviors. Interventions to increase PrEP awareness and willingness, and to facilitate PrEP uptake among PWID are needed.","output":"HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Prevention Awareness, Willingness, and Perceived Barriers among People Who Inject Drugs in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA, 2016-2018."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bu makale, Covid-19 pandemisinin mahalle dzeyinde nas?l deneyimlendi?ini muhtarlar?n g?znden irdelemektedir. ?al??mada, pandemi deneyiminin ve pandeminin yerel y?neti?iminin, farkl? sosyal k?r?lganl?klara sahip mahallelerde farkl?la?an ve benze?en y?nlerinin, muhtarlar?n g?znden anla??lmas? hedeflenmektedir.

It aims to reveal the similarities and differences in experiences and local governance of the pandemic in neighborhoods depending on their level of social vulnerability. The data come from semi-structured interviews conducted online with 20 mukhtars from different neighborhoods in 4 municipalities of Istanbul with differing levels of social vulnerability. The findings show that there is a relation between the social vulnerability level of the neighborhood and its pandemic experiences as well as the mukhtar's efforts related to pandemic governance. In neighborhoods with lower levels of social vulnerability, the main issues with the pandemic experiences and management were related to the demographic composition. In those with higher levels of social vulnerability, in addition to financial problems, issues arose regarding compliance with pandemic regulations. This paper elucidates that pandemic experiences are shaped by neighborhoods' level of social vulnerability and that there is a need for pandemic governance which takes into account the structural and functional characteristics of neighborhoods. It provides some insights which would benefit the institutions in their management of any future pandemics by serving as a guide for more efficient and effective intervention measures.","output":"Farkl?

However, recent encouraging data from BCG revaccination trials in adults combined with studies on mucosal and intravenous routes of BCG vaccination in non-human primate models have renewed interest in BCG for TB prevention. In addition, several well-demonstrated non-specific effects of BCG, for example, prevention of viral and respiratory infections, give BCG an added advantage. Also, BCG vaccination is currently being widely tested in human clinical trials to determine whether it protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or death with detailed analyses and outcomes from several ongoing trials across the world awaited. Through this review, we attempt to bring together information on various aspects of the BCG-induced immune response, its efficacy in TB control, comparison with other candidate TB vaccines and strategies to improve its efficiency including revaccination and alternate routes of administration.

Hence, it is important to understand how to age successfully. Drawing on the concept that an individuals quality of life (QOL) is influenced by their demographics, coping strategies, resilience, and social participation, the current study reports on the findings of these variables among older adults in the Western Philippines. A total of 392 volunteer older adults were surveyed. Aside from the demographics such as age, gender, marital status, average monthly income, educational attainment, and health status, the data collected also included the 30-item coping strategies for the elderly, 14-item resilience scale, 12-item social participation scale, and 35-item older peoples QOL scale. Structural equation modeling was used to verify the parallel and serial mediating role of resilience and social participation within the relationship between coping strategies and QOL. Findings show that coping strategies alone are not enough to improve QOL. The only way to improve QOL is through resiliency, as well as the ability to participate in social activities. In essence, the QOL of older adults can be improved by encouraging them to have more social participation, and at the same time, understand how it takes to become resilient.","output":"Relationship of Coping Strategies and Quality of Life: Parallel and Serial Mediating Role of Resilience and Social Participation among Older Adults in Western Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus originally from Wuhan, China.

Despite extensive studies of the signaling pathways that mediate LPA-regulated cell growth and survival, the mechanisms underlying the apoptotic effect of LPA remain largely unclear. In this study, we investigated this issue in HeLa cells. Our data demonstrate that LPA induces apoptosis in HeLa cells at pathologic concentrations with a concomitant upregulation of the expression of TNFRSF21 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 21), also known as death receptor number 6 (DR6) involved in inflammation. Moreover, treatment of cells with LPA receptor (LPAR) antagonist abolished the DR6 upregulation by LPA. LPA-induced DR6 expression was also abrogated by pertussis toxin (PTX), an inhibitor of GPCRs, and by inhibitors of PI3K, PKC, MEK, and ERK. Intriguingly, LPA-induced DR6 expression was specifically blocked by dominant-negative form of PKC (PKC-DN). LPA-induced DR6 expression was also dramatically inhibited by knockdown of ERK or CREB. These results suggest that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway and the transcription factor CREB mediate LPA-induced DR6 expression. More interestingly, knockdown of DR6 using siRNA approach remarkably attenuated LPA-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results suggest that LPA-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells is mediated by the upregulation of DR6 expression.","output":"Lysophosphatidic Acid Triggers Apoptosis in HeLa Cells through the Upregulation of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 21"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously challenged worldwide healthcare systems and limited intensive care facilities, leading to physicians considering the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for managing SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS: We conducted an interim analysis of the international, multicentre HOPE COVID-19 registry including patients admitted for a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection until 18 April 2020. Those treated with NIV were considered. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or need for intubation. The components of the composite endpoint were the secondary outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted predictors of the primary endpoint within those initially treated with NIV were investigated. RESULTS: 1933 patients who were included in the registry during the study period had data on oxygen support type. Among them, 390 patients (20%) were treated with NIV. Compared with those receiving other non-invasive oxygen strategy, patients receiving NIV showed significantly worse clinical and laboratory signs of ARF at presentation. Of the 390 patients treated with NIV, 173 patients (44.4%) met the composite endpoint. In-hospital death was the main determinant (147, 37.7%), while 62 patients (15.9%) needed invasive ventilation. Those requiring invasive ventilation had the lowest survival rate (41.9%). After adjustment, age (adjusted OR (adj(OR)) for 5-year increase: 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.63, p<0.001), hypertension (adj(OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.61, p=0.03), room air O2 saturation <92% at presentation (adj(OR) 3.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 7.28, p=0.01), lymphocytopenia (adj(OR) 3.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.85, p=0.03) and in-hospital use of antibiotic therapy (adj(OR) 4.91, 95% CI 1.69 to 14.26, p=0.003) were independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: NIV was used in a significant proportion of patients within our cohort, and more than half of these patients survived without the need for intubation. NIV may represent a viable strategy particularly in case of overcrowded and limited intensive care resources, but prompt identification of failure is mandatory to avoid harm. Further studies are required to better clarify our hypothesis.

We hypothesized that the combination of sulfonylurea (iodosulfuron-methyl) anion with inexpensive, commercially available quaternary tetraalkylammonium cations could lead to biologically active ionic liquids (ILs) that could become a convenient and environment-friendly alternative to adjuvants. A simple one-step synthesis allowed for synthesizing iodosulfuron-methyl based ILs with high yields ranging from 88 to 96% as confirmed by UV, FTIR, and NMR. The obtained ILs were found to possess several favorable properties compared to the currently used sodium salt iodosulfuron-methyl, such as adjustable hydrophobicity (octanol-water partition coefficient) and enhanced stability in aqueous solutions, which was supported by molecular calculations showing cationCanion interaction energies. In addition, soil mobility and volatility of ILs were more beneficial compared to the parental herbicide. Herbicidal activity tests toward oil-seed rape and cornflower revealed that ILs comprising at least one alkyl chain in the decyl to octadecyl range had similar or better efficacy compared to the commercial preparation without addition of any adjuvant.

This step invariably occurs by Env positioning itself in the host membrane at the location of viral budding and being incorporated along with the host membrane into the viral particle. In some ways, this step of the viral life cycle would appear to be imprecise. There is no specific sequence in Env or in the retroviral structural protein, Gag, that is inherently required for the production of an infectious Env-containing particle. Additionally, Env-defective proviruses can efficiently produce infectious particles with any of a number of foreign retroviral Env glycoproteins or even glycoproteins from unrelated viral families, a process termed pseudotyping. However, mounting evidence suggests that Env incorporation is neither passive nor random.

This development has only been intensified by the current COVID-19 crisis, which promotes the development of applications that can help stop the virus from spreading by monitoring peoples movements and their social contacts. At the same time, it has become increasingly difficult for individuals to control the use of their private data by commercial companies. While Internet users claim to be highly interested in protecting their privacy, their behaviors indicate otherwise. This phenomenon is discussed in literature as the so-called privacy paradox. The existence of the privacy paradox has also been confirmed by previous studies, which found individuals claims and actions to contradict one another. The present study investigates the following research questions: (1) What significance do individuals attribute to protecting their privacy, with a special focus on the health sector? (2) To what extent are they willing to grant commercial parties access to their data in order to use applications in general and health applications in particular? Results from seven focus groups with 40 respondents aged 20C30 years were conducted in an urban setting in Austria in late 2019. The respondents inputs are meant to provide answers to these questions. The results indicate that, overall, the young generation is well-informed about the growing data collection and is quite critical of it. As such, their willingness to share information in the health context is only moderately pronounced. Thus, only a moderately pronounced privacy paradox can be detected for the health sector when compared to other sectors.

Transcription inhibition caused a greater loss of contacts in nonloop domains than loop domains. We uncovered conserved, transcription-state-dependent chromatin compartmentalization at high resolution that is shared from Drosophila to human, and a transcription-initiation-dependent nuclear subcompartment that brings multiple nonloop domains in close proximity.

We aimed to synthesize the evidence on 14 potentially low-value clinical practices in TBI care. METHODS: Using umbrella review methodology, we identified systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of 14 potentially low-value practices in adults with acute TBI. We present data on methodological quality (AMSTAR-2), reported effect sizes and credibility of evidence (I to IV). RESULTS: The only clinical practice with evidence of benefit was therapeutic hypothermia (credibility of evidence II to IV). However, the most recent meta-analysis on hypothermia based on high-quality trials suggested harm (credibility of evidence IV). Meta-analyses on platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelet therapy were all consistent with harm but were statistically non-significant. For the following practices, effect estimates were consistently close to the null: CT in adults with mild TBI who are low-risk on a validated clinical decision rule; repeat CT in adults with mild TBI on anticoagulant therapy with no clinical deterioration; antibiotic prophylaxis for external ventricular drain placement; and decompressive craniectomy for refractory intracranial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five clinical practices with evidence of lack of benefit or harm.

The primer sets for RT-LAMP were designed using highly conserved nucleotide sequences in the matrix protein region of subgroups A and B, and were specific for each subgroup. The RT-LAMP efficiency was compared to virus isolation and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for RSV detection (BD Directigen EZ RSV test?), using nasopharyngeal aspirates from 59 children with respiratory tract infections. The RT-LAMP was specific for RSV and could not detect other respiratory pathogens. 61% (36/59) of children were positive by RT-LAMP, 34% (20/59) by viral isolation, and 56% (26/46) by EZ RSV. Of 16 specimens that were negative by both antigen detection and virus isolation, 12.5% (2/16) were RT-LAMP positive.

RECENT FINDINGS: Challenges to older adults engagement in mental health research include practical, institutional, and collaboration-related barriers applicable to all clinical trials as well as more personal, cultural, and age-related patient barriers specific to geriatric mental health research. Universal research challenges include (1) institutional barriers of lack of funding and researchers, inter-researcher conflict, and sampling bias; (2) collaboration-related barriers involving miscommunication and clinician concerns; and (3) practical patient barriers such as scheduling issues, financial constraints, and transportation difficulties. Challenges unique to geriatric mental health research include (1) personal barriers such as no perceived need for treatment, prior negative experience, and mistrust of mental health research; (2) cultural barriers involving stigma and lack of bilingual or culturally matched staff; and (3) chronic medical issues and concerns about capacity. SUMMARY: Proposed solutions to these barriers include increased programmatic focus on and funding of geriatric psychiatry research grants, meeting with clinical staff to clarify study protocols and eligibility criteria, and offering transportation for participants. To minimize stigma and mistrust of psychiatric research, studies should devise community outreach efforts, employ culturally competent bilingual staff, and provide patient and family education about the study and general information about promoting mental health.","output":"Engaging in Late-Life Mental Health Research: a Narrative Review of Challenges to Participation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological surveillance is an essential component of public health practice especially during infectious disease outbreaks.

Chemotherapeutics that target influenza virus are available; however, rapid emergence of drug-resistant strains is common. Therapeutic targeting of host proteins hijacked by influenza virus to facilitate replication is an antiviral strategy to reduce the development of drug resistance. Nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) from infected cells has been shown to be mediated by exportin 1 (XPO1) interaction with viral nuclear export protein tethered to vRNP. RNA interference screening has identified XPO1 as a host proinfluenza factor where XPO1 silencing results in reduced influenza virus replication. The Streptomyces metabolite XPO1 inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) has been shown to limit influenza virus replication in vitro; however, LMB is toxic in vivo, which makes it unsuitable for therapeutic use. In this study, we tested the anti-influenza virus activity of a new class of orally available small-molecule selective inhibitors of nuclear export, specifically, the XPO1 antagonist KPT-335 (verdinexor). Verdinexor was shown to potently and selectively inhibit vRNP export and effectively inhibited the replication of various influenza virus A and B strains in vitro, including pandemic H1N1 virus, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus, and the recently emerged H7N9 strain. In vivo, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of verdinexor protected mice against disease pathology following a challenge with influenza virus A/California/04/09 or A/Philippines/2/82-X79, as well as reduced lung viral loads and proinflammatory cytokine expression, while having minimal toxicity. These studies show that verdinexor acts as a novel anti-influenza virus therapeutic agent. IMPORTANCE Antiviral drugs represent important means of influenza virus control. However, substantial resistance to currently approved influenza therapeutic drugs has developed. New antiviral approaches are required to address drug resistance and reduce the burden of influenza virus-related disease. This study addressed critical preclinical studies for the development of verdinexor (KPT-335) as a novel antiviral drug. Verdinexor blocks progeny influenza virus genome nuclear export, thus effectively inhibiting virus replication. Verdinexor was found to limit the replication of various strains of influenza A and B viruses, including a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain, a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus strain, and a recently emerging H7N9 influenza virus strain. Importantly, oral verdinexor treatments, given prophylactically or therapeutically, were efficacious in limiting lung virus burdens in influenza virus-infected mice, in addition to limiting lung proinflammatory cytokine expression, pathology, and death. Thus, this study demonstrated that verdinexor is efficacious against influenza virus infection in vitro and in vivo.","output":"Verdinexor, a novel selective inhibitor of nuclear export, reduces influenza a virus replication in vitro and in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AI technology has been used in many clinical research fields, but most AI technologies are difficult to land in real-world clinical settings.

However, there is a need to synthesise and summarise this body of knowledge to identify the overarching elements of how nurses experience working in disaster situations to reflect on their experiences so that we may help shape future clinical practice, research and education. DESIGN: Qualitative meta\\\\synthesis. METHOD: Following PROSPERO guidelines (Moher et al., 2015), an exhaustive and systematic literature search and quality appraisal was undertaken in December 2019 to reveal nurses experiences during natural disaster response. Sandelowski and Barroso's systematic retrieval, analysis and interpretation of findings method was used to produce a meta\\\\summary of findings from 10 papers evaluating experiences across 9 disasters. A meta\\\\aggregation was used to synthesise the findings from the studies and was methodically quality assessed with PRISMA and CASP. RESULTS: Our findings aggregated data from 42 sub\\\\themes, into the following four themes to capture nurses experiences after responding to disasters. These included agile response; leadership and innovative problem solving; building resilience; positive communication and need for psychological/emotional support. DISCUSSION: This meta\\\\synthesis provides evidence to illustrate nurses resilience and leadership capabilities as means to manage and perceive their disaster relief response. Factors such as emotional intelligence, capacity to react to changing situations, to manage scant resources in extreme situations were highlighted in nurses practising in highly stressful environments. Managers can use these examples to support ways to improve disaster management policies, but also, to engage in support for their staff.

However, little is known about the use of VC on alliance in family-based therapy. The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to a national lockdown during which most family-based therapy transferred to VC. OBJECTIVE: The current study analyzed the development and strength of alliance prior and during lockdown for multi-stressed families participating in Multisystemic Therapy (MST). METHOD: Alliance with the therapist was reported monthly by 846 caregivers (81% female). Using latent growth curve models (longitudinal approach), the development of alliance was estimated for families participating in MST prior to the lockdown, transferring to VC early in treatment or late in treatment. Using regression analyses (cross-sectional approach), lockdown (yes/no) was included as predictor of alliance. In these analyses, type of family (regular; intellectual disability; concerns regarding child abuse or neglect) and gender of caregiver were included as moderators. RESULTS: Both analytical approaches showed that alliance was not affected by VC, except for families with concerns of child abuse, who reported lower alliances during lockdown. However, these results where no longer significant when controlling for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: Strong alliances can be developed and maintained during family-based VC sessions with multi-stressed families. However, for some subgroups, such as families with concerns of child abuse, VC might not be suitable or sufficient.

The primordium of the adenohypophysis as well as the primordium of the hypothalamus in amphibians is of neural origin as shown in other vertebrates, and both are closely associated with each other at the earliest stage of development. Metamorphosis progresses via the interaction of thyroid hormone and adrenal corticosteroids, of which secretion is enhanced by thyrotropin and corticotropin, respectively. However, unlike in mammals, the hypothalamic releasing factor for thyrotropin is not thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), but corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the major releasing factor for corticotropin is arginine vasotocin (AVT).

Background: Pre-pandemic UK survey data show that up to 60% of intensive care units (ICUs) did not meet locally agreed staffing numbers and 40% of ICUs were closing beds at least once a week because of workforce shortages, specifically nursing. Nurse staffing in ICUs is based on the assumption that sicker patients need more nursing resource than those recovering from critical illness. These standards are based on historical working, and expert professional consensus, deemed the weakest form of evidence. Methods: Focus groups with health care professionals working in ICUs (n= 52 participants) and individual interviews with critical care network leads and policy leads (n= 14 participants) in England between December 2019 and July 2020. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Findings: Three themes were identified: the constraining or enabling nature of ICU and hospital structures; whole team processes to mitigate nurse staffing shortfalls; and the impact of nurse staffing on patient, staff and ICU flow outcomes. Staff made decisions about staffing throughout a shift and were influenced by a combination of factors illuminated in the three themes. Conclusions: Whilst nurse: patient ratios were clearly used to set the nursing establishment, it was clear that rostering and allocation/re-allocation during a shift took into account many other factors, such as patient and family nursing needs, staff wellbeing, ICU layout and the experience, and availability, of other members of the multi-professional team. This has important implications for future planning for ICU nurse staffing and highlights important factors to be accounted for in future research studies.","output":"The organisation of nurse staffing in intensive care units: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: Therapeutic reasoning-the mental process of making judgments and decisions about treatment-is developed through acquisition of knowledge and application in actual or simulated experiences. Health professions education frequently uses collaborative small group work to practice therapeutic reasoning. This pilot study compared the impact of a web-based/mobile tool for collaborative case work and discussion to usual practice on student perceptions and performance on questions designed to test therapeutic knowledge and reasoning. Methods: In a therapeutics course that includes case-based workshops, student teams of 3 to 4 were randomly assigned to usual workshop preparation (group SOAP sheet) or preparation using the Practice Improvement using Virtual Online Training (PIVOT) platform. PIVOT was also used in the workshop to review the case and student responses. The next week, groups crossed over to the other condition. Students rated favorability with the preparatory and in-workshop experiences and provided comments about the PIVOT platform via a survey. Student performance on examination items related to the 2 workshop topics was compared. Results: One hundred and eleven students (94%) completed post-workshop surveys after both workshops. The majority of students (57%) preferred using the PIVOT platform for workshop collaboration. Favorability ratings for the in-workshop experience did not change significantly from first to second study week, regardless of sequence of exposure. There was no relationship between examination item scores and the workshop platform the students were exposed to for that content (P = .29). Student responses highlighted the efficiency of working independently before collaborating as a group and the ability to see other students' thought processes as valuable aspects of PIVOT. Students expressed frustration with the PIVOT user interface and the lack of anonymity when discussing their answers in the workshop. Conclusion: A web-based/mobile platform for student team collaboration on therapeutic reasoning cases discussed in small group settings yielded favorable ratings, examination performance comparable to standard approaches, and was preferred by a majority of students. During the rapid shift to substantial online learning for the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual collaboration tools like PIVOT may help health professions teachers to better support groups working virtually on scaffolded therapeutic reasoning tasks.","output":"A Randomized, Crossover Pilot Study of a Novel Web-Based/Mobile Platform for Collaborative Small Group Practice in Therapeutic Reasoning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Physicians who migrate globally face a daunting series of time-consuming, labor- and resource-intensive procedures to prove their clinical competency before being allowed to practice medicine in a new country.

Recently, airborne transmission has been postulated to be a major contributor to the spread of the novel coronavirus, especially in enclosed public spaces. While many studies have demonstrated positive correlations between atmospheric pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the impact of indoor air pollutants on airborne transmission has been largely overlooked. In particular, laser printers are a primary source of particle emission that increases the concentrations of particulate matter in indoor atmosphere by releasing substantial quantities of electrostatic fine particles, at rates comparable with tobacco smoking and incense burning. We hypothesized that particles emitted from laser printers present a potential risk factor for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in offices and other indoor environments with high user occupancy. To test this hypothesis, we reviewed recent knowledge on the characteristics of particles emitted by laser printing, including their emission rates and accumulation in indoor air, electrostatic charges, localized emission and subsequent particle diffusion in relation to the human breathing zone. We then discuss the potential impact on the transmission of SAR-CoV-2 in indoor spaces. We found that emission rates from laser printers ranged from 10(8) to 10(12) particles min(?1), and these fine particles typically remain suspended for prolonged periods in indoor air. Electrostatic charges carried by these particles can reach 260C379 e per particle, thus enhancing their surface adsorption and deposition in human airways. Localized emission by laser printers and subsequent diffusion highly increase particle concentrations near the human breathing zone.","output":"Electrostatic fine particles emitted from laser printers as potential vectors for airborne transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This retrospective analysis aimed to characterize patients with migraine initiating erenumab and the shifting or trend of patient characteristics over time in a real-world setting. METHODS: Adult patients with at least one erenumab written prescription/administration between May 1, 2018 and September 30, 2019 were identified from the Optum De-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) database (index date = date of the first erenumab prescription/administration). Patient demographics and characteristics, acute and preventive medications used prior to initiation of erenumab, and the initial prescriber specialty were examined. In addition, the shifting or trends of patient characteristics over time were analyzed among subgroups of patients based on when they initiated erenumab. RESULTS: A total of 14,774 eligible patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the analysis. Most patients were female (86.4%), average age 46.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 13.1) years, Caucasian (88.7%), non-Hispanic (91.8%), and commercially insured (59.8%) at the index date. During the 12-month pre-index period, commonly observed selected comorbid conditions included anxiety (30.6%), depression (28.2%), and cardiovascular diseases (26.4%), and the mean (SD) Elixhauser comorbidity score was 1.7 (5.5). The most common provider specialty at erenumab initiation was neurologist/headache specialist (46.5%). Over time, there was a decrease in mean baseline Elixhauser comorbidity score at erenumab initiation, an increase in general practitioners prescribing initial erenumab, and increased utilization in patients with less severe migraine overall (a proxy of the declining trend in chronic migraine and triptan use). CONCLUSION: Early use of erenumab post approval focused on patients with more severe disease and a high comorbidity index rating. Over time, utilization of this preventive medication occurred in a broader population of patients with migraine, with increased use by general practitioners and those outside of headache centers.","output":"Real-World Trends in Characteristics of Patients with Migraine Newly Initiated on Erenumab in the USA: A Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of global concern. Accordingly, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), including medical face masks, has sharply risen compared with 2019. The new situation has led to a sharp increase in energy demand and the environmental impacts associated with these product systems. Hence, the pandemic's effects on the environmental consequences of various PPE types, such as medical face masks, should be assessed. In light of that, the current study aimed to identify the environmental hot-spots of medical face mask production and consumption by using life cycle assessment (LCA) and tried to provide solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts. Based on the results obtained, in 2020, medical face masks production using fossil-based plastics causes the loss of 2.03  10(3) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); 1.63  10(8) PDF*m(2)*yr damage to ecosystem quality; the climate-damaging release of 2.13  10(9) kg CO(2eq); and 5.65  10(10) MJ damage to resources.

The vasoreactivity that occurs during reductions in local arterial blood flow, termed low-flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC), is a measure of endothelial-dependent vasoconstrictor function. It is unclear whether aerobic fitness and movement (or lack thereof) influences L-FMC. We systematically reviewed studies examining the impact of physical behaviours on L-FMC. To be included, cross-sectional and interventional studies had to examine the impact of a physical behaviour on L-FMC in adults. There were no language or date of publication restrictions. Sources were searched in May, 2021 and included Scopus, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Academic Search Premier. National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used. Fourteen studies (15 arms; 313 participants; 398 total observations from four arteries) met the inclusion criteria. The study quality varied from four out of 14 (controlled intervention scoring) to nine out of 12 (longitudinal intervention with no control group scoring) with the total points dependent upon the study design. Conflicting results were reported for acute prolonged sitting studies (attenuated L-FMC: n = 1; no change: n = 1) and resistance exercise (increased L-FMC: n = 2; no change: n = 2). Most observational studies examining aerobic fitness (3/4 studies) and aerobic exercise interventions (4/5 studies) observed a favourable effect on L-FMC.

METHODS: We conducted a qualitative, theoretically informed, interview-based study to purposefully sample international experts in health care, technology, business, innovation, and social sciences, drawing on sociotechnical systems theory. We used in-depth interviews to capture perspectives on development, design, and use of data from wearable sensor devices in health care, and employed thematic analysis of interview transcripts with NVivo to facilitate coding. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 experts. Although the use of data from wearable sensor devices in health and care has significant potential in improving patient engagement, there are a number of issues that stakeholders need to negotiate to realize these benefits. These issues include the current gap between data created and meaningful interpretation in health and care contexts, integration of data into health care professional decision making, negotiation of blurring lines between consumer and medical care, and pervasive monitoring of health across previously disconnected contexts.

Fluctuations of carbon dioxide have been associated with adverse neurological outcome in patients with severe respiratory failure requiring extracorporeal organ support. The aim of this study was to investigate whether early hypercapnia is associated with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation during the acute phase of ARDS. METHODS: Between December 2018 and November 2019, patients who fulfilled the Berlin criteria for ARDS, were enrolled. Patients with a history of central nervous system disorders, cerebrovascular disease, chronic hypercapnia, or a life expectancy of less than 24 h were excluded from study participation. During the acute phase of ARDS, cerebrovascular autoregulation was measured over two time periods for at least 60 min. Based on the values of mean arterial blood pressure and near-infrared spectroscopy, a cerebral autoregulation index (COx) was calculated. The time with impaired cerebral autoregulation was calculated for each measurement and was compared between patients with and without early hypercapnia [defined as an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2))  50 mmHg with a corresponding arterial pH < 7.35 within the first 24 h of ARDS diagnosis]. RESULTS: Of 66 patients included, 117 monitoring episodes were available. The mean age of the study population was 58.5  16 years. 10 patients (15.2%) had mild, 28 (42.4%) moderate, and 28 (42.4%) severe ARDS. Nineteen patients (28.8%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Early hypercapnia was present in 39 patients (59.1%). Multivariable analysis did not show a significant association between early hypercapnia and impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation (B = 0.023 [95% CI ? 0.054; 0.100], p = 0.556). Hypocapnia during the monitoring period was significantly associated with impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation [B = 0.155 (95% CI 0.014; 0.296), p = 0.032]. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that moderate permissive hypercapnia during the acute phase of ARDS has no adverse effect on cerebrovascular autoregulation and may be tolerated to a certain extent to achieve low tidal volumes.

This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO)-almitrine combination to restore oxygenation in severe COVID-19 ARDS (C-ARDS) patients. METHODS: We conducted a monocentric preliminary pilot study in intubated patients with severe C-ARDS. Respiratory mechanics was assessed after a prone session. Then, patients received iNO (10 ppm) alone and in association with almitrine (10 g/kg/min) during 30 min in each step. Echocardiographic and blood gases measurements were performed at baseline, during iNO alone, and iNO-almitrine combination. The primary endpoint was the variation of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio). RESULTS: Ten severe C-ARDS patients were assessed (7 males and 3 females), with a median age of 60 [52-72] years. Combination of iNO and almitrine outperformed iNO alone for oxygenation improvement. The median of PaO2/FiO2 ratio varied from 102 [89-134] mmHg at baseline, to 124 [108-146] mmHg after iNO (p = 0.13) and 180 [132-206] mmHg after iNO and almitrine (p < 0.01). We found no correlation between the increase in oxygenation caused by iNO-almitrine combination and that caused by proning.

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing. METHODS: The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged 18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK. Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period. Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included participants had a median age of 461 years (IQR 360C541) and 19 692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106 905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine. Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55C85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74C96) 7 days after two doses in the study population.

In this paper, we developed an oxygen optimal distribution model considering uncertain demands and proposed a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) with a budget-based uncertainty set that protects the initial distribution decisions with low conservatism. The main goal of the TSRO model is to make wait-and-see decisions maximizing production profits and make here-and-now decisions minimizing operational stability and surplus/shortage penalty. To represent the uncertainty set of energy demands, we developed a Gaussian process (GP)-based time series model to forecast the energy demands of continuous processes and a capacity-constrained scheduling model to generate multi-scenario energy demands of discrete processes. We carried out extensive computational studies on TSRO and its components using well-synthetic instances from historical data.

We hypothesized that surgical stabilization of rib fractures would not decrease the incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was queried for all traumatic rib fractures in 2016. Patients were divided into groups with single rib fractures, multiple rib fractures, and flail chest. Nonoperative therapy was compared with stabilization of rib fractures of 1 to 2 ribs or 3+ ribs. RESULTS: There were 114,972 total patients with rib fractures meeting inclusion criteria, with 5,106 (4.4%) having flail chest, 24,726 (21.5%) having single rib fractures, and 85,140 (74.1%) having multiple rib fractures. Those with flail chest (15.9%) were most likely to get rib plating in comparison to multiple rib fractures (0.9%) and single rib fractures (0.2%); P < .001. On logistic regression, surgical stabilization of rib fractures 1 to 2 ribs (odds ratio: 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.10C0.28) or 3+ ribs (odds ratio: 0.17, 95% confidence interval: 0.11C0.28), with nonoperative therapy as the reference was associated with survival. Variables associated with mortality included increasing age, male sex, increasing injury severity score, decreased Glasgow coma scale, requirement of transfusions, and hypotension on admission. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures 3+ ribs (odds ratio: 2.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.58C3.37) was associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome but not 1 to 2 ribs (odd ratio: 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 0.97C2.48). On logistic regression of only patients with flail chest, stabilization of rib fractures was associated with decreased mortality but not increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION: The increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome should be considered in the preoperative assessment for stabilization of rib fractures.","output":"Surgical stabilization of rib fractures is associated with improved survival but increased acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged in South Africa in November 2021, and has later been identified worldwide, raising serious concerns. A real-time RT-PCR assay was designed for the rapid screening of the Omicron variant, targeting characteristic mutations of the spike gene. The assay was used to test 737 sewage samples collected throughout Italy (19/21 Regions) between 11 November and 25 December 2021, with the aim of assessing the spread of the Omicron variant in the country. Positive samples were also tested with a real-time RT-PCR developed by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), and through nested RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Overall, 115 samples tested positive for Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant. The first occurrence was detected on 7 December, in Veneto, North Italy. Later on, the variant spread extremely fast in three weeks, with prevalence of positive wastewater samples rising from 1.0% (1/104 samples) in the week 5C11 December, to 17.5% (25/143 samples) in the week 12C18, to 65.9% (89/135 samples) in the week 19C25, in line with the increase in cases of infection with the Omicron variant observed during December in Italy. Similarly, the number of Regions/Autonomous Provinces in which the variant was detected increased from one in the first week, to 11 in the second, and to 17 in the last one. The presence of the Omicron variant was confirmed by the JRC real-time RT-PCR in 79.1% (91/115) of the positive samples, and by Sanger sequencing in 66% (64/97) of PCR amplicons. In conclusion, we designed an RT-qPCR assay capable to detect the Omicron variant, which can be successfully used for the purpose of wastewater-based epidemiology. We also described the history of the introduction and diffusion of the Omicron variant in the Italian population and territory, confirming the effectiveness of sewage monitoring as a powerful surveillance tool.","output":"The rapid spread of SARS-COV-2 Omicron variant in Italy reflected early through wastewater surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Yersinia pestis, the Gram-negative bacterial agent of plague, is a zoonotic pathogen that primarily infects wild rodents and is transmitted by fleas.

The objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United Kingdom stratified by age, risk and influenza vaccination status. METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional, exploratory, observational study used linked data from the General Practice Research Database and the Hospital Episode Statistics databases to estimate resource use and cost associated with ILI in the UK. RESULTS: Data were included from 156,193 patients with 1 general practitioner visit with ILI. There were 21,518 high-risk patients, of whom 12,514 (58.2%) were vaccinated and 9,004 (41.8%) were not vaccinated, and 134,675 low-risk patients, of whom 17,482 (13.0%) were vaccinated and 117,193 (87.0%) were not vaccinated. High-risk vaccinated patients were older (p<0.001) and had more risk conditions (p<0.001). High-risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.16) or vaccinated (OR 1.19) patients had a higher probability of >1 general practitioner visit compared with low-risk and unvaccinated patients. Patients who were high-risk and vaccinated had a reduced risk of >1 general practitioner visit (OR 0.82; p<0.001). High-risk individuals who were also vaccinated had a lower probability of ILI-related hospitalisation than individuals who were high-risk or vaccinated alone (OR 0.59). In people aged 65 years, the mortality rate was lower in vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals (OR 0.75). The cost of ILI-related GP visits and hospital admissions in the UK over the study period in low-risk vaccinated patients was 27,391,142 and 141,932,471, respectively. In low-risk unvaccinated patients the corresponding values were 168,318,709 and 112,534,130, respectively.

Flash and riverine flood risks in the Sahel have become persistent and widespread recently. ? Timing of occurrence of maximum rainfall is end of July to mid-August in Eastern Sahel, but to the end of August in Western Sahel. ? Fatality, disease outbreaks and damage were exceptional in the aftermath of 2019 and 2020 floods in Sudan. ? Changing natural climate patterns, soil characteristics, human interferences, and mal-governance drive catastrophic floods. ? Overlooked debilitating floods hindered the opportunities for effective management plans. Despite the long-lasting and widespread drought in the Sahel, flood events did punctuate in the past. The concern about floods remains dwarf on the international research and policy agenda compared to droughts. In this paper, we elucidate that floods in the Sahel are now becoming more frequent, widespread, and more devastating. We analyzed gridded daily rainfall data over the period 1981C2020, used photographs and satellite images to depict flood areas and threats, compiled and studied flood-related statistics over the past two decades, and supported the results with peer-reviewed literature. Our analysis revealed that the timing of the maximum daily rainfall occurs from the last week of July to mid-August in the Eastern Sahel, but from the last week of July to the end of August in the Western Sahel. In 2019 and 2020, flash and riverine floods took their toll in Sudan and elsewhere in the region in terms of the number of affected people, direct deaths, destroyed and damaged houses and croplands, contaminated water resources, and disease outbreaks and deaths. Changes in rainfall intensity, human interventions in the physical environment, and poor urban planning play a major role in driving catastrophic floods. Emphasis should be put on understanding flood causes and impacts on vulnerable societies, controlling water-borne diseases, and recognizing the importance of compiling relevant and reliable flood information. Extreme rainfall in this dry region could be an asset for attenuating the regional water scarcity status if well harvested and managed. We hope this paper will induce the hydroclimate scholars to carry out more flood studies for the Sahel. It is only then encumbered meaningful opportunities for flood risk management can start to unveil.

The rise of celebrity politicians such as Donald Trump and Vladimir Zelensky has led political theorists and commentators to worry that the role of expertise in democratic politics has been undermined. According to one recent critique (Archer et al. 2020), celebrities possess a significant degree of epistemic power (the power to influence what people believe) that is unconnected to appropriate expertise. This presents a problem both for deliberative and epistemic theories of democratic legitimacy, which ignore this form of power, and for real existing democracies attempting to meet the standards of legitimacy set out by these theories. But do these critiques apply to democratic elitism? In this paper, we argue that recognition of celebrity epistemic power in fact represents a valuable resource for supporting the legitimacy and practice of democratic elitism, though these benefits do come with certain risks to which elite theories are particularly vulnerable.","output":"Celebrity Politics and Democratic Elitism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT The combined use of chemical and biological control agents could prove to be a successful strategy against insects and ticks, which could improve the efficiency attained by conventional strategies and also lessen environmental impact that could be caused by these substances.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis leading to model development and validation. SETTING: All ICU admissions wherein patients received insulin therapy during a 4-year period at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Each ICU was equipped with continuous physiologic monitoring systems whose signals were archived in an electronic data warehouse along with the entire medical record. PATIENTS: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty-seven ICU patient admissions. INTERVENTIONS: The primary outcome was hypoglycemia, defined as any episode of blood glucose less than 70 mg/dL where 50% dextrose injection was administered within 1 hour. We used 61 physiologic markers (including vital signs, laboratory values, demographics, and continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring variables) to inform the model. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our dataset consisted of 11,847 ICU patient admissions, 721 (6.1%) of which had one or more hypoglycemic episodes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a pathophysiologic signature of 41 independent variables that best characterized ICU hypoglycemia. The final model had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78C0.87) for prediction of impending ICU hypoglycemia. We externally validated the model in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III critical care dataset, where it also demonstrated good performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77C0.81).

Traditional vaccines based on killed and attenuated organisms and inactivated toxins have constituted the majority of clinically used vaccines to date, but novel vaccines based on subunits of these organisms will be increasingly represented in future. In contrast to attenuated and whole cell vaccines, subunit vaccines do not generally contain immune-stimulatory components and are poorly immunogenic. As a result, new, potent and safe adjuvants and delivery systems are needed to enhance the immunogenicity of these vaccines. Furthermore, there is a drive to replace injected vaccines with those that can be administered by mucosal routes.

We aimed to compare pediatric surgery practices, including the number and types of surgery, either elective or emergency surgeries and outpatient services, before the outbreak and during the COVID-19 pandemic in our institution. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively compared pediatric surgery practices, including elective and emergency surgeries, and outpatient services between the previous one-year period (March 2019CFebruary 2020), the last three months of that period (December 2019CFebruary 2020) before the outbreak, and the three months (MarchCMay 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in our hospital. RESULTS: The frequency of elective surgeries during the pandemic was lower than during the last three months before the outbreak: 61 vs. 18 (3-fold), 19 vs. 13 (1.5-fold), 19 vs. 5 (4-fold), and 30 vs. 15 (2-fold) for digestive, neonate, urology and oncology cases, respectively.

These dopamine (DA) replacement-resistant symptoms in part have been attributed to loss of basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons and, in interaction with striatal dopamine (DA) loss, to the resulting disruption of the attentional control of balance and complex movements. Rats with dual cholinergic-DA losses (DL rats) were previously demonstrated to model PD falls and associated impairments of gait and balance. OBJECTIVES: We previously found that the muscarinic M1-positive allosteric modulator (PAM) TAK-071 improved the attentional performance of rats with BF cholinergic losses. Here, we tested the hypotheses that TAK-071 reduces fall rates in DL rats. RESULTS: Prior to DL surgery, female rats were trained to traverse a rotating straight rod as well as a rod with two zigzag segments. DL rats were refamiliarized with such traversals post-surgery and tested over 7 days on increasingly demanding testing conditions.

The aim of this study is to synthesise the evidence on intra-hospital practices for orthopaedic injuries, previously identified as potentially of low value. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies that evaluate selected practices according to a priori PICOS statements (Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome-Study design) . We will evaluate the methodological quality for systematic reviews using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews version 2 (AMSTAR-2). Risk of bias in original studies will be evaluated with the Cochrane revised tool for RCTs (RoB2) and with the risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions (ROBINS-I) tool.

METHODS From January 2010 to May 2015, 131 consecutive patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms were treated by endovascular methods at our institution. Among the 21 patients (16%) treated by intra-arterial thrombolysis for the thrombus formation during the procedure, nine patients (nine aneurysms) suffered from thrombus remnant. We reviewed the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients with thrombus remnant as well as intraoperative and postoperative management of thrombus formation. RESULTS Thrombus formation occurred near the coiled aneurysm in eight patients, and distal embolic occlusion was observed in one patient. All nine patients were initially managed by intra-arterial thrombolysis with tirofiban. One patient with persistent distal embolic occlusion and two patients with distal migration of the thrombus after intra-arterial thrombolysis were additionally treated with stent retriever. One patient with occlusion of the parent artery near the coiled aneurysm despite intra-arterial thrombolysis was partially recanalized by permanent deployment of a stent retriever. Delayed cerebral angiography showed no increase in size of thrombus remnant in any patients. After the procedure, thrombus remnant was managed by intravenous tirofiban. Follow-up CT angiography on the first postoperative day showed patent arterial flow, and ischemic complication related with thromboembolism did not occur in any patients. One patient suffered from hemorrhagic complication. CONCLUSION If the patency of parent artery is maintained and the size of the thrombus remnant does not increase on delayed angiography after intra-arterial thrombolysis, postoperative thromboembolic events rarely occur.","output":"Thrombus remnant despite intra-arterial thrombolysis for thrombus formation during endovascular treatment of ruptured cerebral aneurysms: Does it harm?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic began in 2019, but it is still active.

Methods Based on an approved IRB protocol, CBC differentials from the first 3 days of hospitalization of 12 SARS CoV-2 infected patients were retrospectively extracted from hospital records and analyzed with a privately owned Pattern Recognition Software (PRS, US Patent 10,429,389 B2) previously validated in sepsis, HIV, and hantavirus infections. PRS partitions the data into subsets immunologically dissimilar from one another, although internally similar. Results Regardless of the angle considered, the classic analysis ?which measured the percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils? did not distinguish outcomes (A). In contrast, non-overlapping patterns generated by the PRS differentiated 3 (left, vertical, and right) groups of patients (B). One subset was only composed of survivors (B). The remaining subsets included the highest oxygenation requirements (B). At least two immunologically interpretable, multi-cellular indicators distinguished the 3 data subsets with statistically significant differences (C, p 0.05). Survivors (the left subset) showed lower N/L and/or higher M/L ratios than non-survivors (the vertical subset, C).Therefore, PRS partitioned the data into subsets that displayed both biological and significant differences. Because it offers visually explicit information, clinicians do not require a specialized training to interpret PRS-generated results.

The clinical characteristics of seven patients of family cluster-onset coronavirus disease 2019 were reported, including the immune characteristics of one patient of human immunodeficiency virus/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 coinfection. In the patients of human immunodeficiency virus/severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 coinfection, about 2 weeks after infection, it was observed that CD4 and CD8 count showed a downward trend and that of CD8 is more obvious; at the same time, lymphocytes showed a slight increase. CD4, CD8, and lymphocytes are in the plateau period from the second week to the fourth week. About 4 weeks after infection, all showed an increase, in which anti-coronavirus combined with antiviral therapy were given. The time for Nucleic Acid Testing to present as negative was 51 days. The other six patients in the family were nonChuman immunodeficiency virus infected, the familial cluster received parallel treatment, and the median time for the Nucleic Acid Testing to present as negative was 29 days.

This retrospective analysis reports clinical and pregnancy outcomes among hospitalized pregnant women with COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The Premier Healthcare Database C Special Release was used to examine the impact of COVID-19 among pregnant women aged 15C44 years who were hospitalized and who delivered compared with pregnant women without COVID-19. Outcomes evaluated were COVID-19 clinical progression, including the use of supplemental oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, critical illness, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and maternal death, and pregnancy outcomes, including preterm delivery and stillbirth. RESULTS: Overall, 473,902 hospitalized pregnant women were included, of whom 8584 (1.8%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis (mean [SD] age 28.4 [6.1] years; 40% Hispanic). The risk of poor clinical and pregnancy outcomes was greater among pregnant women with COVID-19 compared with pregnant women without a COVID-19 diagnosis in 2020; the risk of poor clinical and pregnancy outcomes increased with increasing age. Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic women were consistently observed to have the highest relative risk of experiencing poor clinical or pregnancy outcomes across all age groups.

METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?, which was included in the British Lung Foundation/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April 2020. This was during the 3rd week of the UKs initial social distancing measures which included advice to stay at home and only go outside for specific limited reasons. RESULTS: 7039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of age groups (under 17 to over 80), gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or other lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: (1) vulnerability to COVID-19; (2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; (3) pervasive uncertainty; and (4) inadequate national response. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect contextual factors, as well as their subjective experience of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include (1) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; (2) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, (3) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, (4) improving the government and healthcare response.","output":"COVID-19 related concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The value of all hitherto existing professions stems from how the public in which they serve perceive the import of their services This study examines the perceptions of a cross-section of Nigerians regarding their knowledge of the social work profession Through a structured survey instrument, data were collected from a nationally representative sample of 350 Nigerians from the age of twenty years and above Although the majority of the respondents were not familiar with the professional designation social work, they, however, demonstrated substantial knowledge about social workers roles, areas of practice and other measures Since practitioners are actively involved in community organising and development practice across the country, more than two-thirds of the respondents believed that the profession has the potential to address social development problems not only in Nigeria but across the African continent","output":"Public Perceptions of Social Work in Nigeria: Does the Profession Has What It Takes to Address Nigerias Social Problems?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expressed personality traits can play a pivotal role in convincing investors in crowdfunding.

How the cellular m(6)A modification machinery impacts coronavirus replication, which occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, is unknown. Here we show that replication of SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and a seasonal human -coronavirus HCoV-OC43, can be suppressed by depletion of METTL3 or cytoplasmic m(6)A reader proteins YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 and by a highly specific small molecule METTL3 inhibitor. Reduction of infectious titer correlates with decreased synthesis of viral RNAs and the essential nucleocapsid (N) protein. Sites of m(6)A modification on genomic and subgenomic RNAs of both viruses were mapped by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq). Levels of host factors involved in m(6)A installation, removal, and recognition were unchanged by HCoV-OC43 infection; however, nuclear localization of METTL3 and cytoplasmic m(6)A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 increased. This establishes that coronavirus RNAs are m(6)A-modified and host m(6)A pathway components control -coronavirus replication.

We explored how the duration, the size and number of transmission clusters, defined as country-specific monophyletic groups in a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree, differed between the Nordic countries.

In addition, there was a significant positive association between transmission cluster size and duration, suggesting that the size of transmission clusters could be reduced by rapid and effective contact tracing. Thus, these data indicate that to reduce the general burden of COVID-19 there should be a focus on limiting dense gatherings and their subsequent contacts to keep the number, size and duration of transmission clusters to a minimum.

Most of the previous convergence studies have taken a retrospective view in measuring the degree of convergence and monitoring the converging trends. This paper proposes a quantitative future-oriented approach to technological opportunity discovery for convergence using patent information. In a future-oriented approach, technological opportunities for convergence are suggested by predicting potential technological knowledge flows (TKFs) between heterogeneous fields. The potential TKFs are predicted by a link prediction method in a directed network, which is suggested in this paper to represent the direction of the predicted TKFs by adapting the concept of bibliographic coupling and edge-betweenness centrality. Converging technological opportunities are proposed as incremental and radical technological opportunities by extracting the potential increased knowledge flow links and emerging knowledge flow links.

To evaluate our hypothesis, we captured a dataset of 40K RGB and 40K depth video sequences while a garment is being manipulated. We also conducted ablation studies to understand whether the neural network learns the physical and dynamic properties of garments. Our findings suggest that a modified AlexNet-LSTM architecture has the best classification performance for the garment's shape and weights. To further provide evidence that continuous perception facilitates the prediction of the garment's shapes and weights, we evaluated our network on unseen video sequences and computed the 'Moving Average' over a sequence of predictions.

Current guidelines recommend use of extended thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who have high risk of post-discharge venous thromboembolism and low risk of bleeding. We aimed to report our experience regarding different low-molecular-weight heparins administered post-discharge in a COVID-19 patient population with high-thromboembolic and low-bleeding risk. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Consecutive patients admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 16 and July 16, 2020, were assessed for enrollment. Patients were included if they received prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparins after discharge, were 18 years of age, and completed follow-up. Pregnant women, children <18 years of age, patients with intensive care unit admission, and patients who experienced venous and/or arterial thromboembolism prior to discharge were excluded. Extended thromboprophylaxis with either enoxaparin 4000 IU once daily or bemiparin 3500 IU once daily was prescribed if a patient had a modified IMPROVE VTE score of 4, or a modified IMPROVE score of 2 and a D-dimer level of 2 times the reference range. Patients were followed-up for 30 days after discharge. Primary endpoint was occurrence of radiologically confirmed symptomatic venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism). Results: A total of 3498 consecutive patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of them, 38 (20 women) received extended thromboprophylaxis. Mean of age was 66.615.7 years. Twenty-five patients received enoxaparin, and 13 received bemiparin.

However, treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that are directed at specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) may not work well against all strains of the virus. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a therapy based on multiple treatments is needed for COVID-19 patients and to bring the pandemic to an end.

In addition, the proposed therapy (CAT + PAT in OSCAR), which works by a more general physical and chemical mechanism, should work well with other treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that target specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) to provide a safe and effective multiple therapy approach for ending the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","output":"A multiple therapy hypothesis for treatment of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the Coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak, most studies have focused on etiopathogenic aspects and treatment strategies.

Methods: Monocentric investigator-initiated pilot longitudinal observational study conducted by the Association Naso Sano, on a cohort of 30 COVID recovered patients based in the Umbria region, followed up from April to June 2020 for baseline blood counts, IgM and IgG trends using two different serological assays-ELISA and CLIA. The demographics, blood group, co-morbidities and treatment modalities were recorded from each patient along with an analysis of clinical profile, dates concerning symptom onset, first positive and two consecutive negative swabs using an online questionnaire followed by serological testing. Descriptive and Bivariate (Pearson correlation coefficient) statistics were conducted to detect statistically significant correlations. Findings: The study involved 30 patients with a M:F ratio of 0.57 and a distribution of mild (67%), moderate (30%) and critical (3%). Majority of the patients were healthcare workers (40%) and the mean viral shedding duration was 20.13 +/- 6.17 days. The IgG levels offered long-standing protection as long as 3 months in some cases.

A recent well drilled in this region demonstrated that with proper buy-in from the Operator, Constant Bottomhole Pressure (CBHP) Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) could be the answer when planned and executed correctly. This paper drives the point that MPD is more than simply dropping chokes on location. Prior to drilling the well, the Operator initiated the communication very early with the MPD service provider and created an avenue to reduce the projected mud weight and develop a detailed CBHP MPD plan with a Pressurized Mudcap Drilling (PMCD) contingency. The anticipated challenges on this well were: High-pressure gas fractures, formation instability/shale breakout, severe/total loss of returns, inability to reach Target Depth, and casing/cementing issues. The Operator took time and worked with the new MPD service provider to carefully design and plan a new well (referred to as 'Y1' in this document), which helped execute the MPD part of the project within 30 days. In contrast, the MPD execution on a previous well (referred to as 'X2' in this document) with the older MPD service provider took more than 90 days. MPD execution on the new MPD well included dynamic influx management and loss mitigation, and understanding of the petro-physical conditions to reach the target.

Although it looks like a natural and effective solution for a fair assessment of student online learning performance, the authors argue that proctoring technologies are rooted in problematic assumptions about educational fairness and authoritarian pedagogical approaches. The authors have conducted a qualitative case study in a large-sized, top-tier university in South Korea to investigate the negative impacts of adopting proctoring technologies on student subjectivities, pedagogical relationships and educational outcomes, which have not been fully discussed in previous studies. By utilising Foucault's theorisation of disciplinary governmentality, the authors effectively demonstrate that the binary subjectification of students as cheaters and the cheated has degraded the value of student engagement in university education whilst creating more competitive and distrusting relationships amongst students and between students and teachers. Nevertheless, without challenging the unethical consequences of online proctoring technologies or fundamentally unfair social and educational systems, students willingly accept and adopt them as docile bodies, which has led to educational deterioration rather than innovation. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There is an increasing number of online exam proctoring technologies available with advanced technical features. During the coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, many universities have adopted online exam proctoring technologies with exam-related policies and regulations to stop student cheating behaviours. Previous studies have discussed both advantages and disadvantages of adopting online exam proctoring technologies, including specific ethical concerns. What this paper adds Online exam proctoring technologies are deeply rooted in problematic educational approaches such as teacher-centred knowledge transmission. The adoption of online exam proctoring technologies has produced negative impacts on student subjectivities, pedagogical relationships and educational outcomes. Focusing on student cheating as an individual and interpersonal problem neglects the more fundamental issue of social and educational inequality. Implications for practice and/or policy The negative consequences and damages created by the adoption of online exams and online exam proctoring technologies need to be carefully reflected. The notion of academic fairness needs to be approached with a broader perspective, considering the different social and academic circumstances each student is in. It is essential to critically engage students with the broader conversation about educational fairness to develop them as critical thinkers and future leaders in their chosen fields. ? 2022 The Authors.

Thus, it is essential to determine how we can reuse respirators and other personal protective equipment in these urgent times. We investigated multiple commonly used disinfection schemes on media with particle filtration efficiency of 95%. Heating was recently found to inactivate the virus in solution within 5 min at 70 C and is among the most scalable, user-friendly methods for viral disinfection. We found that heat (85 C) under various humidities (100% relative humidity, RH) was the most promising, nondestructive method for the preservation of filtration properties in meltblown fabrics as well as N95-grade respirators. At 85 C, 30% RH, we were able to perform 50 cycles of heat treatment without significant changes in the filtration efficiency. At low humidity or dry conditions, temperatures up to 100 C were not found to alter the filtration efficiency significantly within 20 cycles of treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was a secondary choice, which was able to withstand 10 cycles of treatment and showed small degradation by 20 cycles. However, UV can potentially impact the material strength and subsequent sealing of respirators. Finally, treatments involving liquids and vapors require caution, as steam, alcohol, and household bleach all may lead to degradation of the filtration efficiency, leaving the user vulnerable to the viral aerosols.","output":"Can N95 Respirators Be Reused after Disinfection?

Using the Transactional Theory of Stress, the authors investigate the impact of a TEL environment on students' stress, cognitive appraisal and coping. The authors also explore how the TEL environment impacts students' learning satisfaction and performance. Design/methodology/approach: A survey using Qualtrics was developed to collect the data from 275 undergraduate students. The authors used the Partial Least Squares (PLS) through SmartPLS for instrument validation and testing of the structural model. The reflective-formative model was applied as the measures used to evaluate the first-order constructs are unidimensional, and the second-order construct has a formative measurement. Findings: Students experienced technology-related stress due to ICT use. The negative appraisal such as harm and threat leads to emotion-focused coping among students, while the constructive appraisal such as positive and challenge leads to problem-focused coping. Emotion-focused coping was found to negatively impact learning satisfaction, while problem-focused coping was found to positively impact satisfaction. The authors also found that students with a higher level of experience with online and hybrid classes, higher confidence in computer usage and lower anxiety are better equipped to deal with technostress. Research limitations/implications: This study provides the first comprehensive technostress model in the IS literature that uses formative modeling to explain technostress creators and inhibitors and emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping, as was intended by the Transactional Theory of Stress.

In the presence of AcT and its two substrates, propylene glycol diacetate and H(2)O(2), sufficient and continuous PAA is generated over an extended time to kill a wide range of bacteria with the enzyme dissolved in aqueous buffer. For extended self-disinfection, however, active and stable AcT bound onto or incorporated into a surface coating is necessary. In the current study, an active, stable and reusable AcT-based coating was developed by incorporating AcT into a polydopamine (PDA) matrix in a single step, thereby forming a biocatalytic composite onto a variety of surfaces. The resulting AcT-PDA composite coatings on glass, metal and epoxy surfaces yielded up to 7-log reduction of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when in contact with the biocatalytic coating. This composite coating also possessed potent antiviral activity, and dramatically reduced the infectivity of a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus within minutes. The single-step approach enables rapid and facile fabrication of enzyme-based disinfectant composite coatings with high activity and stability, which enables reuse following surface washing. As a result, this enzyme-polymer composite technique may serve as a general strategy for preparing antibacterial and antiviral surfaces for applications in health care and common infrastructure safety, such as in schools, the workplace, transportation, etc.","output":"Facile fabrication of antibacterial and antiviral perhydrolase-polydopamine composite coatings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Metformin exerts anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. We addressed the impact of prior metformin use on prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: CORONADO is a nationwide observational study that included patients with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 between March 10 and April 10, 2020 in 68 French centres. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days of admission. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was reported for death up to day 28. The association between metformin use and outcomes was then estimated in a logistic regression analysis after applying a propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting approach. RESULTS: Among the 2449 patients included, 1496 were metformin users and 953 were not. Compared with non-users, metformin users were younger with a lower prevalence of diabetic complications, but had more severe features of COVID-19 on admission. The primary endpoint occurred in 28.0% of metformin users (vs 29.0% in non-users, P = 0.6134) on day 7 and in 32.6% (vs 38.7%, P = 0.0023) on day 28. The mortality rate was lower in metformin users on day 7 (8.2 vs 16.1%, P < 0.0001) and on day 28 (16.0 vs 28.6%, P < 0.0001). After propensity score weighting was applied, the odds ratios for primary outcome and death (OR [95%CI], metformin users vs non-users) were 0.838 [0.649?1.082] and 0.688 [0.470?1.007] on day 7, then 0.783 [0.615?0.996] and 0.710 [0.537?0.938] on day 28, respectively.

Health care providers are overwhelmed, resulting in clinical teams spread more thinly. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing an app-based remote patient monitoring system (Huma Therapeutics) on a clinicians workload in the context of a COVID-19Cspecific virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A prospective feasibility study was carried out over 1 month where clinician workload was monitored, and full-time equivalents savings were determined. An NHS hospital repurposed a telephone-based respiratory virtual ward for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in the amber zone (according to the National Health Service definition) were monitored for 14 days postdischarge to help identify deteriorating patients earlier. A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). RESULTS: In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). Digital remote patient monitoring resulted in a reduction in the number of phone calls from a mean total of 9 calls to 4 calls over the monitoring period. There was no change in the mean duration of phone calls (8.5 minutes) and no reports of readmission or mortality. These results equate to a mean saving of 47.60 working hours. Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data. Individual clinicians spent an average of 10.9 minutes per day reviewing data. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based remote patient monitoring technologies may offer tangible reductions in clinician workload at a time when service is severely strained. In this small-scale pilot study, we demonstrated the economic and operational impact that digital remote patient monitoring technology can have in improving working efficiency and reducing operational costs. Although this particular RPM solution was deployed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may set a precedent for wider utilization of digital, remote patient monitoring solutions in other clinical scenarios where increased care delivery efficiency is sought.","output":"Mobile AppCBased Remote Patient Monitoring in Acute Medical Conditions: Prospective Feasibility Study Exploring Digital Health Solutions on Clinical Workload During the COVID Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The nCOVID-19 pandemic initiated its course of contagion from the city of Wuhan and now it has spread all over the globe.

Although there is little doubt that microbes are critically involved in the pathogenesis of NEC, the identity of specific causative pathogens remains elusive. Unlike established normal adult gut microbiota, which is quite complex, uniform, and stable, early postnatal bacterial populations are simple, diverse, and fluid. These properties complicate studies aimed at elucidating characteristics of the gut microbiome that may play a role in the pathogenesis of NEC. A broad variety of bacterial, viral, and fungal species have been implicated in both clinical and experimental NEC. Frequently, however, the same species have also been found in physiologically matched healthy individuals. Clustered outbreaks of NEC, in which the same strain of a suspected pathogen is detected in several patients suggest, but do not prove, a causative relationship between the specific pathogen and the disease. Studies in Cronobacter sakazakii, the best characterized NEC pathogen, have demonstrated that virulence is not a property of a bacterial species as a whole, but rather a characteristic of certain strains, which may explain why the same species can be pathogenic or non-pathogenic. The fact that a given microbe may be innocuous in a full-term, yet pathogenic in a pre-term infant has led to the idea of opportunistic pathogens in NEC. Progress in understanding the infectious nature of NEC may require identifying specific pathogenic strains and unambiguously establishing their virulence in animal models.","output":"The Role of the Intestinal Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Necrotizing Enterocolitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.

RESULTS: 127 patients with P. marneffei infection were identified. All were HIV-infected; median CD4+ T-cell count was 24 cells/l (IQR:12-48); 76% were men. Common clinical features were fever (92.9%), skin lesions (82.6%), hepatomegaly (61.4%), lymphadenopathy (40.2%), weight loss (59.1%) and cough (49.6%).

Standard small molecule drug discovery workflows that start with library screens are an impractical path forward given the timelines to discover, develop, and test clinically. To accelerate the time to patient testing, here we explored the therapeutic potential of small molecule drugs that have been tested to some degree in a clinical environment, including approved medications, as possible therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. Motivating our process is a concept termed polypharmacology, i.e. off-target interactions that may hold therapeutic potential. In this work, we used Ligand Design, our deep learning drug design platform, to interrogate the polypharmacological profiles of an internal collection of small molecule drugs with federal approval or going through clinical trials, with the goal of identifying molecules predicted to modulate targets relevant for COVID-19 treatment. Resulting from our efforts is PolypharmDB, a resource of drugs and their predicted binding of protein targets across the human proteome. Mining PolypharmDB yielded molecules predicted to interact with human and viral drug targets for COVID-19, including host proteins linked to viral entry and proliferation and key viral proteins associated with the virus life-cycle. Further, we assembled a collection of prioritized approved drugs for two specific host-targets, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin B, whose joint inhibition was recently shown to block SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells. Overall, we demonstrate that our approach facilitates rapid response, identifying 30 prioritized candidates for testing for their possible use as anti-COVID drugs. Using the PolypharmDB resource, it is possible to identify repurposed drug candidates for newly discovered targets within a single work day.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancers from 2016-2020 were identified using the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Cancer Registry. Baseline patient characteristics, demographics, and clinical information were gathered and cross-referenced with our electronic medical record. Late-stage disease was defined as initial anatomic stage III-IV disease in the AJCC 8th edition staging system. The control cohort consisted of patients diagnosed from 2016-2019;patients diagnosed in 2020 were the test cohort. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare monthly distributions in stage at diagnosis between the control and test cohorts. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. Results: There were 1597 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2016-2019 and 333 in 2020. Median age at diagnosis was 60 years;99% were female, and 69.1% were white. Mammography was limited from 3/16/20-6/8/20, with 90% reduction in volume during this time.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of substance use and associated factors during the Covid-19 pandemic among school adolescents of west hararghe, Eastern Ethiopia to guide possible intervention and public policy. Methods: A School-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from 10 to 30, October 2021. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 788 students from ten public secondary schools in the West Hararge zone, Eastern Ethiopia. The data were collected using a self-administered pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Data was entered into Epidata version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 26 software for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done. Multi variables binary logistic regression was done and a p-value less than 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. Results : In this study, the response rate of 98.46% were complete fill the questionnaires. More than 1 in 2 of the adolescent students were self-reported substances (alcohol, khat (Catha edulis) and/or cigarette) users (prevalence = 58.6%) during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Currently, the novel coronavirus has spread to most countries in the world, and its impact on the public is also increasing. As a high-risk group in direct contact with the virus, medical workers should be monitored, and their mental health deserves extensive attention. The aim of this study was to explore the mental health of medical workers facing the novel coronavirus and the main factors affecting it. Methods: The present cross-sectional study including 2,100 eligible individuals from 1,050 hospitals in China was conducted through the network platform powered by www.wjx.cn, a platform providing functions equivalent to Amazon Mechanical Turk. We used a self-designed questionnaire to collect demographic information and data on mental states, including gender, age (years), educational level, job rank, body and mind reaction, cognition of risk, and the judgment of the epidemic situation. Independent samples t-tests and one-way (ANOVA) analysis were carried out to compare the differences in the mental reactions according to the demographic and psychological states of the participants. Results: There were 502 males (23.9%) and 1,598 females (76.1%). The participants reported feeling calm (39.1%), tense (63.0%), scared (31.4%), angry (18.8%), sad (49.0%), afraid (34.7%), optimistic (5.1%), impressed (65.0%), and confident (31.1%) during the epidemic. At the same time, the psychological stress responses of medical staff were significantly different according to the levels of exposure in their environments, duration and personal experience.

Patients and Methods: Data on profiles and medical history of all confirmed COVID-19 patients in the past 1 year were extracted from the Korean National Health Insurance System's claims database to assess risk factors for ICU admission and ventilator use. We used a time-series epidemic model to estimate the ICU census in Daegu from the reported hospital data. Findings: Multivariate regression analysis revealed male sex, old age, and residing in Daegu city as significant risk factors for ICU admission. The number of patients requiring ICU admission exceeded the bed capacity across all Daegu hospitals before March 9, 2020, and therefore, critically ill patients were transferred to nearby hospitals outside Daegu. This finding was consistent with our prediction that the ICU census in Daegu would peak on March 16, 2020, at 160 through mitigation efforts, without which it would have reached 300 by late March 2020.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data between 25 August and 30 September 2020 among CALD communities in Greater Western Sydney. Information was collected on respondents experiences in selected livelihood items, including housing, finances, safety, accessing social services and activities, finding work, food, clothing, and relationships during COVID-19 and the pandemics perceived impact on their lives. Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-eight participants were included in the study, 45.5% male and 54.5% female. Many respondents reported their experience in the selected livelihood items as worse during COVID-19 at the time of the study. The feeling of safety was most disrupted, with 56% of respondents rating their experience as worse. This experience was followed by accessing social support group activities, with 50% of respondents stating their experience of using this service had worsened. The experience of accessing social services and financial situation was rated as worse by 41% of respondents. Experience in finding work, housing, and attending schools were all rated as worse. The median perceived impact of COVID-19 among respondents who rated their experience in the selected livelihood items as worse were statistically higher than those who rated their experience as the same. Respondents characteristics also predicted the perceived impact of COVID-19. Unemployed respondents were 3.53 (95% CI: 1.16C10.73, p = 0.026) times more likely to perceive the impact of COVID-19 on their lives as high compared to employed respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The finding demonstrates that the high number of respondents had the same situation as before COVID-19 and highlights the level of resilience exhibited by CALD communities in the Australian context. It also suggests that services in Australia were good during the pandemic. However, enhanced policy and initiatives designed to meet the CALD populations needs are required, particularly in the areas most reported to have been disrupted by changes associated with COVID-19.

Strict restrictions in terms of visiting hours and the number of visitors have made it difficult to arrange in-person family conferences. Phone-based telehealth consultations may be a solution, but the lack of nonverbal cues may diminish the clinician-patient relationship. In this context, video-based, smartphone-enabled family conferences have become important. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish a smartphone-enabled telehealth model for palliative care family conferences. Our model integrates principles from the concept of shared decision making (SDM) and the value, acknowledge, listen, understand, and elicit (VALUE) approach. METHODS: Family conferences comprised three phases designed according to telehealth implementation guidelinesthe previsit, during-visit, and postvisit phases. We incorporated the following SDM elements into the model: team talk, option talk, and decision talk. The model has been implemented at a national cancer treatment center in Taiwan since February 2020. RESULTS: From February to April 2020, 14 telehealth family conferences in the palliative care unit were analyzed. The patients mean age was 73 (SD 10.1) years; 6 out of 14 patients (43%) were female and 12 (86%) were married. The primary caregiver joining the conference virtually comprised mostly of spouses and children (n=10, 71%). The majority of participants were terminally ill patients with cancer (n=13, 93%), with the exception of 1 patient with stroke. Consensus on care goals related to discharge planning and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments was reached in 93% (n=13) of cases during the family conferences. In total, 5 families rated the family conferences as good or very good (36%), whereas 9 were neutral (64%). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-enabled telehealth for palliative care family conferences with SDM and VALUE integration demonstrated high satisfaction for families. In most cases, it was effective in reaching consensus on care decisions.

CASE REPORT In this report, we present the case of a young patient in New York City who presented to our hospital with coronavirus disease 2019-induced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that progressed to ARDS and subsequent death. The patient was managed for DKA on presentation with insulin protocol and acidosis management. However, it became evident that he had underlying respiratory complications, which later presented as ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS We recommend that clinicians be aware of this potentially fatal complication in all patients with pre-existing diabetes. Simultaneously, a low threshold for intubation should be advocated for patients with concurrent COVID-19 and type I diabetes mellitus since the potential for poor clinical outcomes from respiratory demise may be lessened by early respiratory intervention.","output":"COVID-19-Induced Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in an Obese 24-Year-Old Type I Diabetic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 presents many challenges to healthcare systems and infrastructures across the world, exacerbating inequalities and leaving the world's most vulnerable populations most affected.

Non-pharmaceutical public health interventions can be used to mitigate transmission, and modeling efforts can provide crucial insights on the potential effectiveness of such interventions to help inform decision making processes. In this paper we present an agent-based modeling approach to simulating the spread of disease in refugee and IDP settlements. The model, based on the JUNE open-source framework, is informed by data on geography, demographics, comorbidities, physical infrastructure and other parameters obtained from real-world observations and previous literature. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics tool which allows decision makers to distill insights by comparing the results of different simulations and scenarios. Through simulating their effects on the epidemiological development of COVID-19, we evaluate several public health interventions ranging from increasing mask wearing compliance to the reopening of learning institutions.

Therefore, this manuscript aims to identify and describe the scientific literature addressing COVID-19 from a dental research perspective, in terms of the manuscript origin, research domain, study type, and level of evidence (LoE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. A descriptive analysis of bibliographic data, collaboration network, and keyword co-occurrence analysis were performed. Articles were further classified according to the field of interest, main research question, type of study, and LoE. RESULTS: The present study identified 296 dental scientific COVID-19 original papers, published in 89 journals, and co-authored by 1331 individuals affiliated with 429 institutions from 53 countries. Although 81.4% were single-country papers, extensive collaboration among the institutions of single countries (Italian, British, and Brazilian institutions) was observed. The main research areas were as follows: the potential use of saliva and other oral fluids as promising samples for COVID-19 testing, dental education, and guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission in dental practice. The majority of articles were narrative reviews, cross-sectional studies, and short communications. The overall LoE in the analyzed dental literature was low, with only two systematic reviews with the highest LoE I. CONCLUSION: The dental literature on the COVID-19 pandemic does not provide data relevant to the evidence-based decision-making process. Future studies with a high LoE are essential to gain precise knowledge on COVID-19 infection within the various fields of Dentistry.

When an unruptured cerebral aneurysm is diagnosed, the physician has to decide about the treatment method. Often more giant aneurysms are diagnosed at higher risk of rupture and are candidates for intervention. However, several clinical and morphological parameters are introduced as risk factors. Therefore, some small size aneurysms with a higher growth rate and rupture risk may be missed. Nowadays, computational models and artificial intelligence can help physicians make more precise decisions, not only according to the aneurysm size. Therefore, the target can be developing a tool that receives the patient history and medical images as input and gives the aneurysm growth rate and rupture risk as output. Achieving this target can be possible by developing a proper computational growth model and using artificial intelligence. This requires knowledge of the vascular microstructure and the procedure of disease development, including degradation and remodeling mechanisms. Moreover, geometrical and clinical risk factors should also be recognized and considered. The present article is a step-by-step indication of this concept. In this paper, first, a review of different computational growth models is presented. Then, the morphological and clinical risk factors are described, and at last, the methods of combining the computational growth models with machine learning are discussed.

Unfortunately, this young part of the population and, most of the time, their parents are often unaware of SCTs far-reaching capacities and limitations. The capabilities and constraints of SCTs create severe side effects at the technical, individual, and societal level. These side effects are often unforeseeable and unexpected. They arise from the technology's use and the interconnected nature of the IoToys, without necessarily involving malevolence from their creators. Although existing regulations and new ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence provide remedies to address some of the side effects, policymakers did not develop these redress mechanisms having children and SCTs in mind.

However, nAb response against SARS-CoV-2, when present, decays rapidly. Given the myriad roles of antibodies in immune responses, it is possible that antibodies could also mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 via effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which we sought to explore here. METHODS: Plasma of 3 uninfected controls and 20 subjects exposed to, or recovering from, SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in the plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing capability of these plasmas was assessed with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. ADCC activity was assessed with a calcein release assay. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in all COVID-19 subjects studied. All but three COVID-19 subjects contained nAb at high potency (>80% neutralization). Plasma from 19/20 of COVID-19 subjects also demonstrated strong ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including two individuals without nAb against SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: This study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the p-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes. Results: For the 27,036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working and restricting eating and drinking at personal workspaces were implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 15% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all p-values < .001).

METHODS: In total, 21 patients who received autologous or allogeneic HCT for hematological malignancies were screened from April 30, 2020, to July 15, 2020. The telehealth platform assisted in the daily collection of vital signs as well as physical and psychological symptoms for two weeks after hospital discharge. The required medical devices (oximeter and blood pressure monitor) were given to patients and a dedicated smartphone app was developed to collect this data. The data were reviewed daily through web-based software by a hematologist specializing in HCT. RESULTS: Only 12 of 21 patients were able to join and complete the study. Technological barriers were the most frequent limiting factor in this study. Among the 12 patients who completed the study, adherence to data reporting was high.

Limited diagnostic methods hampered the infection control. Since the direct detection of virus mainly by RT-PCR may cause false-negative outcome, host response-dependent testing may serve as a complementary approach for improving COVID-19 diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: Our study discovered a highly-preserved transcriptional profile of Type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent genes for COVID-19 complementary diagnosis. METHODS: Computational language R-dependent machine learning was adopted for mining highly-conserved transcriptional profile (RNA-sequencing) across heterogeneous samples infected by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. The transcriptomics/high-throughput sequencing data were retrieved from NCBI-GEO datasets (GSE32155, GSE147507, GSE150316, GSE162835, GSE163151, GSE171668, GSE182569). Mathematical approaches for homological analysis were as follows: adjusted rand index-related similarity analysis, geometric and multi-dimensional data interpretation, UpsetR, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Besides, Interferome Database was used for predicting the transcriptional factors possessing IFN-I promoter-binding sites to the key IFN-I genes for COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: In this study, we identified a highly-preserved gene module between SARS-CoV-2 infected nasal swab and postmortem lung tissue regulating IFN-I signaling for COVID-19 complementary diagnosis, in which the following 14 IFN-I-stimulated genes are highly-conserved, including BST2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, ISG15, MX1, MX2, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL, RSAD2, and STAT1. The stratified severity of COVID-19 may also be identified by the transcriptional level of these 14 IFN-I genes. CONCLUSION: Using transcriptional and computational analysis on RNA-seq data retrieved from NCBI-GEO, we identified a highly-preserved 14-gene transcriptional profile regulating IFN-I signaling in nasal swab and postmortem lung tissue infected by SARS-CoV-2. Such a conserved biosignature involved in IFN-I-related host response may be leveraged for COVID-19 diagnosis.","output":"Transcriptional Profiling and Machine Learning Unveil a Concordant Biosignature of Type I Interferon-Inducible Host Response Across Nasal Swab and Pulmonary Tissue for COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is known to be concentrated in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cells in vitro in the form of phosphorylated derivatives.

Mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation is widely used for this purpose. In select patients, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be an alternative to invasive ventilation or may complement respiratory management. NIV is used to provide ventilatory support and increase gas exchange at the alveolar level without the use of an invasive artificial airway such as an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. NIV includes both continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Indications for NIV range from acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the intensive care unit or the emergency department, to chronic respiratory failure in patients with neuromuscular disease with nocturnal hypoventilation. In the perioperative setting, NIV is commonly applied as CPAP, and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). There are limited data on the role of NIV in children in the perioperative setting, and there are no clear guidelines regarding optimal timing of use and pressure settings of perioperative NIV. Contraindications to the use of NIV include reduced level of consciousness, apnea, severe respiratory distress, and inability to maintain upper airway patency or airway protective reflexes. Common problems encountered during NIV involve airway leaks and asynchrony with auto-triggering. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has emerged as an alternative to NIV when trying to decrease the work of breathing and improve oxygenation in children. HFNO delivers humidified and heated oxygen at rates between 2-70 L/min using specific nasal cannulas, and flows are determined by the patient's weight and clinical needs. HFNO can be useful as a method for preoxygenation in infants and children by prolonging apnea time before desaturation, yet in children with decreased minute ventilation or apnea HFNO does not improve alveolar gas exchange.

METHODS: Feasibility was evaluated by patient adherence as accomplishment of at least 4 out of 6 supervised yoga-PE sessions along with 70% or more at-home yoga sessions. Intervention (12 weeks) included two 6-weeks periods: P1 comprising one 90-minutes supervised yoga-PE session/week and 15-minutes daily at-home yoga and P2, daily autonomous at-home yoga sessions. Evaluations (at inclusion and by the end of each period) consisted in assessment of OAP on Visual Analog Scale (VAS), forward flexibility (cm) and patient satisfaction on Likert (0-10 points) scale. RESULTS: Between September 2018 and May 2019 we included 24 patients of median 53 years (range 36-72). Feasibility was validated by 83% successful adherence rate.

In this study, we evaluated the performance and generalizability of a deep-learning-based image-quality enhancement algorithm applied to fourfold reduced-count whole-body PET in a realistic clinical oncologic imaging environment with multiple blinded readers, institutions, and scanner types. We demonstrate that the low-count-enhanced scans were noninferior to the standard scans in DIQ (p < 0.05) and overall diagnostic confidence (p < 0.001) independent of the underlying PET scanner used. Lesion detection for the low-count-enhanced scans had a high patient-level sensitivity of 0.94 (0.83C0.99) and specificity of 0.98 (0.95C0.99). Interscan kappa agreement of 0.85 was comparable to intrareader (0.88) and pairwise inter-reader agreements (maximum of 0.72).

Here, we evaluated the subsets, phenotypic and functional characteristics of natural killer (NK) and T cells in patients with COVID-19 and their associations with disease severity. Methods: Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients enrolled in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 25 to February 27, 2020, were collected and analyzed. The phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells and T cells subsets in circulating blood and serum levels of cytokines were analyzed via flow cytometry. Then the LASSO logistic regression model was employed to predict risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. Results: The counts and percentages of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NKT cells were significantly reduced in patients with severe symptoms. The cytotoxic CD3-CD56dimCD16+ cell population significantly decreased, while the CD3-CD56dimCD16- part significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients. More importantly, elevated expression of regulatory molecules, such as CD244 and programmed death-1 (PD-1), on NK cells and T cells, as well as decreased serum cytotoxic effector molecules including perforin and granzyme A, were detected in patients with COVID-19. The serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in severe patients. Moreover, the CD3-CD56dimCD16- cells were screened out as an influential factor in severe cases by LASSO logistic regression.

Infection is ubiquitous in infancy and induces inflammation, a key cardiometabolic risk factor, but the relationship between infection, inflammation, and metabolic profiles in early childhood remains unexplored. We investigated relationships between infection and plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles at age 12 months, and mediation of theseassociations by inflammation.Methods: Matched infection, metabolomics and lipidomics data were generated from 555 infants in a pre-birth longitudinal cohort. Infection data from birth to 12 months were parent-reported (total infections at age 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), inflammation markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, hsCRP); glycoprotein acetyls GlycA) were quantified at 12 months. Metabolic profiles were 12-month plasma nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (228 metabolites) and liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry lipidomics (776 lipids). Associations were evaluated with multivariable linear regression models. Results: Frequent infant infections were associated with adverse metabolomic (elevated inflammation markers, triglycerides, phenylalanine, and lower HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, and omega-3 fatty acids) and lipidomic profiles (elevated phosphatidylethanolamines and lower hexosylceramides, trihexosylceramides, and cholesteryl esters). Similar, more marked, profiles were observed with higher GlycA, but not hsCRP. GlycA, but not hsCRP, mediated a substantial proportion of the relationship between infection and metabolome/lipidome. Conclusions: Infants with a greater infection burden from birth to 12 months had pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic plasma metabolomic/lipid profiles, indicative of heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes in adults. These findings suggest potentially modifiable pathways linking early life infection and inflammation with subsequent cardiometabolic risk.Funding: The establishment work and infrastructure for the BIS was provided by the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Deakin University and Barwon Health.

BACKGROUND Short-term symptomatic results of LPHR are often excellent. However, a high recurrence rate is detected at objective radiographic follow-up. METHODS Retrospective review of a prospectively gathered database of consecutive patients undergoing LPHR with and without reinforced crural repair at a single institution. Subjective and objective outcomes were assessed by using a structured symptoms questionnaire, Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index, satisfaction score, and barium esophagogram. RESULTS From September 1991 to September 2005, LPHR was performed in 85 patients (median age, 66 years) with (25 patients) and without (60 patients) reinforced crural repair. Two patients (3%) underwent laparoscopic reoperation, for severe dysphagia and for symptomatic recurrence, respectively. Subjective outcome, available for 64 patients (75%), improved significantly at median follow-up of 118 months with a postoperative median Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index score of 116. Radiographic recurrence (median follow-up, 99 months) occurred in 23 (66%) of the 35 patients, independently of age at operation, type of paresophageal hiatal hernias, and crural reinforcement, and showed no impact on quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Although providing excellent symptomatic results, long-term objective evaluation of LPHR reveals a high recurrence rate even with reinforced cruroplasty. A tailored, lengthening gastroplasty and reinforced cruroplasty based on objective intraoperative evaluation, and not only on surgeon's personal judgment, may be the answer to recurrences.","output":"Laparoscopic repair of paraesophageal hernia.

The WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic or public health emergency because of its morbidity and mortality. Several inflammatory markers have been used in the initial diagnosis, as well as prognostic markers in disease progression. One of the inflammatory markers is C reactive protein. The other markers that help in prognosis are ferritin, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, CT scan of the lung, IL6 (interleukin 6), RT PCR is reliable diagnostic evidence. Aim of the study: 1. The aim is to determine the C-reactive protein, CT (Computerised Tomography) scan of the lung, RT PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction) in COVID -19 patients. 2. To compare CRP & CT scan values of the lung in various age groups. A cross-sectional study was done from September 2020 to January 2021 and the results were analysed. Out of 704 covid positive patients, the maximum number of patients were in the age group between 31 to 70. The RT PCR showed COVID positive results in 689 (97.8%) patients. The CRP values were found to be >25mg/l from 31-50 (34.7%) years and in 51-70 years of age (52%). In comparison of CT scan with CRP changes, CRP values were found to be raised when there is 25-50% (24.5%) and >50% (27.6%) involvement of lung by COVID. CT scan lung involvement was >50% in the age group between 31-50 (38.9%) and 51-70 (50%), respectively. High CRP values of >25mg/l were observed with the same age group 34.7% with the group of 31-50 and 52% with the group of 51-70, respectively.

Abnormal ncRNAs have been verified to be involved in potential metastasis via modulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition progression and are vital for the progression of cancers. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) are a vital indicator of whether cancer patients will benefit from immunotherapy. Nonetheless, the association between ceRNAs and immune cells remained largely unclear. We used the ceRNA network combined with TICs for the prediction of the clinical outcome of GC patients based on TCGA datasets. The percentage of immunocytes in GC was speculated by the use of CIBERSORT. Via Lasso and multivariate assays, prognostic models were established applying survival-related genes and immune cells. Nomograms were developed, and the accuracy of the nomograms was determined using calibration curves. The association between ceRNAs and TICs was validated by the use of integration analysis. In this study, there were 2219 mRNAs (1308 increased and 911 decreased), 171 lncRNAs (51 decreased and 120 increased), and 123 miRNAs (55 decreased and 68 increased) differentially expressed between tumor groups and nontumor groups. Five lncRNAs, six miRNAs, and 64 mRNAs were used for ceRNA network construction. Eight genes including LOX, SPARC, MASTL, PI15, BMPR1B, ANKRD13B, PVT1, and miR-7-5p were applied for the development of the prognostic model. Survival assays suggested that tumor cases with high risk exhibited a shorter overall survival. In addition, we included T-cell CD4 memory activated, monocytes, and neutrophils for the development of a prognosis model. Eventually, our team demonstrated the possible associations between the ceRNA prognosis model and prognostic model based on immune cells. To sum up, the ceRNA network could be used for gene regulation and predict clinical outcomes of GC patients.","output":"Integrated Analysis of miR-7-5p-Related ceRNA Network Reveals Potential Biomarkers for the Clinical Outcome of Gastric Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This observational study was conducted to determine the prevalence and correlates of wearing masks at a large Midwestern US university during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Various types of interactions between surfactant and virus are important, and they act on different components of a virus such as the lipid envelope, membrane (envelope) proteins and nucleo-capsid proteins. Accordingly, this cannot be a detailed account of all relevant aspects, but instead a summary that bridges between the different disciplines. We describe concepts and cover a selection of the relevant literature as an incentive for diving deeper into the relevant material. Our focus is on more recent developments around the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, applications of surfactants against the virus, and on the potential future use of surfactants for pandemic relief. However, we also cover the most important aspects of the historical development of using surfactants in combatting virus infections. We conclude that surfactants are already playing very important roles in various directions of defence against viruses, either directly, as in disinfection, or as carrier components of drug delivery systems for prophylaxis or treatment. By designing tailor-made surfactants and, consequently, advanced formulations, one can expect a more and more effective use of surfactants, either directly as antiviral compounds or as part of more complex formulations.","output":"Surfactants - compounds for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pregnant women display a higher risk of progression to disease and higher viral loads during infections due to their more permissive, tolerogenic immune system.

Comparative analyses of data by gender, age-groups and height of falls were performed to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients, and in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 4040 patients with fall-related injuries were identified in the study duration which corresponds to the rate of 2.34 per 10,000 population. Although the rate of fall-related injuries decreased over the years, the average number of patients per year remained high accounting for 32% of the hospitalized patients with moderate to severe injuries. Most of the injuries affected the head (36%) followed by spines (29%) and chest (23%). Males were predominant (89%), more likely to fall at workplace, fall from a greater height and have polytrauma than females. The working age-group (20C59 years) constituted the majority of injured (73%) and were more likely to fall at workplace, and to fall from higher heights compared to the older adults who sustained more fall at home.

Comprehensive knowledge of FcRI regulation is thus required. We have identified a functional interaction between FcRI and CD13 in murine MCs. Antigen-triggered activation of IgE-loaded FcRI results in cocapping and cointernalization of CD13 and equivalent internalization rates of up to 40%. Cointernalization is not unspecific, because ligand-driven KIT internalization is not accompanied by CD13 internalization. Moreover, antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD13 causes IL-6 production in an FcRI-dependent manner. These data are indicative of a functional interaction between FcRI and CD13 on MCs. To determine the role of this interaction, CD13-deficient bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were analyzed. Intriguingly, antigen stimulation of CD13-deficient BMMCs results in significantly increased degranulation and proinflammatory cytokine production compared to wild-type cells. Furthermore, in a low-dose model of passive systemic anaphylaxis, antigen-dependent decrease in body temperature, reflecting the anaphylactic reaction, is substantially enhanced by the CD13 inhibitor bestatin (-5.9  0.6C) and by CD13 deficiency (-8.8  0.6C) in contrast to controls (-1.2  1.97C).

The predictions by HSVR were found to be in good agreement with the observed values for the molecules in the training set (n = 53, r(2) = 0.93, [Formula: see text] = 0.84, RMSE = 0.17, s = 0.08), test set (n = 13, q(2) = 0.75C0.89, RMSE = 0.26, s = 0.14), and even outlier set (n = 8, q(2) = 0.78C0.92, RMSE = 0.19, s = 0.09). The built HSVR model consistently met the most stringent criteria when subjected to various statistical assessments. A mock test also assured the predictivity of HSVR. Consequently, this HSVR model can be adopted to facilitate drug discovery and development.","output":"In Silico Prediction of Intestinal Permeability by Hierarchical Support Vector Regression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, a workflow for designing a bot using Robotic Process Automation (RPA), associated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is used for information extraction, classification, etc., is proposed.

For those with tinnitus, such changes can be factors in exacerbating tinnitus. The purpose of this study was to determine tinnitus help-seeking behavior, which resources individuals utilized to cope during the pandemic, and what additional support is desired. Method An exploratory cross-sectional study design including 1,522 adults with tinnitus living in North America (Canada and the United States) was used. Data were collected through an online survey distributed by the American Tinnitus Association via e-mail. Free text from open-ended questions was analyzed using the automated content analysis. The responses to the structured questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics. Results Significantly less tinnitus support was sought during the pandemic, and very few respondents utilized tinnitus support networks during the pandemic at the time the survey was conducted. Nonetheless, seeking support during the pandemic was significantly associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The most frequently utilized resources for coping during the pandemic were contacting family and friends, spending time outdoors or in nature, relaxation, and exercise. Such tools for coping were associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The support requested and advice provided by participants to health care services had overlap. The main support needs related to managing tinnitus included addressing hearing loss, providing peer support, finding cures, and accessing trained and understanding health care providers to help. The advice for professionals related to tinnitus management included the need for cures, personalized support, addressing hearing loss, targeting the tinnitus percept, and providing more information about the condition. Conclusions These findings provide suggestions on how to better support those with tinnitus at a time when health care is undergoing rapid changes. Findings can be used by stakeholders, clinical practitioners, and tinnitus support services to devise ways to work more effectively together to improve access to patient-driven, suitable, accessible, and evidence-based support.

Understanding patients hematologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to doing their prognosis, so adjusting care and improving outcomes. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim at summarizing changes in the hematopoietic system and hemostasis that occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection is often associated with laboratory hematologic features that can have important clinical implications. Careful revision of baseline hematologic data at diagnosis can predict the severity of illness and help clinicians tailoring the approach and management of patients whose condition can be guarded or critical. The levels of hematologic markers like D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, viral load, inflammatory cytokines, differential blood cell count, and peripheral smear are fundamental for the prognosis. Studies have also shown an association between some of these markers and severe COVID-19 infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit or complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, so far, a vaccine is not available, prevention of the infection is based on the avoiding people affected and the spreading of the virus; the treatment, in the absence of an effective antiviral agent, is symptomatic, and, in addition to oxygen support, finds in the anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulation fundamental therapeutic lines. According to the American Society of Hematology (ASH), all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis with LMWH.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patient: from a Hematologists Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 emergency is changing the competitive landscape by pushing companies to adapt to sudden change. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that want to survive must innovate their business. Antifragility represents the capability of a system to absorb shocks and get better, allowing it to overcome a crisis and improve its performance. The use of digital technologies by enterprises is expected to play an important role in building antifragility. The aim of this paper is to study how digital technologies can contribute to the development of antifragility in SMEs. This study analyzed the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis of six small and medium-sized enterprises located in Calabria, South of Italy. All the six enterprises have turned the crisis into a business opportunity developing new products, investing in marketing and communication, or starting new collaborations. The research identifies the factors leveraged by the investigated organizations that enabled this anti fragile behavior. They include slack financial resources, strategic agility, and relations with research institutions. The study highlights the positive impact of digital technologies in developing antifragility. Results were summarized into research propositions to be tested in future confirmatory studies. The findings of the study are useful for researchers interested in antifragility and digital technologies in SMEs.

Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first 30 days of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. METHODS A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from \\"day 0\\" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and continued for 30 days. We collected data on time to surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality, and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same 30-day period in 2018, 2019, and the previous 6 months (Control groups A, B, and C, respectively). RESULTS Forty-three patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P = 0.022), B (P = 0.003) and C (P = 0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our Study group was 26%. Of the 7 mortalities recorded, 4 patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection. In our Study group, COVID-19 infection correlated significantly with 30-day mortality (P = 0.002, odds ratio 2.4). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated a significant increase in 30-day mortality among hip fracture patients during the first 30 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.

Although complex between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 has been structurally resolved, the molecular details of the SARS-CoV-2 and TMPRSS2 complex are still elusive. TMPRSS2 is responsible for priming of the viral spike protein that entails cleavage of the spike protein at two potential sites, Arg685/Ser686 and Arg815/Ser816. The present study aims to investigate the conformational details of complex between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, in order to discern the finer details of the priming of viral spike and to point candidate drug targets. Briefly, full length structural model of TMPRSS2 was developed and docked against the resolved structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with directional restraints of both cleavage sites. The docking simulations showed that TMPRSS2 interacts with the two different loops of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, each containing different cleavage sites. Key functional residues of TMPRSS2 (His296, Ser441 and Ser460) were found to interact with immediate flanking residues of cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Compared to the N-terminal cleavage site (Arg685/Ser686), TMPRSS2 region that interact with C-terminal cleavage site (Arg815/Ser816) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was predicted as relatively more druggable. In summary, the present study provide structural characteristics of molecular complex between human TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and points to the candidate drug targets that could further be exploited to direct structure base drug designing.","output":"Structural Basis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Priming by TMPRSS2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the impact of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological status among Saudi adults, and whether physical activity modifies this association.

Traditionally believed to be only part of parasitic and allergic/asthmatic immune responses, as scientific studies arise, the paradigm about these cells is continuously changing, adding layers of complexity to their roles in homeostasis and disease. Developing principally in the bone marrow by the action of IL-5 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, eosinophils migrate from the blood to very different organs, performing multiple functions in tissue homeostasis as in the gastrointestinal tract, thymus, uterus, mammary glands, liver, and skeletal muscle. In organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, eosinophils are able to act as immune regulatory cells and also to perform direct actions against parasites, and bacteria, where novel mechanisms of immune defense as extracellular DNA traps are key factors. Besides, eosinophils, are of importance in an effective response against viral pathogens by their nuclease enzymatic activity and have been lately described as involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 immunity. The pleiotropic role of eosinophils is sustained because eosinophils can be also detrimental to human physiology, for example, in diseases like allergies, asthma, and eosinophilic esophagitis, where exosomes can be significant pathophysiologic units.

These involve that passengers have to wear masks and guidelines are issued for working at home and teaching online. In addition, other policy measures, such as introducing a reservation system, were considered. To examine to what extent train travelers support policy measures and how these change their perception of becoming infected while traveling by train, a stated preference experiment is conducted. Respondents were asked to evaluate various combinations of policy measures, both whether they consider it safe to travel by train under the stated conditions and whether they would vote in favor of the policy package in a referendum. To analyze the data, a mediation choice model is developed, which allows disentangling the direct effect of the policy measures on support and the indirect effect mediated by infection safety perception. To illustrate this, the results show that implementing the policy measure teaching on campus with later starting times would decrease travelers infection safety perception and therefore indirectly decrease its support. However, the positive direct effect on support suggests that travelers like this option better than teaching online, the guideline that applied at the time of data collection. The direct and indirect effects cancel each other out, indicating that this alternative policy measure would not count on more support than the guideline teaching online. Furthermore, this paper examines the heterogeneity in the support for policy measures by presenting and discussing the results of a Latent Class Choice Model. Amongst others, the results reveal that one class strongly supports the policy measure reservation system, while another class stongly opposes this measure, suggesting that implementing this measure is not trivial as suggested by its moderate effects at the aggregate level.","output":"Train travel in corona time: Safety perceptions of and support for policy measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is extremely transmissible.

In lungs, characterized by a particular immunosuppressive environment primarily due to the presence of alveolar macrophages (AM), 1,25(OH)2D3 has been shown to favor the immune response against pathogens. Here, we explored the ability of aerosolized 1,25(OH)2D3 to locally promote an anti-tumor phenotype in alveolar macrophages (AM) in the treatment of lung metastases. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assay has been used to assess the capability of AM, in vitro treated of not with 1,25(OH)2D3, to stimulate NK cells. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay has been used to assess the effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on MC-38 and B16 tumor cells in vitro growth. 1,25(OH)2D3 was aerosolized in immunocompetent mouse models to evaluate the effect of local administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 on in vivo growth of MC-38 and B16 tumor cells within lungs and on infiltrating immune cells. RESULTS: In vitro incubation of na?ve AM with 1,25(OH)2D3 improved their ability to stimulate NK cell cytotoxicity. In vivo aerosolized 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly reduced the metastatic growth of MC-38 colon carcinoma, a tumor histotype that frequently metastasizes to lung in human. Immune infiltrate obtained from digested lungs of 1,25(OH)2D3-treated mice bearing MC-38 metastases revealed an increased expression of MHCII and CD80 on AM and an up-modulation of CD69 expression on effector cells that paralleled a strong increased ability of these cells to kill MC-38 tumor in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data show that aerosol delivery can represent a feasible and novel approach to supplement 1,25(OH)2D3 directly to the lungs promoting the activation of local immunity against cancer.","output":"Aerosol 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 supplementation: A strategy to boost anti-tumor innate immune activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery remains the most widely accepted and used option method to treat post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) worldwide while lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) serves as an effectively alternative treatment.

We advanced from a one-compartmental design of the stomach to a much more appropriate, multi-compartmental 'mixing tank' gastric model that reflects drug distribution along the different regions of the stomach as a consequence of randomly dosing relative to the different contractile phases of the migrating motor complex (MMC). To capture the intraluminal phenol red concentrations in the different segments of the GI tract both in fasted and fed state conditions, it was essential to include a bypass flow compartment ('magenstrasse') to facilitate the transport of the phenol red solution directly to the duodenum (fasted state) or antrum (fed state). The fasted and fed state models were validated with external reference data from an independent aspiration study using another nonabsorbable marker (paromomycin). These results will be essential for the development and optimization of computational programs for GI simulation and absorption prediction, providing a realistic gastric physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model based on direct measurement of gastric concentrations of the drug in the stomach.","output":"Gastric emptying and intestinal appearance of nonabsorbable drugs phenol red and paromomycin in human subjects: A multi-compartment stomach approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social platforms such as Gab and Parler, branded as \`free-speech' networks, have seen a significant growth of their user base in recent years.

In this work we provide the first large scale analysis of hate-speech on Parler. We experiment with an array of algorithms for hate-speech detection, demonstrating limitations of transfer learning in that domain, given the illusive and ever changing nature of the ways hate-speech is delivered. In order to improve classification accuracy we annotated 10K Parler posts, which we use to fine-tune a BERT classifier. Classification of individual posts is then leveraged for the classification of millions of users via label propagation over the social network. Classifying users by their propensity to disseminate hate, we find that hate mongers make 16.1\\\\% of Parler active users, and that they have distinct characteristics comparing to other user groups. We find that hate mongers are more active, more central and express distinct levels of sentiment and convey a distinct array of emotions like anger and sadness. We further complement our analysis by comparing the trends discovered in Parler and those found in Gab.

PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine if the telephonic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) program can improve social connectedness and loneliness among older adults. A secondary objective was to determine whether additional improvements in life satisfaction and perception of aging were achieved. METHODS: Eligible older adults (age 65+) were recruited via outbound calls and/or a mailer. Participants were mailed a T1 survey, completed intervention training, and matched into a dyad. The matched dyad engaged in weekly telephone calls for 12 weeks. Post 12 weeks, participants completed a T2 survey, and a T3 four weeks later.

RESULTS: Of 177 patients included in this retrospective study, 73% were positive for at least one virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (36.6%) and human rhinovirus (24%) were most frequently detected. Patients in whom a respiratory virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected, were younger (6 versus 24 months; p < 0.001) and more often hospitalized (116 versus 34; p = 0.001) than patients in whom no respiratory pathogen was detected. Also they were more likely to present with feeding problems, dyspnea, rhinorrhea and wheezing (all p < 0.05) than patients without a respiratory pathogen. In the majority of cases, clinicians did not change their antibiotic management after detecting a viral respiratory pathogen.

This study proposed a novel construction of an immune-related protein interaction network (IPIN) in severe cases with the use of a network diffusion technique on a human interactome network and transcriptomic data. Enrichment analysis revealed that the IPIN was mainly associated with antiviral, innate immune, apoptosis, cell division, and cell cycle regulation signaling pathways.

In this context, and given the increasing penetration of zero or low GHG emissions vehicles with high energy efficiency, this work intends to contribute to the future identification of the impact of the transport sector on energy consumption and resulting emissions. It aims at identifying the energy consumption in the sector and quantify the GHG levels from the comparative analysis of the increase of electric based vehicle fleet in detriment of those based in internal combustion engines, considering five scenarios until the year 2030. The study is applied in mainland Portugal considering the fleet of light passenger and commercial vehicles, which comprise the vast majority of the Portuguese fleet. The Bottom-up model, where the hierarchical tree detailing is constructed from detail to the whole, is applied to the study to determine the energy consumption and GHG emissions variables. The analysis is performed through the application of the simulation tool Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system (LEAP) of scenario-based and integrated modelling, herein utilized to determine energy consumption and account for GHG emission sources.

Depending on local conditions and order supply differences SARS-CoV-2 restrictions had a massive impact on medical care. To show the impact of plastic surgery on emergency surgery during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the amount of surgical emergencies in a single center plastic surgery division were evaluated. METHOD: The number of plastic surgery cases in a university hospital was evaluated during 16.03.2020 to 27.04.2020 and compared with previous years. RESULTS: Due to cancelling of elective surgery the number of cases dropped to 57,3a? % of the caseload of previous years. There was no change in ratio of emergency (2020: 56,4a? %; 2017-2019: 54,9a? %) and urgent (2020: 44,6a? %; 2017-2019: 45a? %) surgery.

METHODS This study included 153 consecutive patients with cT1 renal masses undergoing RAPN and analyzed their perioperative outcomes, particularly tumor complexity. In this series, cT1b, completely endophytic, hilar, and cystic tumors were considered complex tumors. Patients with tumors that met at least one of the complex criterion were placed in the complex tumor group; patients with tumors that did not meet any of the complex criteria were placed in the non-complex tumor group. RESULTS Of the 153 patients, 54 (35.3%) had complex tumors; specifically, 18 (11.8%) had cT1b tumors, 15 (9.8%) had completely endophytic tumors, 28 (18.3%) had hilar tumors, and 8 (5.2%) had cystic tumors. The non-complex group included 99 patients (64.7%). The complex tumor group had significantly longer warm ischemia and console times than the non-complex tumor group, but there was no significant difference between them in the achievement of the trifecta. Both warm ischemia and console times were significantly correlated with the number of complex factors. Multivariate analyses of complex factors demonstrated that completely endophytic and cT1b tumors were independently associated with warm ischemia time and console time, respectively. CONCLUSIONS For patients with complex tumors, RAPN may be a feasible procedure with acceptable perioperative outcomes. However, special attention should be paid to long warm ischemia and console times, particularly in those with completely endophytic and/or cT1b tumors.","output":"Perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: Comparative assessments between complex and non-complex renal tumors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The island fox (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) population on Santa Catalina Island, California, USA declined precipitously in 1999 with an approximate 95% reduction on their eastern range, an area representing 87% of the island.

During PPE, high immunological risk patients received 4-6 mg/kg, moderate risk 2-4mg/kg, and low risk 1-2 mg/kg of ATG. During PE, ATG doses were reduced to 3-4 mg/kg for high risk, 1-2 mg/kg for moderate, and low changed to basiliximab. Primary outcomes: biopsy-proven rejection [BPAR], de-novo donor-specific antibody [DSA], delayed graft function [DGF], infection rates, graft loss, and all-cause of mortality. RESULTS During PPE, 224 kidney transplants [KTx], 14 kidney/pancreas transplants [KP] were included, while 180 KTx, 5 KP were included for PE. Basiliximab use increased by 30% in the PE. The odds of DGF were statistically significant between PE vs PPE, OR 1.7 [1.05, 2.8, p-value=0.042].

METHODS: We reviewed 115 gastric cancer patients treated with NAC and radical gastrectomy. The cut-off for IBL predicting the long-term survival was assessed by a receiver operating characteristic curve. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the association between patient characteristics including IBL, overall survival, and disease-free survival. RESULTS: The cut-off for IBL was set at 990 ml. Twenty-six patients had excessive IBL exceeding 990 ml (22.6%) and PICs developed in 33 patients (28.7%). The body mass index, IBL, ypT, and ypN were significant independent prognostic predictors, but PICs were not. CONCLUSION: NAC did not decrease the risk induced by excessive IBL.

We sought to demonstrate the reduction in hospital room utilization after implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS We included all minimally invasive reconstructive surgical procedures in this retrospective cohort study within a large managed care organization of 4.5 million members (2008-2018). We queried the system-wide medical record for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for all included procedures and patient perioperative data. Categorical variables were compared using 2 test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. RESULTS Of the 13,445 patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery, 5,506 were discharged the same day, whereas 7,939 were discharged the next day. Over the 10-year period, patients without hysterectomy had outpatient surgery rates increase from 31.2% to 76.4% (+45.2%), whereas those with hysterectomy increased from 3% to 56.4% (+53.4%). Hospital room utilization decreased by 45,200 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures without hysterectomy and 53,400 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures with hysterectomy. When compared to 2008, in 2018 after more widespread adoption of outpatient elective surgery, for the 738 patients undergoing surgery without hysterectomy, 334 less room days were used, whereas 335 less room days were used among the 640 patients who had a surgical procedure with hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive procedures leads to a significant reduction in hospital room utilization. Same-day discharge decreases hospital resource utilization, therefore improving hospital access, which may be essential for the delivery of routine care during times of resource scarcity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Utilizing Outpatient Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic altered instructional and learning strategies at institutions across the globe.

Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications (recurrent miscarriage, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation) and thrombotic events (both arterial and venous). The most common thrombotic events include brain ischaemia (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) and deep vein thrombosis. To diagnose APS, the presence of aPL antibodies in two measurements and at least one thrombotic event or pregnancy complication are required. It is unclear if people with positive aPL antibodies but without any previous thrombotic events should receive primary antithrombotic prophylaxis. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents versus placebo or no intervention or other intervention on the development of thrombosis in people with aPL antibodies who have not had a thrombotic event. We did not address obstetric outcomes in this review as these have been thoroughly addressed by other Cochrane Reviews. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (4 December 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last search 29 November 2017), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (searched 4 December 2017), and trials registries (searched 29 November 2017). We also checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or their combinations, at any dose and mode of delivery with placebo, no intervention, or other intervention. We also included RCTs that compared antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents with each other or that compared two different doses of the same drug. We included studies performed in people of any age and with no history of thrombosis (as defined by APS Sapporo classification criteria or updated Sydney classification criteria), but with aPL antibodies confirmed on at last two separate measurements. The studies included both pregnant women who tested positive for aPL antibodies and had a history of recurrent obstetric complications, as well as non-pregnancy related cases with positive screening for antibodies, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies and quality of evidence using GRADE. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third review author when necessary. In addition, one review author checked all the extracted numerical data. MAIN RESULTS We included nine studies involving 1044 randomised participants. The studies took place in several countries and had different funding sources. No study was at low risk of bias in all domains. We classified all included studies as at unclear or high risk of bias in two or more domains. Seven included studies focused mainly on obstetric outcomes. One study included non-pregnancy-related cases, and one study included both pregnancy-related cases and other patients with positive results for aPL antibodies. The remaining studies concerned women with aPL antibodies and a history of pregnancy failure. Four studies compared anticoagulant with or without acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus ASA only and observed no clear difference in thrombosis risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 3.77; 4 studies; 493 participants; low-quality evidence). No major bleeding was reported, but minor bleeding risk (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was higher in the anticoagulant with ASA group as compared with ASA alone in one study (RR 22.45, 95% CI 1.34 to 374.81; 1 study; 164 participants; low-quality evidence). In one study ASA was compared with placebo, and there were no clear differences in thrombosis (RR 5.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 42.97; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence) or minor bleeding risk between the groups (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.34 to 29.01; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence), and no major bleeding was observed. Two studies compared ASA with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus placebo or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and no thrombotic events were observed in any of the groups. Moreover, there were no clear differences in the risk of bleeding requiring transfusion (RR 9.0, 95% CI 0.49 to 164.76; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or postpartum bleeding (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.81; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) between the groups. Two studies compared ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWF or unfractionated heparin (UFH); no thrombotic events or major bleeding was reported. Mortality and quality of life data were not reported for any of the comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit or harm of using anticoagulants with or without ASA versus ASA alone in people with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss and with no such history; ASA versus placebo in people with aPL antibodies; and ASA with LMWH versus placebo or IVIG, and ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWH or UFH, in women with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, for the primary prevention of thrombotic events. In a mixed population of people with a history of previous pregnancy loss and without such a history treated with anticoagulant combined with ASA, the incidence of minor bleeding (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was increased when compared with ASA alone. Studies that are adequately powered and that focus mainly on thrombotic events are needed to draw any firm conclusions on the primary prevention of thrombotic events in people with antiphospholipid antibodies.","output":"Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for primary prevention of thrombosis in individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Donor families experienced a difficult time during and after the process of organ donation.

The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, and to discuss the mediating role of positive coping style between resilience and anxiety, and the moderating role of general self-efficacy. METHOD: Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), General Self-efficacy Scale (GSES) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ) were used in this cross-sectional study among 390 healthcare workers in Jiangsu Province, China. Mackinnon's four-step procedure was applied to test the mediation effect, and Hayes PROCESS macro was conducted to examine the moderated mediation model. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety among Chinese healthcare workers during the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was 41.8%.

Multifocal contact lenses (MFCLs) and orthokeratology (OK) reduce peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus, which animal studies have shown to positively impact eye growth. MFCLs are expected to slow myopic progression by 20a??-a??50% and OK by 30a??-a??60%, making them valuable therapeutic tools. In view of the guidelines for myopia management published by the International Myopia Institute in 2019, the aim of this retrospective data analysis of a tertiary care center was to review past experience with OK and MFCLs for myopia control and gain information to update current practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The contact lens (CL) database of the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital of Basel was searched with the label \\"myopia progression\\" between January 2012a??-a??2020. Patients were included if they gave informed consent, were younger than 19 years old at baseline, and had no ocular comorbidities that could potentially compromise vision. Primary outcomes were progression of spherical equivalent refraction for MFCL patients and progression of axial length (AL) for the OK group, comparing with historical data from OK trials. Secondary outcomes were the presence of risk factors for myopia, age, refractive error at baseline, follow-up duration, and adverse effects during therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients could be included, with a mean age of 12.80  3.32 years (y) at baseline. The majority of patients were older than 12 years and already myopic (- 3.89  2.30 diopters) when control treatment was started. Overall, follow-up ranged from 0.08 to 6.33 years (2.03  1.66 y). In the patients treated with MFCLs, myopia control improved significantly when patients changed from spectacles to MFCLs. In the OK group, 14% dropped out during the first year and 2 patients had multiple AL measurements during therapy, which showed a slower growth of AL when compared to other OK trials and controls with spectacles. There were two cases of non-severe keratitis. Environmental risk factors had not been documented and only 48% of clinical records had a documented family risk assessment. CONCLUSION: Patients showed a slower myopia progression under MFCLs or OK, which supports their role as a treatment option in myopia management. In this regard, AL measurement is an important additional parameter to be included in the assessment of myopia progression in clinical practice. Identification of children at risk of developing high/pathologic myopia (family history, environmental risk factors) needs to improve so that the first stages of myopic shift can be recognized and targeted.

A successful SC design and management plan should consider pandemic spatiotemporal characteristics as well as its effects on production and logistical operations, and on the SC workforce at risk. In this paper, a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model is developed to maximise the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of SC profit given a set of pandemic scenarios. An exemplar SC network from the literature is utilised, along with randomly generated pessimistic and optimistic pandemic scenarios. The proposed model is demonstrated by obtaining SC designs for different cases pertaining to pandemic influence and strategic policies. The resultant SC designs are used to contrast the performance of management plans across different pandemic scenarios and for different levels of workforce at risk. Supply chains for socially critical products, such as ventilators, are studied separately to examine the impact of SC network expansion on maximizing satisfied demand. Finally, we investigate the effects of diversifying network node locations across different administrative regions on SC performance.

This paper introduces a cooperatively inspired open-source framework, for intelligent mining of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes. We situate this study within the African context, to drive advancement on state-of-the-art, towards intelligent infectious disease characterization and prediction. The outcome is an enriched Knowledge Base, sufficient to provide deep understanding of the viral sub-strains identification problem. We also open investigation by gender, which to the best of our knowledge has been ignored in related research. Data for the study came from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://gisaid.org) and processed for precise discovery of viral sub-strains transmission between and within African countries. To localize the transmission route(s) of each isolate excavated and provide appropriate links to similar isolate strain(s), a cognitive solution was imposed on the genome expression patterns discovered by unsupervised self-organizing map (SOM) component planes visualization. The Freidman-Nemenyis test was finally performed to validate our claim. Results: : Evidence of inter- and intra-genome diversity was noticed. While some isolates (or genomes) clustered differently, implying different evolutionary source (or high-diversity), others clustered closely together, indicating similar evolutionary source (or less-diversity). SOM component planes analysis revealed multiple sub-strains patterns, strongly suggesting local- or intra-community and country to country transmissions. Cognitive maps of both male and female isolates revealed multiple transmission routes. Freidmans test results showed highly significant difference (p<0.01) among the various isolate groups. Nemenyis test revealed groups that differed in their isolates. Conclusion: The proposed framework offers explanations to SARS-CoV-2 diversity and provides real time identification to disease transmission routes, as well as rapid decision support for facilitating inter- and intra-country contact tracing of infected case(s). Intermediate data produced in this paper are helpful to enrich the genome datasets for intelligent characterization and prediction of COVID-19 and related pandemics, as well as the construction of intelligent device for accurate infectious disease monitoring.","output":"Real Time Viral Sub-Strains Discovery in Emerging Infectious Disease Situation C The African Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Longitudinal studies assessing durability of the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) humoral immune response have generated conflicting results. This has been proposed to be due to differences in patient populations, the lack of standardized methodologies, and the use of assays that measure distinct aspects of the humoral response. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were serially measured in sera from a cohort of 44 well-characterized convalescent plasma donors over 120 days post-COVID-19 symptom onset, utilizing eight assays, which varied according to antigen source, the detected antibody isotype, and the activity measured (i.e., binding, blocking, or neutralizing). While the majority of assays demonstrated a gradual decline in antibody titers over the course of 120 days, the two electrochemiluminescence immunoassay Roche assays (Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 [qualitative, nucleocapsid based] and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [semiquantitative, spike based]), which utilize dual-antigen binding for antibody detection, demonstrated stable and/or increasing antibody titers over the study period. This study is among the first to assess longitudinal, rather than cross-sectional, SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles among convalescent COVID-19 patients, primarily using commercially available serologic assays with Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization.

The reverse vaccinology approach may provide us with significant therapeutic leads in this direction and further determination of T-cell/B-cell response to antigen. In the present study, we conducted a population coverage analysis referring to the diverse Indian population. From the Immune epitope database (IEDB), HLA- distribution analysis was performed to find the most promiscuous T-cell epitope out of In silico determined epitope of Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2. Epitopes were selected based on their binding affinity with the maximum number of HLA alleles belonging to the highest population coverage rate values for the chosen geographical area in India. 404 cleavage sites within the 1288 amino acids sequence of spike glycoprotein were determined by NetChop proteasomal cleavage prediction suggesting the presence of adequate sites in the protein sequence for cleaving into appropriate epitopes. For population coverage analysis, 179 selected epitopes present the projected population coverage up to 97.45% with 56.16 average hit and 15.07 pc90. 54 epitopes are found with the highest coverage among the Indian population and highly conserved within the given spike RBD domain sequence. Among all the predicted epitopes, 9-mer TRFASVYAW and RFDNPVLPF along with 12-mer LLAGTITSGWTF and VSQPFLMDLEGK epitopes are observed as the best due to their decent docking score and best binding affinity to corresponding HLA alleles during MD simulations.

Autopsy also holds promise in medical education as a focal point for integration and correlation of basic & clinical medical knowledge. Unfortunately, the vast educational potential goes unrealized due to several barriers such as clinicolegal risks, potential exposure to biohazardous materials, limited time, space, and negative stigma. On the other hand, cadaveric dissection in gross anatomy is in rapid decline in medical education as sweeping curricular changes continue to reduce contact hours in favor of systemic and clinical integration. The situation was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded expeditious online migration of classes and will likely have a long lasting and transformative impact on the educational landscape. At this time, a unique opportunity exists to adopt an autopsy protocol for cadaveric dissection in gross anatomy to actualize the untapped potential of clinical practice. Therefore, in a pilot project, the feasibility and perceived value of adopting autopsy protocol in cadaveric dissection were evaluated. Four students with regional gross anatomy dissection experience and faculty (n=2) completed dissections of four cadavers using an en masse autopsy protocol. First, external examination of the whole body noting all surface anatomy including scars, abrasions, contusions, and tumors, provided an opportunity to make acquaintance with the body donor. Second, thoracic and abdominopelvic organs were removed en masse (Figure 1) with minimal disruption to the musculoskeletal framework, preserving most neurovascular supply and anatomic relationships of multiple organ systems. The en masse organ block was further dissected into organ system blocks to demonstrate relationships of individual organs. Finally, the musculoskeletal system of the main body frame was regionally dissected. Unstructured interviews of faculty and students were conducted to gauge experience and perceptions of autopsy protocol in cadaveric dissection. A survey of student dissectors (n=4) and observers (n=4) was conducted to qualitatively assess educational value. All participants unanimously reported that autopsy protocol and the en masse organ blocks would benefit gross anatomy education. Students reported new knowledge gained on the boundary of the peritoneum, retroperitoneal structures, ligaments of the visceral organs, and spatial relationships of organ systems that are lost in regional dissections. These outcomes suggest that integrating an en masse autopsy protocol in a gross anatomy course is a viable option that offers a clinical approach to learning gross anatomy. Taken together, adopting autopsy protocol in some form in medical education holds ample opportunity to integrate multiple basic science subjects and clinical practice. Educational value of the autopsy protocol in gross anatomy education will be investigated in the future studies.","output":"Flipping the Script C Adopting Autopsy Protocol for Cadaveric Dissection in Gross Anatomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental disorders are highly prevalent, heterogeneous conditions comorbid with multiple chronic physical illnesses, remaining the leading cause of disability worldwide.1 Its diagnosis and management are limited by the absence of available biomarkers and have largely been dependent on patient's subjective self-reporting obtained at periodic clinician's evaluation that are frequently influenced by recall bias, decreased illness insight, and differences in clinical assessment experience.2 In-person visits are poorly suited for the diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses, yielding only cross-sectional measurements of continuous, fluctuating parameters such as mood/emotions, cognition, sleep, blood pressure, and physical/social activities.

There is limited understanding of the effectiveness of different primary vaccination courses on mRNA based booster vaccines against SARs-COV-2 infections and how time-varying confounders can impact the evaluations comparing different vaccines as primary courses for mRNA boosters. Objective To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of ChAdOx1 versus BNT162b2 as primary doses against SARs-CoV-2 in booster vaccine recipients whilst accounting for time-varying confounders. Design Trial emulation was used to reduce time-varying confounding-by-indication driven by prioritising booster vaccines based upon age, vulnerability and exposure status e.g. healthcare worker. Trial emulation was conducted by meta-analysing eight cohort results whose booster vaccinations were staggered between 16/09/2021 to 05/01/2022 and followed until 23/01/2022.

Community studies have shown that 30% of patients with acute respiratory tract symptoms have no identifiable infective aetiology. This may not be applicable in general practice. Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the infective aetiology in patients who presented to primary care doctors with acute respiratory symptoms. Methods. A prospective study was carried out in all nine primary care clinics belonging to the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGPs) in Singapore. The subjects comprised 594 consecutive patients (318 males, 276 females) aged 21 years who presented with complaints of any one of cough, nasal or throat symptoms of <7 days duration. Data collection was through interview using structured questionnaire, physical examination, throat swabs for bacterial culture and nasal swabs for virus identification by immunofluorescence (IF) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additional PCR was performed on a subsample of 100 patients. Patients were followed-up until resolution of symptoms. Results. The aetiological diagnosis by infective agent is as follows: 150 patients (25.2%) had virus infections, of which 90.7% (136/150) were by rhinovirus. Fourteen patients (2.4%) had bacterial infections, of which 10 were due to group G streptococcus. Group A streptococcus was not detected. Nineteen patients with new pathogens were identified by further PCR. These included parainfluenza 4, human coronavirus OC43, adenovirus, enterovirus and Chlamydia pneumoniae. No pathogen could be identified in 49% of patients. There were no differences in clinical presentation and socio-demographic variables between patients who had viral infections and those in whom no pathogen could be identified. Conclusion.

Given the association between excessive discounting of delayed rewards and chronic pain, this study examined relationships between delay discounting, pain severity, and COVID-19 perceived stress in individuals with chronic pain. Individuals reporting chronic pain (N = 180; 41% female; 86% white; 59% with a college degree) were recruited via the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform in this cross-sectional study. Measures of pain severity, delay discounting, probability discounting, and COVID-19 perceived stress were collected. Delay discounting was a significant predictor of overall pain severity (p < .02) and COVID-19 perceived stress (p < .001). Also, the magnitude of COVID-19 perceived stress fully mediated the relationship between delay discounting and overall pain severity (p = .004). Probability discounting was not a significant predictor of pain severity or COVID-19 perceived stress (p > .05). These findings highlight the importance of excessive discounting of delayed rewards as a potential determinant of pain severity as well as predictor of perceived stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relation between chlorine based DBPs in drinking water and CRC in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility based matched case control study was conducted involving 224 cases and 448 population controls from June 2020 to May 2021. Cases were defined as histologically confirmed CRC cases. Cases were matched with controls by residence, age, and sex using frequency and individual matching. Geocoding of cases, health facility, and georeferencing of controls were carried out. Data was collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Pearson Chi square and Fishers exact tests were employed to assess associations. Stratified analysis was used to detect confounding factors and effect modification. A multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of CRC. RESULTS: Of 214 CRC cases, 148 (69.2%) used chlorinated water whereas out of 428 controls 161 (37.6%) used chlorinated water. In the final regression model, drinking chlorinated surface water (adjusted matched odds ratio [adjusted mOR] = 2.6; 95% CI 1.7-4.0), history of swimming (adjusted mOR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.4-4.1), years at the place of current residence (adjusted mOR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.2), hot tap water use for showering (adjusted mOR; 3.8 = 95% CI 2.5-5.9) were significantly associated with CRC. The stratified analysis confirmed that smoking and meat ingestion were not effect modifiers and confounders.

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and five other databases reporting ABI and ARDS through July 6, 2020 and included studies with ABI and neurological outcome occurring after ARDS. We found 38 studies (10 preclinical studies with 143 animals; 28 clinical studies with 1175 patients) encompassing 9 animal studies (n = 143), 1 in vitro study, 12 studies on neurocognitive outcomes (n = 797), 2 clinical observational studies (n = 126), 1 neuroimaging study (n = 15), and 13 clinical case series/reports (n = 15). Six ARDS animal studies demonstrated evidence of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage within the hippocampus. Five animal studies demonstrated altered cerebral blood flow and increased intracranial pressure with the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation. High frequency of ARDS-associated secondary ABI or poor neurological outcome was observed ranging 82C86% in clinical observational studies. Of the clinically reported ABIs (median age 49 years, 46% men), the most common injury was hemorrhagic stroke (25%), followed by hypoxic ischemic brain injury (22%), diffuse cerebral edema (11%), and ischemic stroke (8%). Cognitive impairment in patients with ARDS (n = 797) was observed in 87% (range 73C100%) at discharge, 36% (range 32C37%) at 6 months, and 30% (range 25C45%) at 1 year. Mechanisms of ARDS-associated secondary ABI include primary hypoxic ischemic injury from hypoxic respiratory failure, secondary injury, such as lung injury induced neuroinflammation, and increased intracranial pressure from ARDS lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy. In summary, paucity of clinical data exists on the prevalence of ABI in patients with ARDS. Hemorrhagic stroke and hypoxic ischemic brain injury were commonly observed. Persistent cognitive impairment was highly prevalent in patients with ARDS.

Drug repurposing, i.e., utilizing an approved drug for a different indication, offers a time-and cost-efficient alternative for making new (relevant) therapies available to physicians and patients. Considering given strategy, many approved and investigational antiviral compounds, alone or in various relevant combinations, used in the past to fight Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1, or Influenza viruses are being evaluated against the SARS-CoV-2. Triazavirin (TZV), a non-toxic broad--spectrum antiviral compound, is efficient against various strains of the Influenza A virus (Influenza Virus A, Orthomyxoviridae), i.e., swine flu (H1N1, or H3N2), avian influenza (H5N1, H5N2, H9N2, or highly pathogenic H7N3 strain), Influenza B virus (Influenza Virus B, Orthomyxoviridae), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Orthopneumovirus, Pneumoviridae), Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus (known as Forest--Spring Encephalitis Virus;Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), West Nile Virus (Flavivirus, Flavaviridae), Rift Valley Fever Virus (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae), and Herpes viruses (Simplexviruses, Herpesviridae) as well. In regard to COVID-19, the molecule probably reduced inflammatory reactions, thus limiting the damage to vital organs and reducing the need for therapeutic support, respectively. In addition, in silico computational methods indicated relatively satisfactory binding affinities of the TZV ligand to both structural (E)-and (S)-proteins, non-structural 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3-CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 as well as human angiotensin-I converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). The interactions between TZV and given viral structures or the ACE-2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 might effectively block both the entry of the pathogen into a host cell and its replication. Promising treatment patterns of COVID-19 positive patients might be also based on a suitable combination of a membrane fusion inhibitor (umifenovir, for example) with viral RNA synthesis and replication inhibitor (TZV).","output":"Triazavirin might be the new hope to fight severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-cov-2)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the ongoing coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, SARS-CoV-2), the entire community of health professionals is working to control disease and investing crores in vaccine development.

The present study explores the extent to which academics in a distinctively relevant subset of science and engineering disciplines are receptive towards the work and teaching practices SbD would arguably imply. Through 29 interviews with researchers in nanotechnology, biotechnology and chemical engineering differences in perceptions of safety, life-cycle thinking and responsibility for safety were explored. Results indicate that although safety is perceived as a paramount topic in scientific practice, its meaning is rigorously demarcated, marking out safety within the work environment. In effect, this creates a limited perceived role responsibility vis--vis safety in the production of knowledge and in teaching, with negligible critical consideration of researchs downstream impacts. This is at odds with the adoption of a broader conception of, and responsibility for, safety. The considerations supporting the perceived boundaries demarcating scientific practice are scrutinized. This study suggests that implementing SbD in academia requires systemic changes, the development of new methods, and attention for researchers and innovators elementary views on the meaning of and responsibility for safety throughout the innovation chain.","output":"Adopting Safe-by-Design in Science and Engineering Academia: The Soil May Need Tilling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Review, in addressing the unacceptably high mortality of patients with liver disease admitted to acute hospitals, reinforces the need for integrated clinical services. The masterplan described is based on regional, geographically sited liver centres, each linked to four to six surrounding district general hospitals-a pattern of care similar to that successfully introduced for stroke services. The plan includes the establishment of a lead and deputy lead clinician in each acute hospital, preferably a hepatologist or gastroenterologist with a special interest in liver disease, who will have prime responsibility for organising the care of admitted patients with liver disease on a 24/7 basis. Essential for the plan is greater access to intensive care units and high-dependency units, in line with the reconfiguration of emergency care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This Review strongly recommends full implementation of alcohol care teams in hospitals and improved working links with acute medical services. We also endorse recommendations from paediatric liver services to improve overall survival figures by diagnosing biliary atresia earlier based on stool colour charts and better caring for patients with impaired cognitive ability and developmental mental health problems. Pilot studies of earlier diagnosis have shown encouraging progress, with 5-6% of previously undiagnosed cases of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis identified through use of a portable FibroScan in primary care. Similar approaches to the detection of early asymptomatic disease are described in accounts from the devolved nations, and the potential of digital technology in improving the value of clinical consultation and screening programmes in primary care is highlighted. The striking contribution of comorbidities, particularly obesity and diabetes (with excess alcohol consumption known to be a major factor in obesity), to mortality in COVID-19 reinforces the need for fiscal and other long delayed regulatory measures to reduce the prevalence of obesity. These measures include the food sugar levy and the introduction of the minimum unit price policy to reduce alcohol consumption. Improving public health, this Review emphasises, will not only mitigate the severity of further waves of COVID-19, but is crucial to reducing the unacceptable burden from liver disease in the UK.","output":"New dimensions for hospital services and early detection of disease: a Review from the Lancet Commission into liver disease in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had a rapid dissemination.

We studied the public attitudes towards death and dying in Wales. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in 2018. Social media and the HealthWiseWales platform were used to recruit participants. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. RESULTS: 2,210 people participated. Loss of independence (84%), manner of death, and leaving their beloved behind were the biggest fears around death and dying. In terms of EoLC, participants sought timely access to care (84%) and being surrounded by loved ones (62%). Being at home was less of a priority (24%). Only 50% were familiar with Advance Care Planning (ACP). A lack of standard procedures as well as of support for the execution of plans and the ability to revisit those plans hindered uptake. The taboo around death conversations, the lack of opportunities and skills to initiate discussion, and personal fear and discomfort inhibited talking about death and dying. 72% felt that we do not talk enough about death and dying and advocated normalising talking by demystifying death with a positive approach. Health professionals could initiate and support this conversation, but this depended on communication skills and manageable workload pressure. Participants encouraged a public health approach and endorsed the use of: a) social media and other public platforms, b) formal education, c) formal and legal actions, and d) signposting and access to information. CONCLUSIONS: People are ready to talk about death and dying and COVID-19 has increased awareness. A combination of top-down and bottom-up initiatives across levels and settings can increase awareness, knowledge, and service-utilisation-drivers to support health professionals and people towards shared decisions which align with peoples end of life wishes and preferences.

New technologies assist these attacks, magnify them and render them deadlier. The more funding terrorist organizations manage to raise, the greater their capacity to recruit members, organize and commit terror attacks. Since the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, law enforcement agencies have increased their efforts to develop more anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering regulations, which are designed to block the flow of financing of terrorism and cut off its oxygen. However, at present most regulatory measures focus on traditional currencies. The more efforts to restrict the financing of terrorism by traditional fiat currencies succeeds, the greater the likelihood that cryptocurrencies will be used in order to fund illicit behavior. Furthermore, the COVID-19 virus and social distancing guidelines that followed it have increased the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, material support to terror and other financial crimes. Cryptocurrencies, electronically generated and stored tokens which can be exchanged via a decentralized payment system, are a game changer, significantly affecting market functions like never before and making it easier to finance terrorism and other types of criminal activity. These decentralized and (usually) anonymous usable currencies facilitate a high volume of transactions, allowing terrorists extensive fundraising, management, transfer and spending of money for illegal activities. The ability of terror organizations and those who finance them to increase their activities and attacks by using cryptocurrencies poses a major threat to national security. As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the issue of how to regulate them becomes more urgent. The scope and utility of financing of terrorism begs for a coherent legal response. This Article proposes to reform the regulation of cryptocurrencies. It advocates the promotion of mandatory obligations directed at cryptocurrency issuers, wallet providers and exchanges to verify the identity of users on the blockchain. Thus, courts could grant warrants obligating companies issuing cryptocurrencies to unmask the identity of cryptocurrency users when there is probable cause that their activities support terrorism or other money laundering activities. Such reforms would make it possible to allow stifling the financing of terrorism and other types of criminal activity financed through cryptocurrencies, and in so doing would make it possible to curb harmful lethal activities and promote national security. As we are aware of the legal challenges our solution poses, this Article also addresses substantial objections that might be raised regarding the proposed reforms, such as jeopardizing innovation, First Amendment freedom of expression objections, Fourth Amendment protection from surveillance and measures for promoting efficiency in the application of the proposed reforms.","output":"Speak Out: Verifying and Unmasking Cryptocurrency User Identity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leaks arising at the level of gastro-esophageal junction remain a major complication in patients who undergo a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

Associations between symptoms and demographic factors, viral burden measured by cycle threshold (CT) value, and duration of PCR positivity were analyzed. Results 18.8% of patients were positive for COVID-19. Asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients were significantly younger that symptomatic patients (2.6 years, p<0.001). There were no differences in average CT between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. The estimated median duration of COVID-19 PCR positivity was 23 days. Being asymptomatic throughout the course of infection was the only factor associated with a shorter course of COVID-19 PCR positivity (21 versus 28 days, p=0.002). Conclusions We found important differences and similarities between asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients, the most meaningful being a similar level of virus as measured by PCR, but a shorter duration of PCR positivity for asymptomatic patients.

To give a solution to both problems, a new kernel family with compact support and its separable version were presented in the literature. The theoretical study of these kernels shows that the new family kernel is parameterised by a scale parameter and generated in such a way that fine scale structures are successively suppressed when the scale parameter is increased. Moreover, the scale parameter is increased, the image is blurred and details and border are removed. All these disadvantages are related to the static nature of these kernels. In this paper, we propose a smart kernel based on deep neural networks (dnn) to create a dynamic kernel with compact support called DSKCS.

This organism causes COVID-19 disease and the rapid rise in cases and geographic spread strained healthcare systems. Clinical research trials were hindered by infection control measures discouraging physical contact and diversion of resources to meet emergent requirements. The need for effective treatment and prevention of COVID-19 prompted an untested investigational response. Trial groups adapted approaches using remote enrolment and consenting, newly developed diagnostic tests, delivery of study medications and devices to participants homes, and remote monitoring to ensure investigator/enrollee safety while preserving ethical integrity, confidentiality, and data accuracy. METHODS: Clinical researchers at our community health system in the USA undertook an outpatient randomized open-label study of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis versus observation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in household COVID-19 contacts. Designed in March 2020, challenges included COVID-19 infection in the research group, HCQ shortage, and lack of well-established home SARS-CoV-2 tests and remote ECG monitoring protocols in populations naive to these procedures. The study was written, funded, and received ethical committee approval in 4 months and was completed by September 2020 during a period of fluctuating infection rates and conflicting political opinions on HCQ use; results have been published. Singular methodology included the use of a new RNA PCR saliva SARS-CoV-2 home diagnostic test and a remote smartphone-based 6-lead ECG recording system. RESULTS: Of 483 households contacted regarding trial participation, 209 (43.3%) did not respond to telephone calls/e-mails and 90 (18.6%) declined; others were not eligible by inclusion or exclusion criteria. Ultimately, 54 individuals were enrolled and 42 completed the study. Numbers were too small to determine the efficacy of HCQ prophylaxis. No serious treatment-related adverse events were encountered.

PRESENTATION OF CASES: We included 7 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, including 4 females and 3 males, with ages ranging from 36 to 71 years. All patients showed abnormal findings on CXR when admitted to the hospital, except one, composed of ground glass opacity (GGO) (n = 1), consolidation (n = 3), and both (n = 2). Both and one side of the lung were affected in three and three (left side = 2; right side = 1) patients, respectively. Pneumonia degrees of mild, moderate and severe were observed in three, one, and two patients, respectively. All patients eventually recovered. DISCUSSION: CXR is the most common radiological examination for patients with respiratory disorders, including COVID-19, and it is readily available in almost all health care facilities. The imaging manifestation of COVID-19 is similar to viral pneumonia but also has its own characteristics, including GGO, consolidation, multiple plaque shadows, and interstitial changes that are mostly seen in peripherals and subpleural areas, as well as shadow infiltration in both lungs.

Participants were allocated to one of three hazard types (COVID-19 pandemic, violent acts, severe weather) and presented with warning messages that were previously issued via an official warning app. Four components of risk appraisalperceived severity (PS), anticipated negative emotions (AE), anticipatory worry (AW), and risk perception (RP)were assessed before and after presenting the warning message. Path models were calculated to predict the intention to comply with the warning message, controlling for age, gender, and previous hazard experience. RESULTS: For the COVID-19 pandemic, higher age ( = 0.18) predicted warning compliance (R(2) = 0.05). AE ( = 0.20) predicted compliance in the case of violent acts (R(2) = 0.09). For severe weather, PS ( = 0.28), age ( = 0.29), and female gender ( = 0.34) lead to higher compliance (R(2) = 0.27). Changes across risk appraisal components were not consistent, as some facets decreased after the receipt of a warning message. DISCUSSION: Risk appraisal has shown a marginal yet differential influence on warning message compliance in different types of hazards. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of sociodemographic factors on compliance should be studied more intensively. Moreover, integrating intermediary variables, such as self-efficacy, is necessary.","output":"Warning Messages in Crisis Communication: Risk Appraisal and Warning Compliance in Severe Weather, Violent Acts, and the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) infection and mortality.

It has been declared a pandemic by the WHO. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians in identifying COVID-19-infected patients by computed tomography CT images. The contribution of this paper is that it proposes a pre-processing technique that increases the recognition rate compared to the techniques existing in the literature. Methods: The proposed pre-processing technique, which consists of both contrast enhancement and open-morphology filter, is highly effective in decreasing the diagnosis error rate. After carrying out pre-processing, CT images are fed to a 15-layer convolution neural network (CNN) as deep-learning for the training and testing operations. The dataset used in this research has been publically published, in which CT images were collected from hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This dataset is composed of 2482 CT scans images, which include 1252 CT scans of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 1230 CT scans of non-infected SARS-CoV-2 patients. Results: The proposed detection method achieves up to 97.8% accuracy, which outperforms the reported accuracy of the dataset by 97.3%.

A DT is an emerging but conceptually different construct than CPS. Like CPS, DT relies on communication to create a highly-consistent, synchronized digital mirror image of the objects or physical processes. DT, in addition, uses built-in models on this precise image to simulate, analyze, predict, and optimize their real-time operation using feedback. DT is rapidly diffusing in the industries with recent advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G and beyond networks), various tools (e.g., age of information, federated learning, data analytics), and other promising trends in networked computing (e.g., edge and cloud computing). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different industrial communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications.

Since the monitoring, characterization, and cataloging of viral variants are important and the existing information on this was scant for Sicily, this pilot study explored viral variants circulation on this island before and in the growth phase of the second wave of COVID-19 (September and October 2020), and in the downslope of that wave (early December 2020) through sequence analysis of 54 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. The samples were nasopharyngeal swabs collected from Sicilian residents by a state-run one-health surveillance laboratory in Palermo. Variant characterization was based on RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of four regions of the viral genome. The B.1.177 variant was the most prevalent one, strongly predominating before the second wave and also as the wave downsized, although its relative prevalence decreased as other viral variants, particularly B.1.160, contributed to virus circulation. The occurrence of the B.1.160 variant may have been driven by the spread of that variant in continental Europe and by the relaxation of travel restrictions in the summer of 2020. No novel variants were identified. As sequencing of the entire viral genome in Sicily for the period covered here was restricted to seven deposited viral genome sequences, our results shed some light on SARS-CoV-2 variant circulation during that wave in this insular region of Italy which combines its partial insular isolation with being a major entry point for the African immigration.","output":"Pilot Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 Variants in the Island of Sicily Prior to and in the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2-are common and varied.

These innovations are now entering the literature, but there is little focus on the resulting disruption. OBJECTIVE We describe the implementation of digital innovations during the COVID-19 response of Australia's largest health service, Metro North (in Brisbane, Queensland), the challenges of the subsequent digital disruption, how these were managed, and lessons learned. METHODS Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian state of Queensland created the Queensland Digital Clinical Charter, which provides guidance for the development of digital health programs. The guidelines utilize three horizons: digitizing workflows, leveraging digital data to transform clinical care, and reimagining new and innovative models of care. The technical response to COVID-19 in Metro North is described across these horizons. The rapid digital response caused significant disruption to health care delivery; management of the disruption and the outcomes are detailed. This is a participatory action research project, with members of the research team assisting with leading the implementation project informing the case report content. RESULTS Several digital innovations were introduced across Metro North during the COVID-19 response. This resulted in significant disruption creating digital hypervigilance, digital deceleration, data discordance, and postdigital \\"depression.\\" Successful management of the digital disruption minimized the negative effects of rapid digital transformation, and contributed to the effective management of the pandemic in Queensland. CONCLUSION The rapid digital transformation in Metro North during COVID-19 was successful in several aspects; however, ongoing challenges remain. These include the need to improve data sharing and increase interoperability. Importantly, the innovations need to be evaluated to ensure that Metro North can capitalize on these changes and incorporate them into long-term routine practice.

No effective treatment exists today. Fat grafting has shown promise in alleviating neuropathic pain, yet the exact mechanism of action, at a biological level, is not yet known. We report on the first human study using autologous fat grafting for treating PHN. Our hypothesis was that fat grafting can alleviate pain and improve the quality of life (QoL) in patients suffering from PHN. If successful, this could be a safe, cost-effective alternative to analgesics. This safety and feasibility study aimed to investigate the possible pain-relieving effect of autologous fat grafting on PHN. METHODS Ten adult patients suffering from PHN underwent autologous fat grafting to a dermal area of neuralgia, with a 12-week follow up. The primary endpoint was patient-reported pain. Secondary endpoints were patient-reported changes in QoL, and the degree and quality of the neuropathic pain. RESULTS The pain was measured by using a visual analog scale (range: 0-10). We observed improvements in both the average and maximum level of pain with a reduction of (-4.0  3.1) and (-5.1  3.9), respectively, ( mean  SD), P<0.05. All parameters investigating neuropathic pain were significantly reduced. No improvement was seen in the QoL. The average amount of fat grafted was 208 ml. We observed no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION This study suggests that autologous fat grafting can relieve chronic pain resulting from HZ.

By performing a comparative analysis of 75401 SARS-CoV-2 reported sequences (as of December 2020), using as reference the first viral sequence reported in Wuhan in December 2019, we described the existence of 26538 genetic variants, the most frequent clustering into four major clades characterized by a specific geographical distribution. Notably, we found the most frequent variant, the previously reported missense p.Asp614Gly in the S protein, as a single mutation in only three patients, whereas in the large majority of cases it occurs in concomitance with three other variants, suggesting a high linkage and that this variant alone might not provide a significant selective advantage to the virus. Moreover, we evaluated the presence and the distribution in our dataset of the mutations characterizing the so called british variant, identified at the beginning of 2021, and observed that 9 out of 17 are present only in few sequences, but never in linkage with each other, suggesting a synergistic effect in this new viral strain.

This racial disparity in the COVID-19 outcomes may result from the segregation of minorities in neighborhoods with health-compromising conditions. We, thus, anticipate that neighborhoods would be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 if they are of present-day economic and racial disadvantage and were redlined historically. To test this expectation, we examined the change of both confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from April to July, 2020, in zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in the New York City using multilevel regression analysis. The results indicate that ZCTAs with a higher proportion of black and Hispanic populations are associated with a higher percentage of COVID-19 infection. Historically low-graded neighborhoods show a higher risk for COVID-19 infection, even for ZCTAs with present-day economic and racial privilege. These associations change over time as the pandemic unfolds. Racial/ethnic minorities are bearing the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic's health impact.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparing against the minimum requirement outlined in the national guidelines for medical officer interns, we filtered and identified 166 indicators from the KHFA survey questionnaire and grouped them into 12 domains. An overall capacity index was calculated as the mean of 12 domain-specific scores for each facility. RESULTS: The average overall capacity index is 69% (95% CI 66% to 72%) for all internship training centres. Hospitals have moderate capacity (over 60%) for most of the general domains, although there is huge variation between hospitals and only 29 out of 61 hospitals have five or more specialists assigned, employed, seconded or part-timeas required by the national guideline.

Common symptoms included fever (43.8%), cough (31.6%) and sore throat (16.2%); 67.3% had no comorbidities, 62.5% reported close contact with a confirmed case, and 76.7% were local infections. Transmission occurred in four main groups: religious gatherings (20.4%), corporations (15.1%), health facilities (10.3%) and a wholesale wet market (6.4%). In 31.9% of confirmed cases, an epidemiological link to an asymptomatic case was found. CONCLUSION: Transmission of the disease by asymptomatic cases should be emphasized to ensure continuous wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. Further research should be conducted to better understand the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from asymptomatic cases.","output":"Descriptive epidemiology of the first wave of COVID-19 in Petaling District, Malaysia: Focus on asymptomatic transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In March, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The absence of previous knowledge of COVID-19 has made decision-making difficult for all in health care, including surgical departments.

METHOD: We searched the electronic datasets, PubMed Database, Google, and Google Scholar, using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, surgery, recommendations, guideline, and triage. The search was limited to the first 2 months after the pandemic began and was closed on May 6, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty papers were included in the analysis and their recommendations are divided into the following categories: 1. general aspects, such as maintaining the safety of health personnel and indications for surgery. 2. The preoperative phase, with recommendations about activating different care pathways for COVID-19 positive patients. 3. The operative phase, with recommendations about activating safety measures for aerosol-generating procedures. 4.

Molecular clocks are widely used to reveal the recent evolutionary histories of viruses but may severely underestimate their longer-term origins because of the inverse correlation between inferred rates of evolution and the timescale of their measurement. Here, we provide a predictive mechanistic model that readily explains the rate decay phenomenon over a wide range of timescales and recapitulates the ubiquitous power-law rate decay with a slope of ?0.65. We show that standard substitution models fail to correctly estimate divergence times once the most rapidly evolving sites saturate, typically after hundreds of years in RNA viruses and thousands of years in DNA viruses. Our model successfully recreates the observed pattern of decay and explains the evolutionary processes behind the time-dependent rate phenomenon. We then apply our model to re-estimate the date of diversification of genotypes of hepatitis C virus to 423,000 (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 394,000C454,000) years before present, a time preceding the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and show that the most recent common ancestor of sarbecoviruses dates back to 21,000 (95% HPD: 19,000C22,000) years ago, nearly thirty times older than previous estimates.

Studies have associated Covid-19 related cardiac injury with a 5-fold increase in the risk of mechanical ventilation and 14 times higher mortality rate(1). In the presence of cardiac co-morbidities, Covid-19 related all-cause mortality rate increases. We present a case of Covid-19 infection in a patient with Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HCM) intending to discuss its sequelae. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year old male presented to ER with 2 days history of non-productive cough and dyspnea. Six months ago, he was hospitalized for 8 days with respiratory failure secondary to Covid-19 pneumonia. He was treated with remdesivir, ceftriaxone, azithromycin and dexamethasone. His past history was significant for HCM status post AICD placement, chronic diastolic heart failure with ejection fraction of 55% and hypertension.On presentation, he was hypotensive at 83/50, with a heart rate of 58 and saturation of 94% on room air. His WBC count was elevated at 12.2. Chest x-ray revealed right basal infiltrate with bilateral small pleural effusions. His presentation ECG revealed new onset atrial fibrillation (AF). Covid PCR test was negative. He was admitted to intensive care unit for vasopressor support for management of septic shock secondary to pneumonia.Therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was initiated in view of AF with CHA2DS2VASC score of 3. Echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 55-60%. Significant left ventricular outflow tract gradient consistent with HCM was noted. Due to worsening of bilateral pleural effusions, bilateral thoracocentesis was performed separately draining 650ml of hemorrhagic fluid on the left and 800ml of hemorrhagic fluid on the right. Pleural fluid (PF) analysis was exudative and cytology was negative. Re-accumulation of PF warranted bilateral chest drain placement. PF culture remained negative. Unfortunately, patient had recurrent hypovolemic shock and he opted for comfort care measures. DISCUSSION: ACE2 receptor in the respiratory epithelium serves as the entry portal for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In patients with HCM, there is up-regulation of ACE2 expression causing a 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein in sarcomeres, thereby increasing susceptibility to cardiac complications (2). Our patient in discussion had new onset AF, on the background of HCM. CONCLUSIONS: Reports indicate an increased incidence of cardiac complications in HCM patients with Covid-19 infection such as arrhythmia, as in our patient. AF in the setting of underlying HCM, can be explained by ACE2 protein up-regulation. Physicians managing HCM patients should well be aware of increased risk of such complications.

These regions often feature high proportions of asymptomatic patients with sub-microscopic parasitaemia and relapses. Naturally acquired antibody responses are induced after Plasmodium infection, providing partial protection against high parasitaemia and clinical episodes. However, previous work has failed to address the presence and maintenance of such antibody responses to P. vivax particularly in low-transmission regions. METHODS: We followed 34 patients in western Thailand after symptomatic P. vivax infections to monitor antibody kinetics over 9 months, during which no recurrent infections occurred. We assessed total IgG, IgG subclass and IgM levels to up to 52 P. vivax proteins every 2C4 weeks using a multiplexed Luminex? assay and identified protein-specific variation in antibody longevity. Mathematical modelling was used to generate the estimated half-life of antibodies, long-, and short-lived antibody-secreting cells. RESULTS: Generally, an increase in antibody level was observed within 1-week post symptomatic infection, followed by an exponential decay of different rates. We observed mostly IgG1 dominance and IgG3 sub-dominance in this population. IgM responses followed similar kinetic patterns to IgG, with some proteins unexpectedly inducing long-lived IgM responses. We also monitored antibody responses against 27 IgG-immunogenic antigens in 30 asymptomatic individuals from a similar region. Our results demonstrate that most antigens induced robust and long-lived total IgG responses following asymptomatic infections in the absence of (detected) boosting infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides new insights into the development and maintenance of naturally acquired immunity to P. vivax and will guide the potential use of serology to indicate immune status and/or identify populations at risk.

This disruption has taken many directions, one of which is the demand imbalance which occurs due to the sudden change in the cargo capacity, as well as demand. Therefore, the random change leads to excessive demand in some routes (hot-selling routes), while some other routes suffer from a big shortage of demand (underutilized routes). Routes are substitutable when there are several adjacent airports in the Origin & Destination (O&D) market. In this market, demand imbalance between substitutable routes occurs because of the above reasons. To tackle the demand imbalance problem, a novel model is introduced to estimate the quantity combinations which maintains the balance between underutilized and hot-selling routes. This model is a variant of the classic Cournot model which captures different quantity scenarios in the form of the best response for each route compared to the other. We then cultivate the model by integrating the Puppet Cournot game with the quantity discount policy. The quantity discount policy is an incentive which motivates the freight forwarders to increase their orders in the underutilized routes. After conducting numerical experiments, the results reveal that the profit can increase up to 25% by using the quantity discount. However, the quantity discount model is only applicable when the profit increase in the hot-selling route is greater than the profit decrease in the underutilized route.","output":"A novel model to manage air cargo disruptions caused by global catastrophes such as Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel parametric regression model is proposed to fit incidence data typically collected during epidemics.

The combination of increasing immune pressure due to the rollout of vaccines and a relatively high number of infections following the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions should have created perfect conditions for immune escape variants to evolve from the Delta lineage. Instead, the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529), which is hypothesised to have evolved in an immunocompromised individual, is the first major variant to exhibit significant immune escape following vaccination programmes and is set to become globally dominant in 2022. Here, we use a simple mathematical model to explore possible reasons why the Delta lineage did not exhibit antigenic evolution and to understand how and when immunocompromised individuals affect the emergence of immune escape variants. We show that when the pathogen does not have to cross a fitness valley for immune escape to occur, immunocompromised individuals have no qualitative effect on antigenic evolution (although they may accelerate immune escape if within-host evolutionary dynamics are faster in immunocompromised individuals). But if a fitness valley exists between immune escape variants at the between-host level, then persistent infections of immunocompromised individuals allow mutations to accumulate, therefore facilitating rather than simply speeding up antigenic evolution. Our results suggest that better global health equality, including improving access to vaccines and treatments for individuals who are immunocompromised (especially in lower- and middle-income countries), may be crucial to preventing the emergence of future immune escape variants of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We investigated college students attitude and compliance towards a prevention strategy involving use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Perceptual completion enables the active construction of coherent, vivid percepts from spatially discontinuous visual information that is prevalent in real-life visual scenes. Despite mounting evidence linking sensory activity enhancement and perceptual completion, surprisingly little is known about whether and how attention, a fundamental modulator of sensory activities, affects perceptual completion. Using EEG-based time-resolved inverted encoding model (IEM), we reconstructed the moment-to-moment representation of the illusory grating that resulted from spatially interpolating the orientation of surrounding inducers. We found that, despite manipulation of observers' attentional focus, the illusory grating representation unfolded in time in a similar manner. Critically, attention to the surrounding inducers simultaneously attenuated the illusory grating representation and delayed its temporal development. Our findings disclosed, for the first time, the suppressive role of selective attention in perceptual completion and were suggestive of a fast, automatic neural machinery that implements the interpolation of missing visual information.","output":"Attention impedes neural representation of interpolated orientation during perceptual completion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus 2 represents a major challenge for global public health authorities. Coronavirus disease 2019 can be fatal especially in elderly people and those with comorbidities. Currently, several vaccines against coronavirus 2 are under application in multiple countries with emergency use authorization. In the same time, many vaccine candidates are under development and assessment. It is worth noting that the design of some of these vaccines depends on the expression of receptor binding domain for viral spike protein to induce host immunity. As such, blocking the spike protein interface with antibodies, peptides or small molecular compounds can impede the ability of coronavirus 2 to invade host cells by intervention with interactions between viral spike protein and cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2. In this virtual screening study, we have used predictive webservers, molecular docking and dynamics simulation to evaluate the ability of 3000 compounds to interact with interface residues of spike protein receptor binding domain.

COVID-19 is associated with notable increases in morbidity and death worldwide. Preexisting conditions, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, are correlated with higher severity and a significant increase in the fatality rate of COVID-19. COVID-19 induces multiple cardiovascular complexities, such as cardiac arrest, myocarditis, acute myocardial injury, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias and, subsequently, heart failure (HF). The precise mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial complications are not clearly understood. The proposed mechanisms of myocardial injury based on current knowledge are the direct viral entry of the virus and damage to the myocardium, systemic inflammation, hypoxia, cytokine storm, interferon-mediated immune response, and plaque destabilization. The virus enters the cell through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor and plays a central function in the virus's pathogenesis. A systematic understanding of cardiovascular effects of SARS-CoV2 is needed to develop novel therapeutic tools to target the virus-induced cardiac damage as a potential strategy to minimize permanent damage to the cardiovascular system and reduce the morbidity.

There are few previously published studies that have examined asthma patients' use of cell phone features and their willingness to use them for self-care in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, there is no validated instrument in Arabic to test the use of cell phone functions. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the general use of cell phone features by asthma patients and their willingness to use them and to determine the frequency of use of cell phone features by asthma patients. It also aimed to translate and validate an Arabic version of the questionnaire to test the use of cell phone functions by asthma patients. Methods This study was conducted in Saudi Arabia in 2021 using an online questionnaire. The test was translated (changes were made as needed) and validated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. After validation of the instrument, the questionnaire included 34 questions divided into three sections: demographic information, current use of cell phone features, and desire to use cell phone features. Adults with asthma aged 18 years and older who owned a smartphone participated in the study. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Two hundred and seventy asthma patients completed the questionnaire. The Cronbach's alpha value of the questionnaire was 0.86, indicating its reliability and consistency. Only 39 (14.4%) of the participants use cell phones for asthma care, and 13 (4.8%) have apps for asthma care on their cell phones. However, 74.1% of participants have a desire to use a cell phone for asthma care. The majority of participating asthma patients (67.8%) occasionally used the mobile internet browser to search for asthma information. Surprisingly, most of the participating asthma patients did not show a greater desire to use methods other than the internet browser to obtain asthma information. They did, however, have a strong desire to use the news to obtain information about asthma.

This paper describes the processes involved in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 from the initial infection and subsequent destruction of type II alveolar epithelial cells by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. MAIN BODY: The activation of alveolar cells and alveolar macrophages leads to the release of large quantities of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and their translocation into the pulmonary vasculature. The presence of these inflammatory mediators in the vascular compartment leads to the activation of vascular endothelial cells platelets and neutrophils and the subsequent formation of platelet neutrophil complexes. These complexes in concert with activated endothelial cells interact to create a state of immunothrombosis. The consequence of immunothrombosis include hypercoagulation, accelerating inflammation, fibrin deposition, migration of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) producing neutrophils into the alveolar apace, activation of the NLRP3 inflammazome, increased alveolar macrophage destruction and massive tissue damage by pyroptosis and necroptosis Therapeutic combinations aimed at ameliorating immunothrombosis and preventing the development of severe COVID-19 are discussed in detail.","output":"Preventing the development of severe COVID-19 by modifying immunothrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the autumn 2020 the course Digital Movie Making was given in a fully online mode, due to the restrictions and lockdowns related to the covid-19 pandemic.

The median age was 60 years (range, 19\\\\86 years), and 71% had an annual income <$40,000. A change in employment status and early stage cancer (stage I and II) were associated with an increase in financial distress (P < .001 and P = .008, respectively). Early stage cancer and telehealth participation were significantly associated with increased worry about future finances (P = .017 and P = .04, respectively).

But, one of the major problems of COVID-19 diagnostics is the presentation of a wide range of symptoms which varies among different patients and needs early diagnosis for better management. Even though RT-qPCR is a precise molecular technique false negative results may be obtained. On the other hand, CRISPR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection approaches are cost and time efficient, highly sensitive and specific, and do not require sophisticated instruments. Moreover, they also show promise for increased scalability and diagnostic tests can be carried out at the point-of-care (POC). The CRISPR can be customized to the target of any genomic region of interest within the desired genome possessing a broad range of other applications and has been efficiently implemented for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The CRISPR/Cas systems provide the specific gene targeting with immense potential to develop new generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Moreover, with the CRISPR/Cas based therapeutics, multiplexing is possible, where different sgRNAs or crRNAs can be guided to more than one target within the same gene thus decreasing the possibility of viral escape mutants. As an exceptionally efficient tool CRISPR/Cas13 and CARVER (Cas13-assisted restriction of viral expression and readout) systems can be implemented to target a broad range of ssRNA viruses that can be used for both, diagnosis and treatment for a variety of viral diseases including SARS-CoV-2.

More often it was stated that everything falls under His providence. The earthly origin of the virus remained mostly unaddressed, as well as eschatological interpretations, contrary to our expectations. We conclude that the main narrative is a general message of repentance, rather than a concrete theological application to the dynamic of the virus, its origins and its subsequent spread. In some cases, virus jargon even was used as a tool just to further accentuate general tendencies of reformed pietist theology. ?

To perform these procedures, the practitioner needs an extensive knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous system, vasculature, and pathological conditions that affect their physiology. A working knowledge of radiation biology and safety is essential. Similarly, a sufficient volume of clinical and interventional experience, first as a trainee and then as a practitioner, is required so that these treatments can be delivered safely and effectively. METHODS This document has been prepared under the aegis of the Society of Neurological Surgeons and its Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training in conjunction with the Joint Section of Cerebrovascular Surgery for the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology. RESULTS The material herein outlines the requirements for institutional accreditation of training programs in neuroendovascular surgery, as well as those needed to obtain individual subspecialty certification, as agreed on by Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training, the Society of Neurological Surgeons, and the aforementioned Societies. This document also clarifies the pathway to certification through an advanced practice track mechanism for those current practitioners of this subspecialty who trained before Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training standards were formulated. CONCLUSIONS Representing neuroendovascular surgery physicians from neurosurgery, neuroradiology, and neurology, the above mentioned societies seek to standardize neuroendovascular surgery training to ensure the highest quality delivery of this subspecialty within the United States.","output":"Training Standards in Neuroendovascular Surgery: Program Accreditation and Practitioner Certification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high demand for organs for transplantation has made it necessary to consider using the youngest of potential donors in order to increase the organ supply. Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. This is a chart review with the objective to analyse the results achieved with transplantation of children kidneys ( 2 years) in the HCFMRP-USP from 1998 to 2000. A total of 5 pacients received en bloc renal transplants from donors aged 9 months to 2 years old, weighthing between 8 and 14 kg. Results: Only one patient lost the allograft within 8 days of transplantation due to allograft trombosis. Two patients had ureteral complications, one with ureteral necrosis and urinary fistula and the other with total ureterovesical anastomosis disrupture. Both were successfully repaired. Intra operatory complication was experienced in one pacient, with arterial anastomosis rupture. In loco reperfusion and repair was made. Another patient had inferior renal pole rupture, treated with polar nefrectomy at the 4o PO. Despite such problems, mean follow up of 20,7 months showed serum creatinine ranging from 0,9 to 2 mg/100ml, with no serious complications.

Many chronic diseases have been linked to risk factors such as poor diet and physical inactivity. Data for these behavioral risk factors are usually obtained from surveys, which can be delayed by years. Behavioral data from digital sources, including social media and search engines, could be used for timely monitoring of behavioral risk factors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to propose the use of digital data from internet sources for monitoring changes in behavioral risk factors in Africa. METHODS: We obtained the adjusted volume of search queries submitted to Google for 108 terms related to diet, exercise, and disease from 2010 to 2016. We also obtained the obesity and overweight prevalence for 52 African countries from the World Health Organization (WHO) for the same period. Machine learning algorithms (ie, random forest, support vector machine, Bayes generalized linear model, gradient boosting, and an ensemble of the individual methods) were used to identify search terms and patterns that correlate with changes in obesity and overweight prevalence across Africa. Out-of-sample predictions were used to assess and validate the model performance. RESULTS: The study included 52 African countries. In 2016, the WHO reported an overweight prevalence ranging from 20.9% (95% credible interval [CI] 17.1%-25.0%) to 66.8% (95% CI 62.4%-71.0%) and an obesity prevalence ranging from 4.5% (95% CI 2.9%-6.5%) to 32.5% (95% CI 27.2%-38.1%) in Africa. The highest obesity and overweight prevalence were noted in the northern and southern regions. Google searches for diet-, exercise-, and obesity-related terms explained 97.3% (root-mean-square error [RMSE] 1.15) of the variation in obesity prevalence across all 52 countries. Similarly, the search data explained 96.6% (RMSE 2.26) of the variation in the overweight prevalence. The search terms yoga, exercise, and gym were most correlated with changes in obesity and overweight prevalence in countries with the highest prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Information-seeking patterns for diet- and exercise-related terms could indicate changes in attitudes toward and engagement in risk factors or healthy behaviors. These trends could capture population changes in risk factor prevalence, inform digital and physical interventions, and supplement official data from surveys.","output":"Monitoring Information-Seeking Patterns and Obesity Prevalence in Africa With Internet Search Data: Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread cancelation of cultural events during the early 2020 stages of the COVID-19 pandemic led professional performing musicians across the world to experience an increasing economic fragility that threatened their health and wellbeing. Within this new normal, developing countries have been at a higher risk due to their vulnerable health systems and cultural policies. Even in such difficult times, the music profession requires musicians to keep up their practicing routines, even if they have no professional commitments. This is because high level technical and expressive skills are crucial to sustaining a music career at a high performance level. However, it could be expected that not all musicians might have had the same engagement with music practice during lockdowns. In this study, we studied the experiences of 309 professional classical musicians based in European and Latin American countries with different levels of performing experience to examine their passionate (or lack thereof) engagement with music practice. Through the mixed methods combination of multigroup invariance and narrative analyses, we identified distinct profiles of musicians who displayed more harmonious or more obsessive passion orientations before and at the peak of the pandemic. We observed that musicians with higher levels of harmonious passion in particular were more capable of sustaining their practice at the peak of the pandemic and that these musicians were mostly located in Latin Americaa paradox, considering that cultural politics supporting the careers of professional performing musicians and entrepreneurial education in Latin America are lacking to a great extent, especially in comparison with the European context.

While MR-proADM is useful for risk stratification in patients with sepsis, clinical data about prediction accuracy in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) is currently missing. Methods: We included consecutively adult patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19 at a tertiary care center in Switzerland between February and April 2020. We investigated the association of MR-proADM levels with in-hospital mortality in logistic regression and discrimination analyses. Results: Of 89 included COVID-19 patients, 19% (n=17) died while in the hospital. Median admission MR-proADM levels (nmol/L) were increased almost 1.5-fold increased in non-survivors compared to survivors (1.3 [interquartile range IQR 1.1-2.3]) vs. 0.8 [IQR 0.7-1.1]) and showed good discrimination (area under the curve 0.78). An increase of 1 nmol/L of admission MR-proADM was independently associated with a more than fivefold increase in in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 5.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4-21.4, p=0.015). An admission MR-proADM threshold of 0.93 nmol/L showed the best prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 93%, a specificity of 60% and a negative predictive value of 97%. Kinetics of follow-up MR-proADM provided further prognostic information for in-hospital treatment.

The former [8 + 2] reaction is stepwise, starting from attack of the diene substituent on furan, not the furyl moiety in dienylfurans, to DMAD to give a diradical intermediate, which then undergoes ring closure to form the second bond between DMAD and the furan moiety, generating the final [8 + 2] cycloadducts. In contrast, the latter [8 + 2] reaction starts from [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the diene in the furan ring of dienylisobenzofurans toward DMAD, followed by the rate-determining stepwise [1,5]-vinyl shift, forming the [8 + 2] products. The different mechanisms of [8 + 2] reactions are attributed to the facts that for dienylfurans, the reactive diene part is the diene substituent on furan, but in the case of dienylisobenzofurans, it is the diene in the furan ring (its reaction with DMAD to generate an aromatic benzene ring is the driving force for this regiochemistry). Consequently, the [8 + 2] reactions begin with the reaction of the most reactive part of tetraene (either the diene substituent on furan for dienylfurans or the diene in the furan ring for dienylisobenzofurans) with DMAD. FMO analysis and kinetic study have been carried out to gain more information of the reaction mechanisms. Two [8 + 2] reactions of dienylisobenzofurans with different substituents toward DMAD have also been further analyzed by DFT calculations in this paper.","output":"Density Functional Theory Study of Mechanisms of [8 + 2] Cycloadditions of Dienylfurans/Dienylisobenzofurans with DMAD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In late 2019, an outbreak of a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in Wuhan, China. A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever. During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We examined the characteristics of these patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24  18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. RESULTS: Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had a fever (>37.2C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42  13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P < .05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases.

Heterozygous variants of SETD1A involved in histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation were previously identified in individuals with schizophrenia. Here, we define the clinical features of the Mendelian syndrome associated with haploinsufficiency of SETD1A by investigating 15 predominantly pediatric individuals who all have de novo SETD1A variants. These individuals present with a core set of symptoms comprising global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, subtle facial dysmorphisms, behavioral and psychiatric problems. We examined cellular phenotypes in three patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with three variants: p.Gly535Alafs*12, c.4582-2_4582delAG, and p.Tyr1499Asp. These patient cell lines displayed DNA damage repair defects that were comparable to previously observed RNAi-mediated depletion of SETD1A. This suggested that these variants, including the p.Tyr1499Asp in the catalytic SET domain, behave as loss-of-function (LoF) alleles. Previous studies demonstrated a role for SETD1A in cell cycle control and differentiation. However, individuals with SETD1A variants do not show major structural brain defects or severe microcephaly, suggesting that defective proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitors is unlikely the single underlying cause of the disorder. We show here that the Drosophila melanogaster SETD1A orthologue is required in postmitotic neurons of the fly brain for normal memory, suggesting a role in post development neuronal function. Together, this study defines a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dominant de novo LoF variants in SETD1A and further supports a role for H3K4 methyltransferases in the regulation of neuronal processes underlying normal cognitive functioning.","output":"Characterization of SETD1A haploinsufficiency in humans and Drosophila defines a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Japan, both the prevalence of the elderly and super\\\\elderly and those of acute heart failure (AHF) have been increasing rapidly.

The present study was planned to evaluate the performance of the cartridge-based Abbott ID NOW test by comparing it to the currently used standard probe-based real-time RT-PCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in the eastern part of India after getting institutional ethics committee (IEC) approval. Two hundred fifty-nine cases of various age groups of both sexes who were advised for testing for SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected according to protocol advisory by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), India. Dry swabs were sent for Abbott ID NOW testing and swabs in viral transport medium were sent for probe-based RT-PCR assay using the CoviPath kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bangalore, India). The data were collected and statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for ID NOW were calculated taking RT-PCR as the gold standard. Results: Out of 259 patients enrolled in the study, 49% were symptomatic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 20.84% among the study population. Sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values of ID NOW test in comparison to RT-PCR assay was found to be 87%, 98%, 92.1% and 96.8% respectively.

The pregnant state, with alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes due to a gravid uterus and slightly immunocompromised state may predispose patients to a more rapidly deteriorating clinical course and can get a greater risk of harm for both the mother and fetus. Therefore, this systematic review was aimed to assess the effect of coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) during pregnancy and its possibility of vertical maternalCfetal transmission. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library until the end of April. All authors independently extracted all necessary data using excel spreadsheet form. Only published articles with fully accessible data on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV, MARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 were included. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes were extracted and analyzed. RESULT: Out of 879 articles reviewed, 39 studies involving 1316 pregnant women were included. The most common clinical features were fever, cough, and myalgia with prevalence ranging from 30 to 97%, while lymphocytopenia and C-reactive protein were the most common abnormal laboratory findings (55C100%). Pneumonia was the most diagnosed clinical symptom of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 infection with prevalence ranged from 71 to 89%. Bilateral pneumonia (57.9%) and ground-glass opacity (65.8%) were the most common CT imaging reported. The most common treatment options used were hydroxychloroquine (79.7%), ribavirin (65.2%), and oxygen therapy (78.8%). Regarding maternal outcome, the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks of gestation was 14.3%, preeclampsia (5.9%), miscarriage (14.5%, preterm premature rupture of membranes (9.2%) and fetal growth restriction (2.8%). From the total coronavirus infected pregnant women, 56.9% delivered by cesarean, 31.3% admitted to ICU, while 2.7% were died. Among the perinatal outcomes, fetal distress rated (26.5%), neonatal asphyxia rated (1.4%). Only, 1.2% of neonates had apgar score < 7 at 5 min. Neonate admitted to ICU was rated 11.3%, while the rate of perinatal death was 2.2%. In the current review, none of the studies reported transmission of CoV from the mother to the fetus in utero during the study period. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus infection is more likely to affect pregnant women. Respiratory infectious diseases have demonstrated an increased risk of adverse maternal obstetrical complications than the general population due to physiological changes occurred during pregnancy.

Both arterial and venous thromboembolic events (TE) due to alterations in the hemostatic system and prothrombotic state are widely reported in patients with CS, more so postoperatively. Increased mortality, if not appropriately treated, is largely due to cardiovascular events and infections. RECENT FINDINGS Patients with CS have markedly increased risk of thromboembolic episodes compared to the general population. The prothrombotic state is mediated by increased levels of procoagulant factors, but also by an impaired fibrinolytic capacity. All contribute to TE, atherosclerosis, and subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Some abnormalities progressively improve after CS remission, but do not fully normalize for at least 1 year or more. SUMMARY Due to the additional thrombotic risk of surgery or any invasive procedure, anticoagulation prophylaxis should be at least considered in patients with CS and balanced with individual bleeding risk.

Upon activation of these pathways, complement component C4 is proteolytically cleaved, and the major product C4b is deposited on the activator, enabling assembly of a C3 convertase and downstream alternative pathway amplification. Although excessive activation of the lectin and classical pathways contributes to multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and overexpression of a C4 isoform has recently been linked to schizophrenia, a C4 inhibitor and structural characterization of the convertase formed by C4b is lacking. In this study, we present the nanobody hC4Nb8 that binds with picomolar affinity to human C4b and potently inhibits in vitro complement C3 deposition through the classical and lectin pathways in human serum and in mouse serum. The crystal structure of the C4b:hC4Nb8 complex and a three-dimensional reconstruction of the C4bC2 proconvertase obtained by electron microscopy together rationalize how hC4Nb8 prevents proconvertase assembly through recognition of a neoepitope exposed in C4b and reveals a unique C2 conformation compared with the alternative pathway proconvertase. On human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, the nanobody prevents C3 deposition through the classical pathway. Furthermore, hC4Nb8 inhibits the classical pathway-mediated immune complex delivery to follicular dendritic cells in vivo. The hC4Nb8 represents a novel ultrahigh-affinity inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade under both in vitro and in vivo conditions.","output":"An Ultrahigh-Affinity Complement C4b-Specific Nanobody Inhibits In Vivo Assembly of the Classical Pathway Proconvertase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 attacks various organs, most destructively the lung, and cellular entry requires two host cell surface proteins: ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

We show here that treatment with the antiandrogen enzalutamidea well-tolerated drug widely used in advanced prostate cancerreduces TMPRSS2 levels in human lung cells and in mouse lung. Importantly, antiandrogens significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in lung cells. In support of this experimental data, analysis of existing datasets shows striking co-expression of AR and TMPRSS2, including in specific lung cell types targeted by SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study was performed in an 11-bed, level 3 pediatric intensive care unit. Evaluation was made of 30 pediatric patients receiving airway pressure release ventilation as rescue therapy for severe ARDS. RESULTS: Patients were switched to APRV on an average 3.2  2.6 d following intubation. When changed from conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) to APRV, there was an expected increase in the SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (165.1  13.6 vs. 131.7  10.2; p = 0.035).

The carbohydrates on the RBD proteins were enzymatically modulated and the effect on antibody reactivity was evaluated with serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Removal of all carbohydrates diminished antibody reactivity while removal of only sialic acids or terminal fucoses improved the reactivity. The RBD produced in Lec3.2.8.1-cells, which generate carbohydrate structures devoid of sialic acids and with reduced fucose content, exhibited enhanced antibody reactivity verifying the importance of these specific monosaccharides.

The present study examined whether middle-aged and older adults perceptions of their own and their partners memory abilities were related to self-reported impact of the pandemic on daily life (e.g., limited social interactions, delayed health care, and disruption to routine). In a sample of 80 married individuals (49% female; age range 40-86 years), we found that participants beliefs about the impact of the pandemic on daily life and their depression ratings significantly predicted (p<0.05) their perceptions of their partners prospective memory abilities. Specifically, pandemic impact on daily life predicted 9.3% of the variance in participants reported perceptions of their partners prospective memory abilities, and participant depression ratings predicted an additional 5.1% of the variance. Surprisingly, these variables did not predict perceptions of participants own cognition or perceptions of partners retrospective memory abilities. In sum, people who reported greater impact of the pandemic on their lives were more likely to believe that their partner frequently forgot to carryout prospective memory intentions (e.g., failed to pass along a message or take medication), and depression further clouded their perception of their partners cognition. These findings should be extended to consider relationship quality and whether individuals consider their partners a reliable source of external memory support during times of life disruption.","output":"Perceptions of Partner Cognitive Ability During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The available data to determine the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) burden in Saudi Arabia are scarce. Therefore, this study closely examines and tracks the trends of the COPD burden in Saudi Arabia from 1990 to 2019 using the dataset of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019. METHODS: This study used the GBD 2019 dataset to analyse the COPD prevalence, incidence, morbidity and mortality rates in the Saudi Arabian population from 1990 to 2019, stratified by sex and age. The age-standardised rate was used to determine the prevalence, incidence, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths. RESULTS: In 2019, an estimated 434,560.64 people (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI) 396,011.72C473,596.71) had COPD in Saudi Arabia, corresponding to an increase of 329.82% compared with the number of diagnosed people in 1990 [101,104.05 (95% UI 91,334.4C111,223.91)]. The prevalence rate of COPD increased by 49%, from 1,381.26 (1,285.35C1,484.96) cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 2,053.04 (1918.06C2194.29) cases per 100,000 in 2019, and this trend was higher in males than females. The incidence rate of COPD in 2019 was 145.06 (136.62C154.76) new cases per 100,000, representing an increase of 43.4% from the 1990 incidence rate [101.18 (95.27C107.86)]. In 2019, the DALYs rate was 508.15 (95% UI 434.85C581.58) per 100,000 population. This was higher in males than females, with a 14.12% increase among males. In 2019, YLLs contributed to 63.6% of DALYs due to COPD. The death rate due to COPD was 19.6 (95% UI 15.94C23.39) deaths per 100 000 in 2019, indicating a decrease of 41.44% compared with the death rate in 1990 [33.55 deaths per 100 000 (95% UI 25.13C47.69)]. In 2019, COPD deaths accounted for 1.65% (1.39C1.88) of the total of deaths in Saudi Arabia and 57% of all deaths caused by chronic respiratory diseases. CONCLUSION: Over the period 1990C2019, the prevalence and incidence of COPD in Saudi Arabia have been steadily rising. Even though COPD morbidity and death rates have been decreasing, they remain higher in men and older age. The holistic assessment and interventions with careful attention to optimising the community-based primary care management, such as screening for early diagnosis, smoking cessation programs and pulmonary rehabilitation, are likely to be the most successful strategies to reduce the burden of COPD in Saudi Arabia.","output":"Prevalence, incidence, morbidity and mortality rates of COPD in Saudi Arabia: Trends in burden of COPD from 1990 to 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that acts in all living systems as a homeostatic network regulator through many pathways, which are adenosine receptor (AR)-dependent and -independent. From a metabolic point of view, adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an essential protein in the regulation of the total intracellular and extracellular adenosine in a tissue. In addition to its cytosolic localization, ADA is also expressed as an ecto-enzyme on the surface of different cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26) and some ARs act as binding proteins for extracellular ADA in humans. Since CD26 and ARs interact with ADA at opposite sites, we have investigated if ADA can function as a cell-to-cell communication molecule by bridging the anchoring molecules CD26 and A(2A)R present on the surfaces of the interacting cells. By combining site-directed mutagenesis of ADA amino acids involved in binding to A(2A)R and a modification of the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technique that allows detection of interactions between two proteins expressed in different cell populations with low steric hindrance (NanoBRET), we show direct evidence of the specific formation of trimeric complexes CD26-ADA-A(2A)R involving two cells. By dynamic mass redistribution assays and ligand binding experiments, we also demonstrate that A(2A)R-NanoLuc fusion proteins are functional. The existence of this ternary complex is in good agreement with the hypothesis that ADA could bridge T-cells (expressing CD26) and dendritic cells (expressing A(2A)R). This is a new metabolic function for ecto-ADA that, being a single chain protein, it has been considered as an example of moonlighting protein, because it performs more than one functional role (as a catalyst, a costimulator, an allosteric modulator and a cell-to-cell connector) without partitioning these functions in different subunits.","output":"Molecular Evidence of Adenosine Deaminase Linking Adenosine A(2A) Receptor and CD26 Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered approaches to anesthesiology education by shifting educational paradigms. This vision paper discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19 and evidence for these modifications and suggests future directions for anesthesiology education.Learning management systems provide structure to online learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations, the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs. Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed curricular options.The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational knowledge prior to teaching sessions with a focus on application during structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate focused pre-class work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions interactive.Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients. Multidisciplinary, in-situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost.

PURPOSE: In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. METHODS: To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19.

Individuals carrying a heterozygous nonsense, frameshift or missense variant in CFH presented with significantly decreased FH levels and significantly increased C3bBbP levels in plasma compared to non-carrier controls. FH and C3bBbP plasma levels were relatively stable over time in samples collected during follow-up visits. Decreased FH and increased C3bBbP concentrations were observed in carriers compared to non-carriers of CFH variants among different AMD stages, with the exception of C3bBbP levels in advanced AMD stages, which were equally high in carriers and non-carriers. In AMD families, FH levels were decreased in carriers compared to non-carriers, but C3bBbP levels did not differ. Rare variants in the CFH gene can lead to reduced FH levels or reduced FH function as measured by increased C3bBbP levels.

However, the existing evidence is inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 symptoms, and mortality among PLWH and patients without HIV. METHOD: The articles included studies published in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane between December 1, 2019, and December 1, 2021. We included the original studies published in English focusing on observational studies assessing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 symptoms, and mortality among PLWH. Four independent reviewers extracted data. STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology-Modified (STROBE-M) checklist was used for quality assessment. For the results with heterogeneity I(2) >75%, a random-effects model was employed. Otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 symptoms, and mortality were compared with and without HIV. RESULTS: We included a total of 32 studies and 71,779,737 study samples, of whom 797,564 (1.11%) were PLWH. Compared with COVID-19 patients without HIV infection, PLWH had comparable risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (adjusted Risk Ratio=1.07, 95% CI: 0.53-2.16, I(2 =) 96%, study n=6, n=20,199,805) and risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms (aRR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.97-1.16, I(2 =) 75%, n=10, n=2,243,370). PLWH, if infected with SARS-CoV-2, were found to have an increased risk of mortality compared with people without HIV (aRR=1.30, 95% CI: 1.09-1.56, I(2 =) 76%, study n=16, n=71,032,659). This finding was consistent across different subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: PLWH are at increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality once infected. The local health system should, on the one hand, strengthen COVID-19 prevention and clinical management among PLWH to avoid infection and, on the other hand, sustain the HIV care continuum for PLWH for HIV management.","output":"Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of The Interaction Between HIV Infection And COVID-19: Two Years Evidence Summary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Bney Brak city tops Israel's COVID-19 infection rate and mortality.

In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-&#945; and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause's male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients.

This survey examined the associations between psychological features, and several demographic and social factors among dental students in German universities. Dental students registered in German universities nationwide were asked to join this survey via a self-directed online questionnaire, from July 2020 to January 2021. This study assembled data on demographic statistics, the depression anxiety stress scales (DASS-21), and the impact of events scalerevised (IES-R) instrument. The relationships between demographic-related variables and mental consequences of depression, anxiety, stress, intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal were inspected. Two hundred and eleven students contributed to the questionnaire and conveyed overall normal or mild outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal. In addition, female gender, cardiovascular diseases, smoking habits, and seeing the COVID-19 outbreak as a financial risk were stated as significant related factors (p < 0.05), with increased IES-R and DASS-21 scores.

In this review, we summarize the underlying pathophysiology of ABO blood groups and COVID-19 to explain the molecular aspects behind the protective mechanism in the O blood group. A or B antigens are not associated with a different risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than that of other antigens. In this case, the cornerstone is natural anti-A and anti-B antibodies from the ABO system. They are capable of interfering with the S protein (SARS-CoV-2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2;host cell receptor), thereby conferring protection to patients with sufficient antibodies (O blood group). Indeed, the titers of natural antibodies and the IgG isotype (specific to the O blood group) may be determinants of susceptibility and severity. Moreover, older adults are associated with a higher risk of bad outcomes due to the lack of antibodies and the upregulation of ACE2 expression during senescence. A better understanding of the role of the molecular mechanism of ABO blood groups in COVID-19 facilitates better prognostic stratification of the disease.

A supplementation of exogenous antioxidants can reduce the total amount of ROS during exercise while it may also affect the ROS' role in the signaling pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis. It has been suggested that hydrogen gas, as an antioxidant, can selectively scavenge hydroxyl radicals but does not affect superoxide anion's signal transduction. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 1-h hydrogen gas inhalation 30min prior to a treadmill exercise on the key biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis and related signaling pathways, and the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes, with those of vitamin C, in the rat skeletal muscle. Eighty-one 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to three interventions (exercise-only, exercise+4%H2, and exercise+vitamin C at 500mg/kg weight, with 27 rats under each intervention), and sampled at pre-, immediately post and 4h post a 60-min treadmill exercise at speed of 27m/min and flat inclination, with nine rats in each sub-group. Expression of mitochondrial biogenetic markers and related signaling molecules in gastrocnemius muscle, and concentrations of oxidative stress markers in serum were measured. Two-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis analyses showed that both hydrogen inhalation and vitamin C supplementation significantly reduced serum levels of MDA immediately after exercise and AGEs 4h after exercise. The pre-exercise supplement of vitamin C significantly reduced mitochondrial complex IV concentrations and PGC-1, NRF-1, TFAM gene expression levels compared to the pre-exercise group, but the hydrogen gas intervention did not result in a reduction in these measurements. Unlike vitamin C, hydrogen inhalation did not blunt post-exercise mitochondrial biogenetic signals, but resulted in an increase in complex IV concentration, activation of PGC-1, and TFAM and NRF-2 gene transcription, and up-regulation of PGC-1 protein expression. The findings indicated that hydrogen gas inhalation could play the role as an effective antioxidant in response to the exercise, whilst it did not significantly affect mitochondrial biogenesis.

The mucin MUC5B is an important component of the innate immune response and expression levels are associated with the MUC5B promoter polymorphism, rs35705950. The high expressing T-allele of rs35705950 is an accepted risk allele for a non-infectious aging lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, given the theory of trade-offs in aging lung disease and the importance of high expression for an adequate immune response, we hypothesize that the T-allele is protective against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We collected demographics, radiology, survival data and MUC5B rs35705950 allele status for 108 patients requiring hospitalisation for COVID-19 at St Antonius Hospital in The Netherlands. For comparison of allele frequencies and allele carriership with a white control cohort, the patient cohort was divided in a white (n=83) and non-white cohort. Results The patients had a median age of 66 years and consisted predominantly of males (74%) and 23 patients (21%) died. The T-allele frequencies of rs35705950 in white patients was 0.04 which was significantly lower than the T-allele frequency of 0.10 in white controls (p= 0.02). Moreover, comparison of the number of carriers and non-carriers of the T allele showed that only 8.4% of patients carried the T-allele versus 18% of controls (p=0.029; OR= 0.41, CI=0.19-0.94). Conclusions The MUC5B rs35705950 promoter polymorphism associates with COVID-19. The risk allele (T) for IPF is protective against the development of severe COVID-19 disease.

The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. RESULTS Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms.

Data on disease progression in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are limited. METHODS: We examined the electronic medical records of all SOT recipients with COVID\\\\19 from 12 Massachusetts hospitals between February 1, and May 6, 2020. We analyzed the demographics, clinical parameters, course, and outcomes of illness in these patients. RESULTS: Of 52 COVID\\\\19\\\\positive SOT patients, 77% were hospitalized and 35% required ICU admission. Sixty\\\\nine percent of hospitalized patients had immunosuppression reduced, 6% developed suspected rejection. Co\\\\infections occurred in 45% in ICU vs 5% in non\\\\ICU patients (P = .037). A biphasic pattern of evolution of laboratory tests was observed. In the first 5 days of illness, inflammatory markers were moderately increased. Subsequently, WBC, CRP, ferritin, and D Dimer increased with increasing stay in the ICU, and lymphocyte counts were similar. Five patients (16%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SOT is associated with high rate of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death from COVID\\\\19 compared to data in the general population of patients with COVID\\\\19. Despite reduction in immunosuppression, suspected rejection was rare. The clinical course and trend of laboratory biomarkers is biphasic with a later, pronounced peak in inflammatory markers seen in those admitted to an ICU.

To identify subgroups of patients where artificial intelligence (AI) can be of particular value and analyse what imaging features may have contributed to the performance of AI by means of visualisation techniques. METHODS: CXR of 487 patients were classified into [4] categoriesnormal, classical COVID, indeterminate, and non-COVID by consensus opinion of 2 radiologists. CXR which were classified as normal and indeterminate were then subjected to analysis by AI, and final categorisation provided as guided by prediction of the network. Precision and recall of the radiologist alone and radiologist assisted by AI were calculated in comparison to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold standard. Attention maps of the CNN were analysed to understand regions in the CXR important to the AI algorithm in making a prediction. RESULTS: The precision of radiologists improved from 65.9 to 81.9% and recall improved from 17.5 to 71.75 when assistance with AI was provided. AI showed 92% accuracy in classifying normal CXR into COVID or non-COVID. Analysis of attention maps revealed attention on the cardiac shadow in these normal radiographs. CONCLUSION: This study shows how deployment of an AI algorithm can complement a human expert in the determination of COVID status. Analysis of the detected features suggests possible subtle cardiac changes, laying ground for further investigative studies into possible cardiac changes. KEY POINTS: ? Through an ambispective clinical study, we show how assistance with an AI algorithm can improve recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value) of radiologists in assessing CXR for possible COVID in comparison to RT-PCR. ? We show that AI achieves the best results in images classified as normal by radiologists. We conjecture that possible subtle cardiac in the CXR, imperceptible to the human eye, may have contributed to this prediction. ? The reported results may pave the way for a human computer collaboration whereby the expert with some help from the AI algorithm achieves higher accuracy in predicting COVID status on CXR than previously thought possible when considering either alone.

The entrepreneurship of college students in the field of intangible culture is studied from the perspective of entrepreneurial psychology. First, the related characteristics, main content, and research status of college entrepreneurship education are described in detail. Entrepreneurial psychology is divided into entrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurial emotion and entrepreneurial will. Then, the concept and development status of intangible cultural heritage are briefly summarized to illustrate the importance of inheriting and developing intangible cultural heritage. A questionnaire is designed based on intangible cultural heritage development mode to interview local college students randomly. Finally, the results are analyzed by descriptive statistics. The results show that massive students do not understand the entrepreneurial policy, and only 16% of them know it very well. More than 30% of the students think that entrepreneurship will improve personal responsibility. Nearly 50% of the students believe that entrepreneurship can increase their life experience. Almost 50% of the students have the psychological quality of persistence and courage in entrepreneurship. The final results show that there are great differences in entrepreneurial cognition among students of different grades. Regarding entrepreneurial emotion, there are obvious differences among students of different genders, disciplines, and grades. Regarding the entrepreneurial will, there are only differences among students with different grades. In entrepreneurship education, different teaching methods should be adopted for different ages to comprehensively improve the effect of entrepreneurship education for students of all grades and help them obtain good entrepreneurship results.

While clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of BLT in ameliorating depression for outpatients, studies examining BLT in the psychiatric inpatient setting are currently lacking. AIM The purpose of this study is to explore whether BLT as adjunctive treatment for depressive symptoms on an acute psychiatric floor is feasible and explore associated changes in depressive symptoms. METHODS An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted at State University of New York (SUNY) Upstate 4B acute inpatient psychiatric unit. BLT was administered to participating patients as adjunctive therapy to their psychopharmacological and psychotherapy treatments on a daily basis throughout their hospitalization. Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Outcome Questionnaire-45.2 (OQ-45.2) were administered before commencing BLT and after their last BLT session. Changes to the aforementioned measures before and after BLT treatment, the dose response of measure changes based on number of sessions, and the hospital length of stay along with the secondary factors such as age, gender, other psychiatric comorbidities, social factors, and psychiatric medications were analyzed. RESULTS BLT is feasible on acute psychiatric inpatient floor with adherence of 94% and has very few side effects. The repeated measures of depression and functioning demonstrated significant decrease in depression and improvement in functioning. Although not statistically significant, clinical meaningful dose-response relationship was found between a number of BLT sessions and improvement in depressive symptoms with five BLT sessions being an optimal amount for depression amelioration. CONCLUSION BLT combined with the ongoing psychopharmacological treatment was well tolerated and easy to administer. It offers a simple, safe, and cost-effective approach to augmenting depressive treatment on an acute psychiatric floor.","output":"Feasibility of Adjunctive Bright Light Therapy for Depressive Symptoms on an Acute Psychiatric Floor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic on international politics are still being studied and no concrete assumptions can be made regarding a new post-COVID world order.

Researchers have focused their attention on cyber insurance during the last decade. One of the primary issues related to cyber insurance is estimating the premium. The effect of network topology has been heavily explored in the previous three years in cyber risk modeling. However, none of the approaches has assessed the influence of clustering structures. Numerous earlier investigations have indicated that internal links within a cluster reduce transmission speed or efficacy. As a result, the clustering coefficient metric becomes crucial in understanding the effectiveness of viral transmission. We provide a modified Markov-based dynamic model in this paper that incorporates the influence of the clustering structure on calculating cyber insurance premiums. The objective is to create less expensive and less homogenous premiums by combining criteria other than degrees. This research proposes a novel method for calculating premiums that gives a competitive market price. We integrated the epidemic inhibition function into the Markov-based model by considering three functions: quadratic, linear, and exponential. Theoretical and numerical evaluations of regular networks suggested that premiums were more realistic than premiums without clustering. Validation on a real network showed a significant improvement in premiums compared to premiums without the clustering structure component despite some variations. Furthermore, the three functions demonstrated very high correlations between the premium, the total inhibition function of neighbors, and the speed of the inhibition function. Thus, the proposed method can provide application flexibility by adapting to specific company requirements and network configurations.","output":"Pricing of cyber insurance premiums using a Markov-based dynamic model with clustering structure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Though the socio-emotional significance of psychiatric diagnoses and the frequency of transitions between diagnostic classifications are widely acknowledged, minimal research reveals how diagnostic shifts are subjectively experienced by psychiatric service-users. AIM: This study investigated how adult service-users make sense of diagnostic shifts and their impacts on one's life. METHODS: Twenty-seven people with self-reported experiences of diagnostic shifts opted into this qualitative study. Virtual narrative interviews invited participants to share their diagnosis stories. Interview transcripts were analyzed using narrative thematic analysis to identify common and divergent experiences across participants. RESULTS: Diverse experiences of diagnostic shifts were related: diagnostic shifts could both promote and undermine clinical trust, therapeutic engagement and self-understanding. The analysis suggested that shared and divergent experiences could be attributed to two dimensions of narratives: participants' Interpretations of Diagnostic Shifts and Diagnosis-Specific Factors. Regarding the former, analysis produced a typology of three possible interpretations of diagnostic shifts, which were linked with consistently different antecedents, experiences and consequences. The latter dimension captured how experiences of diagnostic shifts also hinged on the unique meanings ascribed to the specific diagnoses gained and lost, particularly in relation to their perceived severity, stigma, personal associations, and related communities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed how diagnostic shifts can be experienced as both traumatic and life-enhancing, depending on their social and subjective context.

Courts could be expected to understand the coronavirus context and would take this into account should there be a complaint against the clinician about access to care.The suspension of routine dental care to save lives will lead to the closure of many dental practices due to substantial financial impact. The return to routine care will be slow, with prioritisation of non-aerosol generating procedures while we look to further understand methods to mitigate transmission risk via infected aerosol and spatter.

For this purpose, a rapid alternative diagnostic choice to prevent COVID-19 spread among individuals must be implemented as an automatic detection method. In this article, the multi-objective optimization and deep learning-based technique for identifying infected patients with coronavirus using X-rays is proposed. J48 decision tree approach classifies the deep feature of corona affected X-ray images for the efficient detection of infected patients. In this study, 11 different convolutional neural network-based (CNN) models (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet) are developed for detection of infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images. The efficiency of the proposed model is tested using k-fold cross-validation method. Moreover, the parameters of CNN deep learning model are tuned using multi-objective spotted hyena optimizer (MOSHO). Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the X-ray images at a good accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and F1-score rates. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms competitive models in terms of well-known performance metrics. Hence, the proposed model is useful for real-time COVID-19 disease classification from X-ray chest images. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, subsequent domestic outbreaks of COVID-19 continue to occur. To sharp the community education program to guarantee the final success in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam and comparable countries, we examined the levels of COVID-19 knowledge and associated predictors among university students in Vietnam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on all students enrolling at Phenikaa University using a self-developed questionnaire consisted of 20 questions regarding COVID-19's risk factors, transmission routes, symptoms, and prevention. RESULTS: Among 728 participants, 40.9% were male, 63.2% studied health-related majors, and 18.1% lived alone. Correct response rates ranged from 25.3% to 98.9% across 20 questions. Only 51.9% (378/728) of participants had good knowledge levels. Studying health majors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.547, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.398 - 0.751, P <0.001), and living with the seniors (AOR 0.612, 95% CI 0.389 - 0.963, P = 0.034) or with friends (AOR 0.405, 95% CI 0.252 C 0.650, P <0.001) were negatively associated with a poor level of COVID-19 knowledge.

Whereas it is optimal for patients to receive COVID-19 vaccination as outlined in emergency use authorizations, second-dose deferral of mRNA vaccines may be a consideration within a shared decision-making paradigm of care in select circumstances characterized by high durable first-vaccine-dose protection and significant elevations of vaccine anaphylaxis risk. Still, the durability of protection afforded by a single dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is uncertain, and alternative approaches to complete vaccination, including precautionary use of a COVID-19 viral vector vaccine, also remain patient-preference-sensitive options. There is an urgent need to define correlates of COVID-19 immunity and the level of longer-term protection afforded by COVID-19 vaccination.","output":"The Importance of a Timely Second Dose of the 2021 COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Depends on the Protection Afforded by a First Dose and Subsequent Risk of Anaphylaxis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This quality improvement initiative aimed to improve American Academy of Pediatrics acute otitis media (AOM) guideline adherence in pediatric urgent care sites by increasing the percentage of patients 2 years and older with AOM who received a short duration (7 days or fewer) of antibiotics from a baseline of 7% to a goal of 50%. METHODS: This quality improvement initiative was conducted in a network of seven urgent care sites affiliated with a large academic childrens hospital. The interventions focused on clinician and family education, clinical decision support, and a discharge template that defaulted to a 7-day duration of antibiotics for patients 2 years and older diagnosed with AOM. The outcome measure was the percentage of patients receiving 7 days or fewer of antibiotics. The process measure was the percentage of prescriptions originating from the new discharge template. A repeat visit for AOM within 30 days from the initial visit was the balancing measure. RESULTS: The percentage of patients diagnosed with AOM receiving a short antibiotic course increased from a baseline of 7% to a new centerline mean of 67%, which exceeded the goal. This project resulted in 10,138 antibiotic days being avoided. Eighty-two percent of short-course prescriptions originated from the discharge template. Repeat visits for AOM within 1 month of the initial visit did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: A quality improvement initiative combining education and clinical decision support improved adherence to AOM treatment duration guidelines and avoided unnecessary antibiotic exposure in a pediatric urgent care network without increasing treatment failures.","output":"Increasing Adherence to Acute Otitis Media Treatment Duration Guidelines using a Quality Improvement Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The lack of consensus criteria of acute on chronic kidney injury (ACKI) affects the judgment for its clinical prognosis. METHODS In this study, we analyzed the data from 711,615 hospitalized adults who had at least 2 serum creatinine (SCr) tests within 30 days. We estimated the reference change value (RCV) of SCr given initial SCr level in adults without known risks of acute kidney injury other than chronic kidney disease (CKD). We proposed a criterion for ACKI based on the RCV of SCr (cROCK), which defined ACKI as a 25% increase in SCr in 7 days. We validated cROCK by its association with the risks of in-hospital mortality, death after discharge, and CKD progression in a large cohort of patients with CKD stage 3. RESULTS In 21,661 patients with CKD stage 3, a total of 3,145 (14.5%), 1,512 (7.0%), and 221 (1.0%) ACKI events were detected by both cROCK and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), cROCK only, and KDIGO only, respectively. cROCK detected 40% more ACKI events than KDIGO. Compared with patients without ACKI by both definitions, those with cROCK- but not KDIGO-defined ACKI had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 5.53; 95% CI 3.75-8.16), death after discharge (HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.21-1.83), and CKD progression (OR 5.65; 95% CI 3.05-10.48).

In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual distillation learning network to solve the TUL problem for sparse check-in mobility data, named MainTUL. Specifically, MainTUL is composed of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trajectory encoder that models sequential patterns of input trajectory and a temporal-aware Transformer trajectory encoder that captures long-term time dependencies for the corresponding augmented historical trajectories. Then, the knowledge learned on historical trajectories is transferred between the two trajectory encoders to guide the learning of both encoders to achieve mutual distillation of information. Experimental results on two real-world check-in mobility datasets demonstrate the superiority of MainTUL against state-of-the-art baselines.

We sought to investigate for what we believe is the first time, the effect of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) on nasopharyngeal S pneumoniae density in a low-income to middle-income country population with high pneumococcal carriage rates. METHODS: In an open-label, randomised, controlled trial in The Gambia, 330 healthy children aged 24C59 months were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive one trivalent LAIV dose at enrolment (day 0, intervention) or at the end of active follow-up (day 21, control). The investigator team were initially masked to block size and randomisation sequence to avoid allocation bias. Group allocation was later revealed to the investigator team. The primary outcome was PCR-quantified day 7 and 21 pneumococcal density. Asymptomatic respiratory viral infection at baseline and LAIV strain shedding were included as covariates in generalised mixed-effects models, to assess the effect of LAIV and other variables on pneumococcal densities. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02972957, and is closed to recruitment. FINDINGS: Between Feb 8 and April 12, 2017, and Jan 15 and March 28, 2018, of 343 children assessed for eligibility, 213 in the intervention group and 108 in the control group completed the study and were included in the final analysis. Although no significant differences were seen in pneumococcal carriage or density at each timepoint when comparing groups, changes from baseline were observed in the LAIV group. The baseline S pneumoniae carriage prevalence was high in both LAIV and control groups (75%) and increased by day 21 in the LAIV group (85%, p=00037), but not in the control group (79%, p=044). An increase in pneumococcal density from day 0 amounts was seen in the LAIV group at day 7 (+0207 log(10) copies per L, SE 0105, p=0050) and day 21 (+0280 log(10) copies per L, SE 0105, p=00082), but not in the control group. Older age was associated with lower pneumococcal density (?0015 log(10) copies per L, SE 0005, p=00030), with the presence of asymptomatic respiratory viruses at baseline (+0259 log(10) copies per L, SE 0097, p=0017), and greater LAIV shedding at day 7 (+0380 log(10) copies per L, SE 0167, p=0024) associated with higher pneumococcal density. A significant increase in rhinorrhoea was reported in the LAIV group compared with the control group children during the first 7 days of the study (103 [48%] of 213, compared with 25 [23%] of 108, p<00001), and between day 7 and 21 (108 [51%] of 213, compared with 28 [26%] of 108, p<00001). INTERPRETATION: LAIV was associated with a modest increase in nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage and density in the 21 days following vaccination, with the increase in density lower in magnitude than previously described in the UK. This increase was accelerated when LAIV was administered in the presence of pre-existing asymptomatic respiratory viruses, suggesting that nasopharyngeal S pneumoniae proliferation is driven by cumulative mixed-viral co-infections. The effect of LAIV on pneumococcal density is probably similar to other respiratory viral infections in children. Our findings provide reassurance for the use of LAIV to expand influenza vaccine programmes in low-income to middle-income country populations with high pneumococcal carriage.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women with depressive symptoms who participated in a 12-week mindful physical activity intervention (Mindful Moms) throughout their pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: In this qualitative study, we explore the lived experience of women with depressive symptoms who participated in Mindful Moms, a self-management intervention involving nurse-led motivational sessions and group-based mindful physical activity (yoga). METHODS: Semistructured interviews conducted at approximately 6 weeks postpartum provided rich qualitative data that was analyzed using a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Twenty-five women participated. Findings suggest that participants in Mindful Moms felt empowered to manage their depressive symptoms through the combination of four key factors: a newly recognized need for help, a felt sense of physical and emotional benefit from participation, the power of shared safe space with other pregnant women, support from study staff, and an overall sense of empowerment. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Mindful Moms appears to be a feasible and acceptable approach to enhancing motivation to self-manage depressive symptoms in pregnant women.

Although different methodologies have been utilized to produce mAbs, traditional hybridoma fusion technology is still commonly used for this purpose due to its unmatched performance record. In this study, we coupled the hybridoma fusion strategy with mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) immunization. This time-saving approach can circumvent biological and technical hurdles, such as difficult to express membrane proteins, antigen instability, and the lack of posttranslational modifications on recombinant antigens. We used mRNA-LNP immunization and hybridoma fusion technology to generate mAbs against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. Compared with traditional protein-based immunization approaches, inoculation of mice with RBD mRNA-LNP induced higher titers of serum antibodies. In addition, the mAbs we obtained can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBDs from several variants. Notably, RBD-mAb-3 displayed particularly high binding affinities and neutralizing potencies against both Alpha and Delta variants. In addition to introducing specific mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, our data generally demonstrate that mRNA-LNP immunization may be useful to quickly generate highly functional mAbs against emerging infectious diseases.","output":"An Efficient Approach for SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Production via Modified mRNA-LNP Immunization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the rapid increase in telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the potential for exacerbating existing healthcare disparities in marginalized populations. While eliminating barriers such as transportation and time constraints, telehealth may introduce barriers related to technology access. With little known about the patient experience accessing telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to understand the barriers and facilitators to telehealth use as well as interventions that may address them. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with parents of pediatric patients of a primary care clinic in a diverse community during the study period of March-May 2021. The interviews explored barriers and facilitators to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were balanced across language (Spanish and English) as well as across visit type (in-person vs. telehealth). Recruitment, collection of demographic information, and interviews were conducted by telephone. The conversations were recorded and transcribed. Once thematic saturation was achieved, the data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Of the 33 participants, 17 (52%) spoke English and 16 (48%) spoke Spanish. A total of 17 (52%) had experienced a telehealth encounter as their first visit during the study period while 16 (48%) had an in-person visit. Five themes were identified: (1) a recognition of differences in technological knowledge and access, (2) situational preferences for telehealth versus in-person visits, (3) avoidance of COVID-19 exposure, (4) convenience, and (5) change over time. English-speaking patients expressed greater ease with and a preference for telehealth, while Spanish-speaking participants expressed more technological difficulty with telehealth and a preference for in-person visits. Suggested interventions included informational tutorials such as videos before the visit, technical support, and providing families with technological devices. CONCLUSION: In this study, we examined patient and family perspectives on pediatric telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implementation of the suggested interventions to address barriers to telehealth use is essential to prevent further exacerbation of health disparities already experienced by marginalized populations.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to pediatric telehealth use in English- and Spanish-speaking families: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Outbreaks of infectious diseases repeatedly affected medieval Europe, leaving behind a large number of dead often inhumed in mass graves. Human remains interred in two burial pits from 14(th) century CE Germany exhibited molecular evidence of Salmonella enterica Paratyphi C (S. Paratyphi C) infection. The pathogen is responsible for paratyphoid fever, which was likely the cause of death for the buried individuals. This finding presented the unique opportunity to conduct a paratyphoid fever association study in a European population. We focused on HLA-DRB1*03:01 that is a known risk allele for enteric fever in present-day South Asians. We generated HLA profiles for 29 medieval S. Paratyphi C cases and 24 contemporaneous controls and compared these to a modern German population. The frequency of the risk allele was higher in the medieval cases (29.6%) compared to the contemporaneous controls (13%; p = 0.189), albeit not significantly so, possibly because of small sample sizes. Indeed, in comparison with the modern controls (n = 39,689; 10.2%; p = 0.005) the frequency difference became statistically significant. This comparison also suggested a slight decrease in the alleles prevalence between the medieval and modern controls. Up to now, this is the first study on the genetic predisposition to Salmonella infection in Europeans and the only association analysis on paratyphoid fever C. Functional investigation using computational binding prediction between HLA variants and S. Paratyphi and S. Typhi peptides supported a reduced recognition capacity of bacterial proteins by DRB1*03:01 relative to other common DRB1 variants. This pattern could potentially explain the disease association. Our results suggest a slightly reduced predisposition to paratyphoid fever in modern Europeans. The causative allele, however, is still common today, which can be explained by a trade-off, as DRB1*03:01 is protective against infectious respiratory diseases such as severe respiratory syndrome (SARS). It is thus possible that the allele also provided resistance to corona-like viruses in the past.","output":"Ancient DNA Study in Medieval Europeans Shows an Association Between HLA-DRB1*03 and Paratyphoid Fever"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: We sought to examine and categorize the current evidence on patient-physician relationships among marginalized patient populations within the context of cancer care using a systemic scoping review approach.

Our most recent forecasts reported here based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 - 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). Our forecasts suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.","output":"Real-time forecasts of the 2019-nCoV epidemic in China from February 5th to February 24th, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hundreds of predictions about the duration of the pandemic and the number of infected and dead have been carried out using traditional epidemiological tools (i.e. SIR, SIRD models, etc.) or new procedures of big-data analysis.

While Intensive Care Units (ICUs) have a long term experience in using algorithms for this purpose, due to the special features of the IRCUs, the same strategics are not applicable. The aim of this study is to develop an IRCU specific mortality predictor tool using machine learning methods. METHODS: Vital signs of patients were recorded from 1966 patients admitted from 2007 to 2017 in the Jimnez Daz Foundation University Hospital's IRCU. A neural network was used to select the variables that better predict mortality status. Multivariate logistic regression provided us cut-off points that best discriminated the mortality status for each of the parameters. A new guideline for risk assessment was applied and mortality was recorded during one year. RESULTS: Our algorithm shows that thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, tachypnea, age, sodium levels, hypoxemia, leukocytopenia and hyperkalemia are the most relevant parameters associated with mortality. First year with this decision scene showed a decrease in failure rate of a 50%. CONCLUSIONS: We have generated a neural network model capable of identifying and classifying mortality predictors in the IRCU of a general hospital. Combined with multivariate regression analysis, it has provided us with an useful tool for the real-time monitoring of patients to detect specific mortality risks.

METHODS: A cross-sectional design was conducted at King Hussein Cancer Center. A convenience sampling technique was used to select 446 nurses. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized using three scales: the Work Stressor Inventory for Nurses in Oncology, Revised Ways of Coping Checklist, and Research and Development 36-Item for Health Survey. RESULTS: The results showed that the levels of work stress (2.61/5), using coping strategy scale (1.59/4), and health-related quality of life scale (50.54/100) were moderate. The total mean value of the work stress scale had a significant positive correlation with the total mean value of the coping strategy scale (r=0.322*, p < 0.05) and a significant negative correlation with health-related quality of life. Moreover, there is no significant correlation between the total mean value of the coping strategy scale and the health-related quality of life scale (r=0121, p >0.05).

Here, we report a DNA vaccine containing the spike gene for delivery via electroporation. The spike genes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and then cloned into mammalian cell expression vectors, called pSARS-S and pSARS2-S, respectively. Spike protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting after transient expression in HEK293T cells. After immunization, sera were collected for antigen-specific antibody and neutralizing antibody titer analyses. We found that both pSARS-S and pSARS2-S immunization induced similar levels of antibodies against S2 of SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, only pSARS2-S immunization induced antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. We further found that pSARS2-S immunization, but not pSARS-S immunization, could induce very high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We further analyzed SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses and found that the immune responses were biased toward Th1. Importantly, pSARS2-S immunization in hamsters could induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo.

The effects of COVID-19 on different sub-populations, and its key epidemiologic parameters remain unknown or highly uncertain. We investigated the epidemiology of COVID-19 from January to August of 2020 in an established academic monitoring cohort of N = 9,697 middle-aged World Trade Center responders residing in Long Island, NY. METHODS: A seroprevalence survey and a series of cross-sectional surveys were nested in a prospective cohort study. Measures included IgG antibody testing, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, review of electronic medical records, and surveys of symptoms. Correlates of infection were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort was predominantly men in their mid-fifties; 6,597 cohort members were successfully contacted (68%); 1,042 (11%) individuals participated in the seroprevalence survey; and 369 individuals (5.6% of 6,597 study participants) underwent PCR testing. The estimated standardized cumulative incidence was 21.9% (95%CI: 20.1C23.9%), the asymptomatic proportion was 16.4% (36/219; 95%CI: 11.8C22.0%), the case hospitalization ratio was 9.4% (36/385; 95%CI: 6.6C12.7%), the case fatality ratio was 1.8% (7/385; 95%CI: 0.7C3.7%), and the hospitalization fatality ratio was 8.3% (3/36; 95%CI: 1.8C22.5%). Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with younger age, race/ethnicity, and being currently employed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest a high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among WTC responders in the spring and summer of 2020 and contribute to narrowing the plausible range of the proportion of infections that exhibit no symptoms. An increased risk of infection among younger employed individuals is likely to reflect a higher probability of exposure to the virus, and the racial disparities in the infection risk warrant further investigation.","output":"COVID-19 cumulative incidence, asymptomatic infections, and fatality in Long Island, NY, JanuaryCAugust 2020: A cohort of World Trade Center responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid growth of COVID-19 cases is causing an increasing death toll and also paralyzing the world economy De novo drug discovery takes years to move from idea and/or pre-clinic to market, and it is not a short-term solution for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Drug repurposing is perhaps the only short-term solution, while vaccination is a middle-term solution Here, we describe the discovery path of the HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir as SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro) inhibitors Based on our hypothesis that alpha-ketoamide drugs can covalently bind to the active site cysteine of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, we performed docking studies, enzyme inhibition and co-crystal structure analyses and finally established that boceprevir, but not telaprevir, inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), another coronavirus, in cell culture Based on our studies, the HCV drug boceprevir deserves further attention as a repurposed drug for COVID-19 and potentially other coronaviral infections as well","output":"Repurposing the HCV NS3-4A protease drug boceprevir as COVID-19 therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe pneumonia emerged through zoonosis in late 2019.

Animals were immunized with recombinant RBD antigen intraperitoneally using three different adjuvants (Zn-chitosan, Alhydrogel, and Adju-Phos), and antibody responses were followed for over 5 months. Results showed that potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) can be induced with 70% neutralization titer (NT(70)) of ~14,580 against live, infectious viruses. Although antigen-binding antibody titers decreased gradually over time, sufficiently protective levels of nAbs persisted (NT(80) >2,430) over the 5-month observation period. Results also showed that adjuvants have profound effects on kinetics of nAb induction, total antibody titers, antibody avidity, antibody longevity, and B-cell epitopes targeted by the immune system. In conclusion, a recombinant subunit protein immunogen based on the RBD is a highly promising vaccine candidate.

Yet, their limited access to and uptake of traditional mental health care is inequitable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile interventions emerged as a potential solution to this discontinued healthcare access, but more knowledge is needed about their effectiveness and impact on health equity. This equity-focused systematic review examined the effectiveness and equity impact of mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women. METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and 3 other databases, from date of database inception and until January 2021, for experimental studies on mobile interventions targeting pregnant and postpartum women. We used pooled and narrative synthesis methods to analyze effectiveness and equity data, critically appraised the methodological rigour of included studies using Cochrane tools, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search identified 6148 records, of which 18 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included. Mobile interventions had a clinically important impact on reducing the occurrence of depression (OR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.64]; absolute risk reduction RD: 7.14% [95% CI 4.92 to 9.36]; p<0.001) and preventing its severity perinatally (MD = -3.07; 95% CI -4.68 to -1.46; p<0.001). Mobile cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in managing postpartum depression (MD = -6.87; 95% CI -7.92 to -5.82; p<0.001), whereas other support-based interventions had no added benefit. Results on anxiety outcomes and utilization of care were limited. Our equity-focused analyses showed that ethnicity, age, education, and being primiparous were characteristics of influence to the effectiveness of mobile interventions.

Such interventions carry the potential to address health inequity but more rigorous research that examines patients intersecting social identities is needed.","output":"Mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women: An equity-focused systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Existing research suggests that physical access to food can affect diet quality and thus obesity rates. When defining retail food environment (RFE) quantitatively, there is a little agreement on how to measure lack of healthy food and what parameters to use, resulting in a heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures. In turn, this leads to a conflicting evidence base being one of the many barriers to using evidence in policy\\\\making. AIMS: This systematic review aimed to identify and describe methods used to assess food accessibility in the United Kingdom (UK) to overcome heterogeneity by providing a classification of measures. MATERIALS & METHODS: The literature search included electronic and manual searches of peer\\\\reviewed literature and was restricted to studies published in English between January 2010 and March 2021. A total of 9365 articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 44 articles were included in the review. All included studies were analysed with regards to their main characteristics (e.g., associations between variables of interest, setting, sample, design, etc.) and definition of RFE and its metrics. When defining these metrics, the present review distinguishes between a point of origin (centroid, address) from which distance was calculated, summary statistic of accessibility (proximity, buffer, Kernel), and definition of distance (Euclidean, network distance). Trends, gaps and limitations are identified and recommendations made for food accessibility research in UK. RESULTS: Multiple theoretical and methodological constructs are currently used, mostly quantifying distance by means of Euclidean and ring\\\\buffer distance, using both proximity\\\\ and density\\\\based approaches, and ranging from absolute to relative measures. The association between RFE and diet and health in rural areas, as well as a spatiotemporal domain of food access, remains largely unaccounted. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that the duration of exposure may bear a greater importance than the level of exposure and that density\\\\based measures may better capture RFE when compared with proximity\\\\based measures, however, using more complex measures not necessarily produce better results. To move the field forward, studies have called for a greater focus on causality, individual access and the use of various measures, neighbourhood definitions and potential confounders to capture different aspects and dimensions of the RFE, which requires using univariate measures of accessibility and considering the overall context in terms of varying types of neighbourhoods. CONCLUSION: In order to render ongoing heterogeneity in measuring RFE, researchers should prioritise measures that may provide a more accurate and realistic account of peoples lives and follow an intuitive approach based on convergence of results until consensus could be reached on using some useful standards.","output":"Assessing physical access to healthy food across United Kingdom: A systematic review of measures and findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current outbreak of a coronavirus, has quickly escalated to become a serious global problem that has now been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.

Very few studies in social psychology have looked at how neoliberal ideology transpires out of people's discourses and none have done so in such contexts.

Relying on a qualitative analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews and on the existing literature, we identified five central themes of neoliberal ideology in France: State prerogatives, competition, abstraction from institutional and social contexts, the entrepreneurial self and emotional management. Results suggest that the influence of neoliberal ideology transpires in the way people envision competition as something natural and motivating, in the way they distance themselves from their immediate and distant contexts, and in the way they value and engage in self-regulation while pursuing happiness and self-optimization. We also found that, in the French context, neoliberal ideology was not necessarily associated to the willingness to see the State step back and to the rationalization of all types of inequalities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using linked administrative datasets of outpatients aged 65 years old testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between January 1 and December 31, 2020 in Ontario, Canada. The key exposure was anticoagulation with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants before COVID-19 diagnosis. We calculated propensity scores and used matching weights (MWs) to reduce baseline differences between anticoagulated and non-anticoagulated patients. The primary outcome was a composite of death or hospitalization within 60 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. We used the Kaplan-Meier method and cumulative incidence functions to estimate risk of the primary and component outcomes at 60 days. RESULTS: We studied 23,159 outpatients (mean age 78.5 years; 13,474 [58.2%] female), among whom 3200 (13.8%) deaths and 3183 (13.7%) hospitalizations occurred within 60 days of the SARS-CoV-2 test. After application of MWs, the 60-day risk of death or hospitalization was 29.2% (95% CI 27.4%C31.2%) for anticoagulated individuals and 32.1% (95% CI 30.7%C33.5%) without anticoagulation (absolute risk difference [ARD], ?2.9%; p = 0.005).

The classic symptoms of influenza are fever, fatigue, cough, and body aches. In the outpatient setting, diagnosis can be made by clinical presentation with optional confirmatory diagnostic testing. Antiviral medications should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of initiation of symptoms. The primary preventive measure against influenza is vaccination, which is recommended for all people 6 months of age or older, including pregnant and postpartum women, unless the individual has a contraindication. Vaccination should occur at the beginning of flu season, which typically begins in October. It takes approximately 14 days after vaccination for a healthy adult to reach peak antibody protection. There are challenges associated with vaccine composition and vaccine uptake. It takes approximately 6 to 8 months to identify and predict which influenza strains to include in the upcoming season's vaccine. During this time, the influenza virus may undergo antigenic drift, that is, mutating to avoid a host immune response. Antigenic drift makes the vaccine less effective in some seasons. The influenza virus occasionally undergoes antigenic shift, in which it changes to a novel virus, creating potential for a pandemic.

In the climate change context, such societal teleconnections add a layer of risk that is currently neither fully appreciated in most impacts or vulnerability assessments nor in on-the-ground adaptation planning. Conceptually, societal teleconnections arise from the interactions among actors, and the institutions that guide their actions, affecting the movement of various substances through different structures and processes. Empirically, they arise out of societal interactions, including globalization, to create, amplify, and sometimes attenuate climate change vulnerabilities and impacts in regions far from those where a climatic extreme or change occurs. This paper introduces a simple but systematic way to conceptualize societal teleconnections and then highlights and explores eight unique but interrelated types of societal teleconnections with selected examples: (1) trade and economic exchange, (2) insurance and reinsurance, (3) energy systems, (4) food systems; (5) human health, (6) population migration, (7) communication, and (8) strategic alliances and military interactions. The paper encourages further research to better understand the causal chains behind socially teleconnected impacts, and to identify ways to routinely integrate their consideration in impacts/vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning to limit the risk of costly impacts.

This paper uses real-world data from Cerner Labs collected from 90 source institutions in the United States to assess the potential impact of two viral vaccines on COVID-19 case fatality rates. Methods: We identified 373,032 polymerase chase reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 cases in the Cerner Labs database between 01-MAR-2020 and 31-DEC-2020 and identified patients that had received measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) or a recombinant adjuvanted varicella-zoster vaccine within the previous 5 years. We calculated heterogeneity scores to support interpretation of results across institutions, and used stepwise forward variable selection to construct covariable-based propensity scores. These scores were used to match cases and control for biasing and confounding issues inherent in observational data. Results: Neither the recombinant adjuvanted varicella-zoster vaccine nor MMR showed significant efficacy in prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We could not derive clinically significant results on the impact of MMR for case fatality rates due to persistently high rates of heterogeneity between institutions. However, we were able to achieve acceptable levels of heterogeneity for the analysis of the recombinant adjuvanted varicella-zoster vaccine, and found a clinically meaningful benefit of reduced case fatality rate, with an odds ratio of 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38 C 0.48). Conclusions: Using propensity score matching and heterogeneity statistics can help guide our interpretation of real-world data, and rigorous statistical methods are needed to reduce bias or disparities in data interpretation.

Under the Policy Space Paradigm, governments have the right to violate international obligations so long as the violation is necessary to pursue a public policy goal permitted by an exception. Under the Safety Valve Paradigm, exceptions excuse violations that are undeterrable, such as those motivated by overwhelming domestic political pressure. Both of these approaches, which are dominant in international legal practice, permit governments to invoke international legal exceptions only to the extent that the government acts with a single, permissible objective. In so doing, both paradigms rest on faulty assumptions about how domestic policymaking works.I therefore introduce the Channeling Paradigm, which rests on the observation that international trade policies are the result of bargaining between domestic interest groups. Exceptions in trade agreements influence that bargaining process and the resulting domestic coalitions. Industries seeking economic protection will often ally themselves with groups pursuing non-trade public policy goals, such as environmental protection or public health. Both groups benefit. The domestic industry obtains protection from foreign competition by lending its political support to a public policy goal. Public policy advocates obtain important political support for policies that provide public goods that governments often undersupply, such as measures to protect public health, fight climate change, and address economic inequality. Counterintuitively, then, the domestic political bargaining that legal exceptions encourage serves the public interest by channeling protectionist pressure into the promotion of public goods. The Channeling Paradigm has implications for dispute resolution under international trade agreements, as well as the drafting of new agreements. In short, existing tests for the application of trade agreements public policy exceptions unduly constrain domestic politics. This Article argues that trade tribunals and treaty negotiations should adopt a Predominant Motive test when interpreting and drafting exceptions clauses. Under this approach, a trade restrictive policy would benefit from an exception if the primary objective of the measure is a permitted goal under the exception. So long as it does not become the predominant purpose of the challenged policy, economic protection would not be fatal to invoking an exception. The WTO-compatibility of a wide range of critical government policies that have mixed motivesincluding President Bidens Buy American requirements that seek to address economic inequality within the United States;efforts to reshore critical U.S. supply chains with the goal of ensuring the United States has access to the components it needs to be a global leader in manufacturing;the European Unions efforts to impose a carbon tariff in aid of its efforts to combat climate change;and public health restrictions on trade in medical supplies and the COVID-19 vaccineall depend on a more flexible approach to international legal exceptions.","output":"A Political Theory of Legal Exceptions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A Novel corona virus (covid -19) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. Greater proportion of patients infected by covid 19 may show signs of kidney damage. hyperuricemia has attracted greater attention. However, limited concern has been paid to the potential dangers of lowering serum uric acid. MATERIAL this was a retrospective observational study based on 150 cases with covid 19 infection. we compared serum uric acid among two Group A - Saturation Above 90% and Group B Saturation Below 90%. Serum uric acid levels were divided into three ranges <3.5mg/dl, 3.5 to 4.5 mg/ dl and >4.5mg/dl and compared between the two groups. OBSERVATION the age group of patients was in the range of 18years to 70 years with maximum number of patients in between the age group of 30-50 years. females constituted 32% (24), males 68% (51) belonging to group A and females 28% (21), males 72% (54) in group B. Blood urea nitrogen levels was highest in group A 77.3% (58) and the level is <40mg/dl. Serum Uric acid level <3.5 had 22.7% (17) than compared to group A having 18.7% (14). Serum uric acid level of 3.5 - 4.5 mg/dl had maximum number of patients from group B 22.7% (17) than compared to group A 16% (12).

The present study was conducted to analyze and describe the occurrence of COVID-19 cases among completely vaccinated individuals. METHODS: In an educational institute in Western Maharashtra, we analyzed a cluster of RTPCR positive COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated students which occurred in 12 days. The cases were linked to a series of curricular and co-curricular events in the institute. A detailed epidemiological investigation and genome sequencing of cases were conducted. IgG antibodies against S1 protein of novel SARS-CoV-2 were estimated for cases and age, sex, and vaccination status matched controls. RESULTS: All 37 identified cases were mild COVID. 188 high risk (HR) contacts of the cases were identified. The overall secondary attack was 9.5%. Out of 31 cases and 50 controls, 09 (29%) cases and 08 (16%) controls were found to have IgG antibodies against S1 protein of novel SARS-CoV-2 titer of more than 60 U/ml.

Herein we describe for the first time the impact of delays in diagnostic investigations of patients with an history of early-stage breast cancer (BC) in the largest public cancer center of Lombardy, the Italian region most affected by the pandemic. Methods-This single-institution retrospective study included three observational periods. The first pandemic peak period (March-April 2020) corresponding to the interruption of follow up imaging;the post-peak period (May-December 2020);the pre-pandemic period represented by the five previous years (January 2015-December 2019) as control. The flow of diagnostic activities was compared among the different years. Moreover, the number and characteristics of recurrent BC cases (rBC) diagnosed in the post-peak period were compared to the figures observed in pre-pandemic years, when imaging was regularly carried out, using descriptive statistics. A further comparison was performed between the characteristics of scheduled and delayed rBC diagnosed after the first peak. Results-During the first pandemic peak, diagnostic investigations declined by 81.2% (from 1032 in January-February to 194 in March-April), a drop which was not identified in the same period of the pre-pandemic years, before rebounding to 1065 in May-June, 832 July-August (reflecting the Ssummer physiological drop), 1334 September-October, and 879 November-December. The average number of rBC cases of 16 (range 12-25) in March-April of the pre-pandemic period declined to a value as low as 4 during the first pandemic peak. Thereafter, the number of rBC cases began a steady increase, until reaching a total of 27 in September-October 2020, almost doubling the mean of 14.8 (range 11-21) achieved in the corresponding months of 2015-2019. As a result, the absolute number of rBC cases was 76 in 2020 and on average 78.4 (range 70-95) in pre-pandemic years, and the rBC proportion of 1.42% (76/5336;95% exact confidence interval, CI: 1.12-1.78%) in 2020 was slightly higher than the average proportion of 1.26% of the five previous years, though the latter being well included in the CI of the 2020 proportion. No difference in primary tumor presentation and age at initial diagnosis was found among recurrent patients before and after the pandemic. Of the rBC cases reported during 2020, 10 were from 513 patients with postponed follow up who were finally diagnosed between September-December. As compared to patients on schedule, delayed rBC cases did not present with ductal carcinoma in situ, and reported a median tumor size of 18 mm (range 4.3-90 mm), which was 20% higher than the median of 15 mm (3.1-34) observed for scheduled patients. Distribution of luminal-like, triple negative and HER2-overexpressing BC subtypes among evaluable rBC cases was 75%, 12.5%, 12.5% in scheduled and 66%, 11% and 22% in delayed cases, respectively. Conclusions-Our data showed a slight decrease in the absolute number of rBC during 2020 despite a rebound of examinations, and an increased size of invasive recurrence following the 2-month stop of the first pandemic peak.

Safety measures are insufficient and there are still no approved drugs for the COVID-19 disease. Thus, it is an urgent necessity to develop a specific inhibitor for COVID-19. One of the most attractive targets in the virus life cycle is the polymerase enzyme responsible for the replication of the virus genome. Here, we describe our Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) protocol for designing of a new potential inhibitor for SARS-COV-2 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase. Firstly, the crystal structure of the enzyme was retrieved from the protein data bank PDB ID (7bv2). Then, Fragment-Based Drug Design (FBDD) strategy was implemented using Discovery Studio 2016. The five best generated fragments were linked together using suitable carbon linkers to yield compound MAW-22. Thereafter, the strength of the binds between compound MAW-22 and the SARS-COV-2 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase was predicted by docking strategy using docking software. MAW-22 achieved a high docking score, even more so than the score achieved by Remdesivir, indicating very strong binding between MAW-22 and its target. Finally, three molecular dynamic simulation experiments were performed for 150 ns to validate our concept of design. The three experiments revealed that MAW-22 has a great potentiality to inhibit the SARS-COV-2 RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase compared to Remdesivir. Also, it is thought that this study has proven SBDD to be the most suitable avenue for future drug development for the COVID-19 infection.","output":"Identification of a New Potential SARS-COV-2 RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Inhibitor via Combining Fragment-Based Drug Design, Docking, Molecular Dynamics, and MM-PBSA Calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: The molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 is similar to other coronavirus (CoV) infections viz. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in human. Due to scarcity of the suitable treatment strategy, the present study was undertaken to explore host protein(s) targeted by potent repurposed drug(s) in COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from microarray data repository of SARS-CoV patient blood. The repurposed drugs for COVID-19 were selected from available literature. Using DEGs and drugs, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and chemo-protein interaction (CPI) networks were constructed and combined to develop an interactome model of PPI-CPI network. The top-ranked sub-network with its hub-bottleneck nodes were evaluated with their functional annotations. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 120 DEGs and 65 drugs were identified. The PPI-CPI network (118 nodes and 293 edges) exhibited a top-ranked sub-network (35 nodes and 174 connectivities) with 12 hub-bottleneck nodes having two drugs chloroquine and melatonin in association with 10 proteins corresponding to six upregulated and four downregulated genes. Two drugs interacted directly with the hub-bottleneck node i.e. matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), a host protein corresponding to its upregulated gene. MMP9 showed functional annotations associated with neutrophil mediated immunoinflammation. Moreover, literature survey revealed that angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2 virus, might have functional cooperativity with MMP9 and a possible interaction with both drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study reveals that between chloroquine and melatonin, melatonin appears to be more promising repurposed drug against MMP9 for better immunocompromisation in COVID-19.","output":"Matrix metallopeptidase 9 as a host protein target of chloroquine and melatonin for immunoregulation in COVID-19: A network-based meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer cachexia (CC) is a progressive loss of muscle mass (with or without a decrease of adipose tissue). Gradual deterioration of the patient's fitness is resistant to nutritional intervention. The biochemical foundation of observed catabolism, detrimental protein, and energy balance is complex. However, the generalized inflammatory response plays a vital role. It is a kind of cytokine storm, which involves increased activity of TNF-&#945;, IL-1, IL-6, and INF-?3. Pharmacological treatment of cachexia consists mainly of progestagens and glucocorticosteroids. Still, the assessment of new options limiting the harmful impact of cachexia could be beneficial. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old antimalarial agents endowed with immunomodulatory properties. Being potent autophagy inhibitors, they could lead to a form of intracellular starvation in both cytokine-releasing cells and cancer cells, thus limiting the harmful impact of CC. CQ and HCQ are also efficient in particular connective tissue disorders. They have gained special attention since the World Health Organization announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. According to initial reports, people with a severe inflammatory reaction showed significant benefits. Possibly they could not be attributed to the antiviral activity alone. It is worth noting that the cytokine storm in COVID-19, connective tissue disorders, and cancer cachexia share some similarities. Therefore, we hypothesize that low doses of CQ/HCQ may prove efficient in cancer cachexia.","output":"Can chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine prove efficient in cancer cachexia?

Preventive measures are crucial to address these health risks. Research highlights strength-based factors, such as socio-emotional skills and prosocial behaviors, as important for childhood development and socio-emotional wellbeing. Yet, the initial evidence base shows mixed effectiveness and insufficient behavior change theory application into socio-emotional and prosocial digital game interventions. Additionally, few interventions are designed with a clear process to convert theory into practical game solutions and very limited guidance on the digital game development process exists. This study describes the Intervention Mapping Protocol (IMP) and theory application in the design of a digital game intervention which aims to strengthen social-emotional skills development and promote prosocial behavior in 8C11-year-old children. The method systematically describes the steps of the IMP process in detail to guide future theory-based game design. The results explain the final digital game prototype that was co-designed with continuous input and insights provided by stakeholders and feedback from children. This paper contributes to our understanding of theory application in the design of digital game interventions focused on health and behavior change and provides much needed guidance on how theory and stakeholder input can be incorporated into a final game design.","output":"Design of a Digital Game Intervention to Promote Socio-Emotional Skills and Prosocial Behavior in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Evaluate the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 positive players and other players during rugby league matches, to determine the risk of in-game SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Design Observational. Setting Super League rugby league during four matches in which SARS-CoV-2 positive players were retrospectively found to have participated (2nd August and 4th October 2020). Participants 136 male elite rugby league players: eight SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, 28 identified close contacts and 100 other players who participated in any of the four matches. Main Outcome measures Close contacts were defined by analysis of video footage for player interactions and microtechnology (GPS) data for proximity analysis. Close contacts and other players involved in the matches becoming positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR within 14 days of the match were reported. Results The eight SARS-CoV-2 positive players were involved in up to 14 tackles with other individual players. SARS-CoV-2 positive players were within a 2 m proximity of other players for up to 316 secs, from 60 interactions. One identified contact returned a positive SARS-CoV-2 result within 14 days of the match (subsequently linked to an outbreak within their club environment, rather than in-match transmission), whereas the other 27 identified contacts returned negative SARS-CoV-2 follow up tests and no one developed COVID-19 symptoms. Ninety-five players returned negative and five players returned positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR routine tests within 14 days of the match. Sources of transmission in the five cases were linked to internal club COVID-19 outbreaks and wider-community transmission. Conclusion Despite a high number of tackle involvements and close proximity interactions between SARS-CoV-2 positive players and players on the same and opposition teams during a rugby league match, these data suggest that in-game SARS-CoV-2 transmission is limited during these types of team sport activities played outdoors.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 transmission during team-sport: Do players develop COVID-19 after participating in rugby league matches with SARS-CoV-2 positive players?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, different treatment strategies have been explored. These mainly involve the development of antimicrobial, antiviral, and/or anti-inflammatory agents as well as vaccine production.

Promising antigens are also indicated such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is already in phase 2/3 clinical trial, and the trimeric protein S, which was shown to be up to 150 times more potent than the serum from convalescent donors. Due to the high death rate, the treatment for those currently infected with coronavirus cannot be ignored. Therefore, the potential use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune sera should be carefully but urgently evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical studies.","output":"COVID-19 and Hyperimmune sera: A feasible plan B to fight against coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccination is generally considered the most direct way to restoring normal life after the outbreak of COVID-19, but the available COVID-19 vaccines are simultaneously embraced and dismissed. Mapping factors for vaccine hesitancy may help the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines and provide valuable insights for future pandemics. OBJECTIVES: We investigate how characteristics of a COVID-19 vaccine affect the preferences of adult citizens in the Netherlands to take the vaccine directly, to refuse it outright, or to wait a few months and first look at the experiences of others. METHODS: An online sample of 895 respondents participated between November 4th and November 10th, 2020 in a discrete choice experiment including the attributes: percentage of vaccinated individuals protected against COVID-19, month in which the vaccine would become available and the number of cases of mild and severe side effects. The data was analysed by means of panel mixed logit models. RESULTS: Respondents found it important that a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine becomes available as soon as possible. However, the majority did not want to be the first in line and would rather wait for the experiences of others. The predicted uptake of a vaccine with the optimal combination of attributes was 87%, of whom 55% preferred to take the vaccine after a waiting period. This latter group tends to be lower-educated. Older respondents gave more weight to vaccine effectiveness than younger respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine is high among adults in the Netherlands, but a considerable proportion prefers to delay their decision to vaccinate until experiences of others are known. Offering this wait-and-see group the opportunity to accept the invitation at a later moment may stimulate vaccination uptake. Our results further suggest that vaccination campaigns targeted at older citizens should focus on the effectiveness of the vaccine.","output":"Please, you go first! preferences for a COVID-19 vaccine among adults in the Netherlands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neonatal brain injury or neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a significant morbidity and mortality factor in preterm and full-term newborns. NE has an incidence in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 per 1000 live births carrying a considerable burden for neurological outcomes such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and hydrocephaly. Many scoring systems based on different risk factor combinations in regression models have been proposed to predict abnormal outcomes. Birthweight, gestational age, Apgar scores, pH, ultrasound and MRI biomarkers, seizures onset, EEG pattern, and seizure duration were the most referred predictors in the literature. Our study proposes a decision-tree approach based on clinical risk factors for abnormal outcomes in newborns with the neurological syndrome to assist in neonatal encephalopathy prognosis as a complementary tool to the acknowledged scoring systems. We retrospectively studied 188 newborns with associated encephalopathy and seizures in the perinatal period. Etiology and abnormal outcomes were assessed through correlations with the risk factors. We computed mean, median, odds ratios values for birth weight, gestational age, 1-min Apgar Score, 5-min Apgar score, seizures onset, and seizures duration monitoring, applying standard statistical methods first. Subsequently, CART (classification and regression trees) and cluster analysis were employed, further adjusting the medians. Out of 188 cases, 84 were associated to abnormal outcomes. The hierarchy on etiology frequencies was dominated by cerebrovascular impairments, metabolic anomalies, and infections. Both preterms and full-terms at risk were bundled in specific categories defined as high-risk 75-100%, intermediate risk 52.9%, and low risk 0-25% after CART algorithm implementation. Cluster analysis illustrated the median values, profiling at a glance the preterm model in high-risk groups and a full-term model in the inter-mediate-risk category. Our study illustrates that, in addition to standard statistics methodologies, decision-tree approaches could provide a first-step tool for the prognosis of the abnormal outcome in newborns with encephalopathy.","output":"A Decision-Tree Approach to Assist in Forecasting the Outcomes of the Neonatal Brain Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a lockdown (from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time. Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay. Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series. A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as reproduction numbers is found at March 8, March 10 and March 3, respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at April 19, but daily infections still show a negative growth. From March 19, the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below one. The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes. Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly. Liberalizations of measures from April 20 did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus, the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable.

As a disease preventive approach and to bring relief to the severity of the symptoms, a infusion termed as Bhabha Anti-Viral Infusion-23 (BhAVI-23) was conceptualized and formulated which comprised of 23 selected spices and herbals. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro antiviral potential of the formulation, BhaAVI-23. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The in-vitro anti-viral potential of BhAVI-23 was assessed through inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as through a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriphage based screening assay system. Anti-diabetic potential was assessed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and the bioactive volatile components were detected through headspace gas chromatography followed by molecular docking analysis. RESULTS: The infusion displayed prominent anti-viral activity as evident from significant (57%) inhibition of the HIV1-RT as well as through reduction in the infectivity of P1 (virulent) bacteriophage. The infusion also exerted profound protection (64%) to non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin. Headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of at least 47 major compounds. Docking analysis indicated possible interaction of -pinene and eugenol with SARS-CoV spike protein.

This speed of production comes because of 50 years of hard work by virologists worldwide in pharma groups, research laboratories, and government licensing units. The present chapter presents the background framework of influenza vaccine production and its evolution over 50 years. Isolation of the causative virus of influenza in 1933, followed by the discovery of embryonated hen eggs as a substrate, quickly led to the formulation of vaccines. Virus-containing allantoic fluid was inactivated with formalin. The phenomenon of antigenic drift of the virus HA was soon recognized and as WHO began to coordinate the world influenza surveillance, it became easier for manufacturers to select an up-to-date virus. Influenza vaccines remain unique in that the virus strain composition is reviewed yearly, but modern attempts are being made to free manufacturers from this yolk by investigating internal virus proteins including M2e and NP as universal vaccines covering all virus subtypes. Recent technical innovations have been the use of Vero and MDCK cells as the virus cell substrate, the testing of two new adjuvants, and the exploration of new presentations to the nose or epidermal layers as DNA or antigen mixtures. The international investment into public health measures for a global human outbreak of avian H5N1 influenza together with a focus of swine influenza H1N1 is leading to enhanced production of conventional vaccine and to a new research searchlight on T-cell epitope vaccines, viral live-attenuated carriers of influenza proteins, and even more innovative substrates to cultivate virus, including plant cells.","output":"Influenza Vaccines Have a Short but Illustrious History of Dedicated Science Enabling the Rapid Global Production of A/Swine (H1N1) Vaccine in the Current Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The preen gland is a holocrine sebaceous gland of the avian integument which produces an oily secretion that is spread on the plumage during preening.

To guide training and exercises, we performed a training needs assessment on infectious disease management among professionals at European POE. METHODS: We disseminated a digital questionnaire to representatives of designated airports, ports, and ground-crossings in Europe. Topics were derived from the IHR core capacities for POEs. Based on the importance (4-point Likert scale) and training needs (4-point Likert scale), we identified the topics with the highest priority for training. These results were put in further perspective using prior experience (training < 3 year, exercise < 5 years, events < 5 years). Also, preferences for training methodologies were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty questionnaires were included in the analyses, representing 50 POEs from 19 European countries. Importance is high for 26/30 topics, although scores widely vary among respondents. Topics with a high training need (16/30) are amongst others the handling of ill travelers; using and composing the public health emergency contingency plan, and public health measures. Respondents from ports and airports attribute equal importance to most topics, but respondents from ports showed higher training needs on 75% of the topics. POEs are unevenly and generally little experienced. The most preferred training methods were presentations.

Those decisions, which are guided in part by author characteristics, can impact the conduct and conclusions of knowledge syntheses, which assimilate much of the evidence base in medical education. To better understand the evidence base, this study describes the characteristics of knowledge synthesis authors, focusing on gender, geography, and institution. METHODS: In 2020, the authors conducted meta-research to examine authors of 963 knowledge syntheses published between 1999 and 2019 in 14 core medical education journals. RESULTS: The authors identified 4,110 manuscript authors across all authorship positions. On average there were 4.3 authors per knowledge synthesis (SD = 2.51, Median = 4, Range = 1C22); 79 knowledge syntheses (8%) were single-author publications. Over time, the average number of authors per synthesis increased (M = 1.80 in 1999; M = 5.34 in 2019). Knowledge syntheses were authored by slightly more females (n = 2047; 50.5%) than males (n = 2005; 49.5%) across all author positions. Authors listed affiliations in 58 countries, and 58 knowledge syntheses (6%) included authors from low- or middle-income countries. Authors from the United States (n = 366; 38%), Canada (n = 233; 24%), and the United Kingdom (n = 180; 19%) published the most knowledge syntheses.

METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 forest goers and 15 stakeholders in Savannakhet province, Lao PDR. Interview topics included experience of malaria prevention and health services, and perceptions of prophylaxis as a potential component of malaria elimination strategy. The interviews were transcribed and coded using inductive and deductive approaches for qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: In ethnically and geographically diverse villages, awareness of malaria risk prompts forest goers to protect themselves, albeit sub-optimally using available preventive measures. Stakeholders highlighted challenges for targeting at-risk populations and approaches to address forest malaria in southern Lao PDR. Among policymakers, choice and cost of anti-malarials, particularly their efficacy and source of funding, were key considerations for the feasibility of malaria prophylaxis. Acceptability of prophylaxis among forest goers was also influenced by the complexity of the regimen, including the number of tablets and timing of doses. Implementation of prophylaxis may be affected by a lack of transportation and communication barriers in remote communities. CONCLUSION: Adding prophylaxis to existing malaria control activities requires strengthening the capacity of local health workers in Lao PDR. Ideally, this would be part of an integrated approach that includes strategies to address the other febrile illnesses that forest goers describe as priority health concerns. The prophylactic regimen also requires careful consideration in terms of effectiveness and simplicity of dosing.

The aim of this study was to describe the impact of these measures on the number of hospitalizations in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units, with the hypothesis that the social behavior generated by this emergency promotes a decreased demand for medical care, even when severe cardiovascular disease is involved. We compared the number of admissions in March-April 2010-2019 versus March-April 2020, based on a prospective study including six institutions (three public and three private) that use Epi-Cardio? as a multicenter registry of cardiovascular care unit discharge. Altogether, we included 6839 patients discharged during the 11-year study period (2010-2020). The average number of patient admissions on March-April 2010-19 was 595 (CI 95%: 507-683) and decreased to 348 in 2020 (fall of 46.8%, p < 0.001). The reasons for hospitalization were classified into 11 groups and a statistically significant reduction was seen in 10 of these groups: cardiovascular surgery 72.3%, electrophysiological interventions 67.8%, non-ST acute coronary syndromes 52.6%, angioplasties 47.6%, arrhythmias 48.7%, heart failure 46%, atrial fibrillation 35.7%, ST elevation myocardial infarction 34.7%, non cardiac chest pain 31.8%, others 51.6%.

These deaths and illnesses can be significantly reduced by using very efficient, reliable, safe and economical solar cookers with which any type of food could be cooked most of the days of the year. Even thought there are today lots of succesfull designs of solar cookers, we still need such optimised designs that could operate even in frankly cloudy days;the solar cookers presented here meet these strict requirements. Globally, cooking food involves a significant and unavoidable consumption of energy cause more than 7.8 billion people must eat at least three times a day and this cooking is done mostly by burning fossil fuels or firewood, generating a large amount of toxic and greenhouse gases and particles that are very harmful to health and the environment. The massive use of solar cookers would have great benefits, but to guarantee their use for at least 85% of the days of each year it is necessary to have very high-performance solar cookers, keeping ease use and reasonably low manufacturing costs. The use of Nonimaging Optics and the Constructal Design have made possible to create solar cookers with which them is possible to cook any food on almost any day of the year.

The hypothesis is based on the observation that the majority of patients in need of intensive care are male, and the connection between androgen receptor signalling and expression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme important for SARS-CoV-2 host cell internalization. TRIAL DESIGN: Hospitalised COVID-19 patients will be randomised (2:1) to enzalutamide plus standard of care vs. standard of care designed to identify superiority. PARTICIPANTS: Included participants, men or women above 50 years of age, must be hospitalised for PCR confirmed COVID-19 symptoms and not in need of immediate mechanical ventilation. Major exclusion criteria are breast-feeding or pregnant women, hormonal treatment for prostate or breast cancer, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, current symptomatic unstable cardiovascular disease (see Additional file 1 for further details). The trial is registered at Ume? University Hospital, Region V?sterbotten, Sweden and 8 hospitals are approved for inclusion in Sweden. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients randomised to the treatment arm will be treated orally with 160 mg (4x40 mg) enzalutamide (Xtandi?) daily, for five consecutive days. The study is not placebo controlled. The comparator is standard of care treatment for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoints of the study are (time to) need of mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital as assessed by a clinical 7-point ordinal scale (up to 30 days after inclusion). RANDOMISATION: Randomisation was stratified by center and sex. Each strata was randomized separately with block size six with a 2:1 allocation ratio (enzalutamide + \\"standard of care\\": \\"standard of care\\"). The randomisation list, with consecutive subject numbers, was generated by an independent statistician using the PROC PLAN procedure of SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed to have three phases. The first, an exploration phase of 45 participants (30 treatment and 15 control) will focus on safety and includes a more extensive laboratory assessment as well as more frequent safety evaluation. The second prolongation phase, includes the first 100 participants followed by an interim analysis to define the power of the study. The third phase is the continuation of the study up to maximum 600 participants included in total. TRIAL STATUS: The current protocol version is COVIDENZA v2.0 as of September 10, 2020.

Paediatric burn patients' pain remains poorly managed by pharmacological interventions, leading to increased anxiety, distress, and trauma in patients and their caregivers. Non-pharmacological psychosocial interventions have been suggested as effective in reducing pain and psychological morbidities among paediatric burn patients and their caregivers; however, their degree of effectiveness and appropriateness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is unclear. METHODS A non-date restricted systematic review was conducted through four databases. Studies published in English assessing psychosocial interventions on paediatric burn patients' physical pain along with theirs and/or their caregiver's anxiety, distress, or trauma symptoms were identified and included in this review. Included studies were assessed for their ability to reduce one of the outcomes of interests and for their reflection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' perspectives of health. RESULTS Of the 3178 identified references, 17 were eligible. These include distraction based techniques (n = 8), hypnosis/familiar imagery (n = 2), therapeutic approaches (n = 4), and patient preparation/procedural control (n = 3). Distraction techniques incorporating procedural preparation reduced pain, while discharge preparation and increased 'patient control' reduced patient and caregiver anxiety; and internet based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy reduced short-term but not long-term post-traumatic stress symptoms. No interventions reflected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' perspectives of health; and few targeted caregivers or focused on reducing their symptoms.

Recently, numerous clinical trials have been registered to examine the safety and efficacy of different types of MSCs and their exosomes for treating COVID-19 patients, with less published data on the mechanism of action. Although there is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19 as of yet, MSC therapies showed an improvement in the treatment of some COVID-19 patients. MSC's therapeutic effect is displayed in their ability to reduce the cytokine storm, enhance alveolar fluid clearance, and promote epithelial and endothelial recovery; however, the safest and most effective route of MSC delivery remains unclear. The use of poorly characterized MSC products remains one of the most significant drawbacks of MSC-based therapy, which could theoretically promote the risk for thromboembolism. Optimizing the clinical-grade production of MSCs and establishing a consensus on registered clinical trials based on cell-product characterization and mode of delivery would aid in laying the foundation for a safe and effective therapy in COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 446 subjects from 3 Arab countries (Egypt, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan). Information regarding sociodemographics, clinical history, COVID-19 infection and vaccination history, and 5C scale were collected online. The 5C scores were analyzed to define the cutoff points using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and to verify the capability of the questionnaire to differentiate whether responders are hesitant or non-hesitant to accept vaccination. ROC curve analysis was conducted for previous vaccine administration as a response, with the predictors being the main 5 domains of the 5C questionnaire. The mean score of each sub-scale was compared with COVID-19 vaccine intake. RESULTS: The mean age of the studied population was 37  11, 42.9% were males, 44.8% from Egypt, 21.1% from Jordan, and 33.6% from the UAE.

Benzophenone (Ph(2)CO), was used as the photoinitiator. The synthesis was optimized by changing the concentration of HEMA, Ph(2)CO, EGDMA, and UV irradiation time. PolyVCi undergoes photocrosslinking by 2 + 2 photocylo addition while the monomer/crosslinker couple, HEMA/EGDMA, undergoes free radical polymerization and crosslinking to form EGDMA crosslinked polyHEMA. Hence, simultaneous interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) formation occurs. The IPN consists of dual network of photocrosslinked polyVCi and EGDMA crosslinked polyHEMA chains. Grafting of HEMA/EGDMA chains on the polyVCi backbone also occur during network formation. The chemical functionalities present in the polyVCi/polyHEMA/polyEGDMA IPN films obtained were characterized by FTIR and SEM analysis. The contact angle measurements show enhanced wettability of the IPN film compared to polyVCi surface. TGA analysis confirms thermal stability of the films. Swelling behavior of the films examined in water and in ethanol reveals the effects of the chemical natures of polyVCi and polyHEMA as well as that of crosslinking on the hydrophilicity of the film.

Vaccine acceptance in LMICs is primarily explained by an interest in personal protection against COVID-19, while concern about side effects is the most common reason for hesitancy. Health workers are the most trusted sources of guidance about COVID-19 vaccines. Evidence from this sample of LMICs suggests that prioritizing vaccine distribution to the Global South should yield high returns in advancing global immunization coverage. Vaccination campaigns should focus on translating the high levels of stated acceptance into actual uptake.

A high triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (Tg/HDL c) ratio has been associated with reduced insulin sensitivity, metabolic syndrome and adverse cardiovascular events. Our aim in this study was to determine the association between different components of the lipid profile and particularly the Tg/HDL c ratio with severe complications like the requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. Methods We collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data to conduct a cohort study in 43 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) at baseline and in the subsequent 15 days. Patients were subjected to a very similar treatment scheme with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Descriptive statistics, variable association and logistic regression were applied to identify predictors of disease severity among elements and calculations from the lipid profile. Results Patients were aged 5714 years; 55.8% were male from which 75% required hospitalization and 44.2% were female who 58% were hospitalized. The most common comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus (58%) and hypertension (40%). Hospitalized and critical care patients showed lower HDL c blood levels and increased Tg/HDL c ratio than those with outpatient management and mild/asymptomatic COVID-19. Tg/HDL c ratio correlated with variables of disease severity such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (r=0.356; p<0.05); the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2)(r=0.495; p<0.01); quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA)(r=0.538; p<0.001); increased need of oxygen support (r=0.447; p<0.01) and requirement of mechanical ventilation (r=0.378; p<0.05). Tg/HDL c ratio have a negative correlation with partial oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SaO2/FiO2) ratio (r=-0.332;p<0.05). Linear regression analysis showed that Tg/HDL c ratio can predict increases in inflammatory factors like LDH (p<0.01); ferritin (p<0.01) and D-dimer (p<0.001). Logistic regression model indicated that  7.45 Tg/HDL c ratio predicts requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 11.815, CI 1.832-76.186, p<0.01). Conclusions The Tg/HDLc ratio can be used as an early biochemical marker of COVID-19 severe prognosis with requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation.","output":"High triglyceride to HDL-cholesterol ratio as a biochemical marker of severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unemployment shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic have reignited concerns over the long-term effects of job loss on population health.

Therefore, combination therapies may have the potential of alleviating the patients outcome. This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of two different combination regimens in improving outcomes of patients infected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a single centered, retrospective, observational study of 60 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive inpatients (18 years old) at two wards of the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Patients data including clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. According to the drug regimen, the patients were divided into two groups; group I who received regimen I consisting azithromycin, prednisolone, naproxen, and lopinavir/ritonavir and group II who received regimen II including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir. RESULTS: The oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were positively changed in patients receiving regimen I compared to regimen II (P = 0.013 and P = 0.012, respectively). The serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) changed positively in group I (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in platelets between both groups (75.44 vs 51.62, P < 0.001), their change did not clinically differ between two groups. The findings indicated a significant difference of the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) between two groups, where the patients under regimen I showed a shorter ALOS (6.97 vs 9.93, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the beneficial effect of the short-term use of low-dose prednisolone in combination with azithromycin, naproxen and lopinavir/ritonavir (regimen I), in decreasing ALOS compared to regimen II. Since there is still lack of evidence for safety of this regimen, further investigation in our ongoing follow-up to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia is underway.

In this pressing emergency, public health strategies aimed at preventing the spread of the pandemic have been primarily oriented towards restrictive measures (travel restrictions, use of PPE) in absence of an adequate educational communication, aimed at increasing citizens' knowledge and skills in regard to the emergency context. Aim To offer a perspective on the Italian situation, in terms of health literacy and life skills in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, aimed not only at identifying deficits, but particularly at determining opportuni-ties and resources (assets) - offered by the peculiar context of crisis - useful to provide citizens with the necessary tools to comprehend the criticalities linked with the emergency and to shape their behaviour to new requirements, in absence of external obligations, as well as to promote future participation of the population - both effective and informed - in a social and political context. Methods A non-systematic review of literature on the subject of health literacy and social cohesion in emergency contexts has been supported by a qualitative assessment, based on the model of assets and on the Italian condition in the last trimester of 2020. Results The scarce ability of the population to independently adequate habits and behaviour to new criti-calities required by the risk of infection - as well as the necessity to suspend their empowerment and capa-bility from government authorities to protect public health - has been firstly traced back to a widespread lack of literacy and life skills at a general population level. The current situation of crisis offers a peculiar opportunity of tools, circumstances and receptiveness to highlight such deficits, as well as an intervention on multiple fronts, in order to increase literacy and capability, both on an individual and on a community level, through inclusive and sustainable initiatives. Conclusion A prevention strategy based on the critical understanding of risk and risk-related criticalities is the only one which can aspire to last over time, while offering an effective tool for the safeguarding of public health, along with an opportunity of being prepared to contrast future emergencies more effectively. The development of such strategies represents one of the most significant contributions Health Promotion can offer in the time of Coronavirus.","output":"Literacy in the time of Coronavirus: an Italian perspective: Value of literacy in the context of a pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Although psychological distress is common among Latinos in the United States, they underutilize mental health services. We describe a community-based program to manage stress and reduce depressive symptoms among low-income Spanish-speaking Latinos. Methods: Mentes Positivas en Accin (MPA) (Positive Minds in Action) is an 8-week group program, delivered by trained promotores in community settings and evaluated through a randomized feasibility study. Participants were randomly assigned to an immediate MPA treatment group or a delayed-intervention control group. Outcomes assessed at baseline and 8 weeks included stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9); higher scores indicate worse health. Repeated-measures analysis of variance examined grouptime interaction effects for group differences in change from baseline to 8 weeks. The control group offered the program after the 8-week assessment, completed an additional assessment at the end of the program (16 weeks); t-tests assessed within-group changes. Results: Most participants were female, born in Mexico, and spoke only Spanish. Grouptime interaction effects were significant for both outcomes. Mean PSS scores improved in the treatment group but not the control group (?0.80 vs. +0.10; p<0.014). Mean PHQ-9 scores improved more in the treatment group than the control group (?5.7 vs. ?0.3; p<0.011).

How do the different run modes shape the chemotaxis strategy of a multimode swimmer? Here, we investigate chemotactic motion of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida as a model organism. By simultaneously tracking the position of the cell body and the configuration of its flagella, we demonstrate that individual run modes show different chemotactic responses in nutrition gradients and, thus, constitute distinct behavioral states.

Thus, new strategies should be developed to solve this problem and increase the efficacy of nanomedicine. In this study, gold nanoraspberries (GNRs) were constructed using ultrasmall gold nanospheres (UGNPs) with a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9-sensitive peptide as a cross-linking agent. These UGNPs were then modified with trastuzumab (TRA) and mertansine derivatives (DM1) via the AuS bond. TRA targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) which is overexpressed on Her-2+ breast cancer cells. The AuS bond in GNRs-DM1 can be replaced by the free sulfhydryl group of GSH, which could achieve GSH dependent redox responsive release of the drug. In the mouse model of Her-2+ breast cancer, a \\"positive feedback\\" triple enhanced penetration platform was construct to treat tumours. Firstly, near-infrared light-triggered photothermal conversion increased vascular permeability, resulting in nanoparticle penetration. Secondly, GNRs disintegrated into UGNPs in response to stimulation with MMPs. GNRs with larger particle sizes reached the tumour site through EPR effect and active targeting. Meanwhile, UGNPs with smaller particle sizes penetrated deeply into the tumour through diffusion. Thirdly, the UGNPs transformed activated cancer-associated fibroblasts to a quiescent state, which reduced intercellular pressure and promoted the penetration of the UGNPs into the interior of the tumour. In turn, an increase in the number of nanoparticles penetrating into the tumour led to a \\"positive feedback\\" loop of triple enhanced photothermal effects and further self-amplify the permeability in vivo. Interventional photothermal therapy (IPTT) was used to improve the therapeutic efficacy by reducing the laser power attenuation caused by percutaneous irradiation. The GNRs also showed excellent multimode imaging (computed tomography, photoacoustic imaging and photothermal imaging) capabilities and high anti-tumour efficacy due to efficient tumour targeting and triple enhanced deep penetration into the tumour site.

We systematically reviewed the existing literature on the prevalence of eating disorders in Latin America. RECENT FINDINGS Of 1583 records screened, 17 studies from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela were included in the analysis. Most studies reported point-prevalence rates and only three studies provided lifetime and 12-month prevalence rates. We found a mean point-prevalence rate of 0.1% for anorexia nervosa, 1.16% for bulimia nervosa, and 3.53% for binge-eating disorder (BED) in the general population. Heterogeneity for bulimia nervosa and BED was large. This meta-analysis indicates that the prevalence of anorexia nervosa seems to be lower, whereas the prevalence of bulimia nervosa and especially of BED seems to be higher in Latin America than in Western countries. SUMMARY Our findings show that eating disorders are common mental disorders in Latin America. However, some facets of Latin American culture might be protective for the development of anorexia nervosa and increase the risk for bulimia nervosa and BED.

However, the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is unclear. METHODS: The Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation (PassITON) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the USA to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with symptomatic disease. Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200C399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14 days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days. The trial is projected to enroll 1000 patients and is designed to detect an odds ratio  0.73 for the primary outcome. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide the most robust data available to date on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of adults hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19. These data will be useful to guide the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the current pandemic and for informing decisions about whether developing a standardized infrastructure for collecting and disseminating convalescent plasma to prepare for future viral pandemics is indicated.

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence.

Over the recent months, increased efforts have been directed towards finding a medication or a vaccine that can stop the prevalence of the infections. A simple review of the COVID-19 worldwide statistics revealed the least affected cases in countries known to be on a vegan diet. Vegetarians have low rates of viral illnesses. To find a lasting solution, researchers are now in the process of investigating the potential role of dietary eating patterns in the control of the prevalence of the coronavirus. Only a few studies have been published concerning this matter. The limited data evaluated in this study revealed that red meat varieties can have some quantities of fats and decreasing their use could help mitigate associated viral or bacterial infections. Some of the reviewed studies confirmed the relationship between consumption of a vegan regimen and low occurrence of viral or bacterial diseases. Though COVID-19 is a vital disease, such a benefit can only be inferred to now since there are still no adequate studies pointing to the advantages of a plant-based diet on the transmission or recovery from the coronavirus disease. It seems reasonable from this review that human dietary habits concerning vegan and red meat consumption should be modified substantially as the world struggles with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

However, the study of the impact of environmental corporate social responsibility on employees' work-related outcomes is inchoate. Drawing on social identity theory and signaling theory, this paper investigates the impact of environmental corporate social responsibility on employees' green innovative behaviors. The mediating role of perceived meaningfulness at work and the moderating role of moral identity are also investigated. Data were collected via a time-lagged and multisource survey. The study analyzed the responses of 271 employees of Chinese enterprises. Hypotheses were examined using hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping. The results indicated environmental corporate social responsibility to be positively related to employees' green innovative behaviors. Perceived meaningfulness at work mediates the link between environmental corporate social responsibility and employees' green innovative behaviors.

Our aim was to continue the regular physical health monitoring of North East Hampshire CMHRS patients who are prescribed lithium during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to achieve above 90% compliance for the monitoring standards. Lithium monitoring clinics have been established in our CMHRS since 2017, Lithium is a high-risk medication as recognised by a National Patient Safety Alert in 2009. Previous annual POMH-UK audits have identified suboptimal monitoring of Lithium patients at local and national levels. Method The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) approach was utilised and a QI Bundle formed. A database of patients who are prescribed lithium has been created and maintained. Synchronised standardised reminder letters are sent to the patients twice yearly. NICE recommends that patients on lithium have their lithium levels checked every 3 months for the first year and then at least every 6 months, plus TFTs, U&Es, calcium and weight every 6 months (or more frequently if impaired). The Specialist Pharmacist Service advise that during the COVID-19 pandemic, if patients are not in the at-risk category then monitoring intervals can be extended by up to 3 months, but that patients in the at-risk category should have their normal monitoring intervals continued. Lithium clinics have been held every April and October since 2017 by the Junior Doctors allocated to NE Hampshire CMHRS. This year they were conducted via telephone appointment or face to face where safe to do so with clinician in full PPE. An audit was subsequently carried out in December 2020 to assess our patient's compliance with the aforementioned NICE recommendations for lithium monitoring, the results of which were compared to previous annual audits. Result Seventeen patients were currently prescribed lithium within the NE Hampshire CMHRS. Over 90% compliance with monitoring was achieved in December 2020 apart from the checking of calcium levels which was slightly below target at 82%, and weight which was at 88%. There was no significant reduction in monitoring standards obtained compared to data from the previous three years. Conclusion Routine monitoring for our patients who are prescribed Lithium was effectively and safely continued during the pandemic. Above 90% compliance with lithium monitoring standards was nearly obtained across all areas. We will continue to offer lithium monitoring twice yearly.","output":"Monitoring lithium therapy in a CMHRS during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies on the real-life effect of the BNT162b2 vaccine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention are urgently needed. In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021. We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020. To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities. A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization. This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities.

Restrictive isolation measures have also brought psychological distress to the pediatric population. Building on the syndrome's characteristics, the present study explored the impact of lockdown on the clinical course of young people with PANDAS/PANS. The initial hypothesis considered both the reduced exposure to viral agents and the strategies of the parents and other containment actions as protective factors against the worsening of symptoms. Methods: One hundred and eight children, adolescents, and young adults were recruited according to the multicenter PANDAS/PANS research program. Parents participated in a web-based survey. Results: contrary to our hypothesis, the study results show an increase in symptoms during the block in 71% of the sample. Psychometric analyzes allowed us to exclude a relationship between the main symptoms of PANDAS and the increase in symptoms or the presence of symptoms before the block and their increase over time. The increase in symptoms is best explained by the presence of sleep disturbances and emotional lability. The exacerbation also appears to be linked to the onset of new symptoms in children and adolescents with depressed moods and eating problems. Furthermore, irritability and oppositionality are significant predictors of acute exacerbation. Equally statistically significant is the factor linked to the effects of pandemic stress, such as the fear of contracting the virus. No significant associations for symptom reduction have been identified between parental strategies or other parent-initiated actions, but the study demonstrates that caregiver perceived efficacy on the strategies used can reduce the risk of exacerbation. Conclusion: This preliminary study highlights the importance of studying the causes of increased symptoms in children with PANDAS/PANS. Life events can exacerbate the clinical condition or generate new symptoms in young patients. In particular, environmental, family, and social changes in the course of clinical symptoms in PANDAS/PANS patients should be investigated. It highlights the importance of emotional and behavioral management, which can be improved by enhancing coping strategies in young people with PANDAS/PANS and their caregivers through a combination treatment in which CBT and PMT are included, in line with guidelines. Limits: An experimental proxy-report questionnaire not yet standardized and validated on the PANS/PANDAS pediatric clinical sample was used for the exploratory study. There is also a small sample size (N = 108) and the absence of a control group (pre-lockdown or children without PANDAS/PANS). It would be interesting to evaluate the exact long-term dimensions to see the course of symptoms after covid and conduct a new study focusing on the impact of stressful events on the clinical course of the syndrome.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic During the Lockdown on Children With the Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANDAS/PANS): The Importance of Environmental Factors on Clinical Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study describes the performance of the Multilingual Naming Test (MINT) by Chinese American older adults who are monolingual Chinese speakers. An attempt was also made to identify items that could introduce bias and warrant attention in future investigation. METHODS The MINT was administered to 67 monolingual Chinese older adults as part of the standard dementia evaluation at the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), New York, USA. A diagnosis of normal cognition (n = 38), mild cognitive impairment (n = 12), and dementia (n = 17) was assigned to all participants at clinical consensus conferences using criterion sheets developed at the ADRC at ISMMS. RESULTS MINT scores were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with education, showing sensitivity to demographic factors. One item, butterfly, showed no variations in responses across diagnostic groups. Inclusion of responses from different regions of China changed the answers from \\"incorrect\\" to \\"correct\\" on 20 items. The last five items, porthole, anvil, mortar, pestle, and axle, yielded a high nonresponse rate, with more than 70% of participants responding with \\"I don't know.\\" Four items, funnel, witch, seesaw, and wig, were not ordered with respect to item difficulty in the Chinese language.

Wastewater analysis for SARS-CoV-2 RNA requires specialized equipment, expensive consumables, and expert staff, limiting its feasibility and scalability. Further, the extremely labile nature of viral RNA complicates sample transportation, especially in regions with limited access to reliable cold chains. Here, we present a new method for wastewater analysis, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), that substantially simplifies workflow (at least 70% decrease in time; 40% decrease in consumable usage compared with traditional techniques) by targeting the labor-intensive processing steps of RNA purification and concentration. To optimize and validate this method, we analyzed wastewater samples from residence halls at the University of Kentucky, of which 34% (44/129) contained detectible SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Although concurrent clinical testing was not comprehensive, student infections were identified in the 7 days following a positive wastewater detection in 68% of samples. This pilot study among university residence halls validated the performance and utility of the ESP method, laying the foundation for future studies in regions of the world where wastewater testing is not currently feasible.","output":"Development and Validation of a Simplified Method for Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in University Dormitories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular and renal complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and represent guideline-recommended therapy in this indication.

Home and office BP, BP variability, and metabolic parameters were secondary endpoints. Forty-seven patients (mean age 63.5  10.7 years) treated with luseogliflozin were included in the full analysis set. CAVI did not change significantly from baseline (mean [95% confidence interval] 8.67 [8.37-8.97]) to Week 12 (8.64 [8.38-8.91]; P = .750), but there were significant reductions from baseline in morning home BP, HbA1c, body weight, body mass index, and serum uric acid levels during luseogliflozin therapy.

However, in emergencies or point-of-care situations, acquiring an ECG is often not an option, hence motivating the need for alternative temporal synchronization methods. Here, we propose Echo-SyncNet, a self-supervised learning framework to synchronize various cross-sectional 2D echo series without any external input. The proposed framework takes advantage of both intra-view and inter-view self supervisions. The former relies on spatiotemporal patterns found between the frames of a single echo cine and the latter on the interdependencies between multiple cines. The combined supervisions are used to learn a feature-rich embedding space where multiple echo cines can be temporally synchronized. We evaluate the framework with multiple experiments: 1) Using data from 998 patients, Echo-SyncNet shows promising results for synchronizing Apical 2 chamber and Apical 4 chamber cardiac views; 2) Using data from 3070 patients, our experiments reveal that the learned representations of Echo-SyncNet outperform a supervised deep learning method that is optimized for automatic detection of fine-grained cardiac phase; 3) We show the usefulness of the learned representations in a one-shot learning scenario of cardiac keyframe detection. Without any fine-tuning, keyframes in 1188 validation patient studies are identified by synchronizing them with only one labeled reference study. We do not make any prior assumption about what specific cardiac views are used for training and show that Echo-SyncNet can accurately generalize to views not present in its training set.

We aimed to design a computable phenotyping strategy to detect acute respiratory distress syndrome in electronic health records of critically ill patients. DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. Using a near real-time copy of the electronic health record, we developed a computable phenotyping strategy to detect acute respiratory distress syndrome based on the Berlin definition. SETTING: Twenty multidisciplinary ICUs in Mayo Clinic Health System. SUBJECTS: The phenotyping strategy was applied to 196,487 consecutive admissions from year 2009 to 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The acute respiratory distress syndrome cohort generated by this novel strategy was compared with the acute respiratory distress syndrome cohort documented by clinicians during the same period. The sensitivity and specificity of the phenotyping strategy were calculated in randomly selected patient cohort (50 patients) using the results from manual medical record review as gold standard. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the patients who did not have acute respiratory distress syndrome documented, the computable phenotyping strategy identified 3,169 adult patients who met the Berlin definition, 676 patients (21.3%) were classified to have severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio  100), 1,535 patients (48.4%) had moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (100 &lt; Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio  200), and 958 patients (30.2%) had mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (200 &lt; Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio  300). The phenotyping strategy achieved a sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 96.9%, positive predictive value of 94.4%, and negative predictive value of 96.9% in a randomly selected patient cohort. The clinicians documented acute respiratory distress syndrome in 1,257 adult patients during the study period. The clinician documentation rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 28.4%. Compared with the clinicians' documentation, the phenotyping strategy identified a cohort that had higher acuity and complexity of illness suggested by higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (9 vs 7;p &lt; 0.0001), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score (76 vs 63;p &lt; 0.0001), higher rate of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (99.1% vs 71.8%;p &lt; 0.0001), higher ICU mortality (20.6% vs 16.8%;p &lt; 0.0001), and longer ICU length of stay (5.1 vs 4.2 d;p &lt; 0.0001).

In four patients (17%), blind embolization was performed. The overall technical success rate was 100%. Clinical success was achieved in 17 patients (71%), while seven patients (29%) rebled within 96 h, and all of them were retreated. No major periprocedural complication was reported. The comparison between the two groups did not show statistically significant differences for gender, mean age, mean pre- and postprocedural hemoglobin, aPTT and INR, mean hematoma volume (cm(3)), or mean delay between CT and DSA. Active bleeding at CTA was detected in 90% of COVID-19 patients and 79% of non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.61). At DSA, active bleeding was assessed in eight out of 10 (80%) patients in the COVID-19 group and 12 out of 14 (86%) patients in the non-COVID-19 group (p = 1).

Vaccination is a method for prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Success in controlling the pandemic is not solely dependent on the effectiveness of the vaccines. It is also dependent on the global acceptance and vaccine coverage rate. This study aimed to determine the acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccination in the Iranian population and the factors affecting it. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study was a cross-sectional research on 1564 Iranian people above 18. Study data were collected using a web-based questionnaire and analyzed using linear regression analysis and logistics at a significance level of 0.05 using SPSS. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of the participants reported acceptance of the vaccines. Ten percent of the people were against and 20% were hesitant to get vaccinated. The results showed that risk perception (P = .003), Knowledge of the disease (P < .001), trust in the health system (P < .001), attitude towards vaccination (P < .001), and vaccination literacy (P < .001) were predictors of vaccine acceptance. People with higher levels of education and mistrust towards the health system had a reduced vaccine acceptance rate. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine in Iran was higher than in the other countries in the Middle East. Extensive interventions are important to increase the trust in the health system and improve the knowledge of vaccine efficacy and literacy.","output":"Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine and determinant factors in the Iranian population: a web-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mirai can be considered as the Covid-19 of IoT network-enabled devices The paper explains through the concepts, evolution and propagation methods of Mirai malware and proposes a vulnerability scanner which could help home users and network administers to scan through their network and find possible entry points for Mirai and the scanner provides suggestions to the user to protect the network from the malware The scanner performs attacks similar to Mirai on the user network and aims to understand the breakpoints ? 2020 IEEE","output":"IoT based mirai vulnerability scanner prototype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to evaluate how far the principles of Gated Community can break the chain of the spread of the COVID19 virus In 2020, the world was widely shocked by Coronavirus (COVID19), which started in Wuhan, spread throughout the globe without exception to Indonesia As one of the busiest cities in Indonesia, Jakarta becomes one of the gateways for COVID19 in Indonesia The outbreak of COVID19, made the Jakarta City Government implement a quarantine system policy, which has an impact on the daily lives of Jakartas inhabitants This situation causes the inhabitants community only to be able to move around in their neighborhood The access restrictions for outsiders of residence arose so that some settlements in Jakarta imposed a gated community system The research method used is a qualitative method, which is carried out with literature and observation studies The data used comes from several regulations issued by the government regarding the COVID19 pandemic and phenomena in the field The research location is the Kelapa Gading This region is a residential area with a majority of the gated community, in the area of the gated community housing can prevent or even break the COVID19 chain in the study area","output":"COVID 19 in gated community at Jakarta, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assessed physical activity (PA) and wellbeing during lockdown.

While structured clinical evidence is prohibitively expensive for manual collection, we exploit large-scale unstructured sentences from medical literature that implicitly contain PICOs and results as evidence. Specifically, we pre-train a model to predict the disentangled results from such implicit evidence and fine-tune the model with limited data on the downstream datasets. Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by large margins, e.g., with a 10.7% relative gain over BioBERT in macro-F1.

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of national lockdowns on adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD). METHODS: Studies were identified searching Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Studies published until 4(th) May 2021 were included. We only considered studies reporting original data from quantitative analysis and assessing changes in adherence to the MD, using validated dietary scores, or in consumption of MD food items. Data extraction, pooling, and quality appraisal of included studies were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were retrieved. After screening, 12 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review, of which 4 (33%) were longitudinal studies. Six (85.7%) of the seven studies that measured changes in MD adherence before-during lockdown reported an increase (rate of change of high-adherence to MD ranged between +3.3% and +21.9%). Evidence indicates that consumption of MD food items increased during lockdown but is heterogeneous in study design, quality, and findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest adherence to the MD during lockdown might have increased in some settings, while the determinants of such a trend are to be further explored.

The experiences, information needs, decision-making and support needs of children and young adult (CYA) patients or their parents during this period is not well known. METHODS: A UK-wide online survey co-produced with patients was conducted in May 2020 amongst CYA aged 12-30, or parents of children aged < 18 years with any long-term kidney condition. Participants answered qualitative open text alongside quantitative closed questions. Thematic content analysis using a three-stage coding process was conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred and eighteen CYA (median age 21) and 197 parents of children (median age 10) responded. Predominant concerns from CYA were heightened vigilance about viral (68%) and kidney symptoms (77%) and detrimental impact on education or work opportunities (70%). Parents feared the virus more than CYA (71% vs. 40%), and had concerns that their child would catch the virus from them (64%) and would have an adverse impact on other children at home (65%). CYA thematic analysis revealed strong belief of becoming seriously ill if they contracted COVID-19; lost educational opportunities, socialisation and career development; and frustration with the public for not following social distancing rules. Positive outcomes included improved family relationships and community cohesion. Only a minority (14-21% CYA and 20-31% parents, merged questions) desired more support. Subgroup analysis identified greater negative psychological impact in the shielded group.

We performed a descriptive analysis, categorical or dichotomous variables were tested (Fisher's exact and the MannCWhitney test), and continuous variables (Spearman correlation). Findings: 62% of patients were female with a mean age of 47 years. Our data suggest that those who had mild COVID-19 (61%) appeared to tend to have prolonged symptoms of COVID-19;84% had symptoms for more than three months that persisted for up to 15 months. The number of symptoms tended to increase over time (p < 0001). 43% had symptoms that persisted and 14% developed new symptoms. Less tolerable symptoms, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, were more common in male patients with non-mild disease, and more tolerable symptoms, such as anosmia and taste changes, were more common in female patients with mild disease. Interpretation: The clinical evolution of long COVID in the Brazilian Amazon appears to be challenging and slow.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of serotonergic psychedelics, i.e., the settings in which people use psychedelics, the motives of usage, and the subjective quality of psychedelic experiences. Methods: The study was part of an international, cross-sectional, internet-based survey (N = 5,049) available in five languages (English, German, Spanish, Italian, and Korean) carried out during the early phase of the pandemic from April to August 2020. Participants were asked to retrospectively rate settings and motives of psychedelic substance use before the pandemic and in the last 4 weeks during the pandemic, as well as changes in psychedelic experiences. Results: Of n = 1,375 participants that reported the use psychedelics in 2019 or 2020, n = 642 (46.6%) also took psychedelics during the pandemic. During the pandemic, participants used psychedelics significantly less often in settings that were outside their home. Top motives to use psychedelics were comparable before and during the pandemic, but participants consumed less out of curiosity, to celebrate, or because friends took it, and more out of boredom. An increase in positively connoted, often pro-social experiences was observed. Two thirds of participants who used psychedelics during the pandemic claimed that psychedelics had helped them to deal better with the corona pandemic at least slightly. Discussion: Changes in setting and motives were mostly in line with restrictions caused by control measures to contain the spread of the virus. The unexpected increase in positively connoted experiences possibly reflects a favorable interaction of environmental macro- and individual micro-contexts during the pandemic (e.g., by reducing the use in more uncontrolled recreational settings or by encouraging a strong self-selection of substance users due to the expectation of bad trips). Increased pro-social feelings under psychedelics might reflect a desire for social interactions in times of social distancing and pandemic-related stress and anxiety.","output":"Psychedelic Experiences During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From an International Online Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Respiratory viral infection causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. We previously reported increased bronchial mucosa eosinophil and neutrophil inflammation in COPD experiencing naturally occurring exacerbations. But it is unclear whether virus per se induces bronchial mucosal inflammation, nor whether this relates to exacerbation severity. Objectives To determine the extent and nature of bronchial mucosal inflammation following experimental rhinovirus (RV)-16-induced COPD exacerbations and its relationship to disease severity. Methods Bronchial mucosal inflammatory cell phenotypes were determined at pre-infection baseline and following experimental RV infection in 17 GOLD stage II COPD subjects and as controls, 20 smokers and 11 non-smokers, with normal lung function. No subject had a history of asthma/allergic rhinitis: all were negative for aero-allergen skin prick tests. Results RV-infection increased the numbers of bronchial mucosal eosinophils and neutrophils only in COPD and CD8+ T-lymphocytes in COPD and non-smokers. Monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ T- and CD20+ B-lymphocytes were increased in all subjects. At baseline, compared to non-smokers, COPD subjects and smokers had increased numbers of bronchial mucosal monocytes/macrophages and CD8+ T-lymphocytes but fewer numbers of CD4+ T- and CD20+ B-lymphocytes. The virus-induced inflammatory cells in COPD were positively associated with virus load, illness severity and reductions in lung function. Conclusion Experimental rhinovirus infection induces bronchial mucosal eosinophilia and neutrophilia only in COPD and monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in both COPD and control subjects. The virus-induced inflammatory cell phenotypes observed in COPD positively related to virus load, illness severity. Anti-viral/anti-inflammatory therapies could attenuate bronchial inflammation and ameliorate virus-induced COPD exacerbations.","output":"Bronchial mucosal inflammation and illness severity in response to experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The need for green business practices and green innovations underscores a growing recognition that climate change is now an existential threat not just to population health but also to the survival of businesses that are unable to embrace green practices with a sense of urgency.

Our purpose is to problematize received wisdom, unquestioned assumptions, and incorrect diagnosis of the sources and health consequences of various forms of wastes in Africa. Much of the discourse on this issue remains ahistorical, and that risks leaving aside a vital question of exploitative extraction.

We propose a framework that delineates the structural composition of costs imposed by market violence that ranges from extraction to e-waste disposal. We advocate for the engineering of policies that create conditions for doing more with less resources, eliminating waste, and recycling as crucial steps in creating sustainable waste management innovations. Additionally, we highlight a set of fundamental issues regarding enablers and inhibitors of sustainable innovations and policies for waste management worth considering for future research.

Since the beginning of the vaccination efforts in December 2020, almost 220,000 adverse events (AEs) have been reported through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a reporting platform administered jointly by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control to monitor vaccine-related AEs. We queried this database twice (04/23/21 and 05/14/21) and identified the AE reports with valid manufacturer-specific lot numbers (n = 76,336), a subset representing 33.54% of the total reported AEs. Using vaccine and demographic characteristics at the time of each query date, a model was generated to predict significant AEs, such as death. Our regression analysis revealed that the average age (IRR 1.08) and the number of doses administered in an assisted living facility (IRR 1.01) were significantly associated with the number of deaths observed in each lot, whereas the proportion of remaining vaccine shelf-life (IRR 1.30) and the vaccine manufacturer (IRR 1.09) were not.

Although there has been extensive research on the S1 protein of TGEV, little is known about the intracellular role of TGEV-S1. In the present study, we used yeast two-hybrid screening of a cDNA library from porcine intestinal cells to identify proteins that interact with TGEV-S1. Among 120 positive clones from the library, 12 intracellular proteins were identified after sequencing and a BLAST search. These intracellular proteins are involved in protein synthesis and degradation, biological signal transduction, and negative control of signaling pathways. Using a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay and Co-IP, we found that UBXN1 interacts with the S1 protein. Here, we observed that TGEV infection led to increased UBXN1 expression levels during the late phase of infection in IPEC-J2 cells. Inhibition of UBXN1 in IPEC-J2 cells via siRNA interference significantly decreased the viral titer and downregulated the expression of S1. UBXN1 overexpression significantly increased the viral copy number. Additionally, we provided data suggesting that UBXN1 negatively regulates IFN- expression after TGEV infection. Finally, our research indicated that UBXN1 plays a vital role in the process of TGEV infection, making it a candidate target for the development of a novel antiviral method.","output":"UBXN1 interacts with the S1 protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and plays a role in viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sweeping reviews will be conducted once the COVID-19 pandemic concludes to support public health system strengthening.

Considering the close anatomo-functional correlations between the limbic system and the central olfactory structures, we investigated olfaction in a population of patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE). METHODS: Nineteen adult subjects (14 males, median age 64 years) diagnosed with definite (14/19) or possible (5/19) AE and followed for  6 months were enrolled. The Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), a 12-item, forced-choice, scratch-and-sniff measure, was used to assess the patients olfactory function in comparison with a group of sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC). According to the B-SIT score, subjects were classified as anosmic (< 6), hyposmic (6C8) and normal ( 9). Electro-clinical, laboratory and neuroimaging findings were reviewed. RESULTS: Smell impairment was revealed in 15/19 patients (9 hyposmic, 6 anosmic), compared with 5/19 HC (p = 0.0029). Age, gender and smoking habits did not affect the participants performance at B-SIT. Olfactory dysfunction appeared more common among patients with definite AE (p = 0.0374), regardless of autoantibody status. Subjects with higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at AE onset more likely presented hyposmia/anosmia (p = 0.033), and so did those with bilateral ictal/interictal EEG abnormalities (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: We found olfaction to be impaired in a significantly large proportion of AE cases. Smell deficits appeared more common in subjects with severe AE (as indicated by both definite diagnosis and higher mRS score), and might represent an additional feature of immune-mediated encephalitis.

The impact of advanced age and anesthesia on cerebral autoregulation remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of sevoflurane anesthesia on cerebral autoregulation in two different age groups. This is a follow-up analysis of data acquired in a prospective observational cohort study. One hundred thirty-three patients aged 18-40 and 65 years scheduled for major noncardiac surgery under general anesthesia were included. Cerebral autoregulation indices, limits, and ranges were compared in young and elderly patient groups. Forty-nine patients (37 %) aged 18-40 years and 84 patients (63 %) aged 65 years were included in the study. Age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentrations of sevoflurane were 0.89  0.07 in young and 0.99  0.14 in older subjects (P < 0.001). Effective autoregulation was found in a blood pressure range of 13.8  9.8 mmHg in young and 10.2  8.6 mmHg in older patients (P = 0.079). The lower limit of autoregulation was 66  12 mmHg and 73  14 mmHg in young and older patients, respectively (P = 0.075). The association between sevoflurane concentrations and autoregulatory capacity was similar in both age groups.

The aim of this study was to microscopically analyse osteotomized humerus of birds following the insertion of solid laser-sintered polyamide 12 rods in order to detect foreign body reaction and, thus, verify the bioinert property of the material in the bone fracture environment. Polyamide 12 intramedullary rods were inserted into the osteotomized humerus of 10 birds (white Plymouth Rock) and blocked using 2mm diameter cortical screws of varying lengths. The birds were operated at 60 days of age and monitored post-operatively for three months. Animals were euthanized at 150 days old and samples of the operated humerus collected for immunohistochemistry, light and scanning electron microscopy analysis.

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) was expressed in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels at the site of the newly formed bone surrounding the implant, indicative of local angiogenesis. There was no bone growth on the surface of the rod; however, the implant did not interfere with the circumjacent bone repair. Thus, the findings of this study corroborate with the literature in characterizing polyamide as a bioinert material and, under the studied conditions, it can be concluded that polyamide 12 intramedullary rod is biocompatible and provides adequate bone consolidation in humeral fractures with no signs of rejection.(AU)","output":"Biocompatibility of polyamide 12 intramedullary rod after humeral consolidation in white Plymouth Rock birds/ Biocompatibilidade de haste intramedular bloqueada de poliamida 12 aps consolida??o ssea umeral em aves Plymouth Rock branca"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Public Mental Health and the Buffering Effect of a Sense of Coherence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To develop a universal strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and infection represents a central aim for effective COVID-19 therapy. The growing impact of emerging variants of concern increases the urgency for development of effective interventions. Since ACE2 is the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor and all tested variants bind to ACE2, some even at much increased affinity (see accompanying paper), we hypothesized that aerosol administration of clinical grade soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) will neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the airways, limit spread of infection in the lung and mitigate lung damage caused by deregulated signaling in the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and Kinin pathways. Here we show that intranasal administration of APN01 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection dramatically reduced weight loss and prevented animal death. As a prerequisite to a clinical trial, we evaluated both virus binding activity and enzymatic activity for cleavage of Ang II following aerosolization. We report successful aerosolization for APN01, retaining viral binding as well as catalytic RAS activity. Dose range-finding and IND-enabling repeat-dose aerosol toxicology testing were conducted in dogs. Twice daily aerosol administration for two weeks at the maximum feasible concentration revealed no notable toxicities. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers can now be initiated, with subsequent Phase II testing in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This strategy could be used to develop a viable and rapidly actionable therapy to prevent and treat COVID-19, against all current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.","output":"Development of a novel, pan-variant aerosol intervention for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Communicating scientific uncertainty about public health threats such as COVID-19 is an ethically desirable task endorsed by expert guidelines on crisis communication. However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversiona well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategyaimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemiccan reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.","output":"Communicating Scientific Uncertainty About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Online Experimental Study of an Uncertainty-Normalizing Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Occupational therapy focuses on therapeutic means to address participation in meaningful everyday tasks across the lifespan.

Data regarding fluid resuscitation and kidney injury in COVID-19 is lacking and understanding this relationship is critical. Objectives To determine if there is an association between fluid volume administered in 24 hours and development of renal failure in COVID-19 patients. Methods Retrospective chart review; 14 hospitals in Indiana. Included patients 18 years old, admitted between March 11, 2020 and April 13, 2020 with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 within 3 days of admission. Patients requiring renal replacement therapy prior to admission were excluded. Volumes and types of resuscitative intravenous fluids in the first 24 hours were obtained with demographics, medical history, and other objective data. The primary outcome was initiation of renal replacement therapy. Logistic regression modeling was utilized in creating multivariate models for determining factors associated with the primary outcome. Results The fluid volume received in the first 24 hours from hospital admission was associated with initiation of renal replacement therapy in two different multi-variate logistic regression models. An odds ratio of 1.42 (CI 1.01 C 1.99) was observed when adjusting for age, heart failure, obesity, creatinine, bicarbonate, and total fluid volume. An odds ratio of 1.45 (CI 1.02 C 2.05) was observed when variables significant in univariate analysis were adjusted for. Conclusions Each liter of intravenous fluid administered to patients with COVID-19 in the first 24 hours of presentation was independently associated with an increased risk for initiation of renal replacement therapy, supporting judicious fluid administration in patient with this disease.","output":"Fluid Resuscitation and Progression to Renal Replacement Therapy in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomics is fundamentally changing epidemiological research.

This study investigated the impact of acute COVID-19 public health restrictions on outside time in April 2020, and quantified the association between outside time and both stress and positive mental health, using secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the COVID and Well-being Study. Participants (n = 3,291) reported demographics, health behaviors, amount of time they spent outside pre/post COVID-19 public health restrictions (categorized as increased, maintained, or decreased), current stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4), and positive mental health (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). Outside time was lower following COVID-19 restrictions (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = -0.19). Participants who increased or maintained outside time following COVID-19 restrictions reported lower stress (p < 0.001, 5.93 [5.74-6.12], Hedges' g = -0.18; p < 0.001, mean = 5.85 [5.67-6.02], Hedges' g = -0.21; respectively) and higher positive mental health (p < 0.001, 24.49 [24.20-24.77], Hedges' g = 0.21; p < 0.001, 24.78 [24.52-25.03], Hedges' g = 0.28) compared to those who decreased outside time.

They also provide a focus for detailed epidemiological studies and allow the timing and impact of interventions to be assessed.A common approach is to aggregate case data to administrative regions. Whilst providing a good visual impression of change over space, this method masks spatial variation and assumes that disease risk is constant across space. Risk factors for COVID-19 (e.g. population density, deprivation and ethnicity) vary from place to place across England so it follows that risk will also vary spatially. Kernel density estimation compares the spatial distribution of cases relative to the underlying population, unfettered by arbitrary geographical boundaries, to produce a continuous estimate of spatially varying risk.Using test results from healthcare settings in England (Pillar 1 of the UK Government testing strategy) and freely available methods and software, we estimated the spatial and spatio-temporal risk of COVID-19 infection across England for the first 6 months of 2020. Widespread transmission was underway when partial lockdown measures were introduced on 23 March 2020 and the greatest risk erred towards large urban areas. The rapid growth phase of the outbreak coincided with multiple introductions to England from the European mainland. The spatio-temporal risk was highly labile throughout.In terms of controlling transmission, the most important practical application of our results is the accurate identification of areas within regions that may require tailored intervention strategies.

METHODS: Respiratory samples were directly used for shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: All Romanian sequences belonged to lineage B, with a different subtype distribution between northern and southern regions (subtype B.1.5 and B.1.1). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the Romanian epidemic started with multiple introduction events from other European countries followed by local transmission. Phylogenetic links between northern Romania and Spain, Austria, Scotland and Russia were observed, as well as between southern Romania and Switzerland, Italy, France and Turkey. One viral strain presented a previously unreported mutation in the Nsp2 gene, namely K489E.

METHODS: A literature search of CINAHL in EBSCO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), EMBASE and MEDLINE in EBSCO was carried out. Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials were included. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 was used for quality assessment. The primary outcome measure was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included mortality, function, health related quality of life, hospital readmissions, long-term care admissions and cognition. A pooled meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software 5.4.1. RESULTS: Five studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies were of some concern in terms of their risk of bias.

Although men are primarily detected to be slightly more vulnerable in succumbing to the ongoing COVID-19 contagion, many researchers have recognized that women are facing more of the devastating brunt in secondary terms. Aside gendered health and social impacts, women are more disproportionately disadvantaged than men in economic terms, as they are predominantly found in the part-time and informal occupations, which have been closed down for months now since the emergence of the current global crisis. Also, since women form the vast proportion of the caregivers within the health sector, their role in handling the pandemic as frontline respondents at the hospitals put them in higher risks of contracting the disease. Despite this higher risk of infection, the peculiar attentions to women's health in the planning and rolling out of actions to contain the virus have been overlooked. Additionally, their unpaid domestic care works have also increased due to closure of schools and businesses, which have forced family members to stay at home for as long as movement control orders remain in place. In this confined state, the domestic violence against women have been recorded to be on the increase. To recommend measures that consider gendered dimensions of the current crisis, we have reviewed the various sex-based burdens and impacts of the pandemic, and proceeded to suggest necessary response actions to handle the situation.

Based on a two\\\\year case study of health and social care devolution in Greater Manchester, England, we trace the relational and territorial geographies of policy across and through new devolved city\\\\regional arrangements. Contributing to geographical debates on policy assemblages and city\\\\regionalism, we advance a conceptual framework linking crisis and opportunity, emulation and exceptionalism, and evidence and experimentation. The paper makes two key contributions. First, we argue health and care policy is increasingly drawn towards the logic of global competitiveness without being wholly defined by neoliberal political agendas. Fostering transnational policy networks helped embed global best practice policies while simultaneously hailing Greater Manchester as a place beyond compare. Second, we caution against positioning the city\\\\region solely at the receiving end of devolutionary austerity. Rather, we illustrate how the urgency of devolution was conditioned by crisis, yet concomitantly framed as a unique opportunity by the local state harnessing policy to negotiate a more fluid politics of scale. In doing so, the paper demonstrates how attempts to resolve the local problem of governing health and care under austerity were rearticulated as a global opportunity to forge new connections between place, health, and economy. Consequently, we foreground the multiple tensions and contradictions accumulating through turning to health and care to push Greater Manchester further, faster.

Precarity refers to uncertainty, loss, disruption, and anxiety, which differentially impact people across contexts. We sought to (a) identify how people understand and resist precarity during the pandemic; (b) explore the potential of precarity to serve as an organizing concept for psychological praxis and research; and (c) explore ways in which psychology of working theory (PWT) may be enriched by an infusion of precarity into its theoretical tenets. Twenty-seven participants who experienced work-related disruptions completed an open-ended survey during the summer of 2020 about the multifaceted challenges they faced. We used conventional content analysis to analyze the responses and derived the following three themes: (a) disruptions at work elevate precarity; (b) relationships as a source of both stress and resilience/resistance; and (c) expanding critical consciousness and resistance. Using a critical qualitative research lens, we identified ways in which people were protected from, or vulnerable to, the threats to their security.

We aimed to compare with a monocentric study the impact of late viral and bacterial respiratory infections on the graft function. METHODS: Patients, who survived 6 months or more following lung transplantation that took place between 2009 and 2014, were classified into three groups: a viral infection group (VIG) (without any respiratory bacteria), a bacterial infection group (BIG) (with or without any respiratory viruses), and a control group (CG) (no documented infection). Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) and acute rejection were analysed 6 months after the inclusion in the study. RESULTS: Among 99 included lung recipients, 57 (58%) had at least one positive virological respiratory sample during the study period. Patients were classified as follows: 38 in the VIG, 25 in the BIG (among which 19 co-infections with a virus) and 36 in the CG. The BIG presented a higher initial deterioration in lung function (p = 0.05) than the VIG.

Self-reported vaccine data may be more readily available to and less expensive for researchers than assessing medical records. Methods: We surveyed adult participants in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership who had an authenticated EHR (N=41,484) concerning receipt of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination using a daily survey beginning in December 2020 and a supplemental survey in September-October 2021. We compared self-reported information to that available in the EHR for the following data points: vaccine brand, date of first dose, and number of doses. Self-reported data was available immediately following vaccination (in the daily survey) and at a delayed interval (in the supplemental survey). Results: For the date of first vaccine dose, self-reported \\"immediate\\" recall was within +/- 7 days of the date reported in the \\"delayed\\" survey for 87.9% of participants.

Specifically, it analyzes the effects of different types of sport activities, including nature-based, natural resource-using, and nature-neutral sport activities and different types of environmentally sustainable behaviors such as recycling, ecological consumption, energy-saving, and mobility on subjective well-being. The study conducts comparisons between the period before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first lockdown in Germany. Quantitative survey data were collected using a convenience sampling approach (n = 412). Sport activities were captured with the number of hours spent on nature-based, natural resource-using, and nature-neutral activities. Environmentally sustainable behaviors were measured across four areas, including recycling, ecological consumption, energy-saving, and mobility. Subjective well-being was measured using the scale of the World Health Organization (WHO-5). Differences between the periods before and during COVID-19 were analyzed using t-tests. A set of multivariate regression models were estimated with subjective well-being as the dependent variable and sport activities, environmentally sustainable behaviors, and socio-demographics as independent variables. The results show that nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities significantly decreased during the first COVID-19 lockdown, while environmentally sustainable behaviors increased. The regression analyses reveal that nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities as well as ecological consumption significantly added to individuals' subjective well-being in the pre- and during-COVID-19-period. A decrease in nature-based and nature-neutral sport activities significantly predicted a decrease in individuals' subjective well-being.

However, nonspecific binding of AM1710 to CB1 R, either peripherally or centrally, could be partially responsible for the analgesic effects of AM1710. Thus, we sought to determine in mice whether spinal (intrathecal; i.t.) or peripheral AM1710 administration could lead to anti-allodynia by reducing the protein expression of spinal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) proinflammatory cytokines and elevating the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the absence of CB1 R. Macrophage cell cultures were examined to characterize AM1710-mediated suppression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-). Either i.p. or i.t. AM1710 reversed CCI-induced mechanical allodynia to sham levels in CB1 R (-/-), (+/-), (+/+) mice. CCI-induced neuropathy decreased IL-10 immunoreactivity (IR) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, with i.t. AM1710 restoring basal IL-10 IR. CCI-induced elevations in proinflammatory cytokine IR were decreased within the spinal cord only after i.t. AM1710 in all mouse genotypes. Meanwhile, within DRG tissue from neuropathic mice, proinflammatory cytokines were decreased following either i.p. or i.t. AM1710. Analysis of cultured supernatants revealed AM1710 decreased TNF-alpha protein.

One reason of such a mess may be that it is common in the natural sciences to disregard philosophy of science where several categories of definitions are recognized, among which the nominal are less, and the so-called real ones are more appropriate in scientific contexts. E.g., water is, by its nominal definition, a liquid having certain observable features and, by its real definition, a specific combination (or a product of interaction) of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Noteworthy, the real definition is senseless for people ignorant of atoms. Likewise, the nominal definition of aging as a set of observable features should be supplemented, if not replaced, with its real definition. The latter is suggested here to imply that aging is the product of chemical interactions between the rapidly turning-over free metabolites and the slowly turning-over metabolites incorporated in macromolecules involved in metabolic control. The phenomenon defined in this way emerged concomitantly with metabolic pathways controlled by enzymes coded for by information-storing macromolecules and is inevitable wherever such conditions coincide. Aging research, thus, is concerned with the elucidation of the pathways and mechanisms that link aging defined as above to its hallmarks and manifestations, including those comprised by its nominal definitions.

OBJECTIVE: In times of a shortage of surgeons it makes sense to examine these relationships in order to evaluate future-oriented adjustments to increase the attractiveness of the profession of surgeon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to the registered members of the German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV) in October 2016. The members were asked about the application of occupational safety measures, individual living conditions, working conditions and the subjective health burden depending on the level of training and type of hospital (basic, standard, maximum care). RESULTS: The response rate was 21% (1065/5011). Occupational safety measures were not strictly implemented: routine use of dosimeters, thyroid radiation protection, smoke extraction and protective goggles only took place in 40% (427/1065), 39% (411/1065), 10% (104/1065) and 5% (55/1065), respectively. The majority of surgeons (51%, 548/1065) rated their lifestyle as unhealthy. The majority of them are senior physicians, 46% (250/548) consider their job to be a health hazard. The proportion of chief physicians and assistant physicians is only 21% (115/548) and 18% (98/548).

Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0, descriptive statistics were presented in tables and charts while the hypotheses were tested with Chi-square at a significant level of p = 0.05. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the mean and standard deviation of the respondents was 22.16 3.11 years; 61.7% were ready for clinical practice, 92(30.7%) were ready to nurse coronavirus patients. There is a significant difference between nursing institutions and readiness for clinical practice p = 0.000. There is no significant difference between years of clinical exposure and readiness for clinical practice p = 0.594. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that though the students had a high level of readiness, only few are ready to practice in coronavirus wards, this could pose a challenge to future nurses. It is important to build clinical competence and students confidence to work in areas of infectious diseases like coronavirus.","output":"Readiness for clinical practice amidst coronavirus among nursing students in southwest nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we investigate the impact of COVID-19 through screening and surveillance methods adopted in India, as well as the potential health system, social, political, and economic consequences. The research was done in a chronological manner, and data was collected between 30 January 2020 till 12 June 2020. Initial containment measures, including point of entry screenings and testing protocols, appeared insufficient. However, testing capacity was gradually expanded after the commencement of a nation-wide lockdown. Modeling predictions have shown varying results on the emergence of cases depending on the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals, with a peak predicted in mid-July having over two million cases. The country also faces risks of the economic plunge by losing approximately 4% of its gross domestic product, due to containment measures and reduction in goods importation. The low public health expenditure combined with a lack of infrastructure and low fiscal response implies several challenges to scale up the COVID-19 response and management. Therefore, an emergency preparedness and response plan is essential to integrate into the health system of India.","output":"Situation of India in the COVID-19 Pandemic: India's Initial Pandemic Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reduced the capacity of many addiction treatment centers, limiting access to safe, continual treatment for people with substance use disorders (SUD) in the setting of a pandemic.

Out of 420 patients screened for COVID-19 from 1 February to 1 July, five patients tested positive for COVID-19: four prior to entering its residential community setting, and one after entering the residential community, resulting in no COVID-19 spread to other patients. Patient 1 presented from home and tested positive during screening prior to entry into the community. The primary care provider for patient 2 notified staff of a recent pos-itive COVID-19 test prior to the patients arrival on-site. Patient 3 had a COVID-19 infection in the weeks prior to arrival and tested positive during initial screening. Patient 4 tested positive af-ter coming from another addiction treatment facility that was shut down due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Patient 5 tested negative for COVID-19 during initial screening, entered the residential community, and later tested positive. It is imperative that in-person support for SUD continues during the pandemic.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacts health care systems worldwide. Cancer patients appear to have an increased risk for adverse events when infected by COVID-19, but the inability to receive oncological care seems may be an even larger threat, particularly in case of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: An online survey was submitted to all members of seven international pancreatic associations and study groups, investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pancreatic surgery using 21 statements (April, 2020). Consensus was defined as >80% agreement among respondents and moderate agreement as 60% to 80% agreement. RESULTS: A total of 337 respondents from 267 centers and 37 countries spanning 5 continents completed the survey. Most respondents were surgeons (n = 302, 89.6%) and working in an academic center (n = 286, 84.9%). The majority of centers (n = 166, 62.2%) performed less pancreatic surgery because of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the weekly pancreatic resection rate from 3 [interquartile range (IQR) 2C5] to 1 (IQR 0C2) (P < 0.001). Most centers screened for COVID-19 before pancreatic surgery (n = 233, 87.3%). Consensus was reached on 13 statements and 5 statements achieved moderate agreement. CONCLUSIONS: This global survey elucidates the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding patient selection for the surgical and oncological treatment of pancreatic diseases to support clinical decision-making and creating a starting point for further discussion.","output":"Global Survey on Pancreatic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical ventilator is a machine that is mechanically designed to deliver breathable air in and out of the lungs to provide a breathing mechanism for a patient who is physically unable to breathe, it is an indispensable life-support device in critical care medicine and medical emergencies such as scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study presents the linearity of tidal volume, peak pressure and lung compliance for the parameters considered. However, the maximum pressure of the ventilation device increases slowly when the tidal volumes exceed 600 ml. In addition, influence of evacuation time of the ventilator predicted over high throughput in time regimes of 1 s; 1.2 s; 1.4 s; 1.6 s, and 1.8 s showed that the pressure platform in the pipe might not appear if the exhaust time of the ventilator is less than 1.6 s.

The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps.

The significance of utilisation of combined drug therapies has been considered to be paramount from the perspective of application of clinical information collected from previous viral epidemics. One prospective treatment application has involved the Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) based approach with utilisation of the combination of drugs Nafamostat Mesylate and Favipiravir with the purpose of reduction of the infectious intensity of COVID-19 viral strain. On account of the extensive prevalence of patients becoming infected with the Novel Coronavirus strain, MDT procedures have been mostly favoured by scientists and clinical virologists with the explicit objective of determination of the probability of such combined drug therapies in terms of assisting the recovery of COVID-19 infected patients. The previous researches conducted on the procedural particulars of treatments regarding effective antidote development for COVID-19 infected patients had brought forth various clinical outcomes on such innovative treatment initiatives concerning the observed effects of MDTs on such patients. The corresponding research literature review endeavour has been oriented towards collecting information regarding 2 specifically utilised medicinal substances (the previously mentioned Nafamostat Mesylate and Favipiravir drugs) for treatment purposes of COVID-19 infected individuals. Such drugs generally are associated with pharmaceutical categories such as antivirals, immune modulators, antibiotics and anticoagulants.

We developed an objective retinal vessel pulsation measurement technique, assessed its repeatability, and used it to determine the phase relations between retinal arteries and veins. METHODS Twenty-three eyes of 20 glaucoma patients had video photograph recordings from their optic nerve and peripapillary retina. A modified photoplethysmographic system using video recordings taken through an ophthalmodynamometer and timed to the cardiac cycle was used. Aligned video frames of vessel segments were analyzed for blood column light absorbance, and waveform analysis was applied. Coefficient of variation (COV) was calculated from data series using recordings taken within 1 unit ophthalmodynamometric force of each other. The time in cardiac cycles and seconds of the peak (dilation) and trough (constriction) points of the retinal arterial and vein pulse waveforms were measured. RESULTS Mean vein peak time COV was 3.4%, and arterial peak time COV was 4.4%. Lower vein peak occurred at 0.044 cardiac cycles (0.040 seconds) after the arterial peak (P = 0.0001), with upper vein peak an insignificant 0.019 cardiac cycles later. No difference in COV for any parameter was found between upper or lower hemiveins. Mean vein amplitude COV was 12.6%, and mean downslope COV was 17.7%.

Greater age was associated with lower admission rates and cost. There was higher resource use in the urban areas. No difference was observed by deprivation. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalisation near the end of life was least frequent for older people and those living rurally, although length of stay for both groups, when they were admitted, was longer.

We hypothesized that we can obtain a completely new kind of information about ACE structure and function if we use the whole set of mAbs directed to different epitopes on the ACE molecule.

Many hotel companies set their annual budget based on this index and include it, together with annual economic results, for evaluation when deciding on a potential management bonus. For managers in some companies, achieving a high NPS becomes nearly as important as achieving strong economic results. The purpose of this research is to deepen the study of the NPS index by analysing the existing relationship that the model has with customer satisfaction, focusing on the following main areas of a hotel: reception, cleanliness and room comfort, and gastronomy. To do so, this study uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA).

Modeling is one of the most important components of decision support systems, which are frequently used to simulate and analyze under-studied systems in order to make more appropriate decisions in medical science. In the medical modeling literature, various approaches with varying structures and characteristics have been proposed to cover a wide range of application categories and domains. Regardless of the differences between modeling approaches, all of them aim to maximize the accuracy or reliability of the results in order to achieve the most generalizable model and, as a result, a higher level of profitability decisions. Despite the theoretical significance and practical impact of reliability on generalizability, particularly in high-risk decisions and applications, a significant number of models in the fields of medical forecasting, classification, and time series prediction have been developed to maximize accuracy in mind. In other words, given the volatility of medical variables, it is also necessary to have stable and reliable forecasts in order to make sound decisions. The quality of medical decisions resulting from accuracy and reliability-based intelligent and statistical modeling approaches is compared and evaluated in this paper in order to determine the relative importance of accuracy and reliability on the quality of made decisions in decision support systems. For this purpose, 33 different case studies from the UCI in three categories of supervised modeling, namely causal forecasting, time series prediction, and classification, were considered. These cases were chosen from various domains, such as disease diagnosis (obesity, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, hepatitis, stenosis of arteries, orthopedic disease, autism) and cancer (lung, breast, cervical), experiments, therapy (immunotherapy, cryotherapy), fertility prediction, and predicting the number of patients in the emergency room and ICU. According to empirical findings, the reliability-based strategy outperformed the accuracy-based strategy in causal forecasting cases by 2.26%, classification cases by 13.49%, and time series prediction cases by 3.08%. Furthermore, compared to similar accuracy-based models, the reliability-based models can generate a 6.28% improvement. As a result, they can be considered an appropriate alternative to traditional accuracy-based models for medical decision support systems modeling purposes.","output":"Accuracy versus reliability-based modelling approaches for medical decision making."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CeD) has been associated with an increased risk of respiratory infections, however, we recently demonstrated that the odds of contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD is similar to that of the general population. Due to this discrepancy, how patients with CeD perceive their risk may differ from their actual risk. AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk perceptions for contracting COVID-19 in patients with CeD and to determine the factors that may influence their perceptions. METHODS: We distributed a survey throughout 10 countries between March and June 2020 and collected data on demographics, diet, COVID-19 testing, and risk perceptions of COVID-19 in patients with CeD. Participants were recruited through various celiac associations, clinic visits, and social media. Risk perception was assessed by asking individuals whether they believe patients with CeD are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the general population. Logistic regression was used to determine the influencing factors associated with COVID-19 risk perception, such as age, sex, adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD), and comorbidities such as cardiac/respiratory conditions and diabetes. Data was presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 10,737 participants with CeD completed the survey. From them, 6,019 (56.1%) patients with CeD perceived they were at a higher risk or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to the non-CeD population. A greater proportion of patients with CeD had high levels of COVID-19 risk perceptions when compared to infections in general (56.1% vs 26.7%; p<0.0001). Consequently, 28.8% reported taking extra COVID-19 precautions as a result of their CeD. Members of celiac associations had lower rates of perceiving an increased risk of COVID-19 when compared to non-members (49.5% vs 57.4%, p<0.0001). Older age (aOR: 0.9; 95% CI: 0.9 to 1, p<0.001), male sex (aOR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.94, p=0.001), and strict adherence to a GFD (aOR: 0.89; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97, p=0.007) were associated with a lower perception of COVID-19 risk. Meanwhile, the presence of comorbidities was associated with a higher perception of COVID-19 risk (aOR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.51, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a large proportion of patients with CeD, particularly females, those with comorbidities, or those not adhering to a strict GFD, believed they were or were unsure if they were at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their condition. As high levels of risk perception may increase an individuals pandemic-related stress and contribute to negative mental health consequences, healthcare providers should maintain consistent communication with the celiac community and provide them with evidence-based recommendations.

A small staff contingent of 60 personnel from US Naval Hospital (USNH) Guam was tasked with the medical care of 4,079 sailors who were placed in single room quarantine amongst 11 hotels across the island of Guam. With the assistance of the Defense Digital Service, the USNH Guam staff implemented a web-based symptom checker, which allowed for monitoring of developing COVID symptoms, and selective testing of symptomatic individuals. Materials and Methods: Sailors from the TR were placed in quarantine or isolation cohorts upon debarking the ship. Sailors not positive for COVID-19 were quarantined amongst 11 hotels on Guam. Sailors positive for COVID-19 were isolated aboard Naval Base Guam (NBG). A retrospective cohort analysis and subgroup analyses were performed on symptom data obtained from sailors in quarantine. The sailors recorded their symptoms and temperature in a web-based symptom checker that assigned a symptom severity score (SSS). Sailors with a SSS >50 were evaluated by a medical provider and re-tested. Data were collected from 4 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. Sailors required two negative tests to exit quarantine and re-embark the ship. The time course, and most common cluster of symptoms associated with a positive COVID-19 PCR test were determined retrospectively after data collection. Results: The web-based symptom checker was successful in establishing daily positive contact and symptom monitoring of susceptible individuals in quarantine. 4,079 sailors in quarantine maintained positive contact with medical staff via the symptom checker, with at least 81% of the sailors recording their symptoms on a daily basis. Individuals with high symptom scores were quickly identified and underwent further evaluation and repeat COVID-19 testing. A cohort of 331 sailors tested positive for COVID-19 while in quarantine and recorded symptoms in the symptom checker before and after a positive COVID-19 test. In this cohort, the most frequent symptoms reported prior to a positive test were headache, anosmia, followed by cough. The symptom of anosmia was reported more frequently in sailors positive for COVID-19, compared to a cohort of matched controls. A small medical staff was able to monitor developing symptoms in a large quarantined population, while efficiently allocating resources, preserving personal protective equipment (PPE), and maintaining isolation and social distancing protocols. Conclusions and Relevance: The application provided a tool for broad health surveillance over a large population while maintaining strict quarantine and social distancing protocols. Highly symptomatic sailors were quickly identified, triaged, and transferred to a higher level of care if indicated. The symptom checker and predictive model generated from the data can be utilized by military and civilian public health officials to triage large populations and make rapid decisions on isolation measures, resource allocation, selective testing.","output":"Implementation of a Web-Based Symptom Checker to Manage the Quarantine of the USS Theodore Roosevelt Crew Following a Shipboard Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study reviewed some publications on the benefits of implementing the research skills development (RSD)framework as evidence for academicians and students at the higher education level in carrying out assignments involving research-based learning activities and other scientific work.

Patients access YouTube, one of the largest video databases in the World, to retrieve health-related information increasingly often. OBJECTIVE We aimed to identify high-quality publishers, so-called \\"channels\\" that can be recommended to patients. We hypothesized that the number of views and the number of uploaded videos were indicators for the quality of the information given by a video on PD. METHODS YouTube was searched for 8 combinations of search terms that included \\"Parkinson\\" in German. For each term, the first 100 search results were analyzed for source, date of upload, number of views, numbers of likes and dislikes, and comments. The view ratio (views / day) and the likes ratio (likes * 100 / [likes + dislikes]) were determined to calculate the video popularity index (VPI). The global quality score (GQS) and title - content consistency index (TCCI) were assessed in a subset of videos. RESULTS Of 800 search results, 251 videos met the inclusion criteria. The number of views or the publisher category were not indicative of higher quality video content. The number of videos uploaded by a channel was the best indicator for the quality of video content. CONCLUSION The quality of YouTube videos relevant for PD patients is increased in channels with a high number of videos on the topic.

Herein, metal-free electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) were developed with nitrogen and sulfur co-doped electrochemically exfoliated graphene (N, S-EEGr) electrocatalysts, which was confirmed as an outstanding bifunctional catalyst for synchronous generation and activation of H2O2 via (2 + 1) e- consecutive reduction reactions. Specifically, two elements (N, S) in metal-free N, S-EEGr-CF cathode synergize to promote the formation of H2O2 followed by its activation. With N, S-EEGr-CF cathode, phenol of initial 50 mg L-1 could be effectively removed within pH 3-11 and 6.25 mA cm-2, and 100% removal efficiency could be achieved within 15-min even at neutral pH. The pseudo-first-order rate constant for phenol removal in metal-free EAOPs with N,S-EEGr-CF at neutral pH was 10 times higher than that with EF process. Detection of active species, coupled with decay kinetics with specific trapping agents, confirmed that OH was the dominant oxidizing species promoting removal efficiencies of organics (phenol, antibiotics and dyes) at pH 3 and pH 7. In the actual wastewater treatment, the synergistic effect of bifunctional catalyst would also be used for improving the degradation efficiency of organics.

The main purpose of this paper is to study the role of green bond proposed by the World Bank in 2008, as a reliable instrument to enhance the capital flow in energy efficiency financing and to develop green energy resources during and post the current challenging global time. Design/methodology/approach We model energy efficiency for 37 members of OECD through a panel data framework and quarterly data over 2007Q1-2020Q4. Findings The major results reveal the positive impacts of issued green bonds and regulatory quality index on energy efficiency, while any increase in inflation rate and urbanization decelerates the progress of raising energy efficiency. Practical implications As highlighted concluding remarks and policy implications, it can be expressed that the tool of green bond is a potential policy to drive-up energy efficiency financing and enhancing environmental quality during and post-COVID period. It is recommended to follow green bond policy with an efficient regulation framework and urbanization saving energy planning. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, although a few scholars have investigated the impacts of COVID-19 on green financing or examined the energy efficiency financing, the matter of modeling energy efficiency-green bond relationship has not been addressed by any academic study. The contributions of this paper to the existing literature are: (1) it is the first academic study to discover the relationship between energy efficiency and green bond in OECD countries, (2) since our empirical part provides estimation results based on quarterly data covering the year of 2019 and 2020, it may offer some new policy implications to enhance energy efficiency financing in and post-COVID period, (3) furthermore, we consider energy efficiency indicator (mix of industrial, residential, services and transport energy efficiency) as the dependent variable instead of using the simple energy intensity variable as a proxy for energy efficiency.","output":"Energy efficiency financing and the role of green bond: policies for post-Covid period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of how genetic variations for functional proteins, such as metabolizing enzymes and drug receptors, impact drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In theory, pharmacists are well suited to utilize PGx in tailoring medications to patient genetics when providing medication therapy management services. However, PGx education needs to reach pharmacists prior to implementation. The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a PGx course for pharmacists. METHODS: A PGx education program was created and offered synchronously (virtual) and asynchronously (self-study) to pharmacists in Alberta, Canada. Lectures were delivered by experts live (virtual) with a question-and-answer period for synchronous sessions. These sessions were recorded for asynchronous delivery. Six case studies were discussed in large and small groups (breakout rooms) in synchronous sessions, and provided for self-study in the asynchronous subgroup. Topics included genetic and PGx concepts; therapeutic applications; ethical, legal, and social considerations; and practical implementation. Pre- and post-course surveys measured self-rated knowledge using a 5-point Likert Scale and tested objective knowledge with a graded quiz. RESULTS: Thirty-six pharmacists completed the course and both surveys. Participants reported backgrounds in community (88.9%) and hospital (38.9%) practice. Prior education in PGx was reported by 44.4% from degree programs and 27.8% from continuing education. Overall responses to statements about confidence in PGx moved from a median of Disagree at baseline to Agree after receiving PGx education (2-point difference [1,2] on 5-point Likert Scale; p < 0.001), indicating an increase in self-assessed competency in PGx. Likewise, mean participant grades on the knowledge quiz improved (20.821.9% pre-course vs 70.219.1% post-course, p < 0.001). There was no difference in these results between synchronous and asynchronous groups. CONCLUSION: A didactic and case-based PGx education program was effective at increasing pharmacist knowledge and confidence in PGx in both synchronous and asynchronous environments. Knowledge gained can be utilized in delivery of patient-centered, personalized medication therapy management in the pharmacy setting.","output":"The Efficacy of a Didactic and Case-Based Pharmacogenomics Education Program on Improving the Knowledge and Confidence of Alberta Pharmacists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) is a first-in-class peptide-drug conjugate that targets aminopeptidases and rapidly and selectively releases alkylating agents into tumor cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with RRMM refractory to pomalidomide and/or an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody received melflufen 40 mg intravenously on day 1 of each 28-day cycle plus once weekly oral dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg (20 mg in patients older than 75 years). The primary end point was overall response rate (partial response or better) assessed by the investigator and confirmed by independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The primary analysis is complete with long-term follow-up ongoing. RESULTS: Of 157 patients (median age 65 years; median five prior lines of therapy) enrolled and treated, 119 patients (76%) had triple-classCrefractory disease, 55 (35%) had extramedullary disease, and 92 (59%) were refractory to previous alkylator therapy. The overall response rate was 29% in the all-treated population, with 26% in the triple-classCrefractory population. In the all-treated population, median duration of response was 5.5 months, median progression-free survival was 4.2 months, and median overall survival was 11.6 months at a median follow-up of 14 months.

When demand for essential resources surpasses availability, difficult triaging decisions are necessary. While algorithms exist, almost nothing is known on societal attitudes regarding triage criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted via social media channels to query a broad sample of society. Participants were asked to make triage decisions in case-based vignettes, exploring a variety of factors. They also were asked to assess how sure they were about their decisions, and how such decisions should be reached. Results: The survey was completed in full by 1626 participants in April 2020. Median age was 39 years (range 12-80 years), 984 (61%) were female. Patient prognosis, responsibility towards others, the absence of behavior-induced co-morbidities, and younger age were rated the most important triage criteria, while participants found that insurance status, social status, and nationality should not play a substantial role. Ethics-committees and point systems were regarded potentially helpful for triage decision-making, while decisions based on order of presentation (first-come first-serve) or on a legal basis were viewed critically. Participants were least sure about their decision when dealing with age or behavior-induced co-morbidities. Overall, women were surer about their decisions than men, participants of Christian faith were also more secure about their decision than atheists-agnostics.

Whereas some of the coronaviral proteins are extensively characterized, others remain understudied. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) protein (a viroporin) in the monomeric form. The protein consists of the hydrophobic -helical transmembrane domain (TMD) and amphiphilic -helices H2 and H3, connected by flexible linkers. We show that TMD has a preferable orientation in the membrane, while H2 and H3 reside at the membrane surface. Orientation of H2 is strongly influenced by palmitoylation of cysteines Cys40, Cys43 and Cys44. Glycosylation of Asn66 affects the orientation of H3. We also observe that the E protein both generates and senses the membrane curvature, preferably localizing with the C-terminus at the convex regions of the membrane. This may be favorable for assembly of the E protein oligomers, whereas induction of curvature may facilitate budding of the viral particles.

Materials and Methods In this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study, 68 patients with 88 hepatocellulcar carcinomas (HCCs) who had undergone pre-RFA MRI were enrolled. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Pre-RFA MRI and post-RFA CT images were analyzed to evaluate the presence of a sufficient safety margin ( 3 mm) in two separate sessions using either side-by-side visual comparison or non-rigid registration software. Patients with an insufficient ablative margin on either one or both methods underwent additional treatment depending on the technical feasibility and patient's condition. Then, ablative margins were re-assessed using both methods. Local tumor progression (LTP) rates were compared between the sufficient and insufficient margin groups in each method. Results The two methods showed 14.8% (13/88) discordance in estimating sufficient ablative margins. On registration software-assisted inspection, patients with insufficient ablative margins showed a significantly higher 5-year LTP rate than those with sufficient ablative margins (66.7% vs. 27.0%, p = 0.004). However, classification by visual inspection alone did not reveal a significant difference in 5-year LTP between the two groups (28.6% vs. 30.5%, p = 0.79).

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study of community-dwelling older adults (age 65 years) receiving public home services that were admitted to any ICU in Ontario, Canada between April 1st, 2009 and March 31st, 2015. All individuals had an interRAI-Home Care (RAI-HC) assessment completed within 180 days of ICU admission; these assessments were linked to hospital discharge abstract records. Patients were categorized using frailty measures each calculated from the RAI-HC: a classification tree version of the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); the Frailty Index - Acute Care (FI-AC); and the Changes in Health, End-Stage Disease, Signs, and Symptoms Scale (CHESS). One-year survival models were used to compare their performance. Patients were stratified based on the receipt of mechanical ventilation in the ICU. RESULTS Of 24,499 individuals admitted to an ICU within 180 days of a RAI-HC assessment, 264% (6,467) received mechanical ventilation. Overall, 43.0% (95% CI 42.4% - 43.6%) survived 365 days after ICU admission. In general, among the overall cohort and both mechanical ventilation sub-groups, mortality hazards increased with the severity of baseline frailty.

RECENT FINDINGS: In detail, the psycho-diagnostic areas of prevention, treatment, and aftercare in the realm of IUDs are focused upon in this work. Before each of these areas is presented in more specificity, the terms digital phenotyping and mobile sensing are introduced against the background of an interdisciplinary research endeavor called Psychoinformatics. Obstacles to overcome problems in this emerging research endeavorsensing psychological traits/states from digital footprintsare discussed together with risks and chances, which arise from the administration of online-tracking technologies in the field of IUDs. SUMMARY: Given the limited validity and reliability of traditional assessment via questionnaires or diagnostic interviews with respect to recall bias and tendencies to answer towards social desirability, digital phenotyping and mobile sensing offer a novel approach overcoming recall bias and other limitations of usual assessment approaches. This will not only set new standards in precisely mapping behavior, but it will also offer scientists and practitioners opportunities to detect risky Internet use patterns in a timely manner and to establish tailored feedback as a means of intervention.","output":"The Potential of Digital Phenotyping and Mobile Sensing for Psycho-Diagnostics of Internet Use Disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is considerable concern in the mental health community about the psychological consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and who may be most vulnerable. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms may be particularly sensitive to the context of the pandemic. Previous research suggests insomnia symptoms may contribute to increased OCD symptoms over time, particularly during times of stress, such as the pandemic. The present study examined pre-coronavirus outbreak insomnia symptoms as a predictor of post-coronavirus outbreak OCD symptoms in a sample of community adults who completed a 2016 survey study and were re-contacted on April 1, 2020 (N = 369). Results revealed a small significant increase in OCD symptoms following the coronavirus outbreak and a small significant decrease in insomnia symptoms. Pre-coronavirus outbreak insomnia symptoms significantly predicted increases in post-coronavirus outbreak OCD symptoms. Similar results were found for specific OCD symptom facets with the exception of washing and hoarding symptoms, which were unrelated to pre-coronavirus insomnia symptoms. There was no evidence for a reverse effect of prior OCD symptoms on insomnia symptoms during the pandemic. These findings suggest those with insomnia symptoms prior to the coronavirus pandemic may be vulnerable to increases in some OCD symptoms during the pandemic. The implications for preventing adverse psychological responses during the coronavirus pandemic are discussed.","output":"Linking insomnia and OCD symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic: Examination of prospective associations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19) hit India recently; and the associated uncertainty is increasingly testing psychological resilience of the masses. When the global focus has mostly been on testing, finding a cure and preventing transmission; people are going through a myriad of psychological problems in adjusting to the current lifestyles and fear of the disease. Since there is a severe dearth of researches on this issue, we decided to conduct an online survey to evaluate its psychological impact. METHODS: From 26th to 29th March an online survey (FEEL-COVID) was conducted using principles of snowballing, and by invitation through text messages to participate. The survey collected data on socio-demographic and clinical variables related to COVID-19 (based on the current knowledge); along with measuring psychological impact with the help of Impact of Event-revised (IES-R) scale. RESULTS: There were a total of 1106 responses from around 64 cities in the country. Out of these 453 responses had at least one item missing; and were excluded from the analysis. The mean age of the respondents was around 41 years with a male female ratio of 3:1 and around 22% respondents were health care professionals. Overall approximately one third of respondents had significant psychological impact (IES-R score > 24). Higher psychological impact was predicted with younger age, female gender and comorbid physical illness. Presence of physical symptoms and contact history predicted higher psychological impact, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: During the initial stages of COVID-19 in India, almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact. This indicates a need for more systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs of the population, which can help the government in formulating holistic interventions for affected individuals.","output":"Initial psychological impact of COVID-19 and its correlates in Indian Community: An online (FEEL-COVID) survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: . Given the transformations in teaching modalities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with vocal self-perception during the pandemic and to investigate the ability of selected variables to predict changes in vocal self-perception in teachers with professional vocal demands during the investigated period. STUDY DESIGN: . Cross-sectional survey. METHOD: . A total of 1,126 teachers of both genders (ages 19 to 78 years, average 43.23 years) who were participating in remote teaching activities using their voice answered the online questionnaire. To characterize vocal changes (improvement, worsening or no change), the teachers self-assessment of their voice quality was considered; the association between the variables reported in the questionnaire and vocal changes was analyzed, as was the capacity of these variables for predicting voice changes. RESULTS: . Most of the teachers worked at a public school, reported having no previous voice changes or difficulties with their voice during online classes and indicated that they began to use their voice less often and with reduced intensity during the pandemic. Vocal demands were divided between teaching synchronous online classes, recording video lessons and participating in online meetings. Several variables were associated with voice improvement and worsening, and some had the capacity to predict voice changes: improvement in voice quality was associated with working in a public school or as an autonomous teacher, reduced voice use and, to a lesser extent, participating in online meetings, certain vocal habits and a reduction in vocal symptoms; worsening voice quality was associated with working in a private school, increased voice use, using the voice at a higher intensity, difficulty with the voice in online classes, vocal habits and vocal symptoms. CONCLUSION: . The context of remote education has changed the way teachers communicate during classes, and monitoring is necessary to ensure that necessary adaptations are made to preserve the voice and ensure effective communication.","output":"COVID-19 and remote learning: predictive factors of perceived improvement or worsening of the voice in Brazilian teachers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines are predominantly used for prevention; that means they should establish a protection in immunized people or animals which will protect them from a possible infection and the subsequent illness when they come into contact with the respective pathogens. Fundamentally, there are two kinds of immunization: active and passive. The latter is based on the administration of immunoglobulin preparations that can neutralize a specific virus. Therefore, passive vaccination is applied only in special cases, such as when the person to be protected recently had verifiable contact with a specific virus (postexposure prophylaxis), or if the risk of exposure to pathogens cannot be ruled out in the following weeks and an active vaccination is not possible, as in short-term planned trips to Third World countries (exposure prophylaxis). An example is the administration of antibodies specific for hepatitis B virus in cases of contamination with blood from people who have an acute or chronically persistent infection with this virus, and thus have high concentrations of infectious particles in the blood. Such accidents occur primarily in medical personnel by needlestick injury (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In certain cases, the administration is performed in combination with an active vaccination (activeCpassive immunization). Specific immunoglobulin preparations are also administered when people have been bitten by animals that may be infected with the rabies virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). In the case of early application (together with an active vaccination), the antibodies can neutralize the virus, and impede its spread in the body. Since the time between contact with the virus and its spread in the organism is often very short, passive immunization is limited to a period shortly before or after exposure to the infective agent (usually within 4 days). Therefore, it is reserved for cases in which the contact with the potential pathogen is well documented and the type of infection is known, and when an appropriate immunoglobulin preparation is available. The protection afforded by antibody preparations lasts just a few weeks, as immunoglobulins are rapidly degraded in the organism. Therefore, postexposure administration of active vaccines is increasingly preferred, e.g. in the context of outbreak-control vaccination. In veterinary medicine, passive immunization is employed occasionally in young animals which were born in a flock with high infection pressure. This approach is applied, for example, in kennels when infections occur with canine parvovirus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20). However, its value is controversial, as the immunoglobulins administered hinder the more advantageous active immunization.","output":"Vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inhibitors of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2), which acts as a ligand-receptor pair that initiates the viral attachment and cellular entry of this coronavirus causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are of considerable interest as potential antiviral agents. While blockade of such PPIs with small molecules is more challenging than that with antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) might offer alternatives that are less strain- and mutation-sensitive, suitable for oral or inhaled administration, and more controllable/less immunogenic. Here, we report the identification of SMIs of this PPI by screening our compound library focused around the chemical space of organic dyes. Among promising candidates identified, several dyes (Congo red, direct violet 1, Evans blue) and novel druglike compounds (DRI-C23041, DRI-C91005) inhibited the interaction of hACE2 with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV with low micromolar activity in our cell-free ELISA-type assays (IC50's of 0.2-3.0 M), whereas control compounds, such as sunset yellow FCF, chloroquine, and suramin, showed no activity. Protein thermal shift assays indicated that the SMIs of interest identified here bind SARS-CoV-2-S and not hACE2. While dyes seemed to be promiscuous inhibitors, DRI-C23041 showed some selectivity and inhibited the entry of two different SARS-CoV-2-S expressing pseudoviruses into hACE2-expressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner with low micromolar IC50's (6-7 M). This provides proof-of-principle evidence for the feasibility of small-molecule inhibition of PPIs critical for SARS-CoV-2 attachment/entry and serves as a first guide in the search for SMI-based alternative antiviral therapies for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by coronaviruses in general and COVID-19 in particular.","output":"Small-Molecule Inhibitors of the Coronavirus Spike: ACE2 Protein-Protein Interaction as Blockers of Viral Attachment and Entry for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Screening for oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and oral premalignant lesions may decrease the devastating morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.

However, this strategy brings off another shadow pandemic of intimate partner violence against women, and no study has been done to assess the magnitude of intimate partner violence against pregnant women during the pandemic in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the prevalence of intimate partner violence and its predictors in Southwest Ethiopia amid the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted, from 15 June 2021 to 15 August 2021, on a total of 590 pregnant women recruited by systematic random sampling techniques. Pretested structured questionnaires were used to collect data, and the data were entered using EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed by SPSS version 24. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of intimate partner violence. Finally, statistical significance was declared at a p-value <0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of intimate partner violence was 39.2%. Of this, 29.8%, 26.8%, and 22.2% of the pregnant women had experienced physical, sexual, and emotional intimate partner violence, respectively. Being illiterate (adjusted odds ratio = 2.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.33C4.19), having illiterate husbands (adjusted odds ratio = 4.79, 95% confidence interval: 2.69C8.55), household decisions made by the husband alone (adjusted odds ratio = 4.91, 95% confidence interval: 3.74C9.33), and pandemic-induced economic downturns (adjusted odds ratio = 9.03, 95% confidence interval: 5.18C15.98) were the predictors that were significantly associated with intimate partner violence. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of intimate partner violence against pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has been found to be high in the study area. Thus, more efforts should be tried to integrating intimate partner violence screening in maternal and child healthcare services, and early identification of high-risk individuals, and continuous community-based awareness creation activities are recommended.","output":"Prevalence and its predictors of intimate partner violence against pregnant women amid COVID-19 pandemic in Southwest Ethiopia, 2021: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The Covid-19 pandemic is profoundly changing the organization of healthcare access. This is particularly so for peritoneal neoplastic diseases, for which curative treatment mobilizes substantial personnel, operating room and intensive care resources. The BIG-RENAPE and RENAPE groups have made tentative proposals for prioritizing care provision. A tightening of the usual selection criteria is needed for curative care: young patients with few or no comorbidities and limited peritoneal extension. It is desirable to prioritize disease conditions for which cytoreduction surgery with or without associated hyperthermic intraoperative peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the gold-standard treatment, and for which systemic chemotherapy cannot be a temporary or long-term alternative: pseudomyxoma peritonei, resectable malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas, peritoneal metastases of colorectal origin if they are resectable and unresponsive to systemic chemotherapy after up to 12 courses, first-line ovarian carcinomatosis if resectable or in interval surgery after at most six courses of systemic chemotherapy.

Here we introduce and study an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model wherein the infection and network coevolve with nontrivial probability to close triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network transitivity. This model provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using numerical simulations and approximate master equations (AMEs), we identify and examine a rich set of dynamical features in the model. In many cases, AMEs including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions. Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AMEs accurately trace the temporal evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population, when closing a triangle is the dominant rewiring mechanism.

Although PEDV vaccines have been used widely, the disease has swept rapidly across the county, and is commonly observed in PED-vaccinated farms, and has recurred in domestic herds. To better understand PEDVs responsible for the reemerging outbreaks in Japan, full-length spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of 45 PEDVs collected in Japan during 2013C2016, were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis based on S gene sequences revealed that all the recent field PEDVs were genetically distinct from the classical Japanese strains, and were classified into three genotypes: North American (NA), S INDEL, and Asian non-S INDEL. Our data suggested a possibility that multiple parental PEDV strains were introduced into Japan from abroad at the same time or similar times. The newly identified Japanese strains showed the closest relationship to the US strains. Two sublineages of Japanese strains circulating in Japan were similar to two sublineages identified in the US, suggesting common ancestors for these strains. In comparison with two vaccine strains used in Japan, the field strains had various changes in epitope regions, glycosylation sites, and phosphorylation sites. These substitutions, particularly observed in epitope regions of the S (521, 553, 568, and 570), M (5), and N (123, 252, and 255) proteins, may have affected antigenicity and vaccine efficacy, resulting in an unsuccessful PEDV control. Sequence comparisons between PEDVs collected from primary and secondary outbreaks in three herds revealed that the disease has developed to an endemic stage in which PEDV could persist for nearly two years in the herds or local regions, causing subsequent epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: These results elucidate the genetic characteristics, origin, and molecular epidemiology of PEDVs circulating in Japan, as well as the PEDV strains causing recurrent outbreaks. This study provides a better insight into the PEDVs responsible for recent outbreaks in Japan, and could potentially help to develop measures for controlling and preventing the disease.

A total of 3402 hospitalizations for COVID-19 and 3680 hospitalizations for influenza admitted between October 1, 2019 and May 31, 2020 across 127 Veterans Administration hospitals nationally were studied using the electronic medical record. Acute kidney injury occurred more frequently among those with COVID-19 compared to those with influenza (40.9% versus 29.4%, weighted analysis) and was more severe. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to require mechanical ventilation and vasopressors and experienced higher mortality. Proteinuria and hematuria were frequent in both groups but more common in COVID-19. Recovery of kidney function was less common in patients with COVID-19 and acute kidney injury but was similar among survivors.

Patients with lower lymphocyte counts at onset had a higher positive conversion rate (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.90) and longer duration for IgG (AHR = 4.01, 95% CI: 1.78-9.02). Conclusions The positive conversion rate of IgG for SARS-CoV-2 was relatively lower and quickly lost in PLWH, which meant PLWH was in a disadvantaged situation when affected with COVID-19.","output":"People Living with HIV Easily lose their Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2: Result From A Cohort of COVID-19 Cases in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic generated an unprecedented volume of evolving clinical guidelines that strained existing clinical information systems and necessitated rapid innovation in emergency departments (EDs). OBJECTIVES: Our team aimed to harness new COVID-19-related reliance on digital clinical support tools to re-envision how all clinical guidelines are stored and accessed in our ED. METHODS: We used a design-thinking approach including empathizing, defining the problem, ideating, prototyping, and testing to develop a low-cost, homegrown clinical information hub: E*Drive. To measure impact, we compared web traffic on E*Drive to our legacy cloud-based folder system and conducted a survey of end-users using a validated health technology utilization instrument. RESULTS: Our final product, E*Drive, is a centralized clinical information hub storing everything from clinical guidelines to discharge resources. Clinical guidelines are standardized and housed within the high-traffic E*Drive platform to increase accessibility. Since launch, E*Drive has averaged 84 unique weekly users, compared with less than one weekly user on the legacy system. We surveyed 52 clinicians for a total response rate of 47%. Prior to the E*Drive rollout, 12.5% of ED clinicians felt confident accessing clinical information on the legacy system, whereas 76.6% of ED clinicians felt they could more easily access clinical information using E*Drive. CONCLUSION: The COVID pandemic revealed vulnerabilities within our information dissemination system and presented an opportunity to improve clinical information delivery. Centralized web-based clinical information hubs designed around the clinician end-user experience can increase clinical guideline access in the ED.","output":"Building Back Better: Applying Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic to Expand Critical Information Access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clostridium sporogenes bacteremia in immunocompetent patients is rare with very few reported cases in the literature.

Changes in the industry impact the stable condition of working in a company or industry and it is not something that can be guaranteed again in the future. The proof is that there are many phenomena of job transfers or even layoffs in various business sectors due to COVID-19 pandemic. Many studies have examined the importance of developing career adaptability skills to face the changing needs of the industry. However, studies that discuss the mechanism of forming career adaptability skills involving important antecedent factors such as teaching quality, social support, and career self-efficacy of polytechnic students are still limited. Therefore, this study aims at examining the effect of teaching quality, social support, and career self-efficacy factors on the career adaptability skills of polytechnic students. Materials and Methods. This study involved 265 students at a polytechnic in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The students expressed their perceptions of the quality of their internship learning, social support, and career self-efficacy C data analysis used Structural Equation Modeling by Amos 18 software. Results. This study reveals that teaching quality and social support does not have a direct effect on career adaptability skills. Meanwhile, career self-efficacy has a direct effect on the career adaptability skills of polytechnic students. Other findings, teaching quality and social support have a direct effect on the career self-efficacy of polytechnic students. Finally, career self-efficacy mediates the effect of teaching quality and social support on the career adaptability skills of polytechnic students. Discussion and Conclusion. This study provides important implications for the development of learning in vocational education so that students have a good mastery of career adaptability skills. Vocational education practitioners must design a vocational teaching model that combines vocational teaching, social support, and career self-efficacy to form mastery of career adaptability skills for pop-polytechnic students. In addition, the development of a vocational education curriculum needs to include mastery of career adaptability skills for students in vocational education, be it vocational high schools or polytechnics. In further research, it is necessary to develop a vocational learning model that aims to inculcate career adaptability skills for vocational students. ?

Although CT radiography is one of the finest imaging methods within the medical field, it's difficult for doctors to categorize the COVID-19 in CT scans. So, computer-Aided diagnoses are often helpful for doctors to understand them accurately without consuming more time. Deep learning has been validated as a well-liked and effective method in many areas of medical imaging diagnostics. The convolutional neural networks CNN were designed to classify COVID-19 disease and Pneumonia. These networks are realistic for CT scans by classifying scanned images with some modifications of the lung nodules. The behavior pattern of the pulmonary nodule is disintegrated into the CNN so that unlike network layers is often wont to secure the appearances of the pulmonary nodules with different sizes. The CNN is proficient in capturing the image structure from its feature maps.

This review presents the first comprehensive, up-to-date information and research progression on the nutritional value, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and toxicity of the genus Merremia. Using the key search term Merremia, relevant documents and information were retrieved from electronic databases. Relevant documents were uploaded in RStudio with installed bibliometric software packages and used for data retrieval, tabulation, and network visualization. Bibliometric analysis revealed that ca. 55% of the studies related to Merremia were published in the last decade, which can be grouped into four thematic areas: (i) drug formulation, (ii) taxonomy, (iii) chemical analysis, and (iv) treatment of diseases. Ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and biological activities studies showed that species in the genus are promising medicinal plants with various pharmaceutical potentials. However, clinical studies to validate the efficacy of the reported bioactivities and the mechanisms underlying the various activities are lacking and should constitute a future research focus. Additionally, reports on the nutritional and antinutritional constituents of Merremia species revealed that the species meet high nutritional quality criteria for animals and are therefore suitable for inclusion in livestock diets.

The authors assess the state of diversity in 8 primary surgical specialties in the United States and evaluate trends in research interest in diversity over the past 30 years. METHODS Articles regarding diversity in surgery from 1990 to 2020 were systematically reviewed. The Association of American Medical Colleges Physician Specialty Data Reports and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books provided resident/fellow and faculty data from 2011 to 2016. Trends were analyzed over time per specialty. RESULTS From 1990 to 2020, a total of 199 publications related to diversity were identified among the various surgical specialties. Orthopedic surgery had significantly more publications per year compared with other specialties (P < 0.05). Every specialty demonstrated a significant increase in publications about diversity over time (P < 0.05). A majority of publications were related to sex rather than underrepresented in medicine topics. The proportion of female surgeons was significantly higher for plastic surgery than for orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery (P < 0.001). Plastic surgery exhibited the highest growth rate in female residents (+1.6% per year, P < 0.001). The proportion of underrepresented minorities composing surgical trainees has not significantly increased in any surgical specialty between 2011 and 2016 (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Although diversity representation in surgery has somewhat improved, the rate is too slow to match the growing diversity of the US population. Outcomes have been disparate between specialties and demonstrate greater increases in sex equality relative to ethnic/racial equality.

We explore how social media discourse about COVID-19 in Italy was affected by the rapid spread of the virus, and how themes in postings changed with the adoption of social distancing measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). We used topic modeling and social network analysis to highlight critical dimensions of conversations around COVID-19: 1) topics in social media postings about the Coronavirus; 2) the scope and reach of social networks; and 3) changes in social media content as the nation moved from partial to full social distancing. Twitter messages sent in Italy between February 11th and March 10th, 2020. 74,306 Tweets sent by institutions, news sources, elected officials, scientists and social media influencers. Messages were retweeted more than 1.2 million times globally.

Like all industrial sectors, the aviation sector must implement measures to reduce its climate impact. This paper focuses on the simulation and the evaluation of climatic scenarios for the aviation industry. For this purpose, a specific tool (CAST for\\"Climate and Aviation - Sustainable Trajectories\\") has been developed. This tool follows a methodology adapted to aviation using the concept of carbon budget and models of the main levers of action such as the level of air traffic, reduction of aircraft energy consumption or energy decarbonisation. These models are based on trend projections from historical data or assumptions from the literature. Several scenario analyses are performed in this paper using CAST and allow several conclusions to be drawn. For instance, the modelling of the scenarios based on the ATAG (Air Transport Action Group) commitments shows that aviation would consume between 2.9% and 3.5% of the world carbon budget to limit global warming to 2{\\\\deg}C and between 6.5% and 8.1% for 1.5{\\\\deg}C. Also, some illustrative scenarios are proposed. By allocating 2.6% of the carbon budget to aviation, it is shown that air transport is compatible with a +2{\\\\deg}C trajectory when the annual growth rate of air traffic varies between -1.8% and +2.6%, depending on the considered technological improvements. However, in the case of a +1.5{\\\\deg}C trajectory, the growth rate would have to be reduced drastically.

We assessed the utility of serum inflammatory markers interleukin-6 (IL-6), C reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and neutralizing antibodies (Diazyme, Poway, CA). In controls, non-hospitalized subjects, and hospitalized subjects assessed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (n = 278), median IgG levels in arbitrary units (AU)/mL were 0.05 in negative subjects, 14.83 in positive outpatients, and 30.61 in positive hospitalized patients (P<0.0001). Neutralizing antibody levels correlated significantly with IgG (r = 0.875; P<0.0001). Having combined values of IL-6 10 pg/mL and CRP 10 mg/L occurred in 97.7% of inpatients versus 1.8% of outpatients (odds ratio 3,861, C statistic 0.976, P = 1.00 x 10(?12)). Antibody or ferritin levels did not add significantly to predicting hospitalization. Antibody testing in family members and contacts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases (n = 759) was invaluable for case finding. Persistent IgM levels were associated with chronic COVID-19 symptoms. In 81,624 screened subjects, IgG levels were positive (1.0 AU/mL) in 5.21%, while IgM levels were positive in 2.96% of subjects. In positive subjects median IgG levels in AU/mL were 3.14 if <30 years of age, 4.38 if 30C44 years of age, 7.89 if 45C54 years of age, 9.52 if 55C64 years of age, and 10.64 if 65 years of age (P = 2.96 x 10(?38)). Our data indicate that: 1) combined IL-6 10 pg/mL and CRP 10 mg/L identify SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects requiring hospitalization; 2) IgG levels were significantly correlated with neutralizing antibody levels with a wide range of responses; 3) IgG levels have significant utility for case finding in exposed subjects; 4) persistently elevated IgM levels are associated with chronic symptoms; and 5) IgG levels are significantly higher in positive older subjects than their younger counterparts.","output":"Corona Virus Disease-19 serology, inflammatory markers, hospitalizations, case finding, and aging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To elucidate the intertwining of vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Strokes are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Vascular risk factors are important drivers of strokes. There are unmodifiable vascular risk factors such as age and ethnicity and modifiable vascular risk factors. According to the INTERSTROKE study, the 10 most frequent modifiable vascular risk factors are arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, overweight, dyslipidaemia, smoking, unhealthy diet, cardiac pathologies, diabetes mellitus, stress/depression and overconsumption of alcohol. Also, infection and inflammation have been shown to increase the risk of stroke. There is high-quality evidence for the clinical benefits of optimal primary and secondary stroke prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a new perspective to this field. Vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factorsand COVID-19are strongly intertwined.

It is associated with a reduction in the transmission of healthcare acquired infections (HAIs), increased trust and uptake of healthcare services, cost saving from infections averted, increased efficiency and improved staff morale. Despite these benefits, there is limited evidence on availability of WASH services in HCFs in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA). This study assessed the availability and status of WASH services within HCFs in the GKMA in order to inform policy and WASH programming. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 60 HCFs. Availability of WASH services in the study HCFs was assessed using a validated WASH Conditions (WASHCon) tool comprising of structured interviews, HCF observations and microbial water quality analysis. Data were analysed using Stata 14 software and R software. RESULTS: Overall, 84.5% (49/58) and 12.1% (7/58) of HCFs had limited and basic WASH service respectively. About 48.3% (28/58) had limited water service, 84.5% (49/58) had limited sanitation service, 50.0% (29/58) had limited environmental cleanliness service, 56.9% (33/58) had limited hand hygiene service, and 51.7% (30/58) had limited waste management service. About 94.4% of public HCFs had limited WASH service compared to only 68.2% of private not for profit facilities. More health centre IIIs, 92.5% and health centre IVs (85.7%) had limited WASH service compared to hospitals (54.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that provision of water, sanitation, hand hygiene, environmental cleanliness, and health care waste management services within HCFs is largely hindered by structural and performance limitations. In spite of these limitations, it is evident that environmental cleanliness and treatment of infectious waste can be attained with better oversight and dedicated personnel.

The IC50 values were estimated from 0.4 to 33.3 M against the 0.5-M enzyme. The dose-dependent adduction of epigallocatechin gallate and myricetin was confirmed by quinone staining of protein blotted onto a membrane. The enzyme activity was decreased by increasing the concentration of the two phytochemicals, accompanied by increasing the respective adducted molecule estimated by intact mass spectrometry. Reduced glutathione canceled the formation of conjugate and the inhibitory effect of epigallocatechin gallate or myricetin on the enzyme, suggesting that the formation of the quinone moiety in the phytochemicals is critical for the inhibition. The covalent binding of epigallocatechin gallate or myricetin to the cysteine residue at the active site was confirmed by analyzing peptides from the chymotrypsin-digested main protease.","output":"Food phytochemicals, epigallocatechin gallate and myricetin, covalently bind to the active site of the coronavirus main protease in vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past decades, Spain has seen a striking convergence between womens and mens participation in the labour market.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 150 recovered COVID-19 patients participated in this study. All the patients tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using qualitative RT-PCR. An ELISA was used to measure anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies in serum samples and screen for their persistence at various time points post-infection. RESULTS: The patients were categorized as asymptomatic (27.3%), mild (28%) and moderate (44.7%) according to the disease severity. Amongst them, 35.3% were females (n = 53) and 64.7% were males (n = 97). Significant anti-S IgG antibody levels were observed among the different groups, with the patients in moderate group exhibiting the highest levels followed by the mild group; while the lowest levels were detected among the asymptomatic. There was a significant positive correlation between the patients age and anti-S IgG antibody concentrations (Pearson r = 0.45; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a solid evidence to support the use of an anti-S IgG ELISA as a diagnostic tool to indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgG seropositivity was sustained in recovered patients up to a hundred days' post-infection, the latest time point for antibody measurement in our study. Ours is the first report in Saudi Arabia to investigate the durability of humoral immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients.","output":"Durability of the humoral immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current genomics era is bringing an unprecedented growth in the amount of gene expression data, only comparable to the exponential growth of sequences in databases during the last decades. This data allow the design of secondary analyses that take advantage of this information to create new knowledge. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have developed Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of heterogeneous and normalized transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and common transcriptional regulators in any biological model. The present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach due to the wealth of data that are being generated, which could be used for validating results. Thus, we have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV viruses and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We have found 1899 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlaps with those identified by former laboratory high-throughput screenings (with P-value near 0). Our results reveal a series of common regulators, involved in immune and inflammatory responses that might be key virus targets to induce the coordinated expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors.","output":"Serial co-expression analysis of host factors from SARS-CoV viruses highly converges with former high-throughput screenings and proposes key regulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the contemporary world of work, employees have a strong focus on the nature and quality of their experiences as workers in organisations, seeking to capture meaning and satisfaction on the job and pursuing a strong fit between work and wider personal priorities and projects.

OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated depression, anxiety and PTG and their correlates among COVID-19 survivors. METHOD: A cross-sectional telephone survey recruited 199 COVID-19 patients (Mean age = 42.7; 53.3% females) at six-month follow-up after hospital discharge in five Chinese cities (i.e. Wuhan, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Nanning). Their demographic information, clinical records and experiences during (e.g. severity of covid-19 symptoms, treatment and exposure to other patients suffering) and after hospitalisation (e.g. perceived impact of covid-19, somatic symptoms after hospitalisation), and psychosocial factors (e.g. perceived discrimination, self-stigma, affiliate stigma, resilience and social support) were investigated. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale, respectively. PTG was examined by the Post-traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) instrument. RESULTS: The proportion of depressive symptoms <5, 5 and <10, 10 were 76.9%, 12.0% and 11.1%, respectively. The proportion of anxiety symptoms <5, 5 and <10, 10 were 77.4%, 15.1% and 7.5%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that receiving mental health care services during hospitalisation, somatic symptoms after discharge, perceived affiliate stigma and perceived impact of being infected with COVID-19 were significantly and positively associated with probable depression. Significant correlates of probable anxiety also included permanent residents of the city, somatic symptoms after discharge, perceived impact of being infected with COVID-19 and self-stigma. Social support, self-stigma and receiving mental health care services during hospitalisation were positively associated with PTG. Conclusions: The results suggest that post-hospitalisation and psychosocial factors had relatively stronger associations with depression, anxiety and PTG than pre-hospitalisation and hospitalisation factors. Promoting social support and social inclusion may be useful strategies to improve the mental health of COVID-19 survivors. HIGHLIGHTS: ?

This paper presents a comparative study on the ways the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted general administrative authorities on the local level with respect to various aspects of their functioning and digitalization in five European countries. With a sample of 926 respondents from the Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia, the study shows that the pandemic-imposed changes are very similar in these countries. The results reveal that, except for Germany, the biggest problems of pandemic-related regulations are their obscurity. For all countries under study, parties to the procedures are shown to be the main driver of digitalization and not the public administration itself, generally lagging behind in this sense. Nevertheless, the pandemic has also created several potential opportunities, whereby public managers, especially in Germany, have acknowledged the importance of digitalization right after the protection of health, as confirmed by the wider use of ICT equipment, particularly in Germany and the Czech Republic. Moreover, Germany and Romania exhibit the greatest potential to accelerate digitalization. Finally, the critical factors influencing accelerated digitalization after the pandemic are also identified.

Understanding global patterns of recombination could help to identify underlying mechanisms and to evaluate the potential risks of rapid adaptation. Conventional approaches (e.g., those based on linkage disequilibrium) are computationally demanding or even intractable when sequence alignments include hundreds of sequences, common in viral data sets. We present a comprehensive analysis of recombination across 30 genomic alignments from viruses infecting humans. In order to scale the analysis and avoid the computational limitations of conventional approaches, we apply newly developed topological data analysis methods able to infer recombination rates for large data sets. We show that viruses, such as ZEBOV and MARV, consistently displayed low levels of recombination, whereas high levels of recombination were observed in Sarbecoviruses, HBV, HEV, Rhinovirus A, and HIV. We observe that recombination is more common in positive single-stranded RNA viruses than in negatively single-stranded RNA ones. Interestingly, the comparison across multiple viruses suggests an inverse correlation between genome length and recombination rate. Positional analyses of recombination breakpoints along viral genomes, combined with our approach, detected at least 39 nonuniform patterns of recombination (i.e., cold or hotspots) in 18 viral groups. Among these, noteworthy hotspots are found in MERS-CoV and Sarbecoviruses (at spike, Nucleocapsid and ORF8). In summary, we have developed a fast pipeline to measure recombination that, combined with other approaches, has allowed us to find both common and lineage-specific patterns of recombination among viruses with potential relevance in viral adaptation.","output":"Global Patterns of Recombination across Human Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has grown to be global public health emergency.

It takes an explorative approach to examine changes in attitude towards urban forests and urban green spaces in terms of attraction (i.e., as the actual use behaviour), intended use (i.e., intention of going to green spaces), and civic engagement in relation to green spaces. In particular, it analyses the responses to a survey of 1987 respondents in Belgium and statistically examines the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics, urbanisation characteristics, actual and intended green space use, and changes in attitudes towards green spaces and civic engagement. The findings show that highly educated citizens experienced an increase in actual and intended use of green spaces during the pandemic, but that this increase differs among sociodemographic profiles such as impact of age or access to private green, and depends on their local built environment characteristics.

The resulting country-level measures of levels of exposure to contagion (excluding health professions) predict the growth in COVID-19 cases, and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the early stage of pandemic (up to four weeks after the 100th case). The relationship between levels of occupational exposure to contagion and the spread of COVID-19 is particularly strong for workers aged 45-64. I found that 20-25% of the cross-country variance in numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths can be attributed to cross-country differences in levels of occupational exposure to contagion in European countries. My findings are robust to controlling for the stringency of containment policies, such as lockdowns and school closures. They are also driven by country-specific patterns of social contacts at work, rather than by occupational structures. Thus, I conclude that measuring workplace interactions may help to predict the next waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Occupational Exposure to Contagion and the Spread of Covid-19 in Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Language is a social determinant of health, no less so in the case of Latinx persons, who make up the second largest ethnic group in the United States.

It is known that wearing PPE, and specifically face masks, has physcial consequences like headache and pain, which can increase stress among nursing staff. However, none of these studies placed a focus on PPE and nursing staff, although nurses are the only members of the health care profession who are at the patients bedsides 24/7, and PPE is the only way to protect them from a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the association between the use of PPE and stress among nursing staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted, which we distributed using snowball sampling techniques. The questionnaire was developed on the basis of (inter-)national recommendations as well as the international literature. We used the perceived level of stress scale to measure the nursing staff members stress levels. Results We included data collected from 2600 nurses in this analysis. Nearly all nursing staff wore face masks. We showed that more than two-thirds of the nurses had moderate to high levels of stress. No statistically significant association between the use of PPE and stress was detected. However, we show a statistically significant association between the duration of mask usage and stress. Discussion and conclusions Nearly all participating nurses wore face masks or FFP masks to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. This observation might indicate that Austrian nurses display a high level of compliance with national and international regulations and play a key role in such pandemics. Our results also show that increased mask-wearing time led to increased stress levels. These results suggest that (inter-)national regulations on how and when to use PPE should include a maximum duration of time for wearing each type of mask. Such regulations could help to prevent work-related stress, particularly in the case of future epidemics, and avoid burnout among nursing staff or even nurses leaving their jobs. The consequences of both of these negative outcomes should be considered in light of the predicted expected future shortage of health care workers.","output":"Associations between personal protective equipment and nursing staff stress during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver diseases are mostly triggered by oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to extracellular matrix overproduction and prone to develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver injury (LI) refers to various pathogenic factors leading to the destruction of stem cells that then affect the livers normal function, causing a series of symptoms and abnormal liver function indicators. Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP) is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese medicines; it contains flavonoids including hesperidin, nobiletin, and tangeretin. CRP has antibacterial, antioxidant, and antitumor effects that reduce cholesterol, prevent atherosclerosis and decrease LI. Here we analyzed the components of CRP and their targets of action in LI treatment and assessed the relationships between them using a systems pharmacology approach. Twenty-five active ingredients against LI were selected based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry results and databases. The drug targets and disease-related targets were predicted. The 117 common targets were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network. We identified 1719 gene ontology items in LI treatment, including 1,525 biological processes, 55 cellular components, and 139 molecular functions. These correlated with 49 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. These findings suggest that CRP may counteract LI by affecting apoptotic, inflammatory, and energy metabolism modules. In vitro experiments suggested that the mechanism may involve hesperidin and naringenin acting on CASP3, BAX, and BCL2 to affect the apoptosis pathway, attenuating liver fibrosis. Naringenin significantly inhibited AKT1 phosphorylation, which in turn mediated activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathways against LI. This study provides a reference for systematically exploring the mechanism of CRPs anti-LI action and is also expands of the application of systems pharmacology in the study of traditional Chinese medicine.","output":"Systems Pharmacology Study of the Anti-Liver Injury Mechanism of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads globally, hospital departments will need take steps to manage their treatment procedures and wards.

We present our standard practices around ECMO decision-making, retrieval, cannulation, ventilation, anticoagulation, tracheostomy, imaging and steroids. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital notes on all SARS-CoV-2 patients who required extracorporeal support at St Bartholomews Hospital between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2020. In total, this included 18 patients over this time period. RESULTS: In total, 18 patients were managed with extracorporeal support and of these 14 survived (78%) with 4 deaths (22%). The mean duration from hospital admission to intubation was 4.1  3.4 days, mean time from intubation to ECMO 2.3  2 days and mean run on ECMO 17.7  9.4 days. Survivor mean days from intubation to extubation was 20.6  9.9 days and survivor mean days from intubation to tracheostomy decannulation 46.6  15.3 days. Time from hospital admission to discharge in survivors was a mean of 57.2  25.8 days. Of the patients requiring extracorporeal support, the initial mode was veno-venous (VV) in 15 (83%), veno-arterial (VA) in 2 (11%) and veno-venous-arterial (VVA) in 1 (6%). On VV extracorporeal support, 2 (11%) required additional VVA. Renal replacement therapy was required in 10 (56%) of the patients. Anticoagulation target anti-Xa of 0.2C0.4 was set, with 10 (56%) patients having a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism detected and 2 (11%) patients suffering an intracranial haemorrhage. Tracheostomy was performed in 9 (50%) of the patients and high-dose methylprednisolone was given to 7 (39%) of the patients. CONCLUSION: In our cohort of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 respiratory failure, a long period of invasive ventilation and extracorporeal support was required but achieving good outcomes despite this.

Their long-term wear facilitates extensive data collection and evolving sensitivity of smart wristbands allows them to read various body vitals. In this paper, we hypothesized the use of heart rate variability (HRV) measurements to drive an algorithm that can pre-empt the onset or worsening of an affliction. Due to its significance during the time of the study, SARS-Cov-2 was taken as the case study, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was trained over its observed symptoms. The data used for the analysis was the outcome of a study hosted by Welltory. It involved the collection of SAR-Cov-2 symptoms and reading of body vitals using Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin smart bands. The internal states of the HMM were made up of the absence and presence of a consistent decline in standard deviation of NN intervals (SSDN), the root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD) in R-R intervals, and low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and very low frequency (VLF) components of the HRV measurements. The emission probabilities of the trained HMM instance confirmed that the onset or worsening of the symptoms had a higher probability if the HRV components displayed a consistent decline state. The results were further confirmed through the generation of probable hidden states sequences using the Viterbi algorithm. The ability to pre-empt the exigent state of an affliction would not only lower the chances of complications and mortality but may also help in curbing its spread through intelligence-backed decisions.","output":"Pre-Emption of Affliction Severity Using HRV Measurements from a Smart Wearable; Case-Study on SARS-Cov-2 Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Aim of this study is to investigate COVID-19 outcomes in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

We report a case of aortic angiosarcoma in association with a graft. We also conducted a clinicopathological review of cases of primary aortic sarcomas associated with implanted grafts. CASE REPORT The patient was an 82-year-old woman. She underwent thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) at age 78 because of an aneurysm in the descending aorta. Approximately 4 years after the TEVAR, computed tomography revealed a type II endoleak and expansion of the aneurysm. Her c-reactive protein level rose to 34 mg/dL, and Ga scintigraphy showed 67Ga accumulation at the aneurysm. She had fever up to 39C, and a stent graft infection was suspected. Despite administration of antibiotics, her condition deteriorated, and she died. Postmortem examination identified epithelioid aortic angiosarcoma at the aorta with aneurysm repair and the graft, and the aortic angiosarcoma invaded the left lower lobe of the lung. CONCLUSIONS Our clinicopathological review revealed that the proper clinical diagnosis was very difficult owing to confusion of aortic sarcoma after the implantation with the infected graft, atypical endoleak, or pseudoaneurysm. The histological diagnosis was ambiguous because immunohistochemical and genetic studies were not adequately conducted. Overall prognosis of aortic sarcoma is poor as most patients die within a year, with no effective treatments. It is hoped that recent projects for genomic medicine will provide useful insights about the diagnosis and treatment of these cancers.","output":"Aortic Angiosarcoma in Association with Endovascular Aneurysm Repair: Case Report and Review of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Allergic contact dermatitis represents a T cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity response to exogenous agents.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Antibiotic resistance (AR) is widely considered to be the next global pandemic. As with COVID-19, the potential for AR to disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities is a major concern. Our goal was to identify gaps in knowledge of AR disparities in order to inform the types of interventions that might be most appropriate to address this. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We reviewed the literature to examine evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in (a) infections with the most concerning drug-resistant bacteria in the United States, and (b) underlying social-economic or behavioral factors that could contribute to such infections. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar to identify studies published in English between August 1973 - August 2020. We used keywords that included: antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-resistant infections, antibiotic-seeking behavior, prescription/non-prescription antibiotic use, antibiotic education, or health literacy AND race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. We screened all s to identify US-based studies that assessed (a) or (b) above. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We identified 11 studies investigating racial/ethnic disparities for 5 of the 17 drug-resistant bacteria flagged in the CDCs 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report. Black, Hispanic, and lower-income individuals were found to be at higher risk of some community-acquired antibiotic-resistant infections. We identified multiple factors that may contribute to disparities in AR-related morbidity and mortality, including reported differences in antibiotic use, higher likelihood of living in crowded/multigenerational homes, more frequent employment in potentially high exposure settings (e.g. slaughterhouses), lower health literacy, and more frequent underlying comorbidities, which increases risks for hospitalization and subsequent acquisition of drug-resistant infections. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Given the small number of studies on this topic, educational interventions that aim to raise awareness of this issue must target not only the public but also researchers. Community-based interventions that seek to address disparities in antibiotic resistance literacy among minority and underserved groups could be particularly impactful.","output":"Racial/ethnic disparities in antibiotic-resistant infections: Knowledge gaps and opportunities for educational interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Findings in different contexts suggest that task orientation and ego orientation are related to adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns, respectively.

Our aim was to describe the influence of restrictive measures on patients living with mild cognitive decline and dementia evaluating SARS-CoV2 infection, changes in routines, cognitive decline stage, neuropsychiatric symptoms, delirium, falls, caregiver stress, and access to sanitary care. Materials and Methods: We gathered MCI and dementia patients with clinical follow-up before and after confinement from DegMar registry (Hospital del Mar). A telephone ad-hoc questionnaire was administered. Global status was assessed using CDR scale. Changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed by Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and retrospective interview for pre-confinement base characteristics. Results: We contacted a total of 60 patients, age 75.4 years  5,192. 53.3% were women. Alzheimer's Disease (41.7%) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (25%) were the most prevalent diagnosis. Remaining cases included different dementia disorders. A total of 10% of patients had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. During confinement 70% of patients abandoned previous daily activities, 60% had cognitive worsening reported by relatives/caretakers, 15% presented delirium episodes, and 13% suffered increased incidence of falls. Caregivers reported an increased burden in 41% cases and burnout in 11% cases. 16% reported difficulties accessing medical care, 33% received medical phone assistance, 20% needed emergency care and 21% had changes in psychopharmacological therapies. Neuropsychiatric profile globally worsened (p < 0.000), also in particular items like agitation (p = 0.003), depression (p < 0.000), anxiety (p < 0.000) and changes in appetite (p = 0.004). Conclusion: SARS-CoV2-related lockdown resulted in an important effect over social and cognitive spheres and worsening of neuropsychiatric traits in patients living with mild cognitive decline and dementia. Although the uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic makes strategy difficult, we need to reach patients and caregivers and develop adequate strategies to reinforce and adapt social and health care.","output":"Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic Confinement in Patients With Cognitive Impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The worldwide proliferation of COVID-19 poses the urgent need for sterilizable and transparent air filters to inhibit virus transmission while retaining ease of communication.

CNAF effectively captured particulate matter (PM) by mechanical and electrostatic filtration mechanisms. The temperature of CNAF could be controlled by Joule-heating up to 100 C with thermal stability. CNAF successfully inhibited the growth of E. coli because of the oligodynamic effect of copper. With heat sterilization, the antibacterial efficiency against G. anodireducens was greatly improved up to 99.3% within 10 min.

All data were registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS The data were collected from an online data bank. Data collection began in 2005 for gastric banding (GB) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) results. In addition to primary bariatric operations, data regarding the complications of revision procedures and redo operations were analyzed. Participation in the quality assurance study was required for all certified centers in Germany. RESULTS RYGBs are a popular redo operation after failed gastric banding. In the German Bariatric Surgery Registry (GBSR), we analyzed data from 263 RYGB operations that used a one-step approach after GB and 116 operations that used a two-step approach. The leakage rates for primary RYGB decreased to 1.8%. The incidence of leakage after a one-step RYGB after GB was lower (1.9%) than after the two-step procedure (2.6%). CONCLUSION RYGBs are popular procedures after failed GB in Germany. The multivariable analysis for overall intraoperative complications revealed a significant difference between the two-step and the one-step procedure. In an unadjusted and multivariate assessment, the one-step procedure had statistically lower general postoperative complications than the two-step approach. Therefore, we suggest performing band removal and RYGB as a one-step procedure. Further analysis is necessary to evaluate the risk factors for the one-step procedure. Follow-up investigations must be performed to determine whether RYGB is an effective and safe option after GB.","output":"One versus two-step Roux-en-Y gastric bypass after gastric bandingdata analysis of the German Bariatric Surgery Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to rapidly mutate and change in ways that impact virulence, transmissibility, and immune evasion. Genome sequencing is a critical tool, as other biological techniques can be more costly, time-consuming, and difficult. However, the rapid and complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 challenges conventional sequence analysis methods like phylogenetic analysis. The virus picks up and loses mutations independently in multiple subclades, often in novel or unexpected combinations, and, as for the newly emerged Omicron variant, sometimes with long explained branches. We propose interpretable deep sequence models trained by machine learning to complement conventional methods. We apply Transformer-based neural network models developed for natural language processing to analyze protein sequences. We add network layers to generate sample embeddings and sequence-wide attention to interpret models and visualize multiscale patterns. We demonstrate and validate our framework by modeling SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus taxonomy. We then develop an interpretable predictive model of disease severity that integrates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence and patient demographic variables, using publicly available data from the GISAID database. We also apply our model to Omicron. Based on knowledge prior to the availability of empirical data for Omicron, we predict: 1) reduced neutralization antibody activity (15-50 fold) greater than any previously characterized variant, varying between Omicron sublineages, and 2) reduced risk of severe disease (by 35-40%) relative to Delta.

PATIENTS AND METHODS 47 consecutive patients underwent LP. 27 patients were recruited on the basis of CT and, of these, 16 patients were randomized on the basis of findings during surgery (transection line must be left of portal vein, as 2-3 cm pancreatic mobilization is required for FBPJ) to receive either Roux-Y FBPJ or hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant. RESULTS Only 34% (16/47) of the patients met the randomization criteria. Clinically significant POPF rate was higher in FBPJ group (60%) compared to thand-sewn closure group (13%; P<0.05). POPF rate in FBPJ group was higher even when compared to all patients with hand-sewn closure (60% versus 37%; P<0.05). Overall, FBPJ was technically feasible for only 28% of patients.

A review of the literature on ERAS protocols for knee arthroplasty during the COVID-19 pandemic was also performed and discussed. A total of 199 knee arthroplasties were performed in fourth quarter of 2019 as compared with 76 in the first quarter of 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients who underwent surgery in the first quarter of 2020 had shorter inpatient stays (3.8 vs. 4.5 days), larger percentage of discharges by postoperative day 5 (86.8 vs. 74.9%), and a larger proportion of patients discharged to their own homes (68 vs. 54%). The overall complication rate (1.3 vs. 3%) and readmission within 30 days (2.6 vs. 2%) was similar between both groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children treated for brain tumors during a 30-year period (n = 139) were included. We documented imaging findings, focusing on cystlike lesion development and its relationship with clinical history and other imaging findings. Multivariable analysis was performed using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models. RESULTS: Cystlike lesions developed in 16.5% of patients treated with radiotherapy, with a median of 2 years until the development of the first lesion. For every 4-year age increase, there were 50% decreased odds of developing lesions and a 50% decrease in the average count of lesions. Females demonstrated a 4.00 rate ratio of developing a higher number of lesions.

Clinical evidence indicates that vitamin D may reduce the risk of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and offers benefit particularly in people with Vitamin D deficiency. Some evidence exists for a higher incidence of active TB in patients who are deficient in vitamin D. An association between low levels of 25(OH)D (the active form of vitamin D) and COVID-19 severity of illness and mortality has also been reported. In addition, low 25(OH)D levels are associated with poor outcomes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The cytokine storm experienced in severe COVID-19 infections results from excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Due to its immunomodulatory effects, adequate Vitamin D levels may cause a decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokines during Covid-19 infections. Vitamin D deficiency was found in 82.2% of hospitalized COVID-19 cases and 47.2% of population-based controls (p<0.0001). The available evidence warrants an evaluation of Vitamin D supplementation in susceptible populations with respiratory diseases such as TB, and particularly in those who are deficient in Vitamin D.

In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of percutaneous endoscopic thoracic decompression (PETD) and posterior thoracic laminectomy (PTL) for treating thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF). METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with TSS caused by TOLF who were treated between April 2016 and May 2020 were included in this retrospective study. They were divided into the PETD (n = 11) and PTL (n = 9) groups. The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months. The visual analogue scale (VAS) score, the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score and the recovery rate (RR) were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There were significant differences between PETD group and PTL group in operative time (min) (95.0  18.8 vs 131.1  19.0), postoperative drainage (mL) (20.2  7.9 vs 586.1  284.2), hospital stay (days) (4.4  1.2 vs 10.4  2.6) (P < 0.05 for all).

Prompt and correct identification of catatonia allows for highly effective treatment and prevention of possible complications. The underrecognition of catatonia in older patients is also frequent, and research in this population is scarce. AIM: To conduct a systematic review of the literature on catatonia in older people to ascertain its clinical characteristics across settings. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to December 2021, with a strategy aimed at identifying all articles published on catatonia in older adults. Titles and abstracts were scanned and selected independently by two authors. Papers investigating issues related to catatonia and/or catatonic symptoms in older people, with English abstracts available, were included. References of selected articles were revised to identify other relevant studies. RESULTS: In total, 1355 articles were retrieved. After removing duplicates, 879 remained. Of the 879 identified abstracts, 669 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 210 articles underwent full text review, and 51 were eliminated for various reasons. Fourteen more articles were selected from the references. Overall, 173 articles were reviewed: 108 case reports, 35 case series, 11 prospective cohort studies, 6 case-control studies, 3 retrospective cohort studies and 10 reviews. We found several particular aspects of catatonia in this population. Catatonia in older patients is highly prevalent and tends to have a multifactorial etiology. Older patients, compared to younger patients, have a higher risk of developing catatonia with benzodiazepine (BZD) withdrawal, in bipolar disorder, and in the general hospital. Age, together with other risk factors, was significantly associated with the incidence of deep venous thrombosis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome poor outcome, other complications and mortality. Treatment with BZDs and electroconvulsive therapy is safe and effective. Prompt treatment of its cause is essential to ensure a good prognosis. CONCLUSION: Catatonia in older patients is highly prevalent and tends to have a multifactorial etiology. The risk of developing catatonia in some settings and conditions, as well as of developing complications, is high in this population.

Although reSET-O improves outcomes for individuals with opioid use disorder, most of the therapeutic content is delivered as narrative text. PEAR-008 is an investigational device based on reSET-O that uses an interactive, game-based platform to deliver similar therapeutic content designed to enhance patient engagement, which may further improve treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate how participants interact with the prescription digital therapeutics new content delivery format. Secondary objectives include evaluating treatment success, symptoms of co-occurring mental health disorders, recovery capital, and skill development. METHODS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study was redesigned using a decentralized model because it was not possible to conduct medication initiation and study visits in person, as initially intended. A decentralized, randomized controlled trial design will be utilized to compare patient engagement with PEAR-008 and that with reSET-O using both subjective and objective assessments. The study population will consist of approximately 130 individuals with opioid use disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 criteria) who have recently started buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Participants will be virtually recruited and randomly assigned to receive either PEAR-008 or reSET-O. All study sessions will be virtual, and the duration of the study is 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure of engagement is operationalized as the number of active sessions per week with either PEAR-008 or reSET-O. (An active session is any session that contains some active participation in the app, such as navigating to a different screen, engaging with a learning module, or responding to a notification.) Subjective dimensions of engagement will be assessed with participant surveys. The hypothesis is that PEAR-008 will have significantly greater participant engagement than reSET-O. RESULTS: As of February 2021, participant enrollment is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial will investigate if changing the delivery format and enhancing the content of a prescription digital therapeutic for opioid use disorder will affect how participants use and interact with the prescription digital therapeutic.

By mapping the node embeddings into a two-dimensional space, we find there is clear segregation between left- and right-leaning users. Although using only one of the features or the concatenation does not improve the performance of modeling, we find notable differences in user descriptions, topics, images, and levels of retweet activities. Our framework shows wide applicability and can be further extended by integrating other modalities of data and more relations. The findings have implications for understanding online political polarization and designing mitigation policies for potentially negative outcome of extreme polarization.","output":"Understanding Political Polarization on Social Platforms by Jointly Modeling Users, Connections and Multi-modal Post Contents in Heterogeneous Graphs (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly transforming the healthcare system, with telemedicine, or virtual health, being one of the key drivers of the change.

The capacity of these severe patients to mount a robust and persistent SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response despite the presence of severe immune alterations during the ICU stay is unknown. METHODS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients were sampled five times during the ICU stay and 9 and 13 months afterwards. Immune monitoring included counts of lymphocyte subpopulations, HLA-DR expression on monocytes, plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and T cell proliferation in response to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens. FINDINGS: Despite the presence of major lymphopenia and decreased monocyte HLA-DR expression during the ICU stay, convalescent critically ill COVID-19 patients consistently generated adaptive and humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 maintained for more than one year after hospital discharge. Patients with long hospital stays presented with stronger anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response but no difference in anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG levels. INTERPRETATION: Convalescent critically ill COVID-19 patients consistently generated a memory immune response against SARS-CoV-2 maintained for more than one year after hospital discharge. In recovered individuals, the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response was dependent on length of hospital stay.

It is thought that the distress and uncertainty of pandemic clubbed with information overload and its ambiguity have paved the way for cyberchondria. Students being the vulnerable population, the present study was an effort at understanding cyberchondria in students. AIM: The aim of the study is to assess cyberchondria and its association with depression, anxiety, stress, and quality of life (QOL) in dental students during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on dental students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured pro forma, General Health Questionnaire-12, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21, Cyberchondria Severity Scale 15, and European Health Interview Survey QOL 8. RESULTS: The study revealed that 98.7% of the students were affected by one of the constructs of cyberchondria, viz., excessiveness (93.7%), followed by distress (84.3%) and reassurance-seeking behavior (83.7%). Cyberchondria affected girls more than boys and shared robust positive correlation with depression, anxiety, and stress but not QOL. Factors such as stress, anxiety, QOL, and changes in appetite were associated with higher severity of depression. Family financial losses, preexisting psychiatric illness, and media adverse effect shared robust positive associations with severity of depression, anxiety, and stress and an inverse association with QOL. 76.0% of the students expressed excessive worries regarding missing out on clinical exposure, and nearly half of the students were dissatisfied with eLearning. 78.3% of the students experienced changes in sleep; 68.7% had changes in appetite; and 89.0% reported reduction in the level of physical activity.

However, the degree to which CA contributes to mortality as a preventable driver of ill-health and death is unknown. Objective To estimate the contribution of CA to health behaviors, including smoking and sedentary behavior, as well as the annual mortality attributable to CA in the US through influences on leading causes of death (eg, cardiovascular disease). Evidence Review For this systematic review, the PsycINFO and MEDLINE databases were searched on November 15, 2019. The databases were searched for publications from inception (1806 for PsycINFO, 1946 for MEDLINE) to November 15, 2019. Meta-analyses of the associations between CA and morbidity outcomes were included. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated from these associations along with the estimated US prevalence of CA. The PAF was then applied to the number of annual deaths associated with each cause of death to estimate the number of deaths that are attributable to CA. Additionally, the PAF was applied to the incidence of health behaviors to derive the number of cases attributable to CA. Exposure to 1 or more experiences of adversity before the age of 18 years was analyzed, including abuse, neglect, family violence, and economic adversity. Findings A total of 19 meta-analyses with 20 654 832 participants were reviewed. Childhood adversity accounted for approximately 439 072 deaths annually in the US, or 15% of the total US mortality in 2019 (2 854 838 deaths), through associations with leading causes of death (including heart disease, cancer, and suicide). In addition, CA was associated with millions of cases of unhealthy behaviors and disease markers, including more than 22 million cases of sexually transmitted infections, 21 million cases of illicit drug use, 19 million cases of elevated inflammation, and more than 10 million cases each of smoking and physical inactivity. The greatest proportion of outcomes attributable to CA were for suicide attempts and sexually transmitted infections, for which adversity accounted for up to 38% and 33%, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this systematic review suggest that CA is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality in the US and may be considered a preventable determinant of mortality. The prevention of CA and the intervention on pathways that link these experiences to elevated disease risk should be considered a critical public health priority.","output":"Association of Childhood Adversity With Morbidity and Mortality in US Adults: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the relationship between wearing protective masks combined with goggles and skin injuries in medical staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING A cross-sectional, multicenter online survey investigating skin injuries in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Respondents voluntarily completed the questionnaire on their smartphones. Ordinal and multinomial logistic regression were employed to identify factors related to skin injuries. RESULTS In total, 1,611 respondents wore protective masks combined with goggles in 145 hospitals in China; 1,281 cases of skin injuries were found, and the overall prevalence was 79.5%. Multiple concomitant skin injuries (68.5%) and injuries in four locations (24.0%) were the most common, followed by injuries in three locations (22.8%), two locations (21.7%) and one location (11.0%). Multinomial logistic regression indicated that sweating increased the risk of injuries in 1-4 locations (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio [OR] 16.23-60.02 for one location and 38.22-239.04 for four locations), and wearing an N95 mask combined with goggles and a daily use > 4 hours increased the risk of injuries in four locations (95% CI for OR 1.18-5.31 and 1.14-3.93, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of skin injuries among medical staff wearing protective masks combined with goggles was very high. These were mainly device-related pressure injuries, moisture-associated skin damage and skin tears. The combination of multiple factors resulted in skin injuries at multiple sites. Preventing and managing sweating should be a focus for medical staff who wear protective masks combined with goggles for more than 4 hours.","output":"Association between Protective Masks Combined with Goggles and Skin Injuries in Medical Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM The aim of this study was to reveal the impacts of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the functioning of neurosurgery clinics and to determine the anxiety levels and attitudes of Turkish neurosurgeons towards their profession during the pandemic.

Moreover, the compounds pharmacokinetic and toxic profiles were also analyzed using computational tools. RESULTS: The protein?ligand docking score (kcal/mol) revealed that all the tested AGP derivatives showed a better binding affinity towards all the tested enzymes than hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Meanwhile, all the tested AGP derivatives showed a better binding score with RdRp and S than remdesivir (REM). Interestingly, compounds 12, 14, and 15 showed a better binding affinity towards the all the tested enzyme than AGP, REM, and HCQ.

Methods In this study, malaria infection model was constructed. Distribution of æT cells in various immune organs and dynamic changes of æT cells in the spleens of C57BL/6 mice after infection were detected by flow cytometry. And activation status of æT cells was detected by flow cytometry. Then æT cells in naive and infected mice were sorted and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Finally, æTCR KO mice model was constructed and the effect of æT cell depletion on mouse T and B cell immunity against Plasmodium infection was explored. Results Here, splenic æT cells were found to increase significantly on day 14 after Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis NSM infection in C57BL/6 mice. Higher level of CD69, ICOS and PD-1, lower level of CD62L, and decreased IFN- producing after stimulation by PMA and ionomycin were found in æT cells from infected mice, compared with naive mice. Moreover, 11 clusters were identified in æT cells by scRNA-seq based t-SNE analysis. Cluster 4, 5, and 7 in æT cells from infected mice were found the expression of numerous genes involved in immune response. In the same time, the GO enrichment analysis revealed that the marker genes in the infection group were involved in innate and adaptive immunity, pathway enrichment analysis identified the marker genes in the infected group shared many key signalling molecules with other cells or against pathogen infection. Furthermore, increased parasitaemia, decreased numbers of RBC and PLT, and increased numbers of WBC were found in the peripheral blood from æTCR KO mice. Finally, lower IFN- and CD69 expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, lower B cell percentage and numbers, and less CD69 expressing B cells were found in the spleen from æTCR KO infected mice, and lower levels of IgG and IgM antibodies in the serum were also observed than WT mice. Conclusions Overall, this study demonstrates the diversity of æT cells in the spleen of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis NSM infected C57BL/6 mice at both the protein and RNA levels, and suggests that the expansion of æT cells in cluster 4, 5 and 7 could promote both cellular and humoral immune responses.","output":"Properties and Roles of æT Cells in Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis NSM Infected C57BL/6 Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on authorship gender in articles submitted to The Journal of Pediatrics STUDY DESIGN: Using gender-labeling algorithms and human inspection, we inferred the gender of corresponding authors of original articles submitted in January-February and April-May of 2019 and 2020 noting those articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic We used Pearson chi-square tests to determine differences in gender proportions during the selected periods in the United States and internationally RESULTS: We analyzed 1,521 original articles Submissions increased 10 9% from Jan-Feb 2019 to Jan-Feb 2020 and 61 6% from Apr-May 2019 to Apr-May 2020 Women accounted for 56 0% of original articles in Apr-May 2019, but only 49 8% of original articles in Apr-May 2020 Original articles focused on COVID-19 represented a small percentage of additional articles submitted in Jan-Feb 2020 (1/33 or 3 0%) and (53/199 or 26 6%) in Apr-May 2020 compared with the number of submissions in the same months in 2019 International male CAs submitted a significantly larger proportion of original articles compared with international female CAs in Apr-May 2020 compared to Apr-May 2019 (p=0 043) There was no difference in CA gender proportion in the United States (US in Apr-May of 2020 versus Apr-May of 2019 (p=0 95) There was no significant difference in final dispositions based on CA gender for original articles from 2019 and 2020 (P = 17) CONCLUSIONS: Original article submissions to The Journal increased in Apr-May 2020, with the greatest increase by international male CAs The majority of the submission growth was not related to COVID-19","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Authorship Gender in The Journal of Pediatrics: Disproportionate Productivity by International Male Researchers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eleven years ago, a 64-year-old Caucasian man had LNH Follicular 3a, IV A stage, FLIPI 2 as a prognostic index of follicular lymphoma.

Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without shelter in place orders. Results Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to < 10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% over the counties with no SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP.

In the half-century since the discovery of the first cytokines, the interferons, over fifty cytokines have been identified. Amongst these is interleukin (IL)-6, the first and prototypical member of the IL-6 family of cytokines, nearly all of which utilize the common signaling receptor, gp130. In the last decade, there have been numerous advances in our understanding of the structural mechanisms of IL-6 family signaling, particularly for IL-6 itself. However, our understanding of the detailed structural mechanisms underlying signaling by most IL-6 family members remains limited. With the emergence of new roles for IL-6 family cytokines in disease and, in particular, roles of IL-11 in cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and cancer, there is an emerging need to develop therapeutics that can progress to clinical use. Here we outline our current knowledge of the structural mechanism of signaling by the IL-6 family of cytokines. We discuss how this knowledge allows us to understand the mechanism of action of currently available inhibitors targeting IL-6 family cytokine signaling, and most importantly how it allows for improved opportunities to pharmacologically disrupt cytokine signaling.

Data on its course in children following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is limited. Methods Data on children following HCT who developed COVID-19 (diagnosed by positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR on respiratory tract samples) during 3.2020-4.2021 were prospectively collected by EBMT and GETH, including demography, HCT data, COVID-related manifestations, ICU admission and mortality. Factors associated with worse outcomes (ICU admission or mortality) were characterized. Results Sixty-two children (34 boys; median age 9; min-max; 0.7-17 years) were reported from 27 centers, 16 countries; 57 (92%) following allogeneic and 5 (8%) following autologous HCT. Underlying diseases were acute leukemia (23; 37%), inherited disorders (9; 15%), hemoglobinopathies (7; 11%), solid tumor (6; 10%), bone marrow failure (5; 8%), other malignant (8; 13%) and non-malignant (4; 6%) diseases. Five (8%) children had high blood pressure; 6 (10%) had underlying lung pathology. The median time from the most recent HCT to COVID was 5 months (min-max; 0-169). The stem cell source was bone marrow (33); peripheral (22) or cord blood (1). Among the patients with information available, 34 (62%) underwent in-vivo T cell depletion, 20 (33%) received corticosteroids, and 36 (60%) other immunosuppressant drugs(s) within two months prior to and after the COVID-19 episode. The presence of acute grade 2-4 or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) was reported in 12/54 (23%) and 8/51 (16%) children, respectively. Clinical presentation (n=57) included fever (28; 49%), cough (18; 32%), diarrhea (8; 14%), upper respiratory tract disease (as rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis, or pharyngitis; 12; 21%); six (10%) required oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%; 20 children (35%) were asymptomatic. The median time from symptoms onset to COVID diagnosis was 1 day (-43-40). Sixty-three percent of patients were hospitalized; 43% due to COVID. The proportion of children with neutropenia or lymphocytopenia (<500 cells/mm 3) was 75% and 73%, respectively. Sixteen children (26%) had evidence of viral (n=10), bacterial (n=6) or fungal (n=2) coinfections. The median time from COVID diagnosis to the last follow-up in alive patients was 69 days (min-max; 2 - 294). Six (10%) children who developed COVID at a median 6.5 (min-max; 2- 16) months following allo-HCT (median age 6 years; 5 boys) required ICU care within a median 6 (min-max; -5-15) days after diagnosis. All of them were neutropenic, received steroids, and other immunosuppressive drugs at COVID diagnosis; 5 had undergone in-vivo T cell depletion; 5 were lymphocytopenic, 5 had GVHD (2 acute and 3 chronic); 3 received non-invasive and 2 invasive ventilation. Three children had viral or bacterial coinfections. Three children died. Six (10%) children (5 boys, median age 10.5 years; min-max; 4-13) who developed COVID at median 2 (min-max; 0-147) months following allo-HCT died within median 35 days (min-max; 5-54) after diagnosis. One had high blood pressure, and none suffered from underlying lung pathology. At the time of COVID, 3 were neutropenic, 2 lymphocytopenic; 4 had GVHD (2 acute, 2 chronic); 3 received steroids and 4 immunosuppressive drugs. Two had viral or bacterial coinfections. Five had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at the time of death. In 3, COVID was the primary cause of death. We compared nine children with the worse outcomes to 53 children with benign course. Among patients alive at 100-day post HCT, the probability of worse outcomes was higher in patients with vs. without chronic GVHD (Figure). No other significant differences were observed in demographic, underlying disease, and HCT-related characteristics. Compared to adults following HCT (Ljungman, Leukemia 2021), children had: - Shorter median time from HCT to COVID diagnosis, 5 vs 18 months; - Higher proportion of asymptomatic infections, 35% vs 9%; - Lower proportion of those who required oxygen, 10% vs 35%; - Lower all-cause mortality, 10% vs 29%. Conclusions Children following HCT with COVID-19 have a higher risk of ICU admission and mortality compared to immune competent children. The presence of chronic GVHD at COVID diagnosis was associated with worse outcomes. COVID course following HCT is milder in children compared to adults.

In this article, we analyse the young adult novel Pandemic (Swedish title: Pandemi, 2018) by Swedish author Maths Claesson. Pandemic is the third novel in a trilogy (2013C2018) with 15-year-old astronaut-trainee Linux as the main protagonist. During his astronaut program on a space station, a pandemic breaks out on Earth. While scientists on Earth struggle to isolate the virus and find a vaccine, Linux and his fellow astronaut-trainees are asked by the WHO to try out a simulation, a computer game aimed at isolating a pandemic outbreak and finding a vaccine. Their simulation is successful and eventually becomes decisive for the solution of the current pandemic crisis on Earth. Departing from Critical Future Studies (Goode and Godhe, Cult Unbound J Curr Cul Res 9(1):108C129, 2017), we focus on the figures of hope (cf. Moylan, Demand the impossible: Science fiction and the utopian imagination, Methuen, pp. 1C2, 1986) for a sustainable future and analyse how the novel is widening the scopes of possible futures. We show how the computer simulation and the successful solution of the crisis serves as a vehicle for a broader discussion about what kind of future we want, a future where the conquest of space offers new opportunities, e.g. for solving the environmental crisis. While normally in Y/A speculative fiction, technology is almost exclusively depicted as ostensibly serving human needs, in Pandemic it is thanks to technology, and the younger generations particular skills, that the disease is conquered. In this sense, the novel is hopeful since it depicts the younger generation as being capable of developing different thinking patterns from those of the adult society.","output":"Youth solving pandemics: hopeful futures in Maths Claessons novel Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has created a havoc with rapidly increasing morbidity and mortality rates globally To tide over the current circumstances, it is imperative that novel vaccines are developed at the earliest Development of a novel vaccine against SARS-Co-V-2 seems to be a daunting task at the moment We will have to wait at least for a year before any such vaccine enters the global market Issues pertaining to vaccine efficacy and safety remain unanswered at the moment We are hopeful that the ongoing research on this mysterious virus will unearth valuable information in the days to come, which will help us develop most suitable treatment options and vaccine platforms respectively","output":"Development of COVID-19 vaccines: A race against time!"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to propose an e-learning system model for learning content personalisation based on students emotions.

Besides, it uses a reinforcement learning approach to analyse the learners emotional states and automatically recommend the best-fitted content that keeps the students in a positive mood.

Multivariable logistic regression analysis and bootstrapping were used to develop the score. Adverse discharge was defined as in-hospital mortality or discharge to a skilled nursing facility. The model was subsequently externally validated in a cohort of patients from an independent hospital. RESULTS 106,164 patients in the development cohort and 92,962 patients in the validation cohort were included, of which 16,624 (15.7%) and 7,717 (8.3%) patients experienced adverse discharge, respectively.

Comparisons were made to the original WT virus and to a WT virus passaged 15 times in culture (WTp15 virus). Cidofovir inhibited WT, WTp15, and CDV-R viruses by 50% at 61, 56 and 790 microM, respectively, in plaque reduction assays, with similar inhibition seen in virus yield studies. Cross-resistance occurred with compounds related to cidofovir, but not with unrelated nucleosides. The resistant virus produced 300-fold fewer infectious particles (PFU) than WT and WTp15 viruses in mouse C1271 cells, yet replicated similarly in Vero (monkey) cells. The CDV-R virus was completely attenuated for virulence at 10(7) PFU per mouse in normal BALB/c mice and in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The WTp15 virus was 100-fold less virulent than WT virus in BALB/c mice. Thus, the lack of virulence of the resistant virus in the animal model is explained partly by its reduced ability to replicate in mouse cells and by attenuation occurring as a result of extensive cell culturing (inferred from what occurred with the WTp15 virus).

In this study, we investigated the prevalence and clinical characteristics of children with virus-related ARTIs and determined the spectrum of respiratory viruses and their correlation with meteorological variables in Jiading District, Shanghai, China. Nasopharyngeal swabs from 2819 children with ARTIs were collected from August 2011 to December 2014, and used for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Seventeen respiratory viruses were detected among 691 (24.5 %) of 2819 patients. The highest prevalence of respiratory viruses was detected in the age group of less than 1 year (29.0 %), and the prevalence decreased with age. This suggests that children less than one year old are the most susceptible to infection. Influenza virus (IFV) was the most frequently detected virus (5.8 %), followed by parainfluenza virus (PIV) (5.7 %), enterovirus (EV) (4.3 %), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3.6 %).

Aim: In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the possible changes in migraine frequency, severity, and days with acute medication intake during quarantine period; (2) evaluate possible differences in migraine outcomes in consideration of lifestyle changes, emotions, pandemic diffusion, and COVID-19 infection. Methods: We interviewed patients who were included in the observational Italian Headache Registry (Registro Italiano Cefalee, RICE), retrospectively collecting information on main headache features, lifestyle factors, emotions, individual infection status, and perception of COVID-19 for 2 months before (pre-quarantine) and after the beginning of the quarantine (quarantine). Inclusion criteria were: age > 18, diagnosis of migraine without aura, migraine with aura and chronic migraine, last in-person visit more than 3 months preceding the beginning of quarantine. Results: A total of 433 migraine subjects agreed to be interviewed. We found an overall reduction in headache frequency (9.42  0.43 days with headache vs. 8.28  0.41) and intensity (6.57  0.19 vs. 6.59  0.21) during the quarantine, compared to pre-quarantine. There was a correlation between improvement and number of days of stay-at-home. When results were stratified for geographic area, we found a tendency toward worsening of headache frequency in northern Italy. Disgust regarding viral infection corresponded to a minor improvement in migraine. Conclusions: Migraine patients showed a mild improvement of migraine features, probably attributable to resilient behavior toward pandemic distress. Disgust regarding the contagion whereas potentially favoring defensive behavior, could potentially worsen migraine. The spontaneous limitation of migraine burden during quarantine could favor patient follow-up via the use of telemedicine visits, reliable diaries, and frequent remote contacts.","output":"Investigating the Effects of COVID-19 Quarantine in Migraine: An Observational Cross-Sectional Study From the Italian National Headache Registry (RICe)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From multiple studies conducted through the FCDO AT2030 Programme, as well as key literature, we examine whether Assistive Technology (AT) provision models could look towards more sustainable approaches, and by doing this benefit not only the environment, but also address the problems that the current provision systems have. We show the intrinsic links between disability inclusion and the climate crisis, and the particular vulnerability people with disabilities face in its wake. In particular, we discuss how localised circular models of production could be beneficial, facilitating context driven solutions and much needed service elements such as repair and maintenance. Key discussion areas include systems approaches, digital fabrication, repair and reuse, and material recovery. Finally, we look at what needs be done in order to enable these approaches to be implemented. In conclusion, we find that there are distinct parallels between what AT provision models require to improve equitable reliable access, and strategies that could reduce environmental impact and bring economic benefit to local communities. This could allow future AT ecosystems to be key demonstrators of circular models, however further exploration of these ideas is required to make sense of the correct next steps.

Therefore, it is imperative to correctly identify COVID-19 positive patients and isolate them as soon as possible to contain the spread of the disease and reduce the ongoing burden on the healthcare system. The primary COVID-19 screening test, RT-PCR although accurate and reliable, has a long turn-around time. In the recent past, several researchers have demonstrated the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods on chest radiography (such as X-ray and CT) for COVID-19 detection. However, existing CNN based DL methods fail to capture the global context due to their inherent image-specific inductive bias. Methods: Motivated by this, in this work, we propose the use of vision transformers (instead of convolutional networks) for COVID-19 screening using the X-ray and CT images. We employ a multi-stage transfer learning technique to address the issue of data scarcity. Furthermore, we show that the features learned by our transformer networks are explainable. Results: We demonstrate that our method not only quantitatively outperforms the recent benchmarks but also focuses on meaningful regions in the images for detection (as confirmed by Radiologists), aiding not only in accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 but also in localization of the infected area. The code for our implementation can be found here - https://github.com/arnabkmondal/xViTCOS.

To confirm this observation this paper proposes to evaluate the impact of COVID-19, and more generally of crises that lead to a sharp drop in traffic, on the pilot/controller system, especially during the critical approach and landing phases. To study the influence of this type of crisis on flight operations at Charles De Gaulle airport, an existing energy atypicality metric is applied on a reference period before COVID-19 and compared to the COVID-19 period. Whereas the traffic at Charles De Gaulle airport has decreased by around 90% on April 2020, the obtained statistics underlined an increase in the atypical flight ratio of around 50%. This trend can be explained in part by the appearance of glide interceptions from above as a result of trajectory shortenings, and an increase in the proportion of high speed approaches.","output":"Flight safety during Covid-19: A study of Charles de Gaulle airport atypical energy approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is threatening human health worldwide but no effective treatment currently exists for this disease. Current therapeutic strategies focus on the inhibition of viral replication or using anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory compounds to improve host immunity, but not both. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds could be promising candidates due to their safety and minimal toxicity. In this study, we have developed a novel in silico bioinformatics workflow that integrates multiple databases to predict the use of honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) and Huangqi (Astragalus membranaceus) as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Using extracts from honeysuckle and Huangqi, these two herbs upregulated a group of microRNAs including let-7a, miR-148b, and miR-146a, which are critical to reduce the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these herbs suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 or TNF-, which were both identified in the cytokine storm of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a major cause of COVID-19 death. Furthermore, both herbs partially inhibited the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-transfected BHK-21 cells with the human lung cancer cell line Calu-3 that was expressing ACE2 receptors. These herbs inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) activity, thereby alleviating viral entry as well as replication. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that honeysuckle and Huangqi have the potential to be used as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry that warrants further in vivo analysis and functional assessment of miRNAs to confirm their clinical importance. This fast-screening platform can also be applied to other drug discovery studies for other infectious diseases.","output":"Honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) and Huangqi (Astragalus membranaceus) Suppress SARS-CoV-2 Entry and COVID-19 Related Cytokine Storm in Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Despite resection being considered the treatment of choice for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), percutaneous thermal ablation can be an alternative treatment for patients unfit for surgery. Our aim was to compare long-term results of percutaneous sonographically-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with high-powered microwave ablation (MWSA) in treatment of ICC. Methods: Results of 71 ICC patients with 98 nodules treated with RFA (36 patients) or MWSA (35 patients) between January 2008 and June 2018 in 5 Interventional Ultrasound centers of Southern Italy were retrospectively reviewed. Cumulative overall survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan-Meyer method and differences with the log-rank test. Eleven possible factors affecting survival were analyzed. Results: Overall survival of the entire series was 88%, 65%, 45% and 34% at 12, 36, 60 and 80 months, respectively. Patients treated with MWSA survived longer than patients treated with RFA (p < 0.005). The MWSA group with ICC nodules 3 cm or nodules up to 4 cm survived longer than the RFA group (p < 0.0005). In patients with nodules >4 cm, no significant difference was found. Disease-free survival and progression-free survival were better in the MWSA group compared to the RFA group (p < 0.005). Diameter of nodules and MWSA were independent factors predicting a better survival. No major complications were observed. Conclusions: MWSA is superior to RFA in treating ICC unfit for surgery, achieving better long-term survival in small (3 cm) ICC nodules as well as nodules up to 4 cm of neoplastic tumors and should replace RFA.","output":"Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma and Thermal Ablation: Long-term Results of An Italian Retrospective Multicenter Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Pharmacy-based point-of-care testing has long had the potential to improve patient access to timely care, but adoption has been slowed by financial and regulatory barriers.

It is not known whether these events have impacted the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and disorders of brain-gut interaction (DGBI). METHODS An online platform evaluated the prevalence of GI symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection utilized validated questionnaires and was fully anonymized. Findings were compared with identical data acquired in 2019. The association of results with stress and anxiety was analyzed. RESULTS Data were collected from 1896 subjects May - August 2019 to 980 non-identical subjects May - June 2020. GI symptoms were reported by 68.9% during the COVID-19 lockdown compared with 56.0% the previous year (p < 0.001). The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (26.3% vs. 20.0%; p < 0.001), functional dyspepsia (18.3% vs. 12.7%; p < 0.001), heartburn (31.7% vs. 26.2%, p = 0.002), and self-reported milk intolerance (43.5% vs. 37.8% p = 0.004) was higher during the pandemic.

The simple methods have the advantage that relations between basic quantities become more transparent, thus shedding light to which quantities have biggest impact on predictions, with the additional conclusion that uncertainties in these quantities carry over to high uncertainty also in predictions. A simple non-parametric prediction method for future cumulative case fatalities, as well as future cumulative incidence of infections (assuming a given infection fatality risk f), is presented. The method uses cumulative reported case fatalities up to present time as input data. It is also described how the introduction of preventive measures of a given magnitude  will affect the two incidence predictions, using basic theory of epidemic models. This methodology is then reversed, thus enabling estimation of the preventive magnitude , and of the resulting effective reproduction number RE. However, the effects of preventive measures only start affecting case fatalities some 3-4 weeks later, so estimates are only available after this time has elapsed. The methodology is applicable in the early stage of an outbreak, before, say, 10% of the community have been infected. Beside giving simple estimation and prediction tools for an ongoing epidemic, another important conclusion lies in the observation that the two quantities f (infection fatality risk) and  (the magnitude of preventive measures) have very big impact on predictions. Further, both of these quantities currently have very high uncertainty: current estimates of f lie in the range 0.2% up to 2% ([9], [7]), and the overall effect of several combined preventive measures is clearly very uncertain. The two main findings from the paper are hence that, a) any prediction containing f, and/or some preventive measures, contain a large amount of uncertainty (which is usually not acknowledged well enough), and b) obtaining more accurate estimates of in particular f, should be highly prioritized. Seroprevalence testing of random samples in a community where the epidemic has ended are urgently needed.","output":"Basic prediction methodology for covid-19: estimation and sensitivity considerations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Like other infectious diseases, it is expected that COVID-19 will mostly end with the development of neutralizing antibody immunity This study aimed to evaluate the value of COVID-19 antibody rapid test assessment in emergency medical services (EMS) personnel Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Tehran, Iran from 20th March until 20th May 2020 The results of chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and antibody rapid test were compared in EMS personnel with confirmed COVID-19, as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic ones who had exposure to a probable/confirmed COVID-19 teammate In symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals who were only IgM-positive, chest CT scan or RT-PCR was recommended Results: A total of 243 EMS personnel with the mean age of 36 14+/-8 70 (range 21 to 59) years took part in this study (87 7% were males) Most of the participants (73 3%) had history of exposure One hundred sixty-three EMS personnel were tested using either RT-PCR test or chest CT-scan or both, and 78 (47 9%) of them had at least one positive result Among the participants who had undergone chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test (n=163), 78 had positive chest CT-scan and/or RT-PCR test;of these, 18 individuals had negative results for IgM and IgG The rate of positive IgM and IgG in participants with positive chest CT-scan was 1 6 or 1 3 times more than those with negative chest CT-scan, respectively (p &lt; 0 05) The percentage of positive results for both IgM and IgG in participants having positive RT-PCR test was 1 7 times more than those having negative RT-PCR test (p &lt; 0 05) Conclusion: Rapid antibody test could help in diagnosis of COVID-19 in asymptomatic or symptomatic EMS personnel who did not undergo RT-PCR test or the test was reported as negative However, its sensitivity could be enhanced through use along with other diagnostic methods","output":"Antibody Rapid Test Results in Emergency Medical Services Personnel during COVID-19 Pandemic;a Cross Sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with the natural product inhibitor shikonin illuminates a unique binding mode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Child Sexual Abuse Media (CSAM) is any visual record of a sexually-explicit activity involving minors.

After maximum brightness, the light curves show a monotonic decline or a plateau, resembling those of faint supernovae IIL or IIP, respectively.

If the late-time power source is indeed radioactive decay, these transients produce $^{56}$Ni masses on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$~\\\\msun. The spectral energy distribution of our ILRT sample, extending from the optical to the mid-infrared (MIR) domain, reveals a clear IR excess soon after explosion and non-negligible MIR emission at very late phases.

Although only limited data exist on their health and use of health care services as they transition to adolescence, emerging data suggest that a minority of these persons receive recommended guidance* from their primary care providers (PCPs) starting at age 12 years to ensure a planned transition from pediatric to adult health care (4,5). To address this gap in data, researchers analyzed preliminary data from a follow-up survey of parents and guardians of adolescents aged 12-16 years who previously participated in the Study to Explore Early Development (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbtism/seed.html). The adolescents were originally studied at ages 2-5 years and identified at that age as having autism (autism group) or as general population controls (control group). Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) that accounted for differences in demographic characteristics were used to compare outcomes between groups. Adolescents in the autism group were more likely than were those in the control group to have physical difficulties (21.2% versus 1.6%; aPR = 11.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2-31.9), and to have additional mental health or other conditions? (one or more condition: 63.0% versus 28.9%; aPR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.5-2.5). Adolescents in the autism group were more likely to receive mental health services (41.8% versus 22.1%; aPR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3-2.6) but were also more likely to have an unmet medical or mental health service need (11.0% versus 3.2%; aPR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.1-8.8). In both groups, a small percentage of adolescents (autism, 7.5%; control, 14.1%) received recommended health care transition (transition) guidance. These findings are consistent with previous research (4,5) indicating that few adolescents receive the recommended transition guidance and suggest that adolescents identified with autism in early childhood are more likely than adolescents in the general population to have unmet health care service needs. Improved provider training on the heath care needs of adolescents with autism and coordination of comprehensive programs? to meet their needs can improve delivery of services and adherence to recommended guidance for transitioning from pediatric to adult health care.","output":"Health Status and Health Care Use Among Adolescents Identified With and Without Autism in Early Childhood  Four U.S. Sites, 2018C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encoded by viral genome or host have been found participating in host-microbe interactions.

Maternal serum collected at 18 and 34 weeks' gestation was pooled, and analyzed for concentrations of 32 metabolites of 15 phthalate diesters. Their serum concentrations were categorized into undetectable/detectable levels or tertiles. Linear mixed models were used to determine associations between maternal serum phthalate levels and longitudinal height and body mass index (BMI) z-scores in boys from birth to 20 years of age (n=250 and n=295 respectively). Linear regression was used to determine associations between maternal phthalate levels and deviation from mid-parental height (n=177) and DEXA scan outcomes (n=191) at the 20 year follow-up. Weak positive associations of participants height z-score increase were detected with exposure to some phthalate metabolites in particular to the lower molecular weight phthalate metabolites.

To exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10) noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections reduced and postponed in time by the same factor m (5 or 10). More generally, our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g., large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools, (seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone.","output":"Suppression of Groups Intermingling as Appealing Option For Flattening and Delaying the Epidemiologic Curve While Allowing Economic and Social Life at Bearable Level During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has drastically changed our everyday life and the life of scientists from all over the world.

Therefore, it is increasingly important for nursing students to have high levels of cultural competence in order to meet diverse client needs. A training program is essential to enhance students cultural competence. This study aimed to design, implement, and evaluate a cultural care-training program to improve cultural competence of undergraduate nursing students. METHODS: This exploratory mixed methods study used six steps proposed in the Talbot and Verrinder model to design a training program. In the first step, a conventional qualitative study was conducted and 18 participants were interviewed using purposive sampling. In the second and third steps, literature review and the classic Delphi technique were used for initiation and finalization of the program. The fourth, fifth, and sixth steps were completed by implementing, monitoring, and evaluating the cultural care program (five two-hour sessions) among 73 nursing students using a quasi-experimental design. Finally, effectiveness of program was evaluated through the cultural care inventory before and 1 month after the program. Data were analyzed via SPSS25, independent samples t- test, paired t- test, chi-square test, analysis of covariance, and multivariate linear regression tests. RESULTS: A systematic model was used to identify key elements of a cultural care program, including main topics, educational objectives and contents, assignments and activities for students, teaching and evaluation methods. The curricular objectives and educational contents were implemented in five sessions to produce measurable results. The quantitative step showed that nursing students cultural competence in the intervention group (184.37  22.43) improved significantly compared with the control group (153.19  20.14) (t = 6.24, p = 0.001) after intervention. CONCLUSION: A cultural care training program can be designed by the model applied in this study in order to improve cultural competence of nursing students. This training program will be effective if students learning needs, appropriate assignments, and acceptable teaching methods are addressed. Therefore, nurse educators can design comprehensive training programs to improve nursing students cultural competence in different cultures and contexts. This training program is highly efficient because it is applicable in many disciplines of nursing education.","output":"Using a model to design, implement, and evaluate a training program for improving cultural competence among undergraduate nursing students: a mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a widely used instrument in financial risk management.

However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an \\"uncertainty-normalizing\\" communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.","output":"Communicating Scientific Uncertainty About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Online Experimental Study of an Uncertainty-Normalizing Strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To characterize how community mobility patterns across the United States correlate with local changes in retina visits during the pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient retina clinic visits were linked to population mobility by combining multiple public data sets, including the Google Community Mobility Reports and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Infection. Percentage change from baseline in daily-average number of retina visits by county and mobility were measured by county. RESULTS: A total of 2,159,689 patient visits were examined across 332 counties. Daily-average retina visits decreased by 7.0%, 19.0%, 5.0%, and 4.0% from Quarter 1 to 4 of 2020. This decrease was negatively correlated with increased incident of COVID-19 deaths for Quarters 1 to 3 (r = -0.13, r = -0.16, and r = -0.15, respectively, P < 0.001) and increased incident cases for Quarters 1 and 2 (r = -0.18, r = -0.13, respectively, P < 0.001). Daily-average retina visits relative to baseline were significantly lower for metropolitan counties in Quarters 1 and 2, compared with urban and rural (P < 0.001). The decline in retina visits had greatest association with decline in workplace visits in Quarters 1 to 3 (r = 0.27, r = 0.09, r = 0.12, respectively, P < 0.001 for all).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 524 patients with OSCC treated between 2000 and 2016 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital Muenster, Germany, were examined for the detection of HPV type 16-specific DNA (HPV16-DNA), nicotine and alcohol consumption and the influence of therapy on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the annual prevalence of HPV16-DNA-positive OSCC from 40% (n = 12/30) in 2000 to 46% (n = 18/39) in 2016 (p = 0.025,  = 0.539). Of the HPV16-DNA-positive OSCC, 89% (n = 212) were downgraded on the basis of UICC 8 compared to UICC 7. In the overall collective, frequent alcohol and nicotine ( 10 pack years) consumption showed a significant negative influence on OS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.009, respectively). Frequent alcohol consumption was also prognostically relevant in the HPV16-DNA-negative group (p = 0.049). In the HPV16-DNA-positive group, the prognosis for OS according to UICC 8 showed no statistically significant difference between stages I and II (p = 0,481), or between III and IV (p = 0.439). CONCLUSIONS: The current UICC 8 improves the prognostic stratification of OSCC due to the separation of HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors in comparison to UICC 7. However, the prognostic significance of UICC 8 for HPV-associated OSCC is still insufficient. In the future, alcohol and nicotine consumption could influence the UICC classification in order to further improve prognostic significance.","output":"Prognosefaktoren fr das Gesamtberleben bei Oropharynxkarzinomen in Abh?ngigkeit vom HPV-Status"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 vaccines were efficacious and safe in clinical trials.

Many of these disparities were known prior to the onset of pandemic, including unequal access to geriatric psychiatry educators and clinical experts across the country, as well as limited opportunities for clinical experiences in geriatric psychiatry for medical students and residents. Indeed, the Institute of Medicine Report of 2012, In Whose Hands: The Mental Health and Substance Use Workforce for Older Adults, had identified the current and projected gaps in geriatric mental health training to meet the needs of an aging population. Since 2020, additional gaps and disparities have been recognized that adversely affect the ability to adequately develop and train the next generation of geriatric psychiatrists, as well as geriatrics-informed general psychiatrists and primary care physicians. The year 2020 also brought to the fore, issues of racism and ageism, both of which may not have been adequately addressed before in geropsychiatry education. Yet, racism and ageism are both now more clearly understood as key factors affecting the lives of elders and adding to disparities in geriatric mental health care. At the same time, the challenges of the pandemic led to new innovations in both the delivery of geropsychiatry education and the content of the education strategies that will help to mitigate disparities for patients and trainees. This symposium will address 3 key areas related to disparities in geropsychiatric education and will share important insights that should inform future approaches to geropsychiatry education. Dr. Susan W. Lehmann will present on: In Whose Hands?: Where are we today? In her talk, Dr. Lehmann will discuss the 2012 Institute of Medicine Report that described the deficiencies and disparities in geriatric mental health education identified in 2012, and she will provide an update 10 years later about what has changed since the report, and what remains to be done. She will specifically talk about geographic disparities in opportunities for training and the impact of these disparities on the mental health care of older adults. Dr. Lehmann will discuss the need for professional organizations to focus on national approaches to advocacy and change. Dr. Kirsten Wilkins will present on: Challenges and Opportunities: Preparing the Next Generation of Geropsychiatry Trainees. In her talk, Dr. Wilkins will discuss disparities in health care that were exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic and which negatively impact geropsychiatry education. She will address the clinical care training challenges presented by unequal access to telemedicine for elders, as well as the challenges of incorporating virtual care into the geropsychiatry curriculum for trainees. Dr. Wilkins will also address the national reckoning on race and racism that emerged during 2020 and its impact on older adults and the learning environment for geropsychiatry trainees. She will discuss the implications for geropsychiatry educators in preparing trainees to be leaders in eliminating the deleterious effects of racism and ageism for older adults. Dr. Michelle Conroy will present on: Innovations and opportunities within geriatric psychiatry education: lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. She will discuss innovations in geropsychiatry education that were developed during the Covid-19 pandemic in response to identified disparities, and lessons learned for educators that should continue into the future. In particular, she will describe a number of successful new outreach programs, didactics, and educational products developed by geropsychiatry educators in AAGP.","output":"Addressing Disparities in Geropsychiatry Education: Lessons Learned from 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endoscopy adverse events (AEs), or complications, are a rising concern on the quality of endoscopic care, given the technical advances and the crescent complexity of therapeutic procedures, over the entire gastrointestinal and bilio-pancreatic tract.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is emerging as a promising strategy to alleviate the neuropathic pain conditions induced by peripheral nerve injury. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of MSCs transplantation in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in controlled animal studies, and thus to yield evidence-based decision making. Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMED, Cochrane Central Library, Embase and CINAHL were searched for preclinical controlled animal studies from the inception to April 16th, 2020. Seventeen studies are included in this review. Substantial heterogeneity is observed regarding the animal's species, models of neuropathic pain, regimen of MSCs transplantation and outcome of measures across the included studies. Both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia could be significantly attenuated by transplanted MSCs. The MSCs-elicited analgesic effect is independent on type of MSCs, time of administration, and route of delivery, and is efficiently enhanced by genetic transfection with fibroblast growth factor, proenkephalin and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The migration of MSCs after intrathecal or intravenous injection has been shown to be directed towards the surface of dorsal spinal cord or dorsal root ganglions on the ipsilateral side of injury. No adverse effects have been reported. The accumulating evidence demonstrates the therapeutic effect of MSCs-based cell therapy on prevention and alleviation of the neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat or mouse models. The robust preclinical studies are deserved to optimize the regimen of MSCs transplantation, and to promote the translation of this potentially MSCs-based therapeutic approach into clinical studies.","output":"Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation for Neuropathic Pain Induced by Peripheral Nerve Injury in Animal Models: a Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is thought to provide protection against non-TB infectious diseases.

Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively.

Therefore, the manual classification of lung diseases is very hard to discover, particularly the distinction between COVID-19 and NON-COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 causes infections on one or both lungs which appear as inflammations across lung cells. This can lead to dangerous complications that might cause death in the case of gaining or having an immune disease. The problem of COVID-19 is that its symptoms are similar to conventional chest respiratory diseases like flu disease and chest pain while breathing or coughing produces mucus, high fever, absence of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. In most cases, a deep manual analysis of the chests X-ray or computed tomography (CT) image can lead to an authentic diagnosis of COVID-19. Otherwise, manual analysis is not sufficient to distinguish between pneumonia and COVID-19 disease. Thus, specialists need additional expensive tools to confirm their initial hypothesis or diagnosis using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test or MRI imaging. However, a traditional diagnosis of COVID-19 or other pneumonia takes a lot of time from specialists, which is so significant parameter in the case of a pandemic, whereas, a lot of patients are surcharging hospital services. In such a case, an automatic method for analyzing x-ray chest images is needed. In this regard, the research work has taken advantage of proposing a convolutional neural network method for COVID-19 and pneumonia classification. The X-ray processing have been chosen as a diagnosis way because of its availability in hospitals as a cheap imaging tool compared to other technologies. In this work, three CNN models based on VGG-16, VGG19, and MobileNet were trained using the zero-shot transfer learning technique.

Here, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a system to identify novel functional interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells. Our work demonstrates that when the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ORF4a accessory gene is expressed in yeast it causes a slow-growth phenotype. ORF4a has been characterized as an interferon antagonist in mammalian cells, and yet yeast lack an interferon system, suggesting further interactions between ORF4a and eukaryotic cells. Using the slow-growth phenotype as a reporter of ORF4a function, we utilized the yeast knockout library collection to perform a suppressor screen where we identified the YDL042C/SIR2 yeast gene as a suppressor of ORF4a function. The mammalian homologue of SIR2 is SIRT1, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase. We found that when SIRT1 was inhibited by either chemical or genetic manipulation, there was reduced MERS-CoV replication, suggesting that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV. Moreover, ORF4a inhibited SIRT1-mediated modulation of NF-B signaling, demonstrating a functional link between ORF4a and SIRT1 in mammalian cells. Overall, the data presented here demonstrate the utility of yeast studies for identifying genetic interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells. We also demonstrate for the first time that SIRT1 is a proviral factor for MERS-CoV replication and that ORF4a has a role in modulating its activity in cells. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) initially emerged in 2012 and has since been responsible for over 2,300 infections, with a case fatality ratio of approximately 35%. We have used the highly characterized model system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate novel functional interactions between viral proteins and eukaryotic cells that may provide new avenues for antiviral intervention. We identify a functional link between the MERS-CoV ORF4a proteins and the YDL042C/SIR2 yeast gene. The mammalian homologue of SIR2 is SIRT1, an NAD-dependent histone deacetylase.

However, good recognizers would be distinguished, not only by the number of faces they discriminate but also by the number of rejected stimuli as unfamiliar. When it comes to face recognition, it is important to remember that position, to some extent, would not entail a high cognitive cost, unlike other processes in similar areas of the brain. The aim of this paper was to examine participants recognition profiles according to face position. For this reason, a recognition task was carried out by employing the Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces. Reaction times and accuracy were employed as dependent variables and a cluster analysis was carried out. A total of two profiles were identified in participants performance, which differ in position in terms of reaction times but not accuracy. The results can be described as follows: first, it is possible to identify performance profiles in visual recognition of faces that differ in position in terms of reaction times, not accuracy; secondly, results suggest a bias towards the left.

Unenhanced and/or enhanced MDCT was performed with intravenous and/or per-rectal contrast medium and read by a radiologist blinded to the patients' clinical details to determine the sensitivity and specificity of specific findings at MDCT for identifying leaks. RESULTS Seventeen percent (30/170) of the anterior resections were suspected to have an anastomotic leak. Ninety-three percent (28/30) of patients underwent MDCT. Seven point six percent (11+2/170) had a confirmed leak. Two patients underwent surgery without MDCT. A leak was confirmed by MDCT in 91% (10/11) of patients. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MDCT in diagnosing a leak was 0.91, 1, 1, and 0.95, respectively. The sensitivity of peri-anastomotic air, peri-anastomotic collection, extravasation of rectal contrast medium, and staple line integrity was 0.81, 0.63, 0.54, and 0.72, respectively. Use of rectal contrast medium (8/11 cases) increased the subjective ease of diagnosis and was the only sign in one patient.

In addition, in the perovskite solar cell device there occurs the monomolecular recombination effect; the DIO additive introduced into the perovskite can effectively reduce the trap-induced monomolecular recombination effect, and enhance the solar cell's PCE.","output":"Study of the effect of DIO additive on charge extraction and recombination in organic-inorganic hybrid MAPbI3-x Cl x perovskite solar cell"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: India has seen a surge in COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM) cases during the second wave of the pandemic. We conducted a study to determine independent risk factors for CAM. Methods: We performed a retrospective case control study in a tertiary care private hospital in Pune, India. Fifty-two cases of CAM were compared with 166 concurrent controls randomly selected from the COVID-19 admissions during the same time period. Association of demographic factors, comorbidities, cumulative steroid dose used (calculated as dexamethasone equivalent), maximum respiratory support required, use of injectable/oral anticoagulation, and use of aspirin with CAM was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: A total of 218 subjects (52 cases; 166 controls) were studied. Any diabetes (pre-existing diabetes and new onset diabetes during COVID-19) was noted in a significantly higher proportion of cases (73.1%, 45.8% P<0.001) and cumulative dexamethasone dose used in cases was significantly greater (97.72 mg vs 60 mg; P=0.016). In a multivariate regression analysis cumulate dexamethasone dose >120 mg (OR 9.03, confidence interval 1.75-46.59, P=0.009) and any diabetes (OR 4.78, confidence interval 1.46-15.65, P=0.01) were found to be risk factors for CAM. While use of anticoagulation (OR 0.01, confidence interval 0.00-0.09, P<0.001) and use of aspirin (OR 0.02, confidence interval 0.01-0.07, P<0.001) were found to be protective against CAM. Conclusion: Diabetes mellitus and cumulative dose of dexamethasone greater than 120 mg (or equivalent dose of other corticosteroid) were associated with an increased risk of CAM while use of aspirin and anticoagulation were associated with a lower risk.","output":"COVID-19 ASSOCIATED MUCORMYCOSIS: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evaluation of online teaching quality has become an important issue because many universities are turning to online classes due to the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic In this paper, online teaching quality evaluation is considered as a linguistic multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem Generally, the evaluation sematic information can be symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed in linguistic term sets Thus, an extended linguistic MAGDM framework is proposed for evaluating online teaching quality As the main contribution, the proposed method takes into account the risk preferences of assessment experts (AEs) and unknown weight information of attributes and sub-attributes To be specific, the Delphi method is employed to establish a multi-level evaluation indicator system (EIS) of online teaching quality Then, by introducing the group generalized linguistic term set (GLTS) with two risk preference parameters, a two-stage optimization model is developed to calculate the weights of attributes and sub-attributes objectively Subsequently, the linguistic MAGDM framework was divided into two stages The first stage maximizes the group comprehensive rating values of teachers on different attributes to obtain partial ranking results for teachers on each attribute The latter stage maximizes the group comprehensive rating values of teachers to evaluate the overall quality Finally, a case study is provided to illustrate how to apply the framework to evaluate online teaching quality","output":"Evaluation of Online Teaching Quality: An Extended Linguistic MAGDM Framework Based on Risk Preferences and Unknown Weight Information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in high mortality worldwide. However, information regarding cardiac markers for precise risk-stratification is limited. We aimed to discover a sensitive and reliable early-warning biomarker for optimizing management and improving COVID-19 patients prognosis. Methods: : This single-center case series was conducted between February 4 and April 10, 2020. In total, 2,954 consecutive COVID-19 patients who were receiving treatment at Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital in China were included in the retrospectively selected cohort. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and treated at the study site. Data of serum levels of cardiac markers, coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis, and survival were collected after admission. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was performed to analyze severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor expression. Results: : Median patient age was 60 years (range, 50-68 years);1,461 (49.5%) were female, and 1,515 (51.3%) patients were in a severe/critical condition. Compared to mild/moderate patients (1,439, 48.7%), severe/critical patients showed significantly higher levels of cardiac markers within the first week after admission. Among severe/critical COVID-19 patients, those with abnormal serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide had a significantly higher mortality rate than patients with normal levels. Severe/critical COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CAD (165/1,155 [10.9%]) had more cases of abnormal brain natriuretic peptide levels than those without CAD. Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression was observed in patients with CAD. Regression analysis revealed that patients with elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels were at a higher risk of death (hazards ratio, 1.001 [95% confidence interval, 1.0003-1.002]). Conclusions: : Brain natriuretic peptide is an effective biomarker for early risk assessment in COVID-19 patients with or without pre-existing CAD.

Methods: A total of 215 patients who were diagnosed with COVID?19 by RT?PCR in Wuchang District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province were recruited as the research subjects. The rapid colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was performed on every newly diagnosed patient at the time points of (103) d, (1003) d, (1903) d, and (2803) d after the onset of the disease. Results: In terms of antibody types, among the 215 patients,the positive rate of IgM antibodies was 36.7% at (103) d. The antibody levels were 22.5%, 5.0%, and 4.7% at (1003) d, (1903) d, and (2803) d respectively. In general, the levels of IgG antibody were high. The positive rate of antibody within (103) days was 87.0%, and the rate decreased to 80.8% at (1003) d, 49.7% and 46.5% at (1903) d and (2803) d, respectively. The number of IgM and IgG antibodies homo?positive samples gradually decreased over time. At the meantime, the proportion of IgM+IgG antibodies both negative samples gradually increases. According to the clinical classification, in the early stage of the disease, the positive rate of IgM antibody was different in patients with different severity of clinical symptoms. The more severe the clinical symptoms, the higher the positive rate of IgM antibodies. Around 190 days after the onset of symptoms, the positive rate of IgG antibodies decreased more slowly in mild and common patients. At the 280?day during follow?up, IgM antibodies showed a higher positive rate in severe and critical patients. From the trend of antibody changes in the same patient within 10 months, among the 70 patients, only 55 cases (32.4%) showed continuous positive in IgG antibody, with 77 cases (45.3%) in the IgG antibody positive?to?negative group,and 21 cases (12.4%) in the IgG antibody positive?to?negative?to?positive group. Three cases (1.8%) showed IgG antibody negative converting to positive. However, there were 14 cases (8.2%) remaining with negative IgG antibody. For IgM antibodies, 97 cases (57.1%) were persistently negative, wth 5 cases (2.9%) in the negative?to?positive group, and 65 cases (38.2%) in the positive?to?negative group. IgM antibody continued to be positive within 10 months has not been observed yet, and there were 3 cases (1.8%) in the IgM antibody positive?to?negative?to?positive group. Conclusion: After the new coronavirus infection, the serological response is unstable. In the early stage of the disease, antibody detection has important auxiliary value for the diagnosis of the disease;but in the late stage, the diagnostic value is not great. The antibody response may be positively correlated with the severity of the disease. Nearly 50% of patients can remain positive for IgG antibodies within 10 months, which indicates that nearly half of patients recovering from COVID?19 can obtain longer?lasting immunity. However, IgG antibodies in some patients continue or eventually become negative.

Larger aneurysms are believed to be more likely to rupture and should therefore be treated. Recently, flow diverters (FDs) are widely used to treat large or wide neck aneurysms. However, it can be difficult to treat them by deployment of a single FD because of its insufficient flow disturbance. To overcome this problem, double stenting technique is sometimes applied with the aim to improve the effect of blood velocity reduction. In this study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the hemodynamic changes in an aneurysm when deploying virtual FDs. The results showed that the characteristics of the blood flow field inside the aneurysm did not changed much after the deployment of a single FD but underwent a large change after the deployment of two FDs. Furthermore, the velocity reduction in the aneurysm sac at a plane away from the parent artery increased from 25.9% to 92.8% when two FDs were deployed instead of one compared to no stenting.

Across these HPE domains, the major disruptions included the exclusion of undergraduate learners from clinical learning environments, restricted intra-, inter-institutional and overseas movement of medical professionals, termination of face-to-face learner-educator interactions, deployment of postgraduate learners into non-scope service settings, and CME postponement. Methods: In this review we report on how in Singapore various adaptive measures were instituted across the 3 HPE domains at institutional and national level to maintain adequate resources at the frontline to meet service exigencies, promote healthcare professionals' wellbeing and safety as well as mitigate the spread of the pandemic. Results: We identified several strategies and contingencies developed to address these challenges. These involved the use of online learning platforms, distributed and asynchronous learning, an undergraduate Pathway Programme, and use of innovative hands-on technology like simulation. Robust, well pre-planned pandemic preparedness, effective communication, as well as provision of psychological support resources ensured maintenance of service and academic continuity, trust and resilience within HPE. However, several challenges remain, namely the timing and manner of conducting formative and summative assessments, cybersecurity, and the indispensable hands-on, in-person experiential learning for surgical training. Conclusion: Strong leadership with vision and planning, good communication, prioritising learners' and educators' wellbeing and safety, and harnessing existing and emerging online learning technologies are crucial elements for effective contingencies for HPE disruption during pandemics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study had institutional review board approval, with waiver of informed patient consent. A preprocessing technique that automatically segments pixels outside the body region and replaces their values with a constant value to maximize data redundancy was developed. One hundred CT studies (50 standard-radiation dose and 50 low-radiation dose studies) were preprocessed by using the technique and then reversibly compressed by using the JPEG2000 2D and 3D compression methods. The CRs (defined as the original data size divided by the compressed data size) with and those without use of the preprocessing technique were compared by using paired t tests. The percentage increase in the CR was measured. RESULTS The CR increased significantly (without vs with preprocessing) in JPEG2000 2D (mean CR, 2.40 vs 3.80) and 3D (mean CR, 2.61 vs 3.99) compressions for the standard-dose studies and in JPEG2000 2D (mean CR, 2.38 vs 3.36) and 3D (mean CR, 2.54 vs 3.55) compressions for the low-dose studies (P < .001 for all).

The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the admission rate for AMI to our academic hospital, to monitor the trend during the reopening phase and to evaluate if whether changes in air pollution may have influenced hospitalization rates for AMI in Sardinia and Northern Italy. Methods and results We compared the admission rate for AMI in our department and, by analysing the density of nitrogen dioxide (1/cm2), the state of air pollution in Sardinia and Northern Italy in different periods: the national lockdown (9 MarchC3 May 2020), the 8 weeks before the start of the lockdown, the 8 weeks after the end of the lockdown and the corresponding time period in 2019 (from 9 March to 3 May 2019). A marked decline in AMI admissions was observed during the lockdown period in comparison with the 8 weeks before the start of the lockdown (?47%, 95% CI: 37.5C56.7, P < 0.0001) and the corresponding period in 2019 (?52.8%, 95% CI: 43C65, P < 0.0001). There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations for NSTEMI during the lockdown period in comparison with the 8 weeks before the start of lockdown (?71.8%, 95% CI: 62.3C79.6, P < 0.0001) and the corresponding time period in 2019 (?70.5%, 95% CI: 60.9C78.5, P < 0.0001). Similar trends were seen in the group of STEMI patients, but the fall in admissions was less than that of NSTEMI patients. During the lockdown period, the hospitalizations for STEMI fell by 31.5% (95% CI: 23.2C41.4, P = 0.19) and 49% (95% CI: 39.4C58.6, 47 vs. 24 admissions, P = 0.009) in comparison to the 8 weeks before the start of lockdown and the corresponding period in 2019, respectively. We observed a rise in AMI admissions during the 8 weeks after the lockdown (+47%, 95% CI: 37.5C56.7, P < 0.0001), for both NSTEMI (+71.2%, 95% CI: 61.7C79.1, P < 0.0001) and STEMI (+33.4%, 95% CI: 24.9C43.1, P = 0.15). In Sardinia the relative change in nitrogen dioxide density during the time of lockdown was negligible with little or no impact on the environment (?19%, 95% CI: 12.5C27.7, P = 0.65), if we consider it occurred within a range of very low values of nitrogen dioxide (11.5  3 e 14.1  5 mol/m2). In contrast, in Northern Italy during the lockdown there was a marked decrease in NO2 concentration in comparison with the 8 weeks before the start of lockdown (?53%, 95% CI: 43C62.4, 25.1  16.2 e 54.2  43.5 mol/m2, P < 0.0001). Conclusions Since air pollution did not change substantially in our region, the environment factor cannot explain the decline in the number of admissions for AMI we recorded during the lockdown. Fear of contagion is the most plausible reason for the drop of hospitalizations for AMI during the lockdown period.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction: the experience of the Clinical Cardiology Unit, University Hospital of Cagliari"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Src homology-2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) encoded by the proto-oncogene PTPN11 is the first identified non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase.

In this article, we report the structure-guided design based on the well-characterized SHP2 inhibitor SHP099, extensive structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) of aminopyrazines, biochemical characterization and cellular potency. These medicinal chemistry efforts lead to the discovery of the lead compound TK-453, which potently inhibits SHP2 (SHP2WT IC50 = 0.023 M, Tm = 7.01 C) in a reversible and noncompetitive manner. TK-453 exhibits high selectivity over SHP2PTP, SHP1 and PTP1B, and may bind at the \\"tunnel\\" allosteric site of SHP2 as SHP099.

Cross-species transmissions are possible due to the possession of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in animals. ACE2 recognition by SARS-CoV-2 is a critical determinant of the host range, interspecies transmission, and viral pathogenesis.

However, it remains unclear how MDSCs can be distinguished from their normal myeloid counterparts in the hematopoietic stem cell donor graft and during immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT in the recipient. Our ability to understand their exact role in allo-HSCT is limited by the absence of a specific gene signature or surface markers for identifying MDSCs among myeloid cells and by their plasticity in different microenvironments. According to various studies, MDSCs might induce transplant tolerance and control graft vs. host disease (GVHD), but their impact on the graft vs. tumor effect (GVT) is not fully understood. In fact, we know that MDSCs commonly expand in patients with cancer, and they are thought to promote hematological malignancy progression. However, little is known about whether depleting them might be an effective strategy for enhancing GVT effects. Here, we review data published over the past 40 years on allo-HSCT to delineate the different MDSC subsets, and their abilities to induce transplant tolerance and preserve the GVT effect. This review will provide a basis for determining whether one MDSC subset might be proposed as the most appropriate candidate for cellular therapies, due to its ability to modulate GVHD.","output":"Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in the Context of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, food insecurity has doubled overall and tripled among households with children in the United States Food insecurity and COVID-19 may exacerbate one another through bidirectional links, leading to a syndemic, or sequential disease clusters, which exacerbate one another Experiencing food insecurity may be associated with macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, which can weaken host defenses, thus increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 Food insecurity is associated with chronic medical conditions, which may afford a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness People experiencing food insecurity may have increased exposure to COVID-19 while procuring food People with COVID-19 may be unable to work, generate income, and procure food while quarantined, which may exacerbate food insecurity Clinicians should screen for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide referrals to food-assistance programs when appropriate Policymakers should expand benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to address increases in the depth and breadth of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Perspective: The Convergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Food Insecurity in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human beings are currently experiencing a serious public health event. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has infected about 3 million people worldwide and killed more than 200,000, most being the elderly or people with potential chronic diseases or in immunosuppressive states. According to big data analysis, there are many proteins homologous to or interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which, therefore, may not be the only receptor for the novel coronavirus; other receptors may also exist in host cells of different species. These potential receptors may also play an important role in the infection process of the novel coronavirus. The current study aimed to discover such key proteins or receptors and analyze the susceptibility of different animals to the novel coronavirus, in order to reveal the transmission process of the virus in cross-species infection. We analyzed the proteins coded by the ACE2 gene in different mammalian species and predicted their correlation and homology with the human ACE2 receptor. The major finding of our predictive analysis suggested ACE2 gene-encoded proteins to be highly homologous across mammals. Based on their high homology, their possibility of binding the spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is quite high and species such as Felis catus, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus etc. may be potential susceptible hosts; special monitoring is particularly required for livestock that are in close contact with humans.

Under this scenario, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in domestic animals to assess the risk of transmission between species have been suggested by the OIE. Here we present a case report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in free roaming dogs, found at a rural indigenous community from the Ecuadorian Amazonia. Oral and nasal swabs samples were collected from three dogs found during a COVID-19 surveillance intervention in Amazonian indigenous communities where severe COVID-19 outbreaks were suspected. Total RNA was extracted from dog samples and detection of SARS-CoV-2 gene targets N, ORF1ab and S was performed. The three dogs tested positive for at least two SARS-CoV-2 viral targets. Moreover, there was a high SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of 87.2% within this community. Given that 17.1% of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals had an ultra high load greater than 10(8) copies/ml, transmission from humans to dogs likely occurred. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 positive free roaming dogs. Also, as those animals were found in the Amazonian forest, SARS-CoV-2 transmission to wild mammals is a potential concern. Given the high presence of free roaming dogs associated to rural and indigenous communities in South America, the potential role of these domestic animals on COVID-19 spread would deserve further surveillance studies involving SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR and molecular epidemiology based on genome sequencing to confirm human to dog transmission.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection in free roaming dogs from the Amazonian jungle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Assess women's perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their health care and well-being, access to and satisfaction with medical care due to the changes in delivery of care triggered by the pandemic. METHODS An online survey of women having health care appointments in the outpatient facilities across all divisions of a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary care referral center in North Central Florida. Patients had outpatient appointments that were scheduled, canceled or rescheduled, in person or by telemedicine, between 11 March 2020 and 11 May 2020, a time during which a COVID-19 stay-at-home order was enacted across our state. A total of 6,697 visits were planned. Patients with multiple visits were unified, leaving 6,044 unique patients to whom the survey was emailed between 20 July 2020 and 31 July 2020. The survey was closed on 21 August 2020. Analyses were focused on simple descriptive statistics to assess frequency of responses. Analyses of variance and chi-square analyses were conducted to compare outcomes when all cells were  10, based on sub-specialty and insurance status; otherwise, frequencies were examined for the entire sample only. Missing data were excluded listwise. RESULTS A total of 6044 patients were contacted. Completed surveys numbered 1,083 yielding a response rate of 17.9%. The most common sub-specialty visit was gynecology (56.7%) followed by obstetrics (31.5%,), pelvic floor disorders (4.8%), gynecological oncology (2.9%,), and reproductive endocrinology (0.5%). A substantial percentage of women had visits canceled (19.2%), rescheduled (32.8%) or changed (42.1%) to telemedicine. In our patient population, 32.6% were worried about visiting the clinic and 48.1% were worried about visiting the hospital. COVID-19 triggered changes were perceived to have a negative impact by 26.1% of respondents. Refusal of future telemedicine visits was by 17.2%, however, 75.2% would prefer to use both in-person and telemedicine visits. CONCLUSION During the initial COVID-19 surge with lockdown, the majority of survey respondents were following public health precautions. However, there were significant concerns amongst women related to obstetric and gynecologic medical appointments scheduled during that period. During pandemics, natural disasters and similar extreme circumstances, digital communication and telemedicine have the potential to play a critical role in providing reassurance and care. Nevertheless, given the concerns expressed by survey respondents, communication and messaging tools are needed to increase comfort and ensure equity with the rapidly changing methods of care delivery.","output":"COVID-19: changing the care process for women's health-the patient's perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Affordance refers to the perception of possible actions allowed by an object. Despite its relevance to human-computer interaction, no existing theory explains the mechanisms that underpin affordance-formation; that is, how affordances are discovered and adapted via interaction. We propose an integrative theory of affordance-formation based on the theory of reinforcement learning in cognitive sciences. The key assumption is that users learn to associate promising motor actions to percepts via experience when reinforcement signals (success/failure) are present. They also learn to categorize actions (e.g.,\\"rotating\\"a dial), giving them the ability to name and reason about affordance. Upon encountering novel widgets, their ability to generalize these actions determines their ability to perceive affordances. We implement this theory in a virtual robot model, which demonstrates human-like adaptation of affordance in interactive widgets tasks. While its predictions align with trends in human data, humans are able to adapt affordances faster, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms.","output":"Rediscovering Affordance: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak poses a substantial threat to public health.

In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, targeting a different protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to impede and relinquish the current pandemic. Therefore, in this study, computational modelling and simulation approaches are used to target the N-terminal domain of the phosphor-nucleoprotein (RNA binding protein), which is primarily responsible for binding and packing the viral genome to get ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Our multi-step drug screening approach shortlisted potential drugs. These top hits were confirmed by re-docking which revealed that the interacting molecules block the key residues i.e. Thr57, His59, Ser105, Arg107, and Arg177 and thus ultimately block the NTD from RNA recognition. Furthermore, the activity of the top four hits was also confirmed by using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Our analysis suggests that these top hits possess strong inhibitory properties and should be tested experimentally.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of nursing students and faculty members as related to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative design using Photovoice was adopted. SETTING: The study took place across five countries and one city in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong). PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two nursing students and twenty-eight nursing faculty members who participated in online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Each participant submitted one photo substantiated with written reflections. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval was obtained from institution-specific ethics boards. RESULTS: Three themes and eleven sub-themes emerged from the data. The three main themes were: 1) Psychological roadblocks to online education; 2) Developing resilience despite adversities; and 3) Online education: What worked and what did not. CONCLUSION: Through Photovoice, the reflections revealed that nursing students and faculty members were generally overwhelmed with the online education experience. At the same time, participants were satisfied with the flexibility and convenience, opportunities for professional and personal development and safety afforded by online education. However, concerns over academic integrity, practical skills and clinical competencies, engagement and participation, the duality of technology and social isolation out-shadowed the advantages.

Previous work demonstrated that cells infected with vhs mutants display enhanced activation of the host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR), implying that vhs limits dsRNA accumulation in infected cells. Confirming this hypothesis, we show that partially complementary transcripts of the UL23/UL24 and UL30/31 regions of the viral genome increase in abundance when vhs is inactivated, giving rise to greatly increased levels of intracellular dsRNA formed by annealing of the overlapping portions of these RNAs. Thus, vhs limits accumulation of dsRNA at least in part by reducing the levels of complementary viral transcripts. We then asked if vhs also destabilizes dsRNA after its initial formation. Here, we used a reporter system employing two mCherry expression plasmids bearing complementary 3 UTRs to produce defined dsRNA species in uninfected cells. The dsRNAs are unstable, but are markedly stabilized by co-expressing the HSV dsRNA-binding protein US11. Strikingly, vhs delivered by super-infecting HSV virions accelerates the decay of these pre-formed dsRNAs in both the presence and absence of US11, a novel and unanticipated activity of vhs. Vhs binds the host RNA helicase eIF4A, and we find that vhs-induced dsRNA decay is attenuated by the eIF4A inhibitor hippuristanol, providing evidence that eIF4A participates in the process. Our results show that a herpesvirus host shutoff RNase destabilizes dsRNA in addition to targeting partially complementary viral mRNAs, raising the possibility that the mRNA destabilizing proteins of other viral pathogens dampen the host response to dsRNA through similar mechanisms.","output":"The herpes simplex virus host shutoff (vhs) RNase limits accumulation of double stranded RNA in infected cells: Evidence for accelerated decay of duplex RNA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus replicase gene encodes one or two papain\\\\like proteases (termed PL1pro and PL2pro) implicated in the N\\\\terminal processing of the replicase polyprotein and thus contributing to the formation of the viral replicase complex that mediates genome replication.

METHODS: We conducted a combined survey- and register-based study in a randomly selected, population-based cohort of 10,000 people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, heart valve disease, or ischaemic heart disease in 2018. The questionnaire covered return-to-work items, and we reported the probabilities of feeling under pressure to return to work with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in categories defined by sex, age, and CVD diagnosis. RESULTS: The survey response rate was 51.1%. In this study, we included 842 respondents (79.7% men) aged 32C85 years, who had returned to work following a sick leave. Overall, 249 (29.7%) had felt pressure to return to work.

As such, there are numerous players involved to ensure that the proteins are properly localized. Overall, transport requires vesicle budding, recognition of the vesicle by the target membrane and fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane resulting in delivery of its contents. The initial interaction between the vesicle and the target membrane has been referred to as tethering. Because this is the first contact between the two membranes, tethering is critical to ensuring that specificity is achieved. It is therefore not surprising that there are numerous tethering factors involved ranging from multisubunit complexes, coiled-coil proteins and Rab guanosine triphosphatases. Of the multisubunit tethering complexes, one of the best studied at the molecular level is the evolutionarily conserved TRAPP complex. There are two forms of this complex: TRAPP I and TRAPP II. In yeast, these complexes function in a number of processes including endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport (TRAPP I) and an ill-defined step at the trans Golgi (TRAPP II).

METHODS: Using the single B cell cloning technology, we isolated and characterized 93 RBD-specific antibodies from the memory B cells of four COVID-19 convalescent individuals in the early stage of the pandemic. Then, global RBD alanine scanning with a panel of 19 selected neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including several broadly reactive NAbs, was performed. Furthermore, we assessed the impact of single natural mutation or co-mutations of concern at key positions of RBD on the neutralization escape and ACE2 binding function by recombinant proteins and pseudoviruses. RESULTS: Thirty-three amino acid positions within four independent antigenic sites (1 to 4) of RBD were identified as valuable indicators of antigenic changes in the RBD. The comprehensive escape mutation map not only confirms the widely circulating strains carrying important immune escape RBD mutations such as K417N, E484K, and L452R, but also facilitates the discovery of new immune escape-enabling mutations such as F486L, N450K, F490S, and R346S. Of note, these escape mutations could not affect the ACE2 binding affinity of RBD, among which L452R even enhanced binding. Furthermore, we showed that RBD co-mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y present in B.1.351 appear more resistant to NAbs and human convalescent plasma from the early stage of the pandemic, possibly due to an additive effect. Conversely, double mutations E484Q and L452R present in B.1.617.1 variant show partial antibody evasion with no evidence for an additive effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a global view of the determinants for neutralizing antibody recognition, antigenic conservation, and RBD conformation. The in-depth escape maps may have value for prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 immune escape variants.

We aimed to report our institutional experience with COVID-19 patients who developed acute limb ischemia (ALI) during hospitalization or after discharge. METHODS: This was a single-center cross-sectional study. Records of all patients &#8805;18 years of age admitted to a tertiary center with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between September 1 and December 31, 2020 were retrospectively examined. Data regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities and outcomes were collected. Patients were followed-up during index hospitalization and for 30 days postdischarge. Acute limb ischemia was diagnosed by means of duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography in the presence of a clinical suspicion. RESULTS: A total of 681 consecutive patients (38.5% women) were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 during the study period. Median age was 63 years (IQR, 52-74). In-hospital mortality occurred in 94 (13.8%) patients. Ninety (13.2%) patients required intensive care unit admission at some point of their hospital stay.

We test the hypothesis that listeners with hearing loss' difficulties with comprehension and processing of syntactically complex sentences are due to the processing of degraded input interfering with the successful processing of complex sentences. Method We performed a neuroimaging study with a sentence comprehension task, varying sentence complexity (through subject-object order and verb-arguments order) and cognitive demands (presence or absence of a secondary task) within subjects. Groups of older subjects with hearing loss (n = 20) and age-matched normal-hearing controls (n = 20) were tested. Results The comprehension data show effects of syntactic complexity and hearing ability, with normal-hearing controls outperforming listeners with hearing loss, seemingly more so on syntactically complex sentences. The secondary task did not influence off-line comprehension. The imaging data show effects of group, sentence complexity, and task, with listeners with hearing loss showing decreased activation in typical speech processing areas, such as the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus. No interactions between group, sentence complexity, and task were found in the neuroimaging data. Conclusions The results suggest that listeners with hearing loss process speech differently from their normal-hearing peers, possibly due to the increased demands of processing degraded auditory input. Increased cognitive demands by means of a secondary visual shape processing task influence neural sentence processing, but no evidence was found that it does so in a different way for listeners with hearing loss and normal-hearing listeners.","output":"When Hearing Does Not Mean Understanding: On the Neural Processing of Syntactically Complex Sentences by Listeners With Hearing Loss"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two members of the faculty-who witnessed the birth of Genetic Medicine and remained to see it evolve-present their reflections about the history of genetic medicine at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.

Regrettably, only a small proportion of the population in many low-income and middle-income countries will have access to available vaccines.

Further, we evaluated one external (Bovine corona virus) and one internal (pepper mild mottle virus) reference virus. We found a consistently higher recovery of spiked virus using the modified ultrafiltration-based method. This method also had a significantly higher efficiency (p-value <0.01) for wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Rationale: Recent polls suggest that a significant share of the American public is reluctant to receive an impending COVID-19 vaccine. However, far less is known about which Americans are most likely to refuse the vaccine and their reasons for reluctance. Understanding these issues is critical to developing effective health communications to improve COVID-19 vaccination and end the pandemic.Method: We rely on a demographically representative survey of 5,009 American adults collected from May 28-June 8, 2020. We analyze the influence of demographic factors, political ideology, and COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Results: 31.1% of Americans do not intend to pursue getting vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available. The likelihood of refusal is higher for Blacks, women, and conservatives. People who are more concerned about COVID-19 were less likely to refuse the vaccine. Positive views of vaccination in general (vaccines are safe, effective, and important) were also negatively associated with vaccine refusal intention. The two most cited reasons for refusal are concerns about vaccine safety, and effectiveness. Reasons for reluctance vary across sub-populations. Women were most likely to be hesitant based on concerns about safety and efficacy. Blacks were more likely to be hesitant than Whites because of concerns about safety and efficacy, because they lack needed financial resources or health insurance, and because already had COVID-19.Conclusion: Large proportions of the American public do not intend to pursue a vaccine against COVID-19 once it becomes available, reducing its potential impact.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has encouraged increased digital social activities such as video game play to counteract social isolation during the pandemic. However, there is active debate about the potential for video game overuse, and some video games contain randomised purchases (loot boxes) that may psychologically approximate gambling. In this pre-registered study, we examined the effects of self-isolation and quarantine on excessive gaming and loot box spending. We recruited 1,144 (619 male, 499 female, 26 other) Australian, Aotearoa New Zealand, and US residents who self reported being quarantined or self-isolating (n = 447) or not (n = 619) during the COVID-19 pandemic to a cross-sectional natural experiment. We compared the associations between problem gambling symptomology, excessive gaming and loot box spending for isolated and non-isolated participants. Participants completed the Kessler-10 Psychological Distress Scale, Problem Gambling Severity Index, Internet Gaming Disorder Checklist, a measure of risky engagement with loot boxes, concern about contamination, and reported money spent on loot boxes in the past month, as well as whether they were quarantined or under self-isolation during the pandemic. Although, in our data, excessive gaming and loot box spending were not higher for isolated (self-isolated/ quarantined) compared to non-isolated gamers, the established association between problem gambling symptomology and loot box spending was stronger among isolated gamers than those not isolated. Concerns about being contaminated by germs was also significantly associated with greater excessive gaming and, to a lesser extent, loot box spending irrespective of isolation status. Gamers might be managing concerns about the pandemic with greater video game use, and more problem gamblers may be purchasing loot boxes during the pandemic. It is unclear whether these relationships may represent temporary coping mechanisms which abate when COVID-19 ends. Re-examination as the pandemic subsides may be required. More generally, the results suggest that social isolation during the pandemic may inflate the effect size of some media psychology and gaming effects. We urge caution not to generalise psychological findings from research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic to be necessarily representative of the magnitude of relationships when not in a pandemic.","output":"Effects of self-isolation and quarantine on loot box spending and excessive gamingresults of a natural experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic ravages the globe causing unprecedented health and economic challenges As the world prospects for a cure, scientists are looking critically at strategic protein targets within the SARS-CoV-2 that have therapeutic significance One of such targets is the Helicase which is an enzyme that affects all aspects of SARS-CoV-2 RNA metabolism The aim of this study is to identify small molecules from natural products that have strong binding affinity with and inhibitory activity against an allosteric site (Pocket 26) of SARS-CoV-2 Helicase Pyrx was used for the iin silicomolecular docking simulations of SARS-CoV-2 Helicase (QHD43415-12 pdb) against a library of small molecules obtained from edible African plants Triphenylmethane which had a docking score of -7 4 kcal/mol was chosen as a reference molecule Virtual screening for oral bioavailability was done based on the molecular descriptors of the compounds as provided by Pubchem SwissADME, pkCSM, and Molinspiration were used for further screening for molar refractivity, saturation, promiscuity, pharmacokinetic properties, and bioactivity respectively The Galaxy webserver which uses the GROMACS software was used for the molecular dynamic simulation and analyses The lead compounds are Gibberellin A12, A20 and A51 obtained from Green peas and the Okra plant aGibberellin A20 and A51 /aperformed better than the standard Gibberellin A51 is predicted to show the greatest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Helicase It is recommended that the inhibitory activities of the lead compounds be further investigated","output":"In Silico Identification of Potential Allosteric Inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 Helicase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Host shifts, when a cross-species transmission of a pathogen can lead to successful infections, are the main cause of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19 A complex challenge faced by the scientific community is to address the factors that determine whether the cross-species transmissions will result in spillover or sustained onwards infections Here we review recent literature and present a perspective on current approaches we are using to understand the mechanisms underlying host shifts We highlight the usefulness of the interactions between Drosophila species and viruses as an ideal study model Additionally, we discuss how cross-infection experiments - when pathogens from a natural reservoir are intentionally injected in novel host species- can test the effect cross-species transmissions may have on the fitness of virus and host, and how the host phylogeny may influence this response We also discuss experiments evaluating how cooccurrence with other viruses or the presence of the endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia may affect the performance of new viruses in a novel host Finally, we discuss the need of surveys of virus diversity in natural populations using next-generation sequencing technologies In the long term, these approaches can contribute to a better understanding of the basic biology of host shifts","output":"Host-shift as the cause of emerging infectious diseases: experimental approaches using Drosophila-virus interactions.

Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible.

To test this hypothesis, we retrospectively investigated the long-term prognosis of patients with early intervention in the prodromal phase of iNPH. METHODS: We defined the prodromal phase of iNPH as a 3m Timed Up and Go (TUG) of 13.5 s or less and a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 24 or more. Of the 83 iNPH patients who underwent shunt surgery at Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University Hospital over 3 years from January 2015, 12 prodromal phase cases (73.3  6.2 years, 10 males and 2 females) were included in the study. The iNPH grading scale (INPHGS), MMSE, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), intermittent gait disturbance (IGD), social participation status, and development of comorbidities were evaluated over 4 years. RESULTS: Preoperative MMSE was 27.2  1.5, FAB was 14.1  1.8, TUG was 10.7  1.4 s, and total iNPHGS was 2.8  1.4. At 1, 2, 3, and 4 years postoperatively, total INPHGS improved to 0.8, 0.9, 1.5, and 1.7, respectively, and remained significantly better than preoperatively except at 4 years postoperatively. The MMSE improved slightly to 27.5 after 1 year and then declined by 0.35 per year. After 4 years, the mean MMSE was 26.1, and only one patient had an MMSE below 23. FAB improved to 15.2 after 1 year and then declined slowly at 0.85/year. Ten patients (83%) maintained a high capacity for social participation postoperatively. The preoperative tendency to fall and IGD in 9 (75%) and 8 (67%) patients, respectively, completely disappeared postoperatively, resulting in improved mobility. Shunt malfunction associated with four weight fluctuations and one catheter rupture caused temporary worsening of symptoms, which were recovered by valve re-setting and catheter revision, respectively. CONCLUSION: Early intervention in the prodromal phase of iNPH patients maintained good cognitive and mobility function and social participation ability in the long term. The maintenance of long-term cognitive function suggests its preventive effect on dementia.

This disease burden is linked to the pathogen's intrinsic antibiotic-resistance and protected intracellular localization in alveolar macrophages. Current treatment regimens require several antibiotics with multi-month oral and intravenous administrations that are difficult to implement in the developing world. Herein, we report that a macrophage-targeted polyciprofloxacin prodrug acts as a surprisingly effective pre-exposure prophylactic in highly lethal murine models of aerosolized human pulmonary melioidosis. A single dose of the polymeric prodrug maintained high lung drug levels and targeted an intracellular depot of ciprofloxacin to the alveolar macrophage compartment that was sustained over a period of 7a?days above minimal inhibitory concentrations. This intracellular pharmacokinetic profile provided complete pre-exposure protection in a BSL-3 model with a drug-resistant, aerosolized clinical isolate of Burkholderia pseudomallei from Thailand. This total protection was achieved despite the bacteria's intrinsic resistance to ciprofloxacin and where an equivalent dose of pulmonary-administered ciprofloxacin was ineffective. For the first time, we demonstrate that targeting the intracellular macrophage compartment with extended antibiotic dosing can achieve pre-exposure prophylaxis in a model of pulmonary melioidosis.

Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) treated with anti-CD20 or fingolimod showed a reduced humoral response to mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, while the degree of such responses is unimpaired and similar in pwMS treated with other disease modifying therapies (DMTs), or untreated. However, the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune response is based also on cellular immunity and there is emerging evidence that anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses can be detected after vaccination also in patients with low antibody levels. In this study we aimed to monitor the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection and to identify correlates of reduced protection in frail vaccinated pwMS on different DMTs. Methods. We designed a long term clinical follow-up of the CovaXiMS (Covid-19 vaccine in Multiple Sclerosis) , a prospective multicenter cohort study enrolling pwMS scheduled for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with mRNA vaccines and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after the second vaccine dose. These patients were followed with periodic phone calls up to a mean time of 6 months, and all the SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections were registered. The impact of DMTs on cumulative incidence of breakthrough Covid-19 cases was presented by Kaplan-Meier curves. A multivariable logistic model was run to assess factors associated to a higher risk of breakthrough infections. Findings. 1705 pwMS (81.6% BNT162b2 and 18.4% mRNA-1273) had a full vaccination cycle (2 vaccine doses, 21/28 days apart). Of them, 1509 (88.5%) had blood assessment 4 weeks after the second vaccine dose. During follow-up, 23 breakthrough Covid-19 infections (cumulative incidence: 1.5%, SE=0.3%) were detected after a mean of 108 days after the second dose (range, 18-230). Of them, 9 were on ocrelizumab, one on rituximab, 4 on fingolimod, 6 on dimethyl-fumarate, one on teriflunomide, and 2 were untreated. Just two cases (a woman on ocrelizumab and a man on teriflunomide) required hospitalization. The probability to be infected was associated only with SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels measured after 4 weeks from the second vaccine dose (HR=0.63, p=0.007); an antibody level of 660 U/mL was calculated as the cut-off for higher risk of infection. Interpretation. Our data show that the risk of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections is mainly associated with reduced levels of the virus-specific humoral immune response. Funding.

Herein, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature and analyzed clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS Through searching PubMed until June 03, 2020, we identified 16 relevant case studies (33 cases) from a total of 45 studies that have reported on patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancies. We investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics including type of hematologic malignancies, initial symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Then, we compared those characteristics and outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 to the general population infected with COVID-19. RESULTS The median age was 66-year-old. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common type of hematologic malignancy (39.4%). Fever was the most common symptom (75.9%). Most patients had normal leukocyte counts (55.6%), lymphocytosis (45.4%), and normal platelet counts (68.8%). In comparison to patients with COVID-19 without underlying hematologic malignancies, dyspnea was more prevalent (45.0 vs. 24.9%, p=0.025). Leukocytosis (38.9 vs. 9.8%, p=0.001), lymphocytosis (45.4 vs. 8.2%, p=0.001), and thrombocytopenia (31.3 vs. 11.4%, p=0.036) were significantly more prevalent and lymphopenia (18.2 vs. 57.4%, p=0.012) less prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies. There were no clinical and laboratory characteristics predicting mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Mortality was much higher in patients with hematologic malignancies compared to those without this condition (40.0 vs. 3.6%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Co-occurrence of hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 is rare. However, due to the high mortality rate from COVID-19 in this vulnerable population, further investigation on tailored treatment and management is required.","output":"Clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Micronics Engineered Filtration Group is moving its corporate headquarters from Portsmouth, New Hampshire to Chattanooga, Tennessee from 1 September 2020.","output":"Micronics to relocate HQ to Chattanooga, Tennessee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Efficient coupling of soft robotic cardiac assist devices to the external surface of the heart is crucial to augment cardiac function and represents a hurdle to translation of this technology.

We explored how health centers across the U.S. are using tele-OUD in treatment as well as reasons for nonadoption. METHODS We used the 2018 SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database and literature review to create a sample of community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telemental health services. From this list of health centers, we ued maximum diversity sampling to identify and recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. We used inductive and deductive approaches to develop site summaries. RESULTS Twenty-two health centers from 14 different states participated. Of these, 8 offered tele-OUD. Among centers with tele-OUD, medication management was the most common service provided via video. Typically, health centers offered telemedicine visits after an initial, in-person visit with a waivered (prescribing) provider. Some programs only offered counseling via telemedicine. Leading barriers to treatment that tele-OUD program representatives mentioned included regulations on the prescribing of controlled substances, including buprenorphine, and difficulties in sending lab results to distant (prescribing) providers. Nonadopters reported not offering tele-OUD due to regulations in controlled substance prescribing, complexities and regulatory barriers to offering group visits, and the belief that in-person OUD services were meeting patient need.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Penile tissue was collected from patients undergoing surgery for penile prosthesis for severe ED. Specimens were obtained from two men with a history of COVID-19 infection and two men with no history of infection. Specimens were imaged with TEM and H&E staining. RT-PCR was performed from corpus cavernosum biopsies. The tissues collected were analyzed for endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS, a marker of endothelial function) and COVID-19 spike-protein expression. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function was assessed from blood samples collected from COVID-19 (+) and COVID-19 (-) men. RESULTS: TEM showed extracellular viral particles ~100 nm in diameter with peplomers (spikes) near penile vascular endothelial cells of the COVID-19 (+) patients and absence of viral particles in controls. PCR showed presence of viral RNA in COVID-19 (+) specimens. eNOS expression in the corpus cavernosum of COVID-19 (+) men was decreased compared to COVID-19 (-) men. Mean EPC levels from the COVID-19 (+) patients were substantially lower compared to mean EPCs from men with severe ED and no history of COVID-19.

To design these protocols, laboratory investigation of viral infections is critical to confirm their occurrence and determine their epizootiology. However, laboratory confirmation of certain swine viral diseases is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, requiring scientific personnel with relevant expertise. Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics are tests and devices that provide clinically relevant information on-site, facilitating decision-makers to swiftly take countermeasures for disease control. In the present study, novel photonic biosensors were integrated into a single, automated POC device that can record and analyze changes in the sensors refractive index, allowing the detection of Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2) in oral fluids within 75 min. The objective of this work was to validate this device using reference and field samples (oral fluids). The system was able to detect PPV and PCV-2 in oral fluid samples satisfactorily. The device can be directly deployed in farms for the fast diagnosis of these diseases, contributing to farm biosecurity. ABSTRACT: Viral diseases challenge the health and welfare of pigs and undermine the sustainability of swine farms. Their efficient control requires early and reliable diagnosis, highlighting the importance of Point of Care (POC) diagnostics in veterinary practice. The objective of this study was to validate a novel POC system that utilizes Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) and microfluidics to detect swine viral pathogens using oral fluids and Porcine Parvovirus (PPV) and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2) as proofs of concept. The sensitivity and specificity of the device were calculated for both viruses, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn. PPV had an Area Under Curve (AUC) value of 0.820 (95% CI: 0.760 to 0.880, p < 0.0001), and its optimal efficiency threshold of detection shifts was equal to 4.5 pm (68.6% sensitivity, 77.1% specificity and Limit of Detection (LOD) value 10(6) viral copies/mL). PCV-2 had an AUC value of 0.742 (95% CI: 0.670 to 0.815, p < 0.0001) and an optimal efficiency threshold of shifts equal to 6.5 pm (69.5% sensitivity, 70.3% specificity and LOD 3.3  10(5) copies/mL). In this work, it was proven that PICs can be exploited for the detection of swine viral diseases.

METHODS: This is a single center retrospective case series analysis of individuals with HIV hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. We analyzed relevant data related to demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, HIV viral load and CD4 profiles, serum inflammatory markers, COVID-19 treatment and survival. RESULTS: 25 patients were identified. The demographic, socioeconomic and clinical data are described in Table 1. 88% of subjects. were on HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) but only 60% had CD4 counts > 200cells/mm(3).

The group mortality rate appear to be higher compared to the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 reported in the general population or other published HIV-COVID-19 coinfection case series.

The number of cases follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and we used 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear correlations of the exponents with other variables, for a sample of 126 countries. We find a positive correlation, faster spread of COVID-19 , with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4x10 -7), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3x10 -6), life expectancy (8x10 -6), number of international tourists (1x10 -5), earlier epidemic starting date (2x10 -5), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6x10 -5), lung cancer prevalence (6x10 -5), obesity in males (1x10 -4), share of population in urban areas (2x10 -4), cancer prevalence (3x10 -4), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, smaller sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002-0.006, smaller sample, 50 countries). There is highly significant correlation also with blood type: positive correlation with types RH- (2x10 -5) and A+ (2x10 -3), negative correlation with B+ (2x10 -4). We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02-0.03) with: CO2/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. Other variables are found to have a counterintuitive negative correlation, which may be explained due their strong negative correlation with life expectancy: slower spread of COVID-19 is correlated with high death-rate due to pollution, prevalence of anemia and hepatitis B, high blood pressure in females. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.","output":"COVID-19 transmission risk factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"None.","output":"Changes in university classes as COVID-19 continues and new findings regarding future university instruction methods: from the perspective of Japan and Semey, Republic of Kazakhstan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 has spread rapidly worldwide and disease spread is currently increasing.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We describe the administrative and technical processes involved in transitioning room temperature PLTs to cold storage in April 2020. Additionally, we describe the clinical utilization of cold-stored PLTs in the first month of this practice change, with a focus on changes in PLT counts after transfusion, hemostasis, and safety outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 61 cold-stored PLT units were transfused to 40 bleeding patients, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 1 (1-2) units per patient. The median age was 68 (59-73) years; 58% male. Median pretransfusion and posttransfusion PLTs counts were 88 (67-109) and 115 (93-145). A total of 95% of transfusions were administered in the operating room: 57% cardiac surgery, 20% vascular surgery, 8% general surgery, and 5% solid organ transplantation. Hemostasis was deemed to be adequate in all cases after transfusion. There were no transfusion reactions. One patient (3%) experienced a fever and infection within 5 days of transfusion, which was unrelated to transfusion. Median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 8.5 (6-17) days. Two patients (5%) died in the hospital of complications not related to transfusion.

However, it is unclear whether people's lifestyles will change as a result. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore perceived lifestyle changes after the outbreak of COVID-19 and their association with subjective well-being (SWB) among the general population in Mainland China. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in May 2020. Lifestyle behaviors including leisure-time physical exercise, leisure-time screen time, and dietary intake were self-reported. SWB was measured using the General Wellbeing Schedule (GWS). Other covariates including sociodemographic factors, self-rated physical health, perceived social support, and loneliness were also assessed by a structured questionnaire. A multivariate ordinal regression method was used to analyze the association between SWB and lifestyle behaviors as well as perceived lifestyle changes. RESULTS: A total of 1033 participants aged between 18 and 60 years were included in this study. The mean GWS score was 71.7 points. About 70% of the respondents reported spending more time looking at screens, whereas about 30% reported an increased frequency of vegetable and fruit intake after the outbreak of COVID-19. Inactive physical exercise (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.48), infrequent vegetable intake (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), infrequent fruit intake (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), and often skipping breakfast (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08-1.91) were associated with lower SWB after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, self-rated physical health, perceived social support, and loneliness. Moreover, participants who perceived a decrease in the frequency of vegetable, fruit, and breakfast intake were more likely to report lower SWB. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have positive and negative impacts on different aspects of lifestyle behaviors. Both unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and negative lifestyle changes were associated with lower SWB.

Verbena officinalis (V. officinalis) has been used as a medical plant in traditional and modern medicine, exhibiting anti-tumor and anti-inflammation activity. Purpose The impact of bioactive constituents of V. officinalis on immune responses still remains largely elusive. In this work we investigated the potential targets of V. officinalis and focused on killing efficiency and related functions of NK cells regulated by bioactive constituents of V. officinalis. Study design/methods We used primary human NK cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Potential regulatory roles of selected compounds were analyzed by network pharmacology approaches. Killing efficiency was determined with real-time killing assay and live-cell imaging in 3D. Proliferation was examined by CFSE staining. Expression of cytotoxic proteins was analyzed using flow cytometry. Lytic granule release was quantified by CD107a degranulation assay. Contact time required for killing and determination of serial killers were analyzed using live cell imaging results. Results: Using network pharmacology approaches, we analyzed potential regulatory roles of five compounds (Acteoside, Apigenin, Kaempferol, Verbenalin and Hastatoside) from V. officinalis on immune cell functions and revealed NK cells as a major target. The effect of these compounds on NK killing efficiency was examined with real-time killing assay, and Verbenalin enhanced NK killing efficiency significantly. Further investigation showed that Verbenalin did not affect proliferation, expression of cytotoxic proteins, or lytic granule degranulation, but rather reduced contact time required for killing therefore enhancing total killing events per NK cell, suggestively via inhibition of inhibitory receptors as determined by docking assay. Conclusions Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms how V. officinalis regulates functions of immune cells, especially NK cells, suggesting Verbenalin from V. officinalis as a promising therapeutic reagent to fight cancer and infection.","output":"Bioactive constituents of Verbena officinalis regulate killing efficiency of primary human natural killer cells by accelerating killing processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seit nunmehr sieben Dekaden setzt sich die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) mit ihren 194 Mitgliedstaaten dafr ein, dass allen Menschen das h?chstm?gliche Gesundheitsniveau zuteil wird.

The disease is rapidly transmitting in the community. Imposed lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic have effectively delayed the transmission in the community but the transmissibility in households needs to be explored. The aim of this study was to estimate the household transmission of COVID-19 and assess the factors affecting transmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study where the data were collected from a single isolation center, was conducted. Patients were contacted by phone. Information regarding number of COVID-19-positive cases in the family, their demographic details, along with number of rooms in their household was collected. RESULTS: A total of 369 families of COVID-19-positive patients were contacted. Nineteen families with a single member were excluded. Out of 350 families with a total 2126 members, 480 (22.5%) were COVID-19 positive. Mean age was 30.12 years (14.39) and majority of them were males (68.9%). Majority of the cases (67.3%) were in the age group (19C49 years). Mean rooms per person were 0.51 0.20 (0.14 to 1.50). Mild negative correlation was seen between number of positive COVID-19 cases and rooms per person (r= ?0.138, p=0.008) while moderate negative correlation with number of family members and proportion of family members being COVID-19 positive (r= ?0.542, p0.0001). CONCLUSION: One in four family members got infected with COVID-19, they were majority males and in the working age group.

The proposed model is with an encoderCdecoder architecture and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal feature extraction and multi-head attention for long-term dependency caption. The model simultaneously takes historical information, a priori known future information, and pseudo future information into consideration, where the pseudo future information is learned with the covariate forecasting network (CFN) and multi-task learning (MTL). In addition, we also propose the degraded teacher forcing (DTF) method to train the model efficiently. Compared with other models, the ITANet is more effective in the forecasting of COVID-19 new confirmed cases.

Consistently, across very different organisms and cell types, we find a decrease in the gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination in ageing cells. In addition, we find that loss of gene-to-gene transcriptional coordination is associated with high mutational load of a specific, age-related signature and with radiation-induced DNA damage.

Furthermore, we implement the new correlations in a three-dimensional multiphase EulerianCLagrangian computational fluid dynamics solver to study the effects of weather conditions on airborne virus transmission. The new theory introduces a thermal history kernel and provides transient Nusselt (Nu) and Sherwood (Sh) numbers as a function of the Reynolds (Re), Prandtl (Pr), and Schmidt numbers (Sc). For the first time, these new correlations take into account the mixture properties due to the concentration of CoV particles in a saliva droplet. We show that the steady-state relationships induce significant errors and must not be applied in unsteady saliva droplet evaporation. The classical theory introduces substantial deviations in Nu and Sh values when increasing the Reynolds number defined at the droplet scale. The effects of relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed on the transport and viability of CoV in a cloud of airborne saliva droplets are also examined. The results reveal that a significant reduction of virus viability occurs when both high temperature and low relative humidity occur. The droplet clouds traveled distance and concentration remain significant at any temperature if the relative humidity is high, which is in contradiction with what was previously believed by many epidemiologists. The above could explain the increase in CoV cases in many crowded cities around the middle of July (e.g., Delhi), where both high temperature and high relative humidity values were recorded one month earlier (during June). Moreover, it creates a crucial alert for the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic in the coming autumn and winter seasons when low temperatures and high wind speeds will increase airborne virus survival and transmission.","output":"Weather impact on airborne coronavirus survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Nanotechnology has been manufactured from medicinal plants to develop safe, and effective antischistosmal alternatives to replace todays therapies.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eighty four mice, divided into nine different groups, were sacrificed at 6(th), 8(th), and 10(th) week post-infection (PI), with assessment of parasitological, histopathological, and oxidative stress parameters, and scanning the worms by electron microscope. As a prophylactic drug, GNPs showed slight reduction in worm burden, egg density, and granuloma size and number. As a therapeutic drug, GNPs significantly reduced worm burden (59.9%), tissue egg load (64.9%), granuloma size, and number at 10(th) week PI, and altered adult worm tegumental architecture, added to antioxidant effect. Interestingly, combination of GNPs with PZQ or MFQ gave almost similar or sometimes better curative effects as obtained with each drug separately. The highest therapeutic effect was obtained when ? dose GNPs combined with ? dose MFQ which achieved 100% reduction in both the total worm burden, and ova tissue density as early as the 6(th) week PI, with absence of detected eggs or tissue granuloma, and preservation of liver architecture. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: GNPs have a schistosomicidal, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective role.

The lockdown measures heavily affected vulnerable social groups, including persons affected by Hansens disease (PaHd) and their families. Stigma, late diagnosis and related disability make PaHd a population in a situation of vulnerability. Poor sanitary and socio-economic conditions, lower levels of education and food insecurity are risk markers for Hansens disease. Before COVID-19, PaHd were refused employment or lost their jobs due to physical impairment or discrimination. Job losses worldwide are hitting hardest on poor and vulnerable populations, therefore pushing millions of people to extreme poverty. Hansens disease, also known as leprosy, is only endemic in the poorest areas of the world. Although specific data regarding PaHd are scarce, we traced a parallel between the impact of the current pandemic on the labour market on various excluded and marginalized populations, such as persons with disabilities and PaHd.

We tested whether the participant and experimenter sex modulated placebo effects on experimentally induced pain and associated stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if (i) participant sex and (ii) experimenter sex influence placebo analgesia and subjective and physiological stress in two experiments employing a within-subjects and a mixed design, respectively. Placebo effects were investigated in pain reports, stress, and blood pressure. METHODS: Participants received painful stimulations and a placebo cream. In Experiment One (N = 59) participants underwent a placebo condition (PC) and a natural history condition (NHC) in random order. A placebo cream was applied in the PC and then the heat stimulation temperature was surreptitiously lowered. Identical stimulations were administered in the NHC, but with no cream, no information, and no lowered temperature. In Experiment Two, participants (N = 93) were randomly assigned to three groups receiving either a placebo cream with surreptitiously lowered intensity of electric stimuli (Placebo, PG), a placebo cream (Cream-Control, CCG) without changing the stimuli, or lowered intensity, but with no cream (Pain-Control, PCG) in a mixed design. All participants in both experiments received the same stimuli in the post-test as in the pre-test. Four experimenters (two females) in Experiment One, and five experimenters (two females) in Experiment Two conducted the studies. RESULTS: No placebo effect was seen on pain. However, there were placebo effects on stress, moderated by participant and experimenter sex: in Experiment One males in the PC had lower diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared to males in the NHC. Participants in the PC had lower DBP compared to the NHC when tested by a female. In Experiment Two, participants expected more cream effectiveness when a female experimenter administered it, and reported lower stress in the PG compared to the PCG when tested by females. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a distinction between placebo effects on pain and on associated stress. Secondly, female experimenters recorded lower physiological and subjective stress, higher effectiveness expectations, and lower pain from both sexes compared to male experimenters.

The study included 1543 university students between 18 and 25 years old (50.2% males, M(age) = 19.9 years, SD = 1.9) who retrospectively described their experience between the ages of 12 and 17 years old. The results indicated that stress, ineffectiveness and parental impulsivity increase the negative effect of punitive discipline on CPV. There is no moderating effect of parental warmth/support. The gender of the aggressor is only a moderator in the case of violence toward the father, and the effect of punitive discipline is stronger in males than in females. The study draws conclusions regarding the importance of context and the mode by which parents discipline their children, aspects that can aggravate the adverse effects of physical and psychological punishment on CPV.

Methods: The synergistic activity and the bactericidal activity of colistin in combination with resveratrol was investigated by checkerboard assays and time-kill assays, respectively. A total of 21 strains were investigated, including 16 strains of different species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 6, Escherichia coli, n = 6; Citrobacter braakii, n = 1; Stenotrophomonas malthophilia, n = 1; Enterobacter cloaceae, n = 1; Acinetobacter baumannii, n = 1) with acquired colistin resistance, three colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae precursors, and two strains of intrinsically colistin-resistant species (Serratia marcescens, n = 1; Proteus mirabilis, n = 1). Mechanisms of acquired colistin resistance included chromosomal mutations (i.e., mgrB, pmrAB) and plasmid genes (mcr-1, mcr-1.2). Results: Resveratrol did not show any significant intrinsic antimicrobial activity. Overall, a relevant synergistic antimicrobial activity of resveratrol in combination with colistin was observed with all tested strains, except for the three colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae strains, and for two mcr-1-positive E. coli strains. In time-kill assays, performed with 15 selected strains, the combination of colistin 2 mg/L plus resveratrol 128 mg/L was bactericidal with 11 strains, and bacteriostatic for the remaining ones. Conclusions: Resveratrol was found to potentiate colistin activity against a wide panel of colistin-resistant strains, regardless of species and resistance mechanisms, which would deserve further investigation for potential clinical applications.","output":"Synergistic Activity of Colistin in Combination With Resveratrol Against Colistin-Resistant Gram-Negative Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Converting CO2 into sustainable fuels (e.g., CH4) has great significance to solve carbon emission and energy crisis.

On the other hand, small-incision thyroidectomy lacks sufficient working space and clear vision. The author has newly developed hybrid-type endoscopic thyroidectomy (HET) to overcome these problems. METHODS From March 2011 to February 2012, HET was performed for 85 patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. To evaluate the superiority of HET for malignancy representatively, conventional lobectomy with central compartment node dissection (CCND) performed 1 year previously was compared with HET. In lobectomy and node dissection, a single skin incision (1.5 cm) is made above the clavicle, with a port incision (5 mm) made 3 cm below the clavicle. Then CCND is performed directly through the incision by lifting up the isthmus. To obtain sufficient working space for the lobectomy, the strap muscles are taped and pulled toward the head, then hung by the cradle. The thyroid lobe is retracted to the midline with a retractor, followed by isolation of the inferior laryngeal nerve and transection of the inferior thyroid vessels with the monitor of the scope. Lateral lymph nodes dissection can be performed at the same time, if necessary. In total thyroidectomy, the same procedure is performed at the opposite side. The scalpel can be used to shave through each incision in case of tracheal invasion. RESULTS Of the 85 cases, 62 were malignant, involving papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and 23 were benign. Total thyroidectomy was performed for 22 of the PTC cases and CCND for 49 of the cases. Shaving for tracheal invasion was performed for eight patients. No mortality, complications, recurrence, or metastasis was found 1-2 years after the operation. Compared with conventional thyroidectomy, HET was superior in blood loss, visual analog scale, and postoperative hospital stay. CONCLUSION The author's method (Tori's method) might be less invasive, cosmetically excellent, and moreover, safe and feasible for differentiated thyroid carcinoma including invasion to the trachea.","output":"Hybrid-type endoscopic thyroidectomy (HET: Tori's method) for differentiated thyroid carcinoma including invasion to the trachea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of severe disease and death caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The role of immunosuppressive medications in the clinical presentation, disease course, and outcomes is not well understood. Methods: We analyzed kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 and requiring hospitalization during the initial infection surge at 2 large transplant centers in New Orleans, Louisiana, between February 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Patient presentation, clinical course, kidney transplant function, and postdischarge details are included in this analysis. Results: Twenty-three kidney transplant recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included in the study. The majority of patients were Black (95.7%). Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were present in more than 50% of the patients. The most common presenting symptom was fever, present in 52.2% of patients. All patients were managed with reduction in immunosuppression. Patients received azithromycin (60.9%), hydroxychloroquine (47.8%), remdesivir (8.7%), and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse (8.7%). The average length of stay was 4.5 days (range, 2-18 days). In this study population, 73.9% of the patients sustained acute kidney injury, with an average peak serum creatinine of 3.81 mg/dL. Twenty-six percent of the patients required renal replacement therapy. Seventy-seven percent of patients developed proteinuria (at least 1+ proteinuria on urinalysis).

The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P<.001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P <.001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P=.017).

Possible interventions are therapeutic selective nerve root block or pulsed radiofrequency. Central pain sensitisation is not directly assessable in humans and therefore the term human assumed central sensitisation (HACS) is proposed. The possible existence and degree of sensitisation associated with pain mechanisms assumed present in the human central nervous system, its role in the chronification of pain and its interaction with diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are largely unknown in patients with CLBPr. The aim of quantitative sensory testing (QST) is to estimate quantitatively the presence of HACS and accumulating evidence suggest that a subset of patients with CLBPr have facilitated responses to a range of QST tests. The aims of this study are to identify HACS in patients with CLBPr, to determine associations with the effect of selective nerve root blocks and compare outcomes of HACS in patients to healthy volunteers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A prospective observational study including 50 patients with CLBPr. Measurements are performed before diagnostic and therapeutic nerve root block interventions and at 4 weeks follow-up. Data from patients will be compared with those of 50 sex-matched and age-matched healthy volunteers. The primary study parameters are the outcomes of QST and the Central Sensitisation Inventory. Statistical analyses to be performed will be analysis of variance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, approved this study (dossier NL60439.042.17).

Emergency departments (EDs) are more likely to come into contact with potential EVD patients. It is important for EDs to be prepared to care for suspected EVD patients. Our objective was to understand the perceived challenges experienced by Washington State ED medical directors in EVD preparedness. METHODS An anonymous, electronic survey was sent to a convenience sample of ED medical directors across Washington State between November and February of 2014-2015. The perceived challenges of and attitudes toward EVD preparations were assessed and reported as stratified proportions. RESULTS Of 85 medical directors contacted, 59 responses (69%) were received. This included EDs with annual patient volumes of 60,000 (12 hospitals, 20%). Among the perceived challenges in EVD preparations were spatial modifications (eg, building an anteroom for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment) and waste management planning. Ninety-five percent of respondents moderately or strongly agreed that it is important to have a predesignated hospital to care for EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS Washington State ED medical directors have faced significant challenges in ensuring their EDs are prepared to safely care for suspected EVD patients. Attitudes toward EVD preparations are mixed. Varying levels of perceived importance may represent an additional barrier to statewide EVD preparedness.

However, attaining the combination of high sensitivity and multiplexity with a short assay turnaround poses a formidable technological challenge. Here, the authors develop a rapid, accurate, and highly multiplexed microfluidic digital immunoassay by incorporating machine learning-based autonomous image analysis. The assay has achieved 12-plexed biomarker detection in sample volume <15 L at concentrations < 5 pg/mL while only requiring a 5-min assay incubation, allowing for all processes from sampling to result to be completed within 40 min. The assay procedure applies both a spatial-spectral microfluidic encoding scheme and an image data analysis algorithm based on machine learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pre-equilibrated single-molecule protein digital counting. This unique approach remarkably reduces errors facing the high-capacity multiplexing of digital immunoassay at low protein concentrations. Longitudinal data obtained for a panel of 12 serum cytokines in human patients receiving chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy reveals the powerful biomarker profiling capability.

The efficiency of these systems is defined by the cumulative effect of analyte detection speed, sensitivity, and specificity. In this perspective, we provide a fresh outlook on the use of important parameters obtained from well-characterized analytical models, by connecting the mass transport and reaction limits with the experimentally attainable limits of analyte detection efficiency.

Vaccine hesitancy, an individual behavior influenced by historical, political, and socio-cultural factors, is believed to be a primary factor responsible for decreasing vaccine coverage, thereby increasing the risk and occurrence of VPD outbreaks. Society, culture, and individual motivations affect human decisions regarding health behavior and preventative care, and health perceptions and health-related behaviors can change at the population level as cultures evolve. In recent years, mathematical models of disease dynamics have begun to incorporate aspects of human behavior, however they do not address how evolving cultures influence these health behaviors. Here, using a mathematical modeling framework, we explore the effects of cultural evolution on vaccine hesitancy and vaccination behavior. With this model, we shed light on the facets of cultural evolution (vertical and oblique transmission, homophily, etc.) that promote the spread of vaccine hesitancy, ultimately affecting levels of vaccination coverage and VPD outbreak risk in a population. In addition, we present our model as a generalizable framework for exploring cultural evolution when beliefs influence, but do not strictly dictate, human behaviors. We show vaccine confidence and vaccine-conferred benefits can be driving forces of vaccine coverage, and we demonstrate that an assortative preference among vaccine-hesitant individuals can lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccine coverage. Further, we show that vaccine mandates can lead to a phenomenon in which high vaccine hesitancy co-occurs with high vaccination coverage, and that high vaccine confidence can be maintained even in areas where access to vaccines is limited.","output":"The Cultural Evolution of Vaccine Hesitancy: Modeling the Interaction between Beliefs and Behaviors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of the Industry 4.0 revolution to upgrade the Internet of Things (IoT) standards provides the prominence outcomes for the future wireless communication systems called 5G.

METHODS: Employees were recruited starting with high-risk exposure groups, utilizing e-mails, flyers, and announcements at virtual town hall meetings. At baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 6 months, participants reported occupational and community exposures and gave a blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A post hoc Cox proportional hazards regression model was performed to identify factors associated with increased risk for seropositivity. RESULTS: In total, 1,740 employees were enrolled. At 6 months, the cumulative seroprevalence was 5.3%, which was below estimated community point seroprevalence. Seroprevalence was 5.8% among employees who provided direct care and was 3.4% among employees who did not perform direct patient care. Most participants who were seropositive at baseline remained positive at follow-up assessments.

We considered these three proteins as seed nodes and applied the random walk with restart method on the human interactome to construct a protein-protein interaction sub-network, which captures the effects of viral invasion.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, dPCR could serve as a powerful complement to the current qPCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, especially for the samples with extremely low viral load, such as recurrent COVID-19 patients.","output":"Digital PCR assay for the effective detection of COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 low viral load"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assessing outcomes in healthcare is becoming both a UK and a global policy priority In 2011, the NHS Outcomes Framework policy began developing indicators to monitor the health outcomes of adults and children in England This data now provides important information on the impact of services, guiding not just clinicians around their practice, but also commissioners on the future delivery of services Here, Lloyd discusses how measuring outcomes can improve school nurses' effectiveness","output":"Starting to Measure Up: the Journal of the Health Visitors' Association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Variability in the health effects of dietary fiber might arise from inter-individual differences in the gut microbiota's ability to ferment these substrates into beneficial metabolites. Our understanding of what drives this individuality is vastly incomplete and will require an ecological perspective as microbiomes function as complex inter-connected communities. Here, we performed a parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with overweight and class-I obesity to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35 g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and integrated the findings using an ecological framework. RESULTS Arabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community composition, reduced -diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia obeum, and Prevotella copri. Arabinoxylan further increased fecal propionate concentrations (p = 0.012, Friedman's test), an effect that showed two distinct groupings of temporal responses in participants. The two groups showed differences in compositional shifts of the microbiota (p  0.025, PERMANOVA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses revealed that the propionate response was predictable through shifts and, to a lesser degree, baseline composition of the microbiota. Principal components (PCs) derived from community data were better predictors in MLR models as compared to single taxa, indicating that arabinoxylan fermentation is the result of multi-species interactions within microbiomes. CONCLUSION This study showed that long-chain arabinoxylan modulates both microbiota composition and the output of health-relevant SCFAs, providing information for a more targeted application of this fiber. Variation in propionate production was linked to both compositional shifts and baseline composition, with PCs derived from shifts of the global microbial community showing the strongest associations. These findings constitute a proof-of-concept for the merit of an ecological framework that considers features of the wider gut microbial community for the prediction of metabolic outcomes of dietary fiber fermentation. This provides a basis to personalize the use of dietary fiber in nutritional application and to stratify human populations by relevant gut microbiota features to account for the inconsistent health effects in human intervention studies.

Several antipsychotics and antidepressants have been tested for in vitro activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Chlorpromazine, other phenothiazine antipsychotics, and the antidepressant fluoxetine were found to be rather potent in these studies. However, whether effective plasma concentrations can be obtained with clinically accepted doses of these drugs is not clear. Data of COVID-19 patients are not yet available but several clinical studies are currently underway.The specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine is a potent Sigma-1 receptor agonist and reduces inflammation in animal models of cytokine-stress. Accordingly, fluvoxamine treatment was superior to placebo in reducing impaired respiratory function and other symptoms of inflammation in COVID-19 patients in a placebo-controlled clinical study and another open clinical trial. The beneficial effects of fluvoxamine on the course of COVID-19 were recently confirmed in a large placebo-controlled double-blind trial with several hundred patients.Inflammation represents a major risk factor for many psychiatric disorders which explains the high susceptibilitiy of COVID-19 patients for psychiatric diseases. Many antidepressants and antipsychotics possess anti-inflammatory properties independent of sigma-1 activity which might be important to reduce psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 patients and to improve respiratory dysfunction and other consequences of inflammation.

High risk HPV (Hr-HPV) 16 and 18 together account for more than 70% of cervical cancer cases, whereas the hr-HPV-18 is the second most prevalent hr-HPV type, causing about 5.2% of all cancers worldwide. Considering the high prevalence and mortality rate, cervical cancer remains a noteworthy health problem among women. As of now, no registered immunotherapies are available after the HPV infection. Thus, developing an immunotherapeutic candidate against hr-HPV would be of major clinical benefit. Nowadays, the T-and B-cell peptide based targeted vaccines have been considered as the best candidate for vaccine development against viral infections. In this study, both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine candidates against hr-HPV-18 were predicted. To achieve this, the prediction of T-and B-cell epitopes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) were accomplished, that can be used for HPV immunotherapy. For MHC-I, a maximum number (20) of potent peptides were found, against HLA-B*51:01 (L1 = 9, L2 = 6, E2 = 4, and E4 = 1) having percentile value < 1 and, immunogenicity scores higher than 0.5, followed by HLA-A*11:01 (L1 = 8, E2 = 7 L2 = 2, and E6 = 1, E7 = 1); 19 epitopes.

Methods: We analysed data from the CovidLife study (N=14,387;66.4% female;mean [SD] age, 57.4 [13.9] years). Data were collected in an online survey of UK adults (aged 18 years or over) between 17 April and 7 June 2020. SEP measures included area deprivation (the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation [SIMD]), education level, household income, and employment status. Mental health was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale. Worry indices were derived using principal component analysis. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations between SEP and mental health. Results: Low SEP was associated with increased odds of depression and anxiety (odds ratio [OR] range 1.18-2.69). These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, relationship status, and psychiatric history. Multivariable adjustment for medical worry and isolation during the pandemic had the largest attenuating effects (ranges 18-60% and 4-46%, respectively) on mental health outcomes. When adding further adjustment for the remaining SEP markers and all potential confounding and mediating factors, depression was associated with high area deprivation and low education level and income, whilst anxiety was only associated with low education level. No dose-response relationship was observed. Conclusions: SEP was inversely associated with mental health, which was mostly explained by medical worry and isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health interventions might target these factors to prevent widening inequalities in mental health.

The lack of an effective method to control the endemics has led to a surge in PEDV recurrences in affected farms throughout the country. OBJECTIVES: In the first step toward establishing systematic monitoring of and active control measures over the swine populations, we constructed an assessment model that evaluates the status of (1) biosecurity, (2) herd immunity, and (3) virus circulation in each of the PEDV-infected farms. METHODS: A total of 13 farrow-to-finish pig farms with a history of acute PEDV infection on Jeju Island were chosen for this study. The potential risk of the recurrence in these farms was estimated through on-site data collection and laboratory examination. RESULTS: Overall, the data indicated that a considerable number of the PEDV-infected farms had lax biosecurity, achieved incomplete protective immunity in the sows despite multi-dose vaccination, and served as incubators of the circulating virus; thus, they face an increased risk of recurrent outbreaks. Intriguingly, our results suggest that after an outbreak, a farm requires proactive tasks, including reinforcing biosecurity, conducting serological and virus monitoring to check the sows immunity and to identify the animals exposed to PEDV, and improving the vaccination scheme and disinfection practices if needed.

This was a single-center cohort study evaluating outpatients with fever who received medical examination at Yokohama City University Hospital, prospectively registered between 9 February and 5 May 2020. We treated according to the computed tomography-first triage protocol. The primary outcome was efficacy of the computed tomography-first triage protocol for patients with fever in an outpatient clinic. Efficacy of the computed tomography-first triage protocol for outpatients with fever was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. We conducted additional analyses of the isolation time of feverish outpatients and final diagnoses. In total, 108 consecutive outpatients with fever were examined at our hospital. Using the computed tomography-first triage protocol, 48 (44.9%) patients were classified as suspected Coronavirus disease 2019. Nine patients (18.8%) in this group were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using polymerase chain reaction; no patients in the group considered less likely to have Coronavirus disease 2019 tested positive for the virus. The protocol significantly shortened the duration of isolation for the not-suspected versus the suspected group (70.5 vs 1037.0 minutes, P < .001). Our computed tomography-first triage protocol was acceptable for screening patients with suspected Coronavirus disease 2019. This protocol will be helpful for appropriate triage, especially in areas where polymerase chain reaction is inadequate.","output":"Real-world evaluation of a computed tomography-first triage strategy for suspected Coronavirus disease 2019 in outpatients in Japan: An observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY Amidst the continuing spread of COVID-19, real-time data analysis and visualization remain critical the general public to track the pandemic's impact and to inform policy making by officials. Multiple metrics permit the evaluation of the spread, infection, and mortality of infectious diseases. For example, numbers of new cases and deaths provide easily interpretable measures of absolute impact within a given population and time frame, while the effective reproduction rate provides an epidemiological measure of the rate of spread. By evaluating multiple metrics concurrently, users can leverage complementary insights into the impact and current state of the pandemic when formulating prevention and safety plans for oneself and others. We describe COVID-19 Spread Mapper, a unified framework for estimating and quantifying the uncertainty in the smoothed daily effective reproduction number, case rate, and death rate in a region using log-linear models. We apply this framework to characterize COVID-19 impact at multiple geographic resolutions, including by US county and state as well as by country, demonstrating the variation across resolutions and the need for harmonized efforts to control the pandemic. We provide an open-source online dashboard for real-time analysis and visualization of multiple key metrics, which are critical to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and make informed policy decisions.

We previously reported that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and the cortex actin, which can be targeted by therapeutic agents identified by conventional drug repurposing screens. However, this drug identification strategy requires laborious library screening, which is time-consuming and often limited number of compounds can be screened. As an alternative approach, we developed and trained a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based classification model using information extracted from experimentally identified HSPG and actin inhibitors. This method allowed us to virtually screen 170,000 compounds, resulting in 2000 potential hits. A hit confirmation assay with the uptake of a fluorescently labeled HSPG cargo further shortlisted 256 active compounds. Among them, 16 compounds had modest to strong inhibitory activities against the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles into Vero E6 cells.

In this study, we validated and further refined formulas for estimating partial pressure of carbon dioxide with respiratory gas and pulse oximetry data in mechanically ventilated cardiac arrest patients. METHODS A total of 4,741 data sets were collected retrospectively from 233 resuscitated patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. The original formula used to analyze the data is PaCO2 -est1= PETCO2 +k[(PIO2 -PETCO2 ) -PaO2 ]. To achieve better accuracy, we further modified the formula to PaCO2 -est2= k1 *PETCO2 + k2 *(PIO2 -PETCO2 )+k3 *(100-SpO2 ). The coefficients were determined by identifying the minimal difference between the measured and calculated arterial carbon dioxide values in a development set. The accuracy of these two methods was compared with the estimation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide using end-tidal carbon dioxide. RESULTS With PaCO2 -est1, the mean difference between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and the estimated carbon dioxide was 0.08 kPa (SE  0.003); with PaCO2 -est2 the difference was 0.036 kPa (SE  0.009). The mean difference between the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and end-tidal carbon dioxide was 0.72 kPa (SE  0.01). In a mixed linear model, there was a significant difference between the estimation using end-tidal carbon dioxide and PaCO2 -est1 (p<0.001) and PaCO2 -est2 (p<0.001), respectively.

Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on the cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses. IMPORTANCE Widespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. NAb responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virological, immunological, and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization.

Recent in vitro and electronic health record (EHR) studies suggested that certain allergy medications could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We sought to carefully examine the potential selection bias associated with utilizing EHRs in these settings. Methods: We analyzed associations of three allergy medications (cetirizine, diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine) with testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, measuring the potential effect of selection bias on these associations. We used a retrospective cohort of EHR data from 230,376 patients (18 years+) who visited outpatient clinicians in a single, large academic center at least once but were never hospitalized (10/1/2019-6/1/2020). Main exposures included EHR documentation of three allergy medications and allergy, with an intermediate outcome of receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 test, and the primary outcome as testing negative. Findings: SARS-CoV-2 testing rates varied by sex, age, race/ethnicity and insurance. Increasing age and public insurance were associated with a higher adjusted odds of test negativity, while being Black or Hispanic was significantly associated with test positivity. Allergy diagnosis and use of any of three allergy medications were each associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a test (e.g. diphenhydramine - Odds Ratio (OR) 2.99, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.73, 3.28; cetirizine 1.75 (95% CI 1.60, 1.92)). Among those tested, only use of diphenhydramine was associated with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test (adjusted OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.10, 4.55). However, analyses revealed that selection bias may be responsible for the apparent protective effect of diphenhydramine. Interpretation: Diphenhydramine use was associated with more SARS-CoV-2 testing and subsequent higher odds for negative tests. While EHR-based observational studies can inform a need for interventional trials, this study revealed limitations of EHR data. The finding that diphenhydramine documentation conferred a higher odds of testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 must be interpreted with caution due to probable selection bias.Abbreviations: SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, COVID-19, EHR.","output":"The influence of selection bias on identifying an association between allergy medication use and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which began as an outbreak in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly across the globe.

They have evolved in concert with their hosts and are usually associated with symptomless infections. Mycoviruses are transmitted intracellularly during cell division, sporogenesis and cell fusion, and they lack an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Their natural host ranges are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups. Typically, fungal viruses are isometric particles 25C50 nm in diameter, and possess dsRNA genomes. The best characterized of these belong to the family Totiviridae whose members have simple undivided dsRNA genomes comprised of a coat protein (CP) gene and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) gene. A recently characterized totivirus infecting a filamentous fungus was found to be more closely related to protozoan totiviruses than to yeast totiviruses suggesting these viruses existed prior to the divergence of fungi and protozoa. Although the dsRNA viruses at large are polyphyletic, based on RDRP sequence comparisons, the totiviruses are monophyletic. The theory of a cellular self-replicating mRNA as the origin of totiviruses is attractive because of their apparent ancient origin, the close relationships among their RDRPs, genome simplicity and the ability to use host proteins efficiently. Mycoviruses with bipartite genomes (partitiviruses), like the totiviruses, have simple genomes, but the CP and RDRP genes are on separate dsRNA segments. Because of RDRP sequence similarity, the partitiviruses are probably derived from a totivirus ancestor. The mycoviruses with unencapsidated dsRNA-like genomes (hypoviruses) and those with bacilliform (+) strand RNA genomes (barnaviruses) have more complex genomes and appear to have common ancestry with plant (+) strand RNA viruses in supergroup 1 with potyvirus and sobemovirus lineages, respectively. The La France isometric virus (LIV), an unclassified virus with multipartite dsRNA genome, is associated with a severe die-back disease of the cultivated mushroom.

It is important to characterize a virus at the nucleotide level to discover the viruss genomic sequence variations and similarities relative to other viruses that could have an impact on the functions of its genes and proteins. This entails a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the viral genomes of interest for preferred nucleotides, codon bias, nucleotide changes at the 3(rd) position (NT3s), synonymous codon usage and relative synonymous codon usage. In this study, the variations in the N proteins among 13 different coronaviruses (CoVs) were analysed at the nucleotide and amino acid levels in an attempt to reveal how these viruses adapt to their hosts relative to their preferred codon usage in the N genes. The results revealed that, overall, eighteen amino acids had different preferred codons and eight of these were over-biased. The N genes had a higher AT% over GC% and the values of their effective number of codons ranged from 40.43 to 53.85, indicating a slight codon bias. Neutrality plots and correlation analyses showed a very high level of GC3s/GC correlation in porcine epidemic diarrhea CoV (pedCoV), followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS CoV), porcine delta CoV (dCoV), bat CoV (bCoV) and feline CoV (fCoV) with r values 0.81, 0.68, -0.47, 0.98 and 0.58, respectively.

The standard work pattern of image analysis including quantification and reporting has become highly resource intensive and time consuming. Existence of a large number of datasets with digital echocardiography images and recent advent of AI technology have created an environment in which artificial intelligence (AI) solutions can be developed successfully to automate current manual workflow.

Contemporary AI applications are available for automation and advent in the image acquisition, analysis, reporting and education. AI solutions have been developed for both diagnostic and predictive tasks in echocardiography. Left ventricular function assessment and quantification have been most often performed. Performance of automated image view classification, image quality enhancement, cardiac function assessment, disease classification, and cardiac event prediction was overall good but most studies lack external evaluation.

To offer a scientific rebuttal to pandemic misinformation and disinformation, this study explored the impact of using the Panbio SARS-CoV-2 assay with conditions falling outside of manufacturer recommendations. Methods: Using Panbio, various water and food products, laboratory buffers, and SARS-CoV-2-negative clinical specimens were tested, with and without manufacturer buffer. Additional experiments were conducted to assess the role of each Panbio buffer component (tricine, NaCl, pH, and tween-20), as well as the impact of temperatures (4{degrees}C, 20{degrees}C , and 45{degrees}C) and humidity (90%) on assay performance. Results: Direct sample testing (without the kit buffer), resulted in false positive signals resembling those obtained with SARS-CoV-2-positive controls tested under proper conditions. The likely explanation of these artifacts is non-specific interactions between the SARS-CoV-2-specific conjugated and capture antibodies, as proteinase K treatment abrogated this phenomenon, and thermal shift assays showed pH-induced conformational changes under conditions promoting artifact formation. Omitting, altering, and reverse engineering the kit buffer all supported the importance of maintaining buffering capacity, ionic strength, and pH for accurate kit function.

While these societal changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19Crelated depression and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United States. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants anxiety and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text messages. METHODS: We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used 2-tailed paired t tests to detect changes in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later. RESULTS: The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an average reduction of C1.72 (95% CI C2.35 to C1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and C0.48 (95% CI C0.71 to C0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during the 60-day intervention period. Text messaging interventions could serve as an important public health tool for disseminating strategies to manage mental health.

We report the clinical characteristics and the short-term outcomes in patients with end-stage renal disease who require hospitalization for coronavirus disease-19 and who underwent hemodialysis. Methods: In this retrospective, observational, single-center study, we analyzed the clinical course and outcomes of 116 consecutive end-stage kidney disease patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease-19 who underwent at least 1 hemodialysis session in our hospital between June 26 and August 10, 2020. Baseline clinical features, laboratory data, and treatment given were compared between survivors and non-survivors to identify risk factors associated with mortality. Results: Among the 116 patients who were enrolled in our study, males constituted 81% (n = 94). Many had underlying comorbidities, of which hypertension (90.4%) was the most common. The most common symptoms were fever (76.1%), dyspnoea (61.2%), cough (58.6%), and diarrhea (18.1%). In total, 66.4% of patients had arteriovenous fistula or grafts. Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and serum ferritin were significantly higher in non-survivors group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that dialysis vintage less than 6 months was the most important predictor for mortality. Mortality was 27.5% in our cohort. Conclusion: Mortality among hospitalized end-stage kidney disease patients who underwent hemodialysis was higher when compared to the general population.

We prospectively screened at-risk individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein antibodies in a POC setting to determine if it was a feasible method to identify antibody from prior infection. METHODS: Three EUA-approved lateral flow antibody assays were performed on POC finger-stick blood and compared with serum and a CLIA nucleocapsid antibody immunoassay. Variables including antibody class, time since PCR, and the assay antigen used were evaluated. RESULTS: 512 subjects enrolled, of which 104 had a COVID-19 history and positive PCR. Only three PCR-positive subjects required hospitalization, with one requiring mechanical ventilation. The POC results correlated well with the immunoassay (93-97% sensitivity) and using serum did not improve the sensitivity or specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Finger-stick, POC COVID-19 antibody testing was highly effective in identifying antibody resulting from prior infections in mildly symptomatic subjects. Using high-complexity serum immunoassays did not improve the screening outcome. Almost all individuals with COVID-19 infection produced detectable antibodies to the virus.

METHODS: Data for this study were gleaned from an electronic literature search using various databases PubMed and BioMed Central, Web of Science, etc. Key search words were gender DV during and after COVID-19. A total of 68 records were identified during the search. However, only 46 of these sources met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: From the review done in selected African countries which include Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Zimbabwe; it was discovered that COVID-19 lockdown across these countries worsens the already existing cases of DV. The study also noted that generally, the response of the government has been very poor in terms of dealing with DV cases in the period of COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSION: The study concluded that despite the failures of government in tackling the DV pandemics, NGOs have been very active in championing the cause of those violated while also trying to provide succour to victims. Thus, the study recommended that countries in Africa need to join international initiatives in prioritising DV cases while trying to deal with the virus itself.

Commonly, the ribosome interacts with an mRNA secondary structure that promotes -1 frameshifting on a homopolymeric slippery sequence. Recently, we described an unusual -2 frameshifting (-2 PRF) signal directing efficient expression of a transframe protein [nonstructural protein 2TF (nsp2TF)] of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from an alternative reading frame overlapping the viral replicase gene. Unusually, this arterivirus PRF signal lacks an obvious stimulatory RNA secondary structure, but as confirmed here, can also direct the occurrence of -1 PRF, yielding a third, truncated nsp2 variant named \\"nsp2N.\\" Remarkably, we now show that both -2 and -1 PRF are transactivated by a protein factor, specifically a PRRSV replicase subunit (nsp1). Embedded in nsp1's papain-like autoproteinase domain, we identified a highly conserved, putative RNA-binding motif that is critical for PRF transactivation. The minimal RNA sequence required for PRF was mapped within a 34-nt region that includes the slippery sequence and a downstream conserved CCCANCUCC motif. Interaction of nsp1 with the PRF signal was demonstrated in pull-down assays. These studies demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that a protein can function as a transactivator of ribosomal frameshifting. The newly identified frameshifting determinants provide potential antiviral targets for arterivirus disease control and prevention. Moreover, protein-induced transactivation of frameshifting may be a widely used mechanism, potentially including previously undiscovered viral strategies to regulate viral gene expression and/or modulate host cell translation upon infection.","output":"Transactivation of programmed ribosomal frameshifting by a viral protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Studies reporting SBRT outcomes in oligometastatic patients with adrenal gland metastases (AGM) are limited.

Among CORE patients, those treated with SBRT for AGM were included. Clinical and dosimetric data were collected. Adrenal metastatic burden (AMB) was defined as the sum of all adrenal GTV if more than one oligometastases is present.Competing risk analysis was used to estimate actuarial cumulative local recurrence (LR) and widespread progression (WP). Kaplan-Meier method was used to report overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Treatment related toxicities were also reported. Results: The analysis included 47 patients with 57 adrenal lesions. Median follow-up was 18.2 months. Median LRFS, PFS, and OS were 15.3, 5.3, and 19.1 months, respectively. A minimum PTV dose BED10 > 46 Gy was associated with an improved OS and LRFS. A prescribed BED10 > 70 Gy was an independent predictor of a lower LR probability.

Design Data were from the Well-Being and Experiences study (The WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample of older adolescents and young adults collected from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada from 2017 to 2020 (n = 664). Setting The study setting was a community-based observational longitudinal study. Participants Participants for the study were aged 14 to 17 years old at baseline in 2016-17 (n = 1000). Data were also collected on one parent/caregiver. Waves 2 (n = 747) and 3 (n = 664) were collected in 2019 and 2020, respectively.

In the context of academic meetings and conferences, there is the growing need for a set of guidelines secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the growing environmental and economic challenges that large academic and medical conferences face. These Virtual Meetings Best Practices were established in response to the scant evidence and guidance on the topic. METHODS: These best practice guidelines were developed from a scoping review of peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and lay literature. MEDLINE and Embase databases were scoped for relevant, non-duplicate articles. For lay articles, Google searches were utilized. The recommendations that comprise this document are a compilation of nonexperimental descriptive studies (e.g. case studies) and expert committee reports, opinions and/or experience of respected authorities, and lay articles. RESULTS: We identified four phases of the meeting cycle: Pre-planning considerations, Planning, Accomplishing conference goals through execution, gauging Response and Engaging the target audience for future cycles (PrePARE). Akin to the Plan, Do, Study, Act Cycle of quality improvement interventions, this document is meant to drive meaningful initial and subsequent interventions in the meetings of the medical and academic community. This covers actions and preparation for registration, scheduling, speakers, attendees, event type, technology, monetization/marketing, dealing with disruptions, post-event deliverables, response and engagement strategies. Enhanced access to integrated, high-quality and efficient virtual meetings will establish a new norm as an effective alternative for innovative health research, education and information dissemination in orthopaedics and beyond. CONCLUSIONS: Given the uncertainty of whether large in-person gatherings will be permitted, advisable or responsible later into the summer of 2020 and beyond, these guidelines will aid events being converted and scheduled as virtual-only meetings. As we move forward in the era of increased utility and utilization of virtual conferencing, these guidelines will serve as a benchmark and standard for surgeons in the field.

While not as well studied in the natural reservoirs, the pro-inflammatory response and viral replication appear controlled and show no obvious pathology. In contrast, infection in humans results in an initial high viral load marked by an aggressive pro-inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm. The key difference in the course of the infection between the reservoir and human host is the inflammatory response. In this investigation, we apply a simple two-component differential equation model for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses and a detailed mathematical analysis to identify specific regions in parameter space for single stable endemic equilibrium, bistability or periodic solutions. The extensions of the deterministic model to two stochastic models account for variability in responses seen at the cell (local) or tissue (global) levels. Numerical solutions of the stochastic models exhibit outcomes that are typical of a chronic infection in the natural reservoir or a cytokine storm in human infection. In the chronic infection, occasional flare-ups between high and low responses occur when model parameters are in a region of bistability or periodic solutions. The cytokine storm with a vigorous pro-inflammatory response and less vigorous anti-inflammatory response occurs in the parameter region for a single stable endemic equilibrium with a strong pro-inflammatory response. The results of the model analyses and the simulations are interpreted in terms of the functional role of the cytokines and the inflammatory responses seen in infection of the natural reservoir or of the human host.","output":"Models of cytokine dynamics in the inflammatory response of viral zoonotic infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus which is the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic since the end of 2019 has undergone many mutations that gave rise to several variants of concern (VOC) with higher transmission virulence and ability to evade the immune system than the initial variant (wild-type). Until now there are four variants included in the VOC of the virus namely alpha beta gamma and delta variants. The increased transmission and virulence of these VOCs were associated with mutational changes in the spike protein which is the structure of the virus that plays a role in binding to host cells. In this article we conduct a literature review on VOCs from the SARS-CoV-2 virus related to mutations that occur and their impact on the viral binding process. To gain an understanding of the impact of mutations in these variants we also reviewed the structure of the spike protein and the process of viral entry into host cells.

To clarify the origin of this pollution, we studied air concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), NO2, O3, PM10, SO2, and CO in Beijing, Hengshui and Baoding during the lockdown period from January 24 to 29, 2020. Variations of PM2.5 composition in inorganic ions, elemental carbon and organic matter were also investigated. The HYSPLIT model was used to calculate backward trajectories and concentration weighted trajectories. Results of the cluster trajectory analysis and model simulations show that the severe haze was caused mainly by the emissions of northeastern non-stopping industries located in Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Hebei, and Tianjin. In Beijing, Hengshui and Baoding, the mixing layer heights were about 30% lower and the maximum relative humidity was 83% higher than the annual averages, and the average wind speeds were lower than 1.5 m s?1. The concentrations of NO3?, SO42?, NH4+, organics and K+ were the main components of PM2.5 in Beijing and Hengshui, while organics, K+, NO3?, SO42?, and NH4+ were the main components of PM2.5 in Baoding.

Many mathematical models have been developed to understand and predict the infectiousness of COVID-19. We aim to summarize these models to inform efforts to manage the current outbreak. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, Preprints, and National Knowledge Infrastructure (Chinese database) for relevant studies published between 1 December 2019 and 21 February 2020. References were screened for additional publications. Crucial indicators were extracted and analysed. We also built a mathematical model for the evolution of the epidemic in Wuhan that synthesised extracted indicators. Results: Fifty-two articles involving 75 mathematical or statistical models were included in our systematic review. The overall median basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.78C5.13], which dropped to a controlled reproduction number (Rc) of 1.88 (IQR 1.41C2.24) after city lockdown. The median incubation and infectious periods were 5.90 (IQR 4.78C6.25) and 9.94 (IQR 3.93C13.50) days, respectively. The median case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.9% (IQR 2.3C5.4%). Our mathematical model showed that, in Wuhan, the peak time of infection is likely to be March 2020 with a median size of 98,333 infected cases (range 55,225C188,284). The earliest elimination of ongoing transmission is likely to be achieved around 7 May 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis found a sustained Rcand prolonged incubation/ infectious periods, suggesting COVID-19 is highly infectious. Although interventions in China have been effective in controlling secondary transmission, sustained global efforts are needed to contain an emerging pandemic. Alternative interventions can be explored using modelling studies to better inform policymaking as the outbreak continues.","output":"Spread and impact of COVID-19 in China: A systematic review and synthesis of predictions from transmission-dynamic models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Medical Leadership Competency Framework encourages both medical students and clinicians to actively engage in medical leadership and management (MLM) opportunities. The framework highlights that student-led societies are one way of achieving this objective. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of social media became paramount in actively engaging users to the field of MLM topics. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a social media approach in actively engaging medical students and clinicians to MLM topics.At the start of the 2020/21 academic year, the Birmingham Medical Leadership Society (BMLS) selected two medical students onto their committee with experience of social media management and building a large virtual following. They ensured regular social media posting with posters/video advertisements for all the MLM events BMLS were hosting virtually throughout the year. Platforms used were Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. In addition, hashtags were used across all platforms (e.g. #MedTwitter, #medicalstudents, #medicalleadership, etc) to try to capture a large audience via algorithms. Social media analytics were then compared to the 2019/20 academic year.In total across all four social media accounts, BMLS had a total of 22,159 viewers in the academic year 2020/21 (489.3% increase). The Facebook BMLS MLM content had a total of 10,215 viewers in the academic year 2020/21, compared to 2344 in 2019/20 (336.9% increase) and 656 followers.

This study examined students and teachers perceptions of the effectiveness of emergency remote online teaching. Method: An online cross-sectional survey was administered on the perception of the online learning environment and challenges experienced and effectiveness of strategies used. Overall thirty-three dental students and eleven clinical academic teachers participated. The questionnaire was emailed to the participants for data collection and they responded by using a Likert scale. Reliability of the questionnaire was determined.

This study aimed to explore the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming (MD)-an addictive mental behavior to vivid fantasy associated with distress and functional impairment-and forced COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and quarantine. Previous literature indicated that individuals employ MD for the regulation of distress and boredom, wish fulfillment, and entertainment experiences. The literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health identifies a flareup in psychological difficulties in the general population. In this study we explored the associations between the pandemic threat and mental health indices among individuals with MD. We surveyed 1,565 adults from over 70 countries who responded to calls for participants posted in online MD communities and other general social media sites. Probable MD was determined based on an empirically derived cut-off score on a pertinent measure. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, a series of MANCOVAs, followed by post-hoc ANCOVAs, revealed that individuals with probable MD who were observing lockdown restrictions reported having spent more time in fantasy, experienced more intense and vivid daydreaming, and had a stronger urge to daydream than other participants. Similar statistical procedures indicated that, individuals with probable MD who reported pre-existing anxiety and depression disorders described a greater urge to daydream due to the pandemic and greater difficulty to control this addictive behavior. Compared to individuals with likely normal daydreaming, individuals with suspected MD reported more pandemic-attributed deterioration on a wide array of psychological distress indices. Our data show that the current worldwide pandemic threat is connected with an elevated intensity of this addictive form of mental activity, and that MD is associated with the exacerbation of psychological distress and dysfunction rather than with beneficial regulation of the experienced stressor.","output":"Heightened Levels of Maladaptive Daydreaming Are Associated With COVID-19 Lockdown, Pre-existing Psychiatric Diagnoses, and Intensified Psychological Dysfunctions: A Multi-country Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Screening of ligands that can bind to biologic products of in vitro expression systems typically requires some purification of the expressed biologic target.

Nursing home residents, who often exhibit atypical signs and symptoms, are at increased risk of infection and unplanned admissions, which account for 65% of all bed days, and cost the US healthcare economy more than a trillion dollars a year. Evidence suggests that the current workforce in South Africa receive limited training in this area and are largely unprepared to meet the demands of the aging population. Building the capacity and skills of the workforce in South Africa is one approach that could help to improve the early detection of infection and assist the nursing home workforce to provide more effective and timely care, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Our study aimed to investigate clinical features of Staphylococcus aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia (SA-VAP) and, if bronchoalveolar lavage samples were available, lung bacterial community features in ICU patients with or without COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across two medical ICUs of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy), who developed SA-VAP between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020 (thereafter referred to as cases). After 1:2 matching based on the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, cases were compared with SA-VAP patients without COVID-19 (controls). Clinical, microbiological, and lung microbiota data were analyzed. RESULTS: We studied two groups of patients (40 COVID-19 and 80 non-COVID-19). COVID-19 patients had a higher rate of late-onset (87.5% versus 63.8%; p = 0.01), methicillin-resistant (65.0% vs 27.5%; p < 0.01) or bacteremic (47.5% vs 6.3%; p < 0.01) infections compared with non-COVID-19 patients. No statistically significant differences between the patient groups were observed in ICU mortality (p = 0.12), clinical cure (p = 0.20) and microbiological eradication (p = 0.31). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, SAPS II and initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy were independently associated with ICU mortality. Then, lung microbiota characterization in 10 COVID-19 and 16 non-COVID-19 patients revealed that the overall microbial community composition was significantly different between the patient groups (unweighted UniFrac distance, R(2) 0.15349; p < 0.01). Species diversity was lower in COVID-19 than in non COVID-19 patients (94.4  44.9 vs 152.5  41.8; p < 0.01). Interestingly, we found that S. aureus (log(2) fold change, 29.5), Streptococcus anginosus subspecies anginosus (log(2) fold change, 24.9), and Olsenella (log(2) fold change, 25.7) were significantly enriched in the COVID-19 group compared to the nonCCOVID-19 group of SA-VAP patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, COVID-19 seemed to significantly affect microbiological and clinical features of SA-VAP as well as to be associated with a peculiar lung microbiota composition.

In this experimental study, we were able to replicate earlier findings by demonstrating that listeners (N = 107) showed significantly more willingness to interact with, more social support towards, and a more positive attitude towards coherent than incoherent narrators. Remarkably, these beneficial effects of coherence were observed only for narratives about positive memories. Results are explained in the light of the relevance of positive memories for the social bonding function of autobiographical memory. Furthermore, earlier work was extended and refined by investigating effects of the individual constituting dimensions of coherence (context, chronology, theme) on social responses. In line with our predictions, the dimensions of chronology and theme were most important in impacting social responses of listeners. Possibly a reduction of the attraction effect due to increased effortful processing and reduced credibility due to insufficient emotional elaboration might explain these results respectively. Furthermore, social responses were worse when narratives were incoherent with regard to more than one dimension, in line with the expected additive effect. Overall, fully incoherent narratives, which had had low scores on context, chronology, and theme, had the most adverse effect on listeners' social responses. This study adds significantly to the domain of memory and cognition by showing how cognitive psychological research would benefit from extending a merely intrapersonal perspective to include an interpersonal perspective that considers social implications of memory and cognition as well.","output":"Be coherent and become heard: The multidimensional impact of narrative coherence on listeners' social responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public agenda constantly include the topics of sound local finances and promoting regional development, especially in the context of the government's efforts to ensure a sustainable path of economic growth.

In this context, we recently performed in silico testing of a novel closed-loop fluid management system that is designed for cardiac output and pulse pressure variation monitoring and optimization. The goal of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of this newly developed system in optimizing hemodynamic variables in an in vivo surgical setting. METHODS Sixteen Yorkshire pigs underwent a 2-phase hemorrhage protocol and were resuscitated by either the Learning Intravenous Resuscitator closed-loop system or an anesthesiologist. Median hemodynamic values and variation of hemodynamics were compared between groups. RESULTS Cardiac index (in liters per minute per square meter) and stroke volume index (in milliliters per square meter) were higher in the closed-loop group compared with the anesthesiologist group over the protocol (3.7 [3.4-4.1] vs 3.5 [3.2-3.9]; 95% Wald confidence interval, -0.5 to -0.23; P < 0.0005 and 40 [34-45] vs 36 [31-38]; 95% Wald confidence interval, -5.9 to -3.1; P < 0.0005, respectively). There was no significant difference in total fluid administration between the closed-loop and anesthesiologist groups (3685 [3230-4418] vs 3253 [2735-3926] mL; 95% confidence interval, -1651 to 431; P = 0.28).

We aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of a major care home outbreak in Denmark. METHODS After a staff member had been tested positive on 16 November 2020, a bundle approach programme was initiated including frequent surveillance screenings of residents and staff, isolation and cohorting procedures. This approach also involved limiting the number of visitors and enhancing the use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Available positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic relationships between the outbreak and local circulating strains were reconstructed. RESULTS In all, 50% (56/114) of residents and 26% (49/190) of staff members became infected during the 46-day outbreak period. Altogether 16% of the infected residents died within 30 days after becoming infected. A total of 44% (46/105) of the samples with SARS-CoV-2 were sequenced. and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a dominant outbreak lineage belonging to Global Lineage B.1.1.29 containing the mutation I233V in the S gene. The outbreak lineage was detected in the community 28 days before its introduction into the care home. CONCLUSIONS Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes is associated with severe outbreaks. Initiation of a bundle approach infection control programme in addition to measures ensuring enhanced herd immunity were successful in controlling the outbreak.

The risk of depression in a person with diabetes is approximately twice that of a person without this disease. Depression has a major impact on patient well-being and control of diabetes. However, despite the availability of effective and specific therapeutic interventions for the treatment of depression in people with diabetes, 50% of patients do not receive psychological treatment due to insufficient and difficult accessibility to psychological therapies in health systems. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has therefore been proposed as a useful tool for the delivery of psychological interventions, but it continues to be a field in which scientific evidence is recent and controversial. This systematic review aims to update the available information on the efficacy of psychological interventions delivered through ICTs to improve depressive symptomatology in patients with diabetes. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed following the PRISMA guidelines and using MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases to search for randomized clinical trials of eHealth treatments for patients with diabetes and comorbid depression from 1995 through 2020. In addition, studies related to follow-up appointments were identified. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) randomized clinical trials (RCTs); (b) patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes; (c) adult population over 18 years of age; (d) presence of depressive symptomatology assessed with standardized instruments; (e) treatments for depression based on established psychotherapeutic techniques and principles; (f) delivered through eHealth technologies. We did not limit severity of depressive symptomatology, delivery setting or comparison group (treatment as usual or other treatment). Two coauthors independently reviewed the publications identified for inclusion and extracted data from the included studies. A third reviewer was involved to discuss discrepancies found. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the RCTs. No meta-analysis of the results was performed. The protocol used for this review is available in PROSPERO (Reg; CRD42020180405). Results: The initial search identified 427 relevant scientific publications. After removing duplicates and ineligible citations, a total of 201 articles were analyzed in full text. Ten articles met the criteria of this review and were included, obtaining very good scientific quality after evaluation with the PEDro scale. The main results show that the eHealth psychological intervention for depression in patients with diabetes showed beneficial effects both at the end of treatment and in the short (3 months) and long term (6 and 12 months) for the improvement of depressive symptomatology. The methodology used (type of diabetes, eHealth technology used, recruitment context, implementation and follow-up) was very heterogeneous. However, all studies were based on cognitive-behavioral tools and used standardized assessment instruments to evaluate depressive symptomatology or diagnosis of MDD. Glycemic control was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin, but no benefits were found in improving glycemic control. Only four studies included psychoeducational content on diabetes and depression, but none used tools to improve or enhance adherence to medical prescriptions or diabetes self-care. Conclusions: ICT-based psychological interventions for the treatment of depression in people with diabetes appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptomatology but do not appear to provide significant results with regard to glycemic control. Nonetheless, the scientific evidence reported to date is still very limited and the methodology very diverse. In addition, no studies have implemented these systems in routine clinical practice, and no studies are available on the economic analysis of these interventions. Future research should focus on studying and including new tools to ensure improvements in diabetes outcomes and not only on psychological well-being in order to advance knowledge about these treatments. Economic evaluations should also be undertaken to analyze whether these treatment programs implemented using eHealth technologies are cost-effective.","output":"Effectiveness of eHealth-Based Psychological Interventions for Depression Treatment in Patients With Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An on-site detection strategy is reported based on dual-color SiO2@quantum dot (QD)-integrated lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) strip to realize the quantitative and simultaneous detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) in serum.

METHODS: We used the New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science platform to analyze global NSI research (n = 2987 articles) over the past 115 years using the Web of Science and parameters such as global versus country-specific research activities, semi-qualitative issues, and socioeconomic figures. RESULTS: Density-equalizing mapping showed that although a total of n = 106 countries participated in NSI research, large parts of Africa and South America were almost invisible regarding global participation in NSI research. Average citation rate (cr) analysis indicated a high rate for Switzerland (cr = 25.1), Italy (cr = 23.5), and Japan (cr = 19.2). Socioeconomic analysis revealed that the UK had the highest quotient Q(GDP) of 0.13 NSI-specific publications per bill. US-$ gross domestic product (GDP), followed by South Africa (Q(GDP) = 0.12).

METHODS: Adults from the United States with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the ArthritisPower Patient-Powered Research Network and CreakyJoints patient community completed surveys. Concerns and behaviors were compared among patients with different autoimmune conditions, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) use, and geographic measures of urban status, income, education, and COVID-19 activity. RESULTS: Among 1,517 participants (925 RA, 299 PsA, 185 AS, 108 SLE), mean age was 55.1 years, 88.3% were female, and 89.5% white. COVID-19 concerns were similar across the country and were higher in biologic users (p < 0.001). Avoidance of doctor's office visits (56.6%) or laboratory testing (42.3%) and use of telehealth (29.5%) were more common in urban areas. Among participants on DMARDs without COVID-19 or other respiratory illness, 14.9% stopped a DMARD, with 78.7% of DMARD interruptions not recommended by a physician. DMARD stopping was more common participants with lower socioeconomic status and in participants who avoided an office visit [OR 1.46(1.04-2.04)] or reported lack of telehealth availability [OR 2.26(1.25-4.08)]. CONCLUSION: In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with RA, PsA, AS, and SLE frequently avoided office visits and laboratory testing.

A strict lockdown from early 2021 combined with an aggressive vaccination programme enabled a gradual easing of lockdown measures to be introduced whilst both deaths and reported case numbers reduced to less than 3% of their peak. The emergence of the Delta variant in April 2021 has reversed this trend, and the UK is once again experiencing surging cases, albeit with reduced average severity due to the success of the vaccination rollout. This study presents the results of a modelling exercise which simulates the progression of the pandemic in the UK through projection of daily case numbers as lockdown lifts. Methods: A simulation model based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered structure was built. A timeline of UK lockdown measures was used to simulate the changing restrictions. The model was tailored for the UK, with some values set based on research and others obtained through calibration against 16 months of historical data. Results: The model projects that if lockdown restrictions are lifted in July 2021, UK COVID-19 cases will peak at hundreds of thousands daily in most viable scenarios, reducing in late 2021 as immunity acquired through both vaccination and infection reduces the susceptible population percentage. Further lockdown measures can be used to reduce daily cases. Other than the ever-present threat of the emergence of new variants, the most significant unknown factors affecting the profile of the pandemic in the UK are the length and strength of immunity, with daily peak cases over 50% higher if immunity lasts 8 months compared to 12 months. Another significant factor is the percentage of unreported cases. The reduced case severity associated with vaccination may lead to a higher proportion of unreported mild or asymptomatic cases, meaning that unmanaged infections resulting from unknown cases will continue to be a major source of infection. Conclusions: Further research into the length and strength of both recovered and vaccinated COVID-19 immunity is critical to delivering more accurate projections from models, thus enabling more finely tuned policy decisions. The model presented in this article, whilst by no means perfect, aims to contribute to greater transparency of the modelling process, which can only increase trust between policy makers, journalists and the general public.","output":"COVID-19 Case Rates in the UK: Modelling Uncertainties as Lockdown Lifts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rotavirus C (RVC) has been detected increasingly in humans and swine in different countries, including the US. It is associated with significant economic losses due to diarrheal disease in nursing piglets. In this study we aimed: (1) to determine the prevalence of RVC in healthy and diarrheic suckling piglets on US farms; and (2) to evaluate if maternal antibody (Ab) levels were associated with protection of newborn suckling piglets against RVC. There was a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.0002) of litters with diarrhea born to gilts compared with those born to multiparous sows. Of 113 nursing piglet fecal samples tested, 76.1% were RVC RNA positive. Fecal RVC RNA was detected in significantly (p = 0.0419) higher quantities and more frequently in piglets with diarrhea compared with healthy ones (82.5 vs. 69.9%). With the exception of the historic strain Cowden (G1 genotype), field RVC strains do not replicate in cell culture, which is a major impediment for studying RVC pathogenesis and immunity. To circumvent this, we generated RVC virus-like particles (VLPs) for Cowden (G1), RV0104 (G3) and RV0143 (G6) and used them as antigens in ELISA to detect swine RVC Abs in serum and milk from the sows. Using RVC-VLP Ab ELISA we demonstrated that sows with diarrheic litters had significantly lower RVC IgA and IgG Ab titers in milk compared to those with healthy litters.

The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment. AIM: Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. POPULATION: 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled. METHODS: A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed. RESULTS: Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources.

Blinded to the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing, lung ultrasound (LUS) examinations and chest computed tomography (CT) were performed, and the specific characteristics of these imaging studies were assessed. METHODS From March 15, 2020, to April 15, 2020, 63 consecutive patients were enrolled in this prospective pilot study. All patients underwent hematochemical tests, LUS examinations, chest CT, and confirmatory rRT-PCR. The diagnostic performance of LUS and chest CT was calculated with rRT-PCR as a reference. The interobserver agreement of radiologists and ultrasound examiners was calculated. Ultrasound and CT features were compared to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Positive and negative likelihood ratios measured the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS Nineteen (30%) patients were COVID-19 negative, and 44 (70%) were positive. No differences in demographics and clinical data at presentation were observed among positive and negative patients. Interobserver agreement for CT had a  value of 0.877, whereas for LUS, it was 0.714. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of chest CT for COVID-19 pneumonia were 93%, 90%, 85%, and 95%, respectively; whereas for LUS, they were 68%, 79%, 88%, and 52%.

We determined a cutoff value for the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) during an ICU admission that could predict 28-day mortality of nondiabetic MODS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, outcome assessor blinded cohort design, we evaluated 82 such patients for fasting blood glucose (FBG)/insulin levels (FIL) during an ICU admission and followed their outcome for 28 days. The primary outcome variable was the HOMA-IR score calculated from the above variables. The statistical tool included receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden index, and correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 38 patients succumbed to their illness. The optimal cutoff value for HOMA-IR was 1.61 (area under curve: 0.684, sensitivity: 36.8%, specificity: 95.5%). The 28-day survival was significantly lower (p = 0.001) at HOMA-IR threshold 1.61 (odds ratio: 12.25, hazard ratio: 2.98). The mean HOMA-IR among survivors vs nonsurvivors was 0.76  0.61 and 1.38  1.14, respectively (p = 0.004). Except for FIL and FBG, HOMA-IR values did not correlate with any other baseline or outcome parameters (demographics, APACHE II/sequential organ failure assessment score, vasopressor needs, or ICU/hospital stay). On comparing these parameters across the HOMA-IR threshold, only FIL and the hospital stay varied significantly. Most of the outcome parameters, however, varied significantly among nonsurvivors vs survivors. CONCLUSION: The HOMA-IR is a significant predictor of mortality in MODS. Its cutoff value may assist in determining a reference range for critically ill patients. Its routine use in the light of other disease severity scores may serve in their better prognostication.

This variant contains up to 36 mutations in the spike protein, the target of neutralizing antibodies, and can escape vaccine-induced immunity. The third booster vaccination campaign began with healthcare workers and high-risk groups. The safety and immunogenicity of third booster vaccination against Omicrons remain unknown. Methods: In total, 272 healthcare workers were evaluated for their long-term safety and immunogenicity. Here, we established vaccine panels to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity against variants of concern (VOCs), including the Omicron variant, using a live virus microneutralization assay. Findings: Two-dose vaccination induced robust anti-spike antibodies and neutralization titers (NTs) against the ancestral strain WK-521, whereas NTs in VOCs were significantly decreased. Within 93-247 days of the second vaccine dose, NTs against Omicron were completely abolished in up to 80% of individuals among the vaccine panels. The third booster vaccination induced a robust increase in anti-spike antibodies and NTs against the WK-521, Delta, and Omicron variants. The breadth of humoral immunity and cross-reactivity with Omicron increased. The cytokine signature and adverse event rate remained unchanged after three dose vaccination.

The pathogenesis is most often revealed by pulmonary conditions, including acute thoracic syndrome, which is affecting the life expectancy of these populations. The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 33-year-old man with a history of homozygous SS homozygous sickle cell anemia who consulted on March 24, 2020 for febrile dyspnea 11 days after the onset of symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status worsened rapidly in the emergency room and then in ICU leading to severe ARDS requiring intubation, curarization, and venovenous ECMO. Hematologically, severe hemolysis associated with major thrombocytopenia without documented spinal cord injury was noted. Several transfusion exchanges are performed. The evolution was finally slowly favorable and led to discharge from the intensive care unit and then from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. In addition, from a therapeutic point of view, it advocates (1) a high preventive anticoagulation from the outset according to the level of D-dimers (2) the use of venovenous ECMO in this particular case, whereas this technique has had rather disappointing results in acute chest syndromes. (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2. It could be associated with marked hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary vascular vasodilation.","output":"Severe COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a sickle cell disease adult patient: case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The novel COVID-19 required many countries to impose public health measures that likely impacted the participation and mobility of community-dwelling older adults. This protocol details a multimethod cohort design undertaken to describe short-term and medium-term changes to the mobility and participation of older Canadians living in the community rather than retirement facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A longitudinal telephone (or online)-administered survey is being conducted with a random sample of older adults living within 20 km of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, identified from census dissemination areas. Baseline data collection of community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and over began in May 2020 with follow-ups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument and global rating of change anchors are the primary outcomes of interest. A subsample of respondents will participate in open-ended, semistructured interviews conducted over the telephone or through video-conference, to explore participants lived experiences with respect to their mobility and participation during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and quantitative approaches will be used to determine changes in mobility and social and personal participation, and associated personal and environmental factors. For the interviews, qualitative data will be analysed using descriptive phenomenology.

During the pandemic, half the globe's population have been placed under strict physical distancing orders and many long-term care facilities serving older adults went into lockdown mode, restricting access to all visitors, including family members. Before the pandemic emerged, a 2020 National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report warned of the underappreciated adverse effects of social isolation and loneliness on health, especially among older populations. Social isolation and loneliness predict all-cause mortality at rates that rival clinical risk factors, such as obesity and smoking; they are associated with greater incidence of psychological, cognitive, and physical morbidities. This paper sets forth a proposal to design robots to function as companions and friends for socially isolated and lonely older people during pandemic emergencies and in aging societies more generally. The proposal section presents and defends the proposal.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a known significant risk factor for mucormycosis. Here, we present our experience with rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) during the second wave of COVID-19 at a tertiary health care centre in North India. METHODS: This case series includes four cases of ROCM that were managed by our neurosurgical team in view ofcerebral involvement. RESULTS: All the cases with an exception of one (Case 1), had a history of treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. Case 2, 3 had undergone functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and orbital decompression before the onset of cerebral involvement; Case 4 underwent FESS and cranial surgery in the same sitting. All the patients had a history of DM and all the cases treated for COVID-19 pneumonia had a history of treatment with corticosteroids. Two patients underwent surgery with the exception of one patient, who did not provide consent for the same. One patient expired before surgical excision could be attempted. CONCLUSION: Regular and intensive follow-up is the key in swift detection and management of ROCM in post-COVID patients. While surgical excision is advisable in the fungal lesion, it must be borne in mind that radical excision of cerebral lesions is associated with morbidity, delayed recovery, and prolonged ICU stay. Culture and sensitivity-based antibiotics should be used judiciously as fever is a common postoperative complication. Blood sugar monitoring and control of DM are paramount in this condition.

A survey was conducted between April and July 2020 in four countries of the European Union-Estonia, Hungary, Portugal and Romania,-resulting in a relatively large sample of farmers (N = 421). The analysis was built on a semi-nonparametric approach. Approximately 19 percent of small-scale producers were able to increase sales during the first wave of the pandemic, although country-level variation was significant. Fruits and vegetables were by far the most popular products. The importance of specific channels varied across countries, but farm gate sales were among the most important marketing channels both before and during the first wave. The importance of channels that were based on digital resources and home delivery increased. Our evidence indicates that diversification was a strategy that paid off, both in terms of marketing channels and different product categories. However, the impact appears to be nonlinear; the initial advantage generated by diversification rapidly tapered off, either temporarily (in the case of products), or permanently (in the case of marketing channels).

Conventional LFAs, such as gold nanoparticle dyed assays, are limited to approximately five targets-the maximum number of test lines on an assay. To increase the information obtainable from each test line, we combined green and red emitting quantum dots (QDs) as labels for C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibodies in an optical duplex immunoassay. CdSe-QDs with sharp and tunable emission bands were used to simultaneously quantify CRP and IL-6 in a single test line, by using a single UV-light source and two suitable emission filters for readout through a widely available BioImager device. For image and data processing, a customized software tool, the MultiFlow-Shiny app was used to accelerate and simplify the readout process. The app software provides advanced tools for image processing, including assisted extraction of line intensities, advanced background correction and an easy workflow for creation and handling of experimental data in quantitative LFAs.

Recently, target-specific genetic manipulations are made possible to perform in combination with specific Cre-lines, albeit costly, labor-intensive and time consuming. Thus, alternative methods of gene manipulations to address important biological questions are highly desirable. In this study, we utilized in utero electroporation technique which involves efficient delivery of hindbrain-specific enhancer/promoter construct, Krox20 into the third ventricle of live mouse embryo to investigate green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression pattern in mouse auditory brainstem and other hindbrain neurons. RESULTS We created a GFP/DNA construct containing a Krox20 B enhancer and -globin promoter to drive GFP expression in the hindbrain via injection into the third ventricle of E12 to E13.5 mice. Electrical currents were applied directly to the embryonic hindbrain to allow DNA uptake into the cell. Confocal images were then acquired from fixed brain slices to analyze GFP expression in mouse whole brain at different postnatal stages (P6-P21). By using a cell-type specific enhancer as well as region specific injection and electroporation, robust GFP expression in the cerebellum and auditory brainstem but not in the forebrain was observed. GFP expression in calyx of Held terminals was more robust in <P15 compared to >P15 mice. In contrast, GFP expression in MNTB neurons was more prevalent in >P15 compared to <P15. In regards to the relative expression of GFP versus the synaptic marker Vglut1, percentage fluorescence GFP intensity in the calyx was higher in P11 to P15 than P6 to P10 and P16 to P21 groups. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, this technique would potentially allow hindbrain-specific genetic manipulations such as knock-down, knock-in and rescue experiments to unravel critical molecular substrates underpinning functional and morphological remodeling of synapses as well as understanding the pathophysiology of certain neurological disorders targeting not only the auditory brainstem but also other parts of hindbrain, most notably the cerebellum.","output":"Gene delivery in mouse auditory brainstem and hindbrain using in utero electroporation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This systematic review aimed to examine the impact of the corona virus pandemic on e-commerce that spreads throughout the world including Indonesia, causing panic and anxiety, making everyone fearful and anxious so as to form a protective attitude towards themselves and their families to avoid the plague by making purchases panic to meet the needs and desires that tend to be impulsive Methods: This research method compares the findings in the field, expert opinion, online news, newspapers, research results and journals that examine the corona virus in the world, especially in Indonesia Results: The factors that influence panic buying that tend to make impulsive buying are psychological factors, environmental factors, regulation, trust This can be seen from the attitude of consumers facing the covid-19 pandemic by making panic purchases that tend to be impulsive Conclusion:This analysis resulted in a panic buying concept that had never been studied before, either at Indonesia or abroad The pandemic currently striking the world is causing panic buying Large purchases are made by the public to anticipate a pandemic, which can actually have an impact on price fluctuations In addition, it can result in an empty product supply in the market because it has been bought up by the community in the face of a pandemic which in principle is based on their concept of being an economically capable community","output":"Emerging advances in E-commerce: Panic and impulse buying during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 made many countries impose restrictions in order to control its dangerous effect on the citizens.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (20 g per day for 3C5 days) was co-administered with corticosteroids. With the corticosteroid treatment, all patients achieved an abatement of fever within 1 day, and 78.6% (22/28) of the patients achieved radiological remission when evaluated about 3 days later. Only one (3.6%) patient progressed to severe COVID-19, and all patients recovered and were discharged without any sequela. The median time from illness onset to viral clearance was similar, as compared with 44 corticosteroid-untreated patients with relatively milder disease [18 (IQR 14.3C23.5) days vs. 17 (IQR, 12C20) days, p = 0.252]. When adjusted for age, sex, underlying comorbidities, baseline blood laboratory parameters, viral load, and chest radiological findings, the causal hazard ratio of corticosteroid treatment for the viral clearance was 0.79 (95%CI, 0.48C1.30, p = 0.34). Conclusion: Short-course and low-dose applications of corticosteroids, when co-administered with intravenous immunoglobulin, in non-severe COVID-19 patients during the stage of clinical deterioration may possibly prevent disease progression, while having a negligible impact on the viral clearance.","output":"Clinical Use of Short-Course and Low-Dose Corticosteroids in Patients With Non-severe COVID-19 During Pneumonia Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: While PCR has been recognized as one of the appropriate ways to diagnosis of infectious diseases, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which is a nucleic acid amplification method, can be considered as an alternative to PCR, and it is faster, cost-effective, and easier to perform than nested PCR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Keywords were searched in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. Keywords were PCR, LAMP, RAA, RPA, Virus and COVID-19. RESULTS: LAMP technology has been extensively applied for the detection of human pathogenic bacteria, crop pests, pathogenic organisms and components in meat products. A new isotheral method, Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), can amplify the DNA as well as RPA. RPA has benefited from isothermal PCR and both simplicity and rapid amplification. Recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay has been favorably used in the detection of bacterial and viral pathogens and solved the technical difficulties posed by DNA amplification methods because it does not need thermal denaturation of the template and employs at a low and constant temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, digital PCR, LAMP, nicking endonuclease amplification reaction, recombinase polymerase amplification, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats are different nucleic acid amplification tests of COVID-19. LAMP methods can be more specific than qPCR and immunoassays. The LAMP assay can be applied for rapid detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, because LAMP is a highly sensitive and specific DNA/RNA amplification technique.","output":"Different Methods for Molecular and Rapid Detection of Human Novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: No validated treatments have been identified for the COVID-19 pandemic virus; several are currently in randomized clinical trials. Diagnostic instruments are rapidly evolving. Symptoms range from those of a common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to sepsis arising from the flood of inflammatory bacterial and viral pathogens in the blood. Mortality generally arises from cytokine storms of uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, with secondary bacterial infection. To address the indisputably urgent need for therapeutics for COVID-19, a specialized interdisciplinary medical panel convened in Shanghai in March 2020 to consider all relevant clinical and experimental evidence on the possible utility of intravenous (IV) ascorbate in the treatment of COVID-19-related ARDS. METHODS: The panel convened multidisciplinary medical experts and reviewed all relevant in vitro, in vivo, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials on IV ascorbate and issued a consensus report on 23 March 2020 noting that substantial differences in serum concentrations of ascorbate are achieved through IV administration in contrast with the oral route. FINDINGS: The Shanghai panel, and a parallel medical group in Guangzhou, are advising the use of high-dose IV ascorbate for the treatment of ARDS, along with other supportive therapies, including Vitamin D and zinc. We report preliminary progress in using this treatment for 50 consecutive cases treated in Shanghai hospitals, consistent with earlier reports from a meta-analysis of the use of IV ascorbate to treat sepsis. We provide an instructive clinical anecdote regarding a single family where one elderly member with cardiac and other major comorbidities developed and survived ARDS-related sepsis following daily treatments that included 15 g of IV ascorbate. None of her adult caregivers who had ingested between 2 and 10 g of ascorbate daily developed COVID-19.","output":"Ascorbate as Prophylaxis and Therapy for COVID-19Update From Shanghai and U.S. Medical Institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structures of power and inequality shape day-to-day life for individuals who are poor, imposing waiting in multiple forms and for a variety of services, including for healthcare (Andaya, 2018a; Auyero, 2012; Strathmann and Hay, 2009). Constraints, such as the age requirements for Medicare, losing employer-provided health insurance, or the bureaucracy involved in filing for disability often require people to wait to follow recommendations for medical treatments. In 2016-2017, we conducted 52 narrative interviews in St. Louis, a city with significant racial and economic health inequities and without Medicaid expansion. We interviewed people with one or more chronic illnesses for which they were prescribed medication and who identified as having difficulties affording their prescriptions. Throughout the interviews, participants frequently recounted 1) experiences of waiting for care, along with other services, and 2) the range of strategies they utilized to manage the waiting. In this article, we develop the concept of active waiting to describe both the lived experiences of waiting for care and the responses that people devise to navigate, shorten, or otherwise endure waiting. Waiting is structured into healthcare and other social services at various scales in ways that reinforce feelings of marginalization, and also that require work on the part of those who wait. While much medical and public health research focuses on issues of diagnostic or treatment delay, we conclude that this conceptualization of active waiting provides a far more productive frame for accurately understanding the emotional and physical experiences of individuals who are disproportionately poor and made to wait for their care. Only with such understanding can we hope to build more just and compassionate social systems.","output":"Waiting for care: Chronic illness and health system uncertainties in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This prognostic study evaluates the use of plasma D-dimer concentrations to rule out pulmonary embolism among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","output":"D-Dimer Testing for the Exclusion of Pulmonary Embolism Among Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study was to compare the oral health attitudes and behaviors of medical and dental students/interns during the Corona pandemic in Saudi Arabia using Hiroshima University Dental Behavioral Inventory (HU-DBI).

The feasibility of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) rectosigmoid resection using TEM was evaluated in swine. Transgastric endoscopic assistance to extend transanal colon mobilization was also investigated. Full-thickness circumferential rectal dissection was performed and extended proximally. After maximal sigmoid mobilization, the specimen was exteriorized and transected, and the proximal colon was stapled to the distal rectum. In a subset of animals, transgastric endoscopic access was used to mobilize the colon further. RESULTS Rectosigmoid resection using TEM was performed in two non-survival and seven swine cadavers (n = 9). The mean procedure time was 3 h (2.5-4 h), and mean length of resected colon was 16.7 cm (10-25 cm). Transgastric endoscopic assistance was used in three cadavers and two non-survival swine (n = 5) with a mean operative time of 3.5 h (3.5-3.75 h). The mean length of colon mobilized with transgastric and transanal endoscopic access was 24.4 cm (20-27 cm) vs. 16.7 cm which mobilized the transanal approach alone (p = 0.016).

The long-term kinetics of IgG antibodies to the spike and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are of particular interest as easily measurable potential indirect markers of both previous infection and resistance to reinfection. Previous studies in hospitalized patients have found that anti-N IgG levels decline over time. We undertook this study to characterize the kinetics of anti-N IgG in a longitudinal cohort of health care workers in an acute hospital setting. Methods: All HCWs who were either employed or part of the medical staff at six acute-care hospitals in Phoenix, AZ in June 2019 were invited to participate in a long-term study of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs. A cohort of 1358 HCWs provided informed consent, filled out a questionnaire regarding their health care role and potential COVID-19 symptoms, and had blood drawn between June 15 th and August 15 th, 2020 (Draw 1). The questionnaire and blood draws were repeated in October 2020 (Draw 2), January 2021 (Draw 3), and April 2021. SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG was measured using the Abbott Architect platform, using a signal to cutoff ratio (S/Co) greater than 1.4 as a positive result. A participants first positive result was treated as Time 0. Anti-N IgG S/Co values at each time point were summarized as mean, median, and inter-quartile range, and differences over time were tested using the Friedmans test. Results: 290 participants (21.4%) had at least one positive IgG, with a median S/Co of 4.96, IQR 2.37-6.67. The Month 3 median S/Co was 2.32, IQR 1.34-4.22, Month 6 median was 0.96, IQR 0.51-2.05, and Month 9 median was 0.60, IQR 0.26-1.29 (See Figure).

Conclusion: In a cohort of health care workers with mild to moderate COVID-19, anti-N IgG levels steadily decreased over 9 months from the initial positive IgG. The high rates of conversion to seronegative over a relatively short time frame illustrate why antibody-based testing must be interpreted cautiously when used as a definitive marker of prior COVID infection.

Therefore, one of the outstanding problems of this research was to select the relevant scientific literature to synthesize the theory and create a conceptual theoretical model based on it. The aim of this paper is to explore the context and preconditions for managerial growth during an organizational change at different levels and aspects of organizations. Therefore, six theoretical approaches from the fields of management, psychology, and education were chosen (Hiatt, Kotter, Kbler-Ross, Goleman, Mezirow, and Marcia). Conclusions provide insights into the context, aims, and directions of managerial growth within organizational change. First, the context of organizational change is understood as an educational environment that creates incentives for managerial growth at the macro, meso, and micro levels and encompasses the development of personal and professional skills and the conscious evolution of inner perceptions related to work. Second, managerial growth in the context of organizational change is targeted toward three objectives at the organizational, group, and individual levels: productivity, connection, and self-realization. Third, managerial growth in the context of organizational change is directed toward three dimensions: (1) the strategic-operational dimension overlaps with the development of leadership skills to ensure successful change implementation in the organization;(2) the social-emotional dimension overlaps with the development of psychosocial skills, enabling coping with challenges through relationships and an emotionally supportive workplace environment;and (3) the perceptual-spiritual dimension overlaps with the development of personal maturity and professional motivation, disclosing authentic performance during organizational change.

Relatively rare movement disorders associated with COVID-19 are increasingly reported in case reports or case series. Here, we present a case and systematic review of myoclonus and cerebellar ataxia associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline using the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases, from November 1, 2019 to December 6, 2020. RESULTS: 51 cases of myoclonus or ataxia associated with COVID-19, including our case, were identified from 32 publications. The mean age was 59.6 years, ranging from 26 to 88 years, and 21.6% were female. Myoclonus was multifocal or generalized and had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms. Myoclonus occurred in isolation (46.7%), or with ataxia (40.0%) or cognitive changes (30.0%). Most cases improved within 2 months, and treatment included anti-epileptic medications or immunotherapy. Ataxia had an acute onset, usually within 1 month of COVID-19 symptoms, but could be an initial symptom. Concurrent neurological symptoms included cognitive changes (45.5%), myoclonus (36.4%), or a Miller Fisher syndrome variant (21.2%). Most cases improved within 2 months, either spontaneously or with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review highlights myoclonus and ataxia as rare and treatable post-infectious or para-infectious, immune-mediated phenomena associated with COVID-19.

According to TCM theory, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is closely associated with cold-dampness, an etiological factor in TCM. Cold-dampness could be attenuated by sun exposure and Wenyang herbs, both of which can restore the vitamin D level in the blood in Western medicine.

We examined physician perceptions of concerns about and barriers to 1L treatment by class of regimen (IO-IO, IO-TKI, and single-agent TKI [SA-TKI]) in the United States. Methods: US-based oncologists treating  5 aRCC patients in the prior 12 months were identified from the Cardinal Health network, a community of > 800 oncologists. Physicians were surveyed about concerns in prescribing and barriers to treating by class (scale of 1-5;1 = no concern/not a barrier, 5 = most concerning/major barrier);mean scores are reported. Adverse events (AEs) of concern were selected from a prespecified list and respondents rank-ordered from most to least concerning by class. Physicians were also asked to gauge affordability and to rank-order 13 characteristics to identify key factors in prescribing preference. The impact of COVID-19 on aRCC care in practice was also assessed. Results: A total of 49 providers (84% community, 16% academic) treating a median of 20 (IQR 14-30) aRCC patients from across the United States participated. For IO-IO, the top 3 concerns in prescribing were AEs (4.3), patient out-of-pocket costs (OOP;3.7), and unexpected late AEs (3.6), whereas patient OOP (4.3), AEs (4.1), and patient adherence (3.9) were of most concern for IO-TKI. For SA-TKIs, the top 3 concerns were patient adherence (3.9), patient OOP (3.9), and AEs (3.6). High patient OOP and impact on quality of life were the top 2 barriers in using IO-TKI therapy. The most concerning AEs were colitis, pneumonitis, and hypertension for IO-IO or IO-TKI, and diarrhea, fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, and hypertension for SA-TKI. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and complete response (CR) were ranked 1st, 2nd, and 3rd factors in prescribing preferences while patient compliance, patient preference, and practice reimbursement ranked 11th, 12th, and 13th. Patient OOP and drug acquisition costs (DAC) were the most important factors when considering the affordability of treatment, with the perception that IO-IO was the most expensive among the classes of therapy. The overall impact of COVID-19 on caring for aRCC patients was very limited, with a moderate increased use of telemedicine and a slight impact on the timing and number of routine care visits. Conclusions: OS, PFS, and CR ranked highest among the most important factors influencing selection of 1L treatment for aRCC. Factors of concern and barriers varied by class of treatment, with patient adherence and OOP affecting use of TKI or IO-TKI therapies, and AEs affecting the use of IO-based therapy. This study revealed perceptions of high patient OOP and DAC of IO-IO therapy, in contrast to our expectations.","output":"US physician perceptions of treatment decision making for advanced renal cell carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally, infection by seasonal influenza viruses causes 3C5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000C650,000 respiratory deaths each year.

It is essential for decision makers to make reliable and reasonable emergency decisions within a short span of time, since inappropriate decisions may result in enormous economic losses and social disorder. To handle emergency effectively and quickly, this paper proposes a new EDM method based on the novel concept of q-rung orthopair fuzzy rough (q-ROPR) set. A novel list of q-ROFR aggregation information, detailed description of the fundamental characteristics of the developed aggregation operators and the q-ROFR entropy measure that determine the unknown weight information of decision makers as well as the criteria weights are specified. Further an algorithm is given to tackle the uncertain scenario in emergency to give reliable and reasonable emergency decisions. By using proposed list of q-ROFR aggregation information all emergency alternatives are ranked to get the optimal one. Besides this, the q-ROFR entropy measure method is used to determine criteria and experts' weights objectively in the EDM process.

We aimed to identify circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) associated to ILA in a cohort of respiratory asymptomatic subjects older than 60 years. We identified 81 subjects with ILA from our Lung-Aging Program in Mexico City (n = 826). We randomly selected 112 subjects without ILA (Ctrl) from the same cohort. Using polymerase chain reaction PCR-Array technology (24 ILA and 24 Ctrl, screening cohort) and reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (57 ILA and 88 Ctr, independent validation cohort) we identified seven up-regulated miRNAs in serum of ILA compared to Ctrl (miR-193a-5p, p < 0.0001; miR-502-3p, p < 0.0001; miR-200c-3p, p = 0.003; miR-16-5p, p = 0.003; miR-21-5p, p = 0.002; miR-126-3p, p = 0.004 and miR-34a-5p, p < 0.005).

We aimed to identify general practitioners (GPs) perceptions and experiences of how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in general practice in England. Twenty-four semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 GPs at two time-points: autumn 2020 (14 interviews) and spring 2021 (10 interviews). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically, taking a longitudinal approach. Participants reported a lower threshold for antibiotic prescribing (and fewer consultations) for respiratory infections and COVID-19 symptoms early in the pandemic, then returning to more usual (pre-pandemic) prescribing. They perceived less impact on antibiotic prescribing for urinary and skin infections. Participants perceived the changing ways of working and consulting (e.g., proportions of remote and in-person consultations), and the changing patient presentations and GP workload as influencing the fluctuations in antibiotic prescribing. This was compounded by decreased engagement with, and priority of, AMS due to COVID-19-related urgent priorities. Re-engagement with AMS is needed, e.g., through reviving antibiotic prescribing feedback and targets/incentives. While the pandemic disrupted the usual ways of working, it also produced opportunities, e.g., for re-organising ways of managing infections and AMS in the future.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on community antibiotic prescribing and stewardship: a qualitative interview study with general practitioners in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fear of infection of COVID-19 among people has greatly reduced their intention to travel, which needs a deeper understanding to aid the policy-makers in framing robust guidelines to ensure safe travel This paper aims to present a critical understanding of the travelers willingness to reduce their trip frequency, using psycho attitudinal analysis of the variables impacting the travel behavior For this purpose, a web-based survey was conducted across India, and demographic, socio economic and psycho-attitudinal data was collected from 410 individuals, from across 21 states of India Information regarding the psycho-attitudinal data was collected using a set of indicators After extraction of latent factors from these indicators using factor analysis, factor scores were determined for each individual for these latent factors Subsequently, ordered logistic regression models were used to understand the influence of these pandemic-oriented variables upon an individuals intention to travel for essential, recreational and work trips In the estimation results, majority of the respondents showed a willingness to reduce their essential and recreational trips compared with work trips The awareness regarding the disease and the regionality of respondents showed a significant influence on their decision The study concludes by presenting the policy implications of the analysis [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Transportation Letters is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"A comprehensive analysis of the trip frequency behavior in COVID scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work is a statistical analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of cases worldwide overtakes one million, data reveals closed outbreaks in Hubei and South Korea, with a new slight increase in the number of infected people in the latter. Both of these countries have reached a plateau in the number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) residents, suggesting a trend to be followed by other affected regions. Using Hubei's data as a basis of analysis, we have studied the spreading rate of COVID-19 and modelled the epidemic center for 10 European countries. We have also given the final TCCpM curves for Italy and Lombardia. The introduction of the -factor allows us to analyse the different stages of the outbreak, compare the European countries amongst each other, and, finally, to confront the initial phase of the disease between Europe and South America. Methods: By dividing the TCCpM curves in multiple sections spanning short time frames we were able to fit each section to a linear model. By pairing then the angular coefficient ( factor) of each section to the total number of confirmed infections at the center of the corresponding time interval, we have analysed how the spreading rate of Covid-19 changes as more people are infected. Also, by modelling the TCCpM curves with an asymmetrical time integral of a Normal Distribution, we were able to study, by fitting progressively larger data ensembles, how the fitting parameters change as more data becomes available. Findings: The data analysis shows that the spreading rate of COVID-19 increases similarly for all countries in its early stage, but changes as the number of TCCpM in each country grows. Regarding the modelling of the TCCpM curves, we have found that the fitting parameters oscillate with time before reaching constant values. The estimation of such values allows the determination of better parameters for the model, which in turn leads to more trustworthy forecasts on the pandemic development. Interpretation: The analysis of the oscillating fitting parameters allows an early prediction of the TCC, epidemic center and standard deviation of the outbreak. The  factor and the recovered over confirmed cases ratio can be used to understand the pandemic development in each country and to compare the protective measures taken by local authorities and their impact on the spreading of the disease.","output":"Analysing and comparing the COVID-19 data: The closed cases of Hubei and South Korea, the dark March in Europe, the beginning of the outbreak in South America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because of high fluctuations of tourism demand, accurate predictions of tourist arrivals are of high importance for tourism organizations.

Despite the widespread use of DES in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, the optimal treatment for DES restenosis remains poorly defined. A systematic search of electronic resources was performed. The primary end point was diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography. Seven trials were included, enrolling a total of 1,586 patients with 1,728 restenotic lesions. The following treatment options were found: balloon angioplasty (BA) in 343 patients (19.3%), iopromide-based paclitaxel-eluting balloons (PEB) in 343 (21.6%), sirolimus-eluting stents in 441 (27.8%), paclitaxel-eluting stents in 462 (29.1%), and everolimus-eluting stents in 34 (2.2%). Compared with BA, PEB (-17.74%, 95% credible interval [CI] -25.17% to -11.31%), everolimus-eluting stents (-14.93%, 95% CI -33.47% to 1.16%), paclitaxel-eluting stents (-15.3%, 95% CI -22.96% to -8.35%), and sirolimus-eluting stents (-11.08%, 95% CI -17.89% to -3.4%) had similar reductions in diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography. PEB (85%) and everolimus-eluting stents (68%) had the greatest probabilities for being the best treatment option. Furthermore, PEB were the best treatment in terms of late luminal loss (85%) and binary restenosis (85%). BA had the lowest efficacy with respect to all study end points. In conclusion, in patients with DES restenosis, repeat DES implantation and iopromide-based PEB are valid alternatives. However, PEB had greater angiographic efficacy and therefore should be considered the new benchmark comparator in the treatment of DES restenosis. The use of BA should be discouraged in patients with DES restenosis.","output":"Meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the effectiveness of different strategies for the treatment of drug-eluting stent restenosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arterial hypertension is a risk factor for several pathologies, mainly including cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which rank as leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.

Scientific evidence showed that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection. However, few data are available about the effect of face masking on the duration of the disease. We aimed to study the association between recovery time among a Tunisian cohort of COVID-19 confirmed patients and mask wearing. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from March to July 2020 including patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Tunisian national containment center. Data were collected via phone call interview. Kaplan-Meir Methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models were, respectively, used to study the association between recovery time and face masks use. RESULTS: Among the 264 patients included, the median duration of viral clearance was 20 days (interquartile range (IQR 17-32days)). The median time to RNA viral conversion was 18 days (IQR 16-21 days) when using masks versus 23 days (IQR17-36 days) without wearing masks. Face masks use was significantly associated with an accelerated RNA clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (HR 2.006, 95% CI 1.247-3.228) (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: With the emergence of new variants, it is important to adopt widespread mask wearing to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection and accelerate RNA negative conversion, until effective levels of vaccination are achieved nationally.

To inform risk assessment, the aims of this review were fourfold, namely (1) to describe the most important physical processes related to ADMs and pathogen transport, (2) to discuss studies that focused on the application of ADMs to pathogenic bioaerosols, (3) to discuss emission and inactivation rate parameterisations, and (4) to discuss methods for conversion of concentrations to infection probabilities (concerning quantitative microbial risk assessment). The studies included human, livestock, and industrial sources. Important factors for dispersion included wind speed, atmospheric stability, topographic effects, and deposition. Inactivation was mainly governed by humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet radiation. A majority of the reviewed studies, however, lacked quantitative analyses and application of full quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA). Qualitative conclusions based on geographical dispersion maps and threshold doses were encountered frequently. Thus, to improve risk assessment for future outbreaks and releases, we recommended determining well-quantified emission and inactivation rates and applying dosimetry and doseCresponse models to estimate infection probabilities in the population at risk.","output":"Atmospheric dispersion modelling of bioaerosols that are pathogenic to humans and livestock C A review to inform risk assessment studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The Australasian Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (Aus-ROC) out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) Epistry (Epidemiological Registry) now covers 100% of Australia and New Zealand (NZ).

METHODS We included all OHCA cases throughout 2019 as submitted to the Epistry by the eight Australian and two NZ emergency medical services (EMS). We calculated crude and age-standardised incidence rates and performed a national and EMS regional comparison. RESULTS We obtained data for 31,778 OHCA cases for 2019: 26,637 in Australia and 5,141 in NZ. Crude incidence was 107.9 per 100,000 person-years in Australia and 103.2/100,000 in NZ. Overall, the majority of OHCAs occurred in adults (96%), males (66%), private residences (76%), were unwitnessed (63%), of presumed medical aetiology (83%), and had an initial monitored rhythm of asystole (64%). In non-EMS-witnessed cases, 38% received bystander CPR and 2% received public defibrillation. Wide variation was seen between EMS regions for all OHCA demographics, arrest characteristics and outcomes. In patients who received an EMS-attempted resuscitation (13,664/31,778): 28% (range across EMS=13.1% to 36.7%) had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital arrival and 13% (range across EMS=9.9% to 20.7%) survived to hospital discharge/30-days.

Thus, reentrant swelling of the polymer chains is observed with increasing pH. This effect is more important at low polymer grafting densities, when it is accompanied by in-plane heterogeneous distribution at intermediate pH values. In addition, we observed self-assembly on the polymer brush (formation of holes and islands) at pH values below pKa, due to the short-range attractive interaction between uncharged grafted chains. The sensitivity of the ionization of grafted chains to the physicochemical environment was also studied by measuring the interaction force between a silica tip and polymer brushes by atomic force microscopy.

While many have focused on clinical outcomes, less attention has been paid to vulnerability and risk of infection. In this study, we developed a planning tool that examines factors that affect vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Across 46 variables, we defined five broad categories: 1) access to medical services, 2) underlying health conditions, 3) environmental exposures, 4) vulnerability to natural disasters, and 5) sociodemographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors. The developed tool was validated by comparing the estimated overall vulnerability with the real-time reported normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19. ANALYSIS: A principal component analysis was undertaken to reduce the dimensions. In order to identify vulnerable census tracts, we conducted rank-based exceedance and K-means cluster analyses. RESULTS: All of the 5 vulnerability categories, as well as the overall vulnerability, showed significant (P-values <<0.05) and relatively strong correlations (0.203<&#961;<0.57) with the normalized confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the census tract level. Our study showed a total of 722,357 (~17% of the County population) people, including 171,403 between the ages of 45-65 (~4% of County's population), and 76,719 seniors (~2% of County population), are at a higher risk based on the aforementioned categories. The exceedance and K-means cluster analysis demonstrated that census tracts in the northeastern, eastern, southeastern and northwestern regions of the County are at highest risk. CONCLUSION: Policymakers can use this planning tool to identify neighborhoods at high risk for becoming hot spots; efficiently match community resources with needs, and ensure that the most vulnerable have access to equipment, personnel, and medical interventions.","output":"Assessing COVID-19 risk, vulnerability and infection prevalence in communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of nanoprobes in sensors is a popular way to amplify their analytical performance.

Compared to water, the stability constant in seven carboxylic acid buffers (citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, malic acid and tartaric acid) was reduced. All seven buffers exhibited a competitive mechanism. Binding constants for the interaction between ?-cyclodextrin and buffers ranged from 4 to 44 M-1, and binding enthalpies were in the range -19 to -11 kJ/mole. There was a relation between the chemical structures of the buffers and their ability to bind to cyclodextrin. All seven buffers had a carbon chain longer than three carbons. Hydroxyl groups on the carbon chain decreased the binding affinity. 1H and ROESY NMR spectroscopy supported inclusion of the citric acid into the cyclodextrin cavity, although the results for succinic and maleic acids were ambiguous.

Functional hypogonadism is the most frequent form, and clomiphene citrate (CC) has been recently introduced as a possible off-label therapeutic option for these patients. OBJECTIVES This study aims to evaluate the effects of CC on the overall sexual function in dysmetabolic obese men with low testosterone(T) levels. METHODS This was a sub-study of a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial that included twenty-four obese or overweight subjects, with impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes, and confirmed low total T (10.4 nmol/l) levels. Subjects were treated with CC or placebo (Plac) for 12 weeks, with an interval wash-out period of 6 weeks between treatments. All subjects were on metformin 2gr/day and a low-calorie diet. The between-treatment difference in the overall sexual function was assessed by IIEF-15 and a qADAM questionnaire. RESULTS IIEF-15 and qADAM questionnaire data were available for 18 individuals. In unadjusted analyses, CC was associated with lower IIEF-15 total, erectile function, and intercourse satisfaction domain scores than Plac. After adjustments for multiple variables, CC was associated with a higher IIEF-15 sexual desire domain score (+0.9  0.8; p<.001) despite a lower qADAM score (-2.1  0.9; p=.008) with respect to Plac. No differences were found for the other domains between groups. DISCUSSION The clinical significance of the absolute changes in IIEF-15 and qADAM scores during CC versus Plac is limited. However, CC has a reliable effect on sexual desire, and is also as safe as Plac. According to the sample size, duration of follow-up, and inclusion criteria defined for the main study, further studies are therefore needed to assess the long-term efficacy of CC. CONCLUSION Compared to Plac, CC was associated with a neutral effect on overall sexual function.","output":"Overall sexual function in dysmetabolic obese men with low testosterone levels treated with clomiphene citrate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This introduction to the Journal of Industrial Relations? 2020 Annual Review of Industrial Relations provides an overview of the six Annual Review articles, an international review and two practitioner reviews The COVID-19 pandemic presented a crisis for the labour market, intensifying serious existing issues such as stagnant wage growth, the gender pay gap and employer non-compliance with minimum wage laws The pandemic also presented an opportunity for the Australian government to direct its economic stimulus measures in a targeted manner that addressed these existing problems concurrently with the immediate pandemic-related issues However, 2020 will be marked by this missed opportunity","output":"Australian industrial relations in 2020: COVID-19, crisis and opportunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methods We identified that 308 women who had undergone surgical repair of POP were followed up for at least 6 months. Recurrence rates of POP after tension-free vaginal mesh (TVM) surgery (n = 243), native tissue repair (NTR) (vaginal hysterectomy with colpopexy, anterior and posterior colpoplasty, or circumferential suturing of the levator ani muscles and apical repair by transvaginal sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF)) (NTR; n = 31), and laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy after subtotal hysterectomy (LSC; n = 34) were compared. Presence of mesh erosion was also recorded. Results Patients who underwent LSC were significantly younger (65.32  3.23 years) than those who underwent TVM surgery (69.61  8.31 years). After TVM surgery, the rate of recurrence (over POP-Q stage II) was 6.17% (15/243) and was highest in patients with advanced POP. The recurrence rate in patients who underwent NTR procedure was 3.23% (1/34) and that in patients who underwent LSC was 11.76% (4/11). There was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between the three types of surgery. There were 13 cases (5.35%) of mesh erosion after TVM surgery and none after LSC surgery. The risk of mesh erosion was correlated with having had total TVM surgery but not with patient age or POP stage. Repeat procedures were performed in 5 women (2.14%) who underwent TVM surgery and 1 (2.94%) who underwent LSC. No patient underwent repeat surgery after NTR. There was no statistically significant difference in the reoperation rate between the three types of surgery. Conclusion Our study suggested that TVM surgery, NTR, and LSC have comparable outcomes as for the postoperative recurrence rate and mesh erosion.

Despite ongoing efforts by the government to ensure COVID-19 vaccination of most residents to attain herd immunity, myths and beliefs have adversely shaped the perception of most Nigerians, challenging the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. This study aimed to assess the factors influencing the awareness, perception, and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine among Nigerian adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional online nationwide study was conducted from April to June 2021 among Nigerian adult population using the snowballing method. Descriptive analysis was used to summarise the data. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify the predictors of COVID-19 uptake among the respondents. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 1058 completed forms were analysed and 63.9% were females. The mean age was 40.8 years12.2 years. Most of the respondents (740; 69.5%) had satisfactory awareness of the vaccination exercise. The media was the main source of information.

The purpose of this study was to generate an unbiased survey of cellular senescence gene expression with whole brain tissues using a standardized, curated set of 88 genes associated with cellular senescence. We performed a comparative analysis of aged brains with two CNS disease models; the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination. Each experimental group could be distinguished from the others by expression of unique subsets of cellular senescence genes, with minimal overlap between each group. Gene ontology analyses identified unique processes within cellular senescence among each group. To examine how these changes translate to the human condition, we interrogated gene expression data from publicly available databases of human aging and AD cases which also corroborated our finding that cellular senescence gene expression changes in AD differ significantly from healthy aging, although the changes in human did not always correlate with the murine models. These data provide important insight on the common and unique global changes in expression of cellular senescence genes in the CNS accompanying aging, injury or disease. Future studies may define, using more refined cellular assays, the specific cellular phenotype differences, and how disparate drivers of unique disease pathologies all seemingly culminate in a common activation of cellular senescence.","output":"Distinct profiles of cellular senescence-associated gene expression in the aged, diseased or injured central nervous system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A weak production of INF- along with an exacerbated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported during infection by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins able to counteract the host immune system, which is believed to be one of the most important features contributing to the viral pathogenesis and development of a severe clinical picture. Previous reports have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 N protein, along with some non-structural and accessory proteins, efficiently suppresses INF- production by interacting with RIG-I, an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in the recognition of pathogen-derived molecules. In the present study, we better characterized the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 N counteracts INF- secretion and affects RIG-I signaling pathways. In detail, when the N protein was ectopically expressed, we noted a marked decrease in TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation. The capability of the N protein to bind to, and probably mask, TRIM25 could be the consequence of its antagonistic activity. Furthermore, this interaction occurred at the SPRY domain of TRIM25, harboring the RNA-binding activity necessary for TRIM25 self-activation. Here, we describe new findings regarding the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the IFN system, filling some gaps for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms affecting the innate immune response in COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 N Protein Targets TRIM25-Mediated RIG-I Activation to Suppress Innate Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated the mental health among 187 final-year-senior-high-school students during the six-months pandemic-related lockdown.

A pilot study was conducted to analyze a small number of specimens from patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome pulmonary fibrosis (HPSPF) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Digital images of entire lung histological serial sections stained with picrosirius red and alcian blue or anti-CD68 antibody were analyzed using dedicated software to automatically quantify fibrosis, collagen, and macrophage content. Automated fibrosis quantification based on parenchymal tissue density and fibrosis score measurements was compared to pulmonary function values or Ashcroft score. Automated fibrosis quantification of HPSPF lung explants was significantly higher than that of IPF lung explants or biopsies and was also significantly higher in IPF lung explants than in IPF biopsies. A high correlation coefficient was found between some automated quantification measurements and lung function values for the three sample groups. Automated quantification of collagen content in lung sections used for digital image analyses was similar in the three groups.

METHODS: An in-depth review and analysis of available data from the DACH countries was conducted. Data was collected from official government sources whenever possible, and supplemented by information from international databases and local reports. The data was then analyzed to identify common patterns as well as significant divergences across the DACH region, especially in the area of health policy and technology use.

Method: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Medline complete and MedRxiv. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 were eligible. Study selection and data-extraction were performed by two authors independently. QUADAS-2 checklist tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve model were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the serological tests. Subgroup meta-analysis analyses was performed to explore the heterogeneity. Results: : The pooled sensitivity for IgG, IgM and IgG-IgM based LFIA tests were 0.5856, 0.4637 and 0.6886, respectively compared to rRT-PCR method. The pooled sensitivity for IgG and IgM based CLIA tests were 0.9311 and 0.8516, respectively compared to rRT-PCR. The pooled sensitivity the IgG, IgM and IgG-IgM based ELISA tests were 0.8292, 0.8388 and 0.8531 respectively compared to rRT-PCR. All tests displayed high specificities ranging from 0.9693 to 0.9991. Among the evaluated tests, IgG based CLIA expressed the highest sensitivity signifying its accurate detection of the largest proportion of infections identified by rRT-PCR. ELISA and CLIA tests performed better in terms of sensitivity compared to LFIA. IgG based tests performed better compared to IgM except for the ELISA. Conclusions: We report that IgG-IgM based ELISA tests have the best overall diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type independently. Given the poor performances of the current LFIA devices there is need for more research on the development of highly sensitivity and specific POC LFIA that are adequate for most individual patient applications and attractive for large sero-prevalence studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed 80 patients with spinal cord AVMs by spinal cord angiography who had hemorrhage before the first endovascular treatment at New York University Medical Center, Beth Israel Medical Center, or Roosevelt Hospital in New York. We compared the baseline and radiologic characteristics of patients with and without recurrent hemorrhage by the log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS We observed recurrent hemorrhage in 35 (44%) patients (1/41 patients with endovascular treatment and 34/39 patients without endovascular treatment). The median length of total follow-up was 659 days (interquartile range, 129-2640 days), and the median length from first-to-recurrent hemorrhage was 369 days (interquartile range, 30-1596 days). The log-rank test revealed that endovascular treatment and venous thrombosis reduced recurrent hemorrhage, and associated aneurysm was related to recurrent hemorrhage.

METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out during the first pandemic wave in the intensive care units (ICUs) of two referral University Hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Two hundred twenty-two consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were evaluated during the ICU stay. In addition to major demographic and clinical data, we recorded information on the route and amount of nutritional support provided on a daily basis. RESULTS: Among patients still in the ICUs and alive on day 4 (N = 198), 129 (65.2%) and 72 (36.4%) reached a satisfactory caloric and protein intake, respectively, mainly by enteral route. In multivariable analysis, a satisfactory caloric intake on day 4 was associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.46 [95%CI, 0.42C0.50], P < 0.001). Mild obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30 and < 35 kg/m(2)) was associated with higher mortality (HR = 1.99 [95%CI, 1.07C3.68], P = 0.029), while patients with moderate-severe obesity (BMI35 kg/m(2)) were less likely to be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 0.71 [95%CI, 0.62C0.82], P < 0.001).

In addition, the predictive role of the psychological variables was explored through the lens of negative and positive information processing perspective on total and domain-specific COVID-19 prevention behavior. METHODS: A cross-sectional research was conducted. The sample included 834 Hungarian speaking women. The assessed variables were: COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, COVID-19 health anxiety, negative automatic thoughts, psychological flexibility, and four domains of COVID-19 prevention behavior (social distancing, general hygiene, information seeking, health behavior). A three-level hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the predictors of preventive behavior in each generation. RESULTS: A diversity across generations was found. In case of baby boomer generation, the final model explained 32.4% of the variance for total prevention behavior [F(14,215) = 8.847, p < 0.001], and only perceived risk made a significant contribution. For Gen X the final model accounted for 21.1% of variance of total prevention behavior [F(14,341) = 7.788, p < 0.001], marital status, perceived risk, COVID-19 health anxiety, and negative automatic thoughts made significant contributions. In case of Gen Y the final model accounted for 6.2% of variance on total prevention behavior [F(14,147) = 1.761, p = 0.05], only perceived risk had a contribution to the final model. For Gen Z the final model accounted for 23.4% of variance on total preventive behavior [F(13,71) = 2.979, p = 0.002], and only psychological flexibility made a contribution to the model. The results on the distinct domains of COVID-19 prevention behavior emphasized details in the dissimilarity among generations. CONCLUSION: The role of generational identity on COVID-19 prevention behavior is relevant. The coexistence of negative and positive information processing may have its beneficial role in certain areas of prevention.","output":"Psychological Predictors of COVID-19 Prevention Behavior in Hungarian Women Across Different Generations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the global COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS The study is an analysis of the results of the ADEA Survey of Dental School Seniors, 2020 Graduating Class. Each year, ADEA surveys senior predoctoral students from the accredited U.S. dental schools. Whenever feasible, the answers of the survey respondents from the 2020 class were compared with their 2015 counterparts. RESULTS The analysis revealed that 46% of the 2020 respondents decided to become a dentist before going to undergraduate college, more than the proportion of those deciding while in college (42%). When it comes to preparedness to practice dentistry, the responses indicated a high level of readiness to go into the profession. Seventy-seven percent of survey participants reported the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect their plans after graduation. Between 2015 and 2020, the share of survey respondents who planned to go into advanced dental education immediately after graduation increased from 35% to 40%. Almost a third of the 2020 respondents who planned to go into private practice immediately upon graduation intended to join a Dental Service Organization (DSO). Grants and scholarships represented a higher share of the average funding for dental education for the 2020 respondents than five years ago. The share of respondents expecting to graduate without any loans to finance their dental degrees and predental education (educational debt) increased significantly, from 12% in 2015 to 17% in 2020.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective adjuvant therapy, but not still unsatisfactory. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), which has recently been used in clinical practice, may have faster and stronger effects comparing the traditional model (10-Hz high-frequency rTMS). A large number of studies have showed that rTMS, especially iTBS, can enhance the neural plasticity of the brain, and cognitive training can improve the cognitive function of schizophrenia. Is there any facilitation effect of iTBS add on cognitive training (such as working memory training, WMT) on cognitive function enhancement in schizophrenia is still unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study is designed of a double-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial that will include 200 schizophrenia patients between 18 and 45 years of age. The patients will be randomized to four groups, i.e., the study group (iTBS+WMT), WMS control group (iTBS+ Simple Response Training (SRT)), iTBS control group (sham iTBS+WMT), and placebo control (sham iTBS+SRT). The patients will receive 3 min 20 s of real or sham stimulation, followed by a short 1C2-min rest and 40 min of WMT training or SRT immediately. Neuropsychological and clinical symptom assessments, with functional and structural MRI, will be performed on baseline, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up periods. The primary outcome is cognitive function measured by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The secondary outcomes are changes in neuroplasticity, as measured by MRI and other behavioral assessments. DISCUSSION: The aim of our study is to explore the facilitation effects of iTBS added on WMT in improving cognitive function of schizophrenia. That means, patients with schizophrenia will benefit more in cognitive function improvement from the combination training mode of preheating (iTBS stimulation changes the neural activity of working memory-related brain regions) and ironning (working memory training). And the long-term effects of this combined training model will be assessed at a 6-month follow-up period. In case of a significant improvement of working memory with a prolonged effect, the iTBS combined with WMT protocol could be considered as a first-line clinical protocol in schizophrenia treatment. More broadly, the potential for increased universality and efficiency of rTMS with the iTBS model to enhance the neural plasticity of the brain should have a more positive effect on cognitive function in schizophrenia.

Earlier studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SARS-CoV-1 in Eastern Asian (EAS) populations. In this report, we aimed at exploring the frequency of a set of genetic polymorphisms that could affect SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or severity, including those that were previously associated with SARS-CoV-1. METHODS: We extracted the list of SNPs that could potentially modulate SARS-CoV-2 from the genome wide association studies (GWAS) on SARS-CoV-1 and other viruses. We also collected the expression data of these SNPs from the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) databases. Sequences from Qatar Genome Programme (QGP, n = 6,054) and 1000Genome project were used to calculate and compare allelic frequencies (AF). RESULTS: A total of 74 SNPs, located in 10 genes: ICAM3, IFN-, CCL2, CCL5, AHSG, MBL, Furin, TMPRSS2, IL4, and CD209 promoter, were identified. Analysis of Qatari genomes revealed significantly lower AF of risk variants linked to SARS-CoV-1 severity (CCL2, MBL, CCL5, AHSG, and IL4) compared to that of 1000Genome and/or the EAS population (up to 25-fold change). Conversely, SNPs in TMPRSS2, IFN-, ICAM3, and Furin were more common among Qataris (average 2-fold change). Inter-population analysis showed that the distribution of risk alleles among Europeans differs substantially from Africans and EASs. Remarkably, Africans seem to carry extremely lower frequencies of SARS-CoV-1 susceptibility alleles, reaching to 32-fold decrease compared to other populations. CONCLUSION: Multiple genetic variants, which could potentially modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection, are significantly variable between populations, with the lowest frequency observed among Africans.

In early March 2020, leadership at Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak Michigan (Beaumont) identified the need to develop high capacity testing modalities with appropriate sensitivity and specificity and rapid turnaround time. We describe the molecular diagnostic testing experience since initial rollout on March 16, 2020 at Beaumont, and results of repeat testing during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in MI. METHODS: Beaumont is an 1100 bed hospital in Southeast MI. In March, testing was initially performed with the EUA Luminex NxTAG CoV Extended Panel until March 28, 2020 when testing was converted to the EUA Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 for quicker turnaround times. Each assay was validated with a combination of patient samples and contrived specimens. RESULTS: During the initial week of testing there was > 20 % specimen positivity. As the prevalence grew the positivity rate reached 68% by the end of March (Figure 1). Many state and hospital initiatives were implemented during the outbreak, including social distancing and screening of asymptomatic patients to increase case-finding and prevent transmission. We also adopted a process for clinical review of symptomatic patients who initially tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by a group of infectious disease physicians (Figure 2). This process was expanded to include other trained clinicians who were redeployed from other departments in the hospital. Repeat testing was performed to allow consideration of discontinuation of isolation precautions. During the surge of community cases from March 16 to April 30, 2020, we identified patients with negative PCR tests who subsequently had repeat testing based on clinical evaluation, with 7.1% (39/551) returning positive for SARS- CoV2.

We also explored the potential impact of a mitigation strategy after the interruption. Results: Delays towards the elimination target are estimated to range between 0 to 9 years. Highly endemic settings where control efforts have been ongoing for 5-8 years are most affected by an interruption, for which we identified a mitigation strategy to be most relevant. However, more importantly, all settings can expect an increase in the number of VL cases. This increase is substantial even for settings with a limited expected delay in achieving the elimination target. Conclusion: Besides implementing mitigation strategies, it is of great importance to try and keep the duration of the interruption as short as possible, to prevent new individuals from becoming infected with VL, and continue the efforts towards VL elimination as a public health problem in India.","output":"Modelling the impact of COVID-19-related programme interruptions on visceral leishmaniasis in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While tracking-data analytics can be a goldmine for institutions and companies, the inherent privacy concerns also form a legal, ethical and social minefield.

METHODS: The peripheral lymphocyte and subsets of 95 confirmed cases with COVID-19 from baseline to four weeks were compared between critical illness and non-critical illness cases with or without DM. RESULTS: The dynamic characteristics of lymphocyte and subsets in COVID-19 patients was that it reduced significantly at one week, rapidly elevated to the peak at two weeks after onset, then gradually declined during recovery. The COVID-19 critical illness patients with DM had the lowest decline at one week and the slow lowest rise at two weeks after onset, while COVID-19 non-critical illness patients with DM had the rapid highest rise at two weeks after onset, both of them had similar lymphocyte and subsets at five weeks after onset and lower than those patients without DM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a reference for clinicians that for COVID-19 patients with DM and the lowest decline of lymphocyte and subsets, immunomodulatory therapy as soon as possible might avoid or slow down disease progression; moreover for COVID-19 critical illness patients with or without DM and non-critical illness patients with DM, continuous immunomodulatory therapy in later stages of disease might speed up virus clearance, shorten hospital stay, improve disease prognosis in COVID-19 critical illness patients with DM.","output":"Lymphocyte subsets with the lowest decline at baseline and the slow lowest rise during recovery in COVID-19 critical illness patients with diabetes mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to analyse the effectiveness of the lockdown measure taken to control the transmission of COVID\\\\19 in India by examining the peak of the epidemic pre and post the adoption of stringent lockdown from 25 March 2020.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the mindsets of American adults over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic to understand their relative stability over time and their relationship with emotions, behaviors, experiences, and wellbeing. METHODS: American adults (N = 5365) were recruited in early March of 2020 to participate in a longitudinal survey with follow-up surveys at 6-weeks and 6-months. Three mindsets that people formed about the COVID-19 pandemic were measured: the pandemic is a catastrophe, the pandemic is manageable and the pandemic can be an opportunity. RESULTS: In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, these mindsets were associated with a unique and largely self-fulfilling pattern of emotions (positive, negative), behaviors (healthy, unhealthy, and compliance with CDC guidelines), experiences (connection/growth, isolation/meaninglessness) and wellbeing (physical health, mental health, quality of life). Moreover, mindsets formed in the first week of the pandemic were associated with quality of life 6 months later, an effect that was mediated by emotions and health behaviors. CONCLUSION: The mindsets that people adopted about the COVID-19 pandemic - that it is a catastrophe, manageable, or an opportunity may explain some of the heterogeneity in the lived experiences of Americans through their self-fulfilling impact on peoples' emotions, health behaviors, and wellbeing.","output":"Making sense of a pandemic: Mindsets influence emotions, behaviors, health, and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter provides a general view on social and mental dimensions of the coronavirus epidemic by analyzing it in the context of Turkey.

Cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) harboring different Mthapgs were used to observe functional differences under hypoxia-ischemia. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was conducted to identify the particularly elevated mRNA. The patient study identified an association between Mthapg F1 and risk of ischemic stroke (OR 1.72:1.27-2.34, p = 0.001). The cellular study further demonstrated an impeded induction of hypoxic inducible factor 1&#945; in the Mthapg F1 cybrid after hypoxia-ischemia. Additionally, the study demonstrated that Mthapg F cybrids were associated with an altered mitochondrial function, including decreased oxygen consumption, higher mitochondrial ROS production, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Mthapg F cybrids were also noted to be prone to inflammation, with increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines and elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9.

Infection with the A59 strain of MHV induces both encephalitis and hepatitis, while the highly neurovirulent JHM strain induces a fatal encephalitis with little, if any, hepatitis. The pathogenic phenotype for each strain is determined by the genetic composition of the viral genome, as well as the host immune response. Using isogenic recombinant viruses with A59 background genes differing only in the spike gene, we have previously shown that high neurovirulence is associated with the JHM spike protein, the protein responsible for attachment to the host cell receptor (J. J. Phillips, M. M. Chua, G. F. Rall, and S. R. Weiss, Virology 301:109-120, 2002). Using another set of isogenic recombinant viruses with JHM background genes expressing either the JHM or A59 spike, we have further investigated the roles of viral genes in pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that the high neurovirulence of JHM is associated with accelerated spread through the brain and a heightened innate immune response that is characterized by high numbers of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages, suggesting an immunopathogenic component to neurovirulence. While expression of the JHM spike is sufficient to confer a neurovirulent phenotype, as well as increased macrophage infiltration, background genes contribute to virulence as well, at least in part, by dictating the extent of the T-cell immune response.","output":"Both spike and background genes contribute to murine coronavirus neurovirulence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The prevalence of depression in the United States is >3 times higher mid-COVID-19 versus pre-pandemic. Racial/ethnic differences in mindsets around depression and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well characterized. OBJECTIVE To describe attitudes, mindsets, key drivers, and barriers related to depression pre- and mid-COVID-19 by race/ethnicity using digital conversations about depression mapped to health belief model (HBM) concepts. METHODS Advanced search, data extraction, and AI-powered tools were used to harvest, mine, and structure open-source digital conversations of US adults who engaged in conversations about depression pre- (February 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and mid-COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020-November 1, 2020) across the internet. Natural language processing, text analytics, and social data mining were used to categorize conversations that included a self-identifier into racial/ethnic groups. Conversations were mapped to HBM concepts (ie, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy). Results are descriptive in nature. RESULTS Of 2.9 and 1.3 million relevant digital conversations pre- and mid-COVID-19, race/ethnicity was determined among 1.8 million and 979,000 conversations, respectively. Pre-COVID-19, 1.3 million conversations about depression were analyzed among non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), 227,200 among Black Americans (BA), 189,200 among Hispanics, and 86,800 among Asian Americans (AS). Mid-COVID-19, a total of 736,100 conversations about depression were analyzed among NHW, 131,800 among BA, 78,300 among Hispanics, and 32,800 among AS. Conversations among all racial/ethnic groups had a negative tone, which increased pre- to mid-COVID-19; finding support from others was seen as a benefit among most groups. Hispanics had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group of conversations showing an avoidant mindset toward their depression. Conversations related to external barriers to seeking treatment (eg, stigma, lack of support, and lack of resources) were generally more prevalent among Hispanics, BA, and AS than among NHW. Being able to benefit others and building a support system were key drivers to seeking help or treatment for all racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS There were considerable racial/ethnic differences in drivers and barriers to seeking help and treatment for depression pre- and mid-COVID-19. As expected, COVID-19 has made conversations about depression more negative, and with frequent discussions of barriers to seeking care. Applying concepts of the HBM to data on digital conversation about depression allowed organization of the most frequent themes by race/ethnicity. Individuals of all groups came online to discuss their depression. These data highlight opportunities for culturally competent and targeted approaches to address areas amenable to change that might impact the ability of people to ask for or receive mental health help, such as the constructs that comprise the HBM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-three systemically healthy male dental patients with gingivitis were recruited consecutively and randomly divided into two groups: WhatsApp group (n = 24) and a control group (n = 19). At baseline visit, the participants were educated and motivated about oral health and given a folio on instructions about the oral hygiene preventive measures. The participants in the study group further received WhatsApp messages about the dental care at weekly intervals throughout the study (3 months). Plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were measured at baseline and after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS The averages of PI and GI were not significantly different between both groups at any time point of measurement (baseline, after one, and three months; p value >0.05). Intragroup comparisons revealed that the reductions in PI were highly significant after 1 and 3 months (-0.26  0.26 and -0.57  0.35, respectively, for WhatsApp group, and -0.24  0.27 and -0.64  0.4. respectively, for the control group; p value range: 0.001 to <0.001).

TICI was determined by core laboratory review. Good outcome was defined as an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days. We analyzed the association among clinical outcome, successful-versus-unsuccessful reperfusion (TICI 2b-3 versus TICI 0-2a), and age (dichotomized across the median). RESULTS Two hundred sixty-nine of 291 patients treated with Solitaire in the STAR and SWIFT data bases for whom TICI and 90-day outcome data were available were included. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range, 60-76 years) with an age range of 25-88 years. The mean age of patients 70 years of age or younger was 59 years, and it was 77 years for patients older than 70 years. There was no significant difference between baseline NIHSS scores or procedure time metrics. Hemorrhage and device-related complications were more common in the younger age group but did not reach statistical significance. In absolute terms, the rate of good outcome was higher in the younger population (64% versus 44%, P < .001).

It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread. We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs. By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem. The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise. We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF. Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve. Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values.

Methods: In this review, we analyze 18 articles to look at how access to health insurance has affected how Americans receive medical care during the coronavirus pandemic. Results: The large-scale job losses related to the pandemic translates directly into millions of Americans also losing employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) coverage. With the pandemic disproportionately affecting minority populations, these communities now bear the additional toll of not receiving appropriate care. Conclusion: Due to the pandemic, it is probable that a significant portion of Americans that are uninsured are less likely to seek medical care for COVID-19 symptoms. While the disease can manifest as a mild respiratory illness in most, others can experience more severe disease and require acute, intensive medical care.

Communities that are of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to have health insurance and follow up with medical care due to out-of-pocket costs, which in turn leads to a higher case fatality rate due to COVID-19.","output":"Papering over the cracks: COVID-19s amplification of the failures of employer-based health insurance coverage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with severe acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) has prompted efforts to understand the genetic basis for its unique characteristics and its jump from non-primate hosts to humans. Tests for positive selection can identify apparently nonrandom patterns of mutation accumulation within genomes, highlighting regions where molecular function may have changed during the origin of a species. Several recent studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have identified signals of conservation and positive selection within the gene encoding Spike protein based on the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitution. Such tests cannot, however, detect changes in the function of RNA molecules. Methods Here we apply a test for branch-specific oversubstitution of mutations within narrow windows of the genome without reference to the genetic code. Results We recapitulate the finding that the gene encoding Spike protein has been a target of both purifying and positive selection. In addition, we find other likely targets of positive selection within the genome of SARS-CoV-2, specifically within the genes encoding Nsp4 and Nsp16. Homology-directed modeling indicates no change in either Nsp4 or Nsp16 protein structure relative to the most recent common ancestor. Thermodynamic modeling of RNA stability and structure, however, indicates that RNA secondary structure within both genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome differs from those of RaTG13, the reconstructed common ancestor, and Pan-CoV-GD (Guangdong). These SARS-CoV-2-specific mutations may affect molecular processes mediated by the positive or negative RNA molecules, including transcription, translation, RNA stability, and evasion of the host innate immune system. Our results highlight the importance of considering mutations in viral genomes not only from the perspective of their impact on protein structure, but also how they may impact other molecular processes critical to the viral life cycle.","output":"Positive selection within the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other Coronaviruses independent of impact on protein function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and objectives: The principal complications associated with thyroid surgery consist in postoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy, hypoparathyroidism, intra-operative and post-operative hemorrhage. In this paper, structured as a literature review, we describe the current knowledge and the technical improvements currently employed in the field of thyroid surgery, focusing on the contribution of energy based devices in relation with the reduction of the operating time and the odds of possible complication. Materials and methods: a relevant systematic literature search on Pubmed was carried out including works from 2004 through 2019, selecting studies providing information on the energy based devices employed in surgeries and statistic data concerning RNL (transient and permanent) injury and operative time. Results: Nineteen studies were reviewed, dealing with 4468 patients in total. The operative variables considered in this study are: employed device, number of patients, pathological conditions affecting the patients, surgical treatment, RNL injury percentage and the operating time, offering an insight on different patient conditions and their relative operative outcomes. A total of 1843 patients, accounting to the 41.2% of the total pool, underwent the traditional technique operation, while 2605 patients (58.3%) were treated employing the energy based devices techniques. Thyroidectomy performed by approaches different from traditional (for example robotic, MIVAT (Mini Invasive Video Assisted thyroidectomy)) were excluded from this study. Conclusions: The energy-based vessel sealing devices in study, represent a safe and efficient alternative to the traditional clamp-and-tie hand technique in the thyroidal surgery scenario, granting a reduction in operating time while not increasing RNL injury rates. According to this information, a preference for energy based devices techniques might be expressed, furthermore, a progressively higher usage rate for these devices is expected in the near future.","output":"Energy Based Vessel Sealing Devices in Thyroid Surgery: A Systematic Review to Clarify the Relationship with Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injuries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 has significant impact on socio-economic systems worldwide, which are strongly connected with the use of natural resources.

The study uses a visual analytics approach for detecting changes in water use patterns in the period from January 2018 to April 2020 for the case of a regional European city (Wroc?aw, Poland). The results of the study showed that the total water consumption in April 2020 did not change significantly, therefore, it did not impact available water resources in the water supply system. However, the amount of used water in different water intake points changed comparing to the previous month mostly in housing buildings (+13.2%), commercial objects (C17.2%), and education facilities (C38.1%). The relatively similar structure of groups of users within the city is a favorable fac-tor, as it results in stable water consumption in each urban district, which is beneficial from the point of view of the urban water supply system.

Design/methodology/approach Following a theoretical approach that integrates transilience and panarchy theory as a response strategy in PBS supply chains, our qualitative study involved collecting data through 19 semi-structured interviews at six manufacturing firms during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March to August 2020) and triangulating the findings with the secondary data and that from an industry workshop. Following an inductive approach, we performed thematic data analysis in Nvivo software package. Findings The findings suggest characterising discontinuities in PBS supply chains as unmanageable external supply-side, demand-side or interactional discontinuities or other manageable deliberate or forced organisational discontinuities. Following that characterisation, we developed a conceptual framework combing both resilience and transformation into new service opportunities. Research limitations/implications We gained insights into the first-response abilities and ways of coping among manufacturing firms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though our findings capture a contemporary, eye-of-the-storm perspective on future directions, a longitudinal study on the pandemic could further validate and extend the modes of response that complement mitigation with the ability to accelerate change or innovation of internal process or external service offerings. Originality/value Combining current literature with lessons learned from the firms' immediate responses, this paper's overview and characterisation of discontinuities following the COVID-19 outbreak in PBS supply chains demonstrate how manufacturing firms can foster transilience. As such, it integrates product-based supply chain discontinuities into the domain of service-based supply chains.","output":"Responding to discontinuities in product-based service supply chains in the COVID-19 pandemic: Towards transilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an evolving and dynamic virus that causes major economic losses for the poultry industry worldwide Continuous evolution and emergence of new variants of this virus are the major challenges for controlling the disease with routine vaccination Successful vaccination usually requires the use of a homologous vaccine, which in turn necessitates continuous investigation of the circulating strains Herein, we performed a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction- (RT-PCR-) based investigation in broiler chicken flocks of the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia IBV was detected in 36 5% of the tested flocks (42 out of 115) from January 2012 to March 2014 Direct sequencing of hypervariable region-3 (HVR-3) of the Spike (S)-1 gene was performed, followed by phylogenetic analysis to determine the circulating IBV genotypes Four lineages appear to coexist in this region, including the GI-13 or 4/91 IBV (31%), GI-16 or CK/CH/LDL/97I IBV (28 6%), GI-1 or Mass IBV (19%), and GI-23 or Middle East IBV (21 4%) The latter lineage include two subgroups: IS/720/99 IBV (16 7%) and IS/Variant2/98 IBV (4 7%) Some of the detections made in the 4/91 and Mass lineages are expected to belong to the vaccine strains Lineages without a homologous vaccine in use (CK/CH/LDL/97I and Middle East) represent 50% of the isolates recovered in this study Based on identity with the vaccine sequences, field observations, and frequent detection, these two lineages appear to be out of coverage of the IBV vaccines used in Saudi Arabia This is the first time to identify Middle East lineage (IS/720/99 IBV and IS/Variant2/98 IBV) in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia","output":"Cocirculation of four infectious bronchitis virus lineages in broiler chickens in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia from 2012 to 2014"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sea star wasting disease (SSWD) is a condition that has affected asteroids for over 120 years, yet mechanistic understanding of this wasting etiology remains elusive.

Read recruitment revealed only two picornavirus-like genome fragments that recruited from only SSWD-affected specimens, but neither was unique to wasting lesions. Wasting lesion margin reads recruited to a greater number of viral genotypes (i.e., richness) than did either scar tissue and grossly normal tissue reads.

However, these nonspecific symptoms can rapidly be followed by multiple organ failure and death. Deterioration often occurs despite supportive and therapeutic measures. Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment in patients who do not recover their liver function. ACLF on the other hand involves acute deterioration in liver function in a patient with pre-existing chronic liver disease leading to different organ failures. There are different definitions, classifications, and prognostic assessments of patients with ACLF. Infections (bacterial or viral) and inflammation (acute alcoholic hepatitis) are common precipitating events, although, some patients develop ACLF without a clear trigger. Similar to ALF, clinical features include jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and depressed mental status which may quickly deteriorate to multiple organ failure and death.

METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational study of patients with suspected COVID-19 and confirmed COVID-19. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings, and the presence of alternative diagnoses were evaluated. Clinical risk scores were developed based on clinical differences between patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 110 patients suspected of having COVID-19, 60.9% underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing based on the judgment of physicians. Two patients were found to have COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of 108 non-COVID-19 patients were compared with those of 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have a history of high-risk exposures and an abnormal sense of taste and smell. The COVID-19 group had significantly higher rates of subnormal white blood cell counts, lower eosinophil counts, and lower procalcitonin levels than the non-COVID-19 group. When blood test results, CT findings, and the presence of alternative diagnoses were scored on an 11-point scale (i.e., \\"COVID-19 Clinical Risk Score\\"), the COVID-19 group scored significantly higher than the non-COVID-19 group, more than four points in the COVID-19 group. All non-COVID patients who did not undergo PCR had a score of 4 or less.

Protein-protein networks were constructed and a module analysis was conducted. A network analysis was used to identify the target genes of SFD. Regarding the results obtained, 1134 DEG were identified using the STRING website. The module analysis revealed that nine hub genes exhibited ubiquitin-protein ligase activity. Therefore, SFD significantly alters the expression of ubiquitination-related genes and, thus, plays an important therapeutic role in the treatment of heart failure.

It is principally expressed by mucosal tissues, where it facilitates chemotaxis of monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages and has antimicrobial properties. CXCL17 is also implicated in the pathology of inflammatory disorders and progression of several cancers, as well as being highly upregulated during viral infections of the lung. However, the exact role of CXCL17 in health and disease is largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of known molecular targets mediating CXCL17 functional responses.

Moreover, CXCL17 interacts with neuropillin-1, a VEGFR2 co-receptor. Additionally, we find CXCL17 only inhibits CXCR4 ligand binding in intact cells and demonstrate that this effect is mimicked by known glycosaminoglycan binders, surfen and protamine sulfate. This indicates that CXCL17 inhibits CXCR4 by a unique mechanism of action that potentially requires the presence of a glycosaminoglycan containing accessory protein. Altogether, our results reveal that CXCL17 is an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 and represents an important discovery in our understanding of the (patho) physiological functions of CXCL17 and regulation of CXCR4 signalling.","output":"CXCL17 is an endogenous inhibitor of CXCR4 via a novel mechanism of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Das bereinkommen zur Erhaltung der wandernden wildlebenden Tierarten (Bonner Konvention) wurde am 23.

Previous investigators have suggested that cryopreserved allografts may heighten risk of nonengraftment. To date, no study has investigated the effect of cryopreservation of CD34-selected hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+HPC) used as the sole graft source. OBJECTIVE We sought to evaluate outcomes after unrelated donor or matched sibling allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34+HPC. STUDY DESIGN This was a single center analysis of adult patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent allo-HCT with cryopreserved CD34 selected allo-HCT grafts from 1/2010 to 6/2017. All patients received ablative conditioning and antirejection prophylaxis with rabbit ATG. GCSF-mobilized leukapheresis products underwent CD34 selection using the CliniMACS Reagent System. Cells were then cryopreserved in DMSO (final concentration 7.5%) to -90C using a controlled rate freezing system before transfer to vapor phase liquid nitrogen storage. In internal validation, this method has shown 92% mean CD34+ viability and 99.7% mean CD34+ recovery. Engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days of ANC  0.5. Platelet recovery was recorded as the first of 7 consecutive days with platelet count  20 K/mcL without transfusion. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate OS/RFS, and cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate relapse, NRM, and acute GvHD. RESULTS A total of 64 patients received a cryopreserved CD34 selected graft. Median CD34+ cell count before cryopreservation was 6.6  10^6/kg (range 1.4-16.1) and median CD3+ count 2.0  10^3/kg (range 0-21.1). All patients were engrafted, at a median of 11 days post-HCT (range 8-14). One patient had poor graft function in the setting of CMV viremia, requiring CD34 selected boost on day 57. Median time to platelet recovery was 16 days (range 13-99). Comparing cryopreserved versus fresh grafts, estimated 2-year OS was 70% (58-83%, 95% CI) vs 62% (57-67%, 95% CI) with fresh grafts (HR 0.86, 0.54-1.35 95% CI, p = 0.5). The estimated 2-year RFS was 59% (48-74%, 95% CI) versus 56% (51-61%, 95% CI; HR 1.01, 0.68-1.51 95% CI, p > 0.9). Cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 29% (17-41%, 95% CI) versus 23% (19-27%, 95% CI; p = 0.16), while cumulative incidence of NRM at 2 years was 17% (9-28%, 95% CI) versus 23% (19-28%, 95% CI; p = 0.24).

In this study, we report the occurrence and co-occurrence of different virus types and subtypes among the patients arriving at the pediatric emergency room of New York Presbyterian Hospital, a major urban hospital. Methods: We collected nasal swabs from the patients and their accompanying persons. We also recorded the levels (None, Mild, High, and Severe) of their symptoms (Fever, Chill, Muscle Pain, Watery Eye, Runny Nose, Sneezing, Sore throat and Cough). The collected swabs were tested for the presence of common viruses infecting the respiratory tract. Results: Human Rhinovirus was the most common virus among the patients, followed Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Human Rhinovirus was most common in summer, autumn and spring. In contrast, influenza was more common in winter. Further, Influenza A virus was more likely to co-occur with Corona Virus 229E. In comparison, Influenza was less likely to co-occur with Human Rhinovirus. Moreover, Influenza, Parainfluenza and Corona virus were associated with more severe symptoms, while Human Rhinovirus was associated with less severe symptoms. In addition, we observed that Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus were more likely to infect a patient when these viruses also infected the accompanying person. We also found that it was difficult to distinguish among viruses based on the symptoms. The inability to distinguish among different virus types and subtypes is explained by the fact that multiple viruses lead to similar symptoms.

One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARS-CoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication. Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of known binders. Here, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 M), and synthetic compounds previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 M). In combination with the developed pharmacophore model, these and other confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors may provide a basis for further similarity-based screening in independent compound databases and structural design optimization efforts, to identify 3CLpro ligands with improved potency and selectivity. Overall, this study suggests that the integration of virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning can facilitate 3CLpro-targeted small molecule screening investigations. Different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning-based screening strategies provided complementary information, helping to increase the number and diversity of identified active compounds. Finally, the resulting pharmacophore model and experimentally validated small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro provide resources to support follow-up computational screening efforts for this drug target.","output":"A Pharmacophore Model for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Small Molecule Inhibitors and in Vitro Experimental Validation of Computationally Screened Inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been recovered from different sites in the human body, including the mouth.

This research is a normative-juridical that focuses on the problem of synchronization between the two legal systems;sharia and positive law. The results show that Sharia provisions explicitly require that a lockdown be imposed for anyone and any interest (including collective worship activities) in an infectious area, except for medical personnel carrying out the mandate to provide health services to the community. Prohibition of going out or entering the disaster area can lead to the legal status of haram (strongly prohibited) or makr?h (lessly prohibited) depending on the level of emergency it causes based on information from medical experts.

We identify influential accounts from different Twitter communities discussing COVID-19, and follow these \`sentinel nodes' longitudinally from July 2020 to January 2021. We characterize sentinel nodes in terms of a linked-media preference score, and use a standardized similarity score to examine alignment of tweets within and between communities.

Many factors have contributed to the spread of COVID-19, and the success of public health interventions depends on the level of community adherence to preventative measures. Public health professionals must also understand regional demographic variation in health disparities and determinants to target interventions more effectively. In this study, a systematic evaluation of three significant interventions employed in the US, and their effectiveness in slowing the early spread of COVID-19 was conducted. Next, community-level compliance with a state-level stay at home orders was assessed to determine COVID-19 spread behavior. Finally, health disparities that may have contributed to the disproportionate acceleration of early COVID-19 spread between certain counties were characterized. The contribution of these factors for the disproportionate spread of the disease was analyzed using both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results of this investigation show that delayed implementation of public health interventions, a low level of compliance with the stay at home orders, in conjunction with health disparities, significantly contributed to the early spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Delayed Interventions, Low Compliance, and Health Disparities Amplified the Early Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past few months, health systems worldwide have been put to the test with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Even though the leading clinical manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection involve the respiratory tract, there is a non-negligible risk of systemic involvement leading to the onset of multi-organ failure with fatal consequences Since the onset of COVID-19, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease have been at increased risk of poor clinical outcomes with higher death rates Moreover, the occurrence of new-onset cardiac complications is not uncommon among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 Of importance, a significant portion of COVID-19 patients present with myocardial injury Herein, the authors discuss the mechanisms leading to myocardial and microvascular injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection and their clinical implications","output":"Myocardial and Microvascular Injury Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passive immunization with polyclonal hyper immunoglobulin (HIG) therapy represents a proven strategy by transferring immunoglobulins to patients to confer immediate protection against a range of pathogens including infectious agents and toxins.

Neuromodulation achieved with tDCS may further regulate regional cerebral perfusion affiliated through the neurovascular unit; however, components of cerebral perfusion decrease across aging. A novel neuroimaging approach, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), can aid in quantifying these regional perfusional changes. To date, the interaction of the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance across the lifespan and obtained fNIRS hemodynamic responses remain unknown. Objective: This review aims to examine the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS hemodynamic responses within the context of cognitive aging. Methods: Six databases were searched for studies. Quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was carried out to determine overall and subgroup effect sizes. Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. The overall effect size demonstrates that tDCS can alter cognitive performance and fNIRS signals, with aging being a potential intermediary in tDCS efficacy. Conclusion: From the studies included, the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS metrics are most prominent in young healthy adults and appear to become less robust with increasing age.

First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.","output":"COVID-19 mental health impact and responses in low-income and middle-income countries: reimagining global mental health."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Isolation and loneliness have become buzz words when discussing older adults during the coronavirus disease pandemic; yet, these are age-old problems.

This is of concern because both loneliness and social isolation have been linked to poor health. Poor health, in turn, can lead to worse isolation and loneliness. These health problems may lead to the older adult seeking care in the emergency department where screening and initial treatment could be initiated. Suggestions for questions that emergency nurses can ask to identify an older adult who is lonely or suffers from social isolation, as well as steps to consider when encountering the older adult with complaints of loneliness and/or social isolation, are provided, with the realization that these are only the first steps of many that would need to be taken.

Previous studies have shown that metoprolol prevents several chronic OSA-induced cardiovascular diseases through inhibiting autonomic nerve hyperactivity. It remains unclear whether chronic OSA can lead to dendritic remodeling in the brain, and whether metoprolol affects the dendritic remodeling. In this study we investigated the effect of metoprolol on dendrite morphology in a canine model of chronic OSA, which was established in beagles through clamping and reopening the endotracheal tube for 4 h every other day for 12 weeks. OSA beagles were administered metoprolol (5 mg kg(?1) d(?1)). The dendritic number, length, crossings and spine density of neurons in hippocampi and prefrontal cortices were assessed by Golgi staining. And the protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by Western blotting. We showed that chronic OSA successfully induced significant brain hypoxia evidenced by increased HIF-1 levels in CA1 region and dentate gyrus of hippocampi, as well as in prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, OSA led to markedly decreased dendrite number, length and intersections, spine loss as well as reduced BDNF levels. Administration of metoprolol effectively prevented the dendritic remodeling and spine loss induced by chronic OSA. In addition, administration of metoprolol reversed the decreased BDNF, which might be associated with the metoprolol-induced neuronal protection.

When these channels are decorated with redox-active functional groups, they can serve as the anode in metal ion batteries (LIB and SIB). Though sodium's superior relative abundance makes it a better choice over lithium, the energetically unfavourable intercalation of the larger sodium ion makes it incompatible with the commercial graphite anodes used in Li-ion batteries. Also, their sluggish movement inside the electrodes restricts the fast sodiation of SIB. Creating an electronic driving force at the electrodes via chemical manipulation can be a versatile approach to overcome this issue. Herein, we present anodes for SIB drawn on three isostructural COFs with nearly the same Highest Occupied Molecular Orbitals (HOMO) levels but with varying Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals (LUMO) energy levels. This variation in the LUMO levels has been deliberately obtained by the inclusion of electron-deficient centers (phenyl vs. tetrazine vs. bispyridine-tetrazine) substituents into the modules that make up the COF. With the reduction in the cell-potential, the electrons accumulate in the anti-bonding LUMO. Now, these electron-dosed LUMO levels become efficient anodes for attracting the otherwise sluggish sodium ions from the electrolyte. Also, the intrinsic porosity of the COF favors the lodging and diffusion of the Na+ ions. Cells made with these COFs achieve a high specific capacity (energy density) and rate performance (rapid charging-discharging), something that is not as easy for Na+ compared to the much smaller sized Li+. The bispyridine-tetrazine COF with the lowest LUMO energy shows a specific capacity of 340 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 128 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 15 A g-1. Only a 24% drop appears on increasing the current density from 0.1 to 1 A g-1, which is the lowest among all the top-performing COF derived Na-ion battery anodes.","output":"Tuning the electronic energy level of covalent organic frameworks for crafting high-rate Na-ion battery anode"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Those in the livestock industry involved in rearing animals and in producing milk, meat and eggs, must respond to two demands: one expressed by consumers, and the other by the public.

Conventional vaccine platforms, such as live attenuated vaccines and whole inactivated vaccines, can be difficult to manufacture, may cause severe side effects, and can potentially induce severe infection. Subunit vaccines carry far fewer safety concerns due to their inability to cause vaccine-based infections. The applicability of protein nanoparticles (NPs) as vaccine scaffolds is promising to prevent infectious diseases, and they have been explored for a number of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. Many types of protein NPs exist, including self-assembling NPs, bacteriophage-derived NPs, plant virus-derived NPs, and human virus-based vectors, and these particular categories will be covered in this review. These vaccines can elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses against specific pathogens, as well as provide protection against infection in a number of animal models. Furthermore, published clinical trials demonstrate the promise of applying these NP vaccine platforms, which include bacteriophage-derived NPs, in addition to multiple viral vectors that are currently used in the clinic. The continued investigations of protein NP vaccine platforms are critical to generate safer alternatives to current vaccines, advance vaccines for diseases that currently lack effective prophylactic therapies, and prepare for the rapid development of new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.

It was recognised that such restrictions could have profound impact on residents and their families. Nonetheless, these measures were strictly imposed over a prolonged period in many countries; impeding families from remaining involved in their relatives' care and diluting the meaningful connections for residents with society. It is timely to explore the impact of public health measures on people living in nursing homes from an ethical perspective. In order to foreground the ethical dimensions of the implications of visitor restrictions in nursing homes, we compiled an ethical case that reflects some recent experiences of nursing homes residents and their families, in the Irish Republic. We describe a series of events encountered by a woman and her family during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and we deploy an ethical decision-making tool to guide and structure our analysis. Our case analysis draws attention to ethical principles that are relevant to explicating the ethical duties and obligations that arise in relation to the interests, well-being, and safety of residents and their families, as well as nursing home staff and the wider community during a pandemic. These include the right of autonomy, trust, minimising harm, and proportionality. We conclude that a number of different strategies should be adopted by nursing homes and relevant regulatory bodies. This includes honest, regular communication between the nursing home staff, the resident and their family. Central to communications is the resident's wishes, their current clinical status and the all-important wider public health obligations. National strategies include mass vaccination, the timely provision of guidance documents and interventions from regulatory bodies that are patient-centred, adaptable, and cost effective.","output":"Visitor restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ethical case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disinfectant quaternary ammonium compounds (Quats) have diverse uses in a variety of consumer and commercial products, particularly cleaning products. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have become a primary tool to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces. Disinfectant Quats have very low vapor pressure, and following the use phase of the products in which they are found, disposal is typically down-the-drain to wastewater treatment systems. Consequently, the potential for the greatest environmental effect is to the aquatic environment, from treated effluent, and potentially to soils, which might be amended with wastewater biosolids. Among the earliest used and still common disinfectant Quats are the alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (ADBAC) compounds and the dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC) compounds. They are cationic surfactants often found in consumer and commercial surface cleaners. Because of their biocidal properties, disinfectant Quats are heavily regulated for human and environmental safety around the world. Consequently, there is a robust database of information regarding the ecological hazards and environmental fate of ADBAC and DDAC; however, some of the data presented are from unpublished studies that have been submitted to and reviewed by regulatory agencies (i.e., EPA and European Chemicals Agency) to support antimicrobial product registration. We summarize the available environmental fate data and the acute and chronic aquatic ecotoxicity data for freshwater species, including algae, invertebrates, fish, and plants using peer-reviewed literature and unpublished data submitted to and summarized by regulatory agencies. The lower limit of the range of the ecotoxicity data for disinfectant Quats tends to be lower than that for other surface active agents, such as nonionic or anionic surfactants. However, ecotoxicity is mitigated by environmental fate characteristics, the data for which we also summarize, including high biodegradability and a strong tendency to sorb to wastewater biosolids, sediment, and soil. As a result, disinfectant Quats are largely removed during wastewater treatment, and those residues discharged in treated effluent are likely to rapidly bind to suspended solids or sediments, thus mitigating their toxicity.","output":"Assessment of ecological hazards and environmental fate of disinfectant quaternary ammonium compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted multiple aspects of daily living, including behaviors associated with occupation, transportation, and health. It is unclear how these changes to daily living have impacted physical activity and sedentary behavior. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we add to the growing body of research on the health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining longitudinal changes in objectively measured daily physical activity and sedentary behavior among overweight or obese young adults participating in an ongoing weight loss trial in San Diego, California. METHODS: Data were collected from 315 overweight or obese (BMI: range 25.0-39.9 kg/m(2)) participants aged from 18 to 35 years between November 1, 2019, and October 30, 2020, by using the Fitbit Charge 3 (Fitbit LLC). After conducting strict filtering to find valid data on consistent wear (>10 hours per day for 250 days), data from 97 participants were analyzed to detect multiple structural changes in time series of physical activity and sedentary behavior. An algorithm was designed to detect multiple structural changes. This allowed for the automatic identification and dating of these changes in linear regression models with CIs. The number of breakpoints in regression models was estimated by using the Bayesian information criterion and residual sum of squares; the optimal segmentation corresponded to the lowest Bayesian information criterion and residual sum of squares. To quantify the changes in each outcome during the periods identified, linear mixed effects analyses were conducted. In terms of key demographic characteristics, the 97 participants included in our analyses did not differ from the 210 participants who were excluded. RESULTS: After the initiation of the shelter-in-place order in California on March 19, 2021, there were significant decreases in step counts (?2872 steps per day; 95% CI ?2734 to ?3010), light physical activity times (?41.9 minutes; 95% CI ?39.5 to ?44.3), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity times (?12.2 minutes; 95% CI ?10.6 to ?13.8), as well as significant increases in sedentary behavior times (+52.8 minutes; 95% CI 47.0-58.5). The decreases were greater than the expected declines observed during winter holidays, and as of October 30, 2020, they have not returned to the levels observed prior to the initiation of shelter-in-place orders. CONCLUSIONS: Among overweight or obese young adults, physical activity times decreased and sedentary behavior times increased concurrently with the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. The health conditions associated with a sedentary lifestyle may be additional, unintended results of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Objectively Measured Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Among Overweight Young Adults: Yearlong Longitudinal Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since this catastrophic crisis began, learning at universities has changed to distance mode to reduce person-to-person transmission of the virus.

Benefits include increased flexibility, enhanced student engagement and satisfaction, and more effective use of time spent during face-to-face teaching. However, the development and implementation of flipped classroom teaching are also associated with challenges, including time required to develop learning materials and getting students to engage with the preparatory work. This teaching tip describes a structured approach to designing and implementing the flipped classroom approach for clinical skills to allow a greater focus on practicing the hands-on skills and the provision of feedback during the laboratory session. First, the rationale for flipping the classroom and the expected benefits should be considered. On a practical level, decisions need to be made about what to include in the flipped component, how it will complement the face-to-face class, and how the resources will be created. In the design phase, adopting a structured template and aligning with established pedagogical principles is helpful. A well-designed flipped classroom motivates learners by including different elements such as quality educational media (e.g., videos), the opportunity to self-assess, and well-defined connections to relevant knowledge and skills. Student engagement with the flipped material can be promoted through different strategies such as clear communication to manage student expectations and adapting the delivery of the face-to-face component.

Methods Food and Drug Administration (FDA) online resources pertaining to COVID-19 tests, EUAs, and medical devices were consulted, as well as linked resources from the FDAs webpages. Homepages of the 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs were comprehensively reviewed. PubMed literature searches were performed, most recently in May 2021, to locate literature about the identified home tests, as were searches of Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Literature Selection Studies were included if they were performed at home or were self-collected (or collected by a parent or guardian for patients under 18 years of age), and evaluated the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results Limited data has been published for these home tests given that they are available through EUAs that do not require clinical trials. Fifteen studies were located from searching the literature, but only 2 met the inclusion criteria. Review of the home-tests' websites yielded a single study for each test with the 3 BinaxNow platforms using the same study for their EUAs. The 9 COVID-19 home tests with EUAs as of May 7, 2021 include 3 molecular tests and 6 antigen tests. These tests had similar performance based on positive percent agreement ranging from 83.5% to 97.4% and negative percent agreement ranging from 97% to 100%.

First, research suggests that fact-checking has several important limitations and is rarely successful in fully undoing the effects of misinformation exposure. Second, there are many factors driving misinformation sharing and acceptance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic-such as emotions, distrust, cognitive biases, racism, and xenophobia-and these factors both make individuals more vulnerable to certain types of misinformation and also make them impervious to future correction attempts.

In parallel, research institutes in collaboration with biotech companies have identified strategies to use viral proteins as vaccine candidates for COVID-19. Although this looks promising, they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models. As various models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing phase, biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to Phase I clinical trials. In view of the present outbreak, this looks a justified approach, but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies, we can never predict the outcomes in humans. Since animal models are critical for vaccine development and SARS-CoV-2 has different transmission dynamics, in this review we compare different animal models of SARS-CoV-2 with humans for their pathogenic, immune response and transmission dynamics that make them ideal models for vaccine testing for COVID-19. Another issue of using animal model is the ethics of using animals for research; thus, we also discuss the pros and cons of using animals for vaccine development studies.","output":"Current global vaccine and drug efforts against COVID-19: Pros and cons of bypassing animal trials."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging and radiotherapy has been met with both scepticism and excitement. However, clinical integration of AI is already well-underway. Many authors have recently reported on the AI knowledge and perceptions of radiologists/medical staff and students however there is a paucity of information regarding radiographers. Published literature agrees that AI is likely to have significant impact on radiology practice. As radiographers are at the forefront of radiology service delivery, an awareness of the current level of their perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI is essential to identify any educational needs necessary for successful adoption into practice. Aim: The aim of this survey was to determine the perceived knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI amongst UK radiographers and highlight priorities for educational provisions to support a digital healthcare ecosystem. Methods: A survey was created on Qualtrics? and promoted via social media (Twitter?/LinkedIn?). This survey was open to all UK radiographers, including students and retired radiographers. Participants were recruited by convenience, snowball sampling. Demographic information was gathered as well as data on the perceived, self-reported, knowledge, skills, and confidence in AI of respondents. Insight into what the participants understand by the term AI was gained by means of a free text response. Quantitative analysis was performed using SPSS? and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on NVivo?. Results: Four hundred and eleven responses were collected (80% from diagnostic radiography and 20% from a radiotherapy background), broadly representative of the workforce distribution in the UK. Although many respondents stated that they understood the concept of AI in general (78.7% for diagnostic and 52.1% for therapeutic radiography respondents, respectively) there was a notable lack of sufficient knowledge of AI principles, understanding of AI terminology, skills, and confidence in the use of AI technology. Many participants, 57% of diagnostic and 49% radiotherapy respondents, do not feel adequately trained to implement AI in the clinical setting. Furthermore 52% and 64%, respectively, said they have not developed any skill in AI whilst 62% and 55%, respectively, stated that there is not enough AI training for radiographers. The majority of the respondents indicate that there is an urgent need for further education (77.4% of diagnostic and 73.9% of therapeutic radiographers feeling they have not had adequate training in AI), with many respondents stating that they had to educate themselves to gain some basic AI skills. Notable correlations between confidence in working with AI and gender, age, and highest qualification were reported. Conclusion: Knowledge of AI terminology, principles, and applications by healthcare practitioners is necessary for adoption and integration of AI applications. The results of this survey highlight the perceived lack of knowledge, skills, and confidence for radiographers in applying AI solutions but also underline the need for formalised education on AI to prepare the current and prospective workforce for the upcoming clinical integration of AI in healthcare, to safely and efficiently navigate a digital future.

Influenza surveillance has been conducted in Zambia since 2008; however, only 4.3% of patients enrolled in 2011C2012 were positive for influenza. Therefore, we examined non-influenza respiratory pathogens in children with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Zambia, to estimate the scope of disease burden and determine commonly-identified respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Two reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods (single and multiplex) were used to analyze nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected from SARI cases under five years of age from January 2011 through December 2012. All specimens were negative for influenza by rRT-PCR. The panel of singleplex reactions targeted seven viruses, while the multiplex assay targeted thirty-three bacteria, fungi, and viruses. RESULTS: A set of 297 specimens were tested by singleplex rRT-PCR, and a different set of 199 were tested by multiplex rRT-PCR. Using the singleplex assay, 184/297 (61.9%) specimens were positive for one or more viruses. The most prevalent viruses were human rhinovirus (57/297; 19.2%), human adenovirus (50/297; 16.8%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (45/297; 15.2%). Using multiplex PCR, at least one virus was detected from 167/199 (83.9%) specimens, and at least one bacteria was detected from 197/199 (99.0%) specimens. Cytomegalovirus (415/199; 208.5%) and RSV (67/199; 33.7%) were the most commonly detected viruses, while Streptococcus pneumonie (109/199; 54.8%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (92/199; 46.2%) were the most commonly detected bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Single infections and co-infections of many viruses and bacteria were identified in children with SARI.

The results were compared to the general Portuguese populations HRQoL before the COVID-19 outbreak. This research also aimed to understand the factors that can influence the respondents HRQoL. METHODS: A sample of Portugals population quarantined at home (n = 904) filled in an online survey comprising the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item and the EQ-5D-5L and other questions about sociodemographic characteristics, feelings, duties and activities during the quarantine. The sample was weighted to mirror the general populations gender, age and education. Descriptive analyses and correlation coefficients were used to evaluation the respondents anxiety and HRQoL. Generalised linear models were estimated to identify determinants of HRQoL during the COVID-19 quarantine. RESULTS: The results show that individuals quarantined at home reported higher anxiety and lower HRQoL levels and that people with more anxiety tended to have a lower HRQoL. Females and elderly individuals experienced the highest levels of anxiety and poorest HRQoL. In addition, HRQoL during the quarantine can be explained by various occupational and attitudinal variables, as well as sociodemographic variables.

Initial and follow-up CXR were reviewed by three experienced radiologists to identify the predominant pattern and distribution of lung parenchymal abnormalities. RESULTS: In total, 347 CXR of 96 patients were reviewed. Initial CXR were abnormal in 41 out of 96 patients (42.7%). The mean time from onset of symptoms to CXR abnormality was 5.3 (range 1-21) days. The predominant pattern of lung abnormality was ground-glass opacity on initial CXR (51.2%) and consolidation on follow-up CXR (51.0%). Multifocal bilateral abnormalities in mixed central and peripheral distribution were seen in 63.4% and 59.2% of abnormal initial and follow-up CXR, respectively.

Ambient vibration sources can be any ground motion inducing phenomena, e.g., ocean waves, wind, industrial activity or road traffic, where each source does not need to be strictly stationary even during short times. Typically, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to obtain spectral information from the measured time series in order to estimate the HVSR, even though possible non-stationarity may bias the spectra and HVSR estimates. This problem can be alleviated by employing the HilbertCHuang Transform (HHT) instead of FFT. Comparing 1D inversion results for FFT and HHT-based HVSR estimates from data measured at a well studied, urban, permanent station, we find that HHT-based inversion models may yield a lower data misfit [Formula: see text] by up to a factor of 25, a more appropriate Vs model according to available well-log lithology, and higher confidence in the achieved model.","output":"Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio of Ambient Vibration Obtained with HilbertCHuang Transform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are a collection of autonomous nodes with a limited battery life.

One of these problems is the optimal coverage of a observed area. Indeed, whatever the domain, ensuring optimal network coverage remains a very important issue in WSNs, especially when the number of sensors is limited. In this paper, we aim to cover a two-dimensional Euclidean area with a given number of sensors by using genetic algorithm in order to find the best placement to ensure a good network coverage.

In this context, the use of a microscope drape method is proposed, to minimise aerosol spread in the wider operating theatre environment. METHODS The efficacy of the method is assessed with a simulation model, using a CMI Concept Air Trace MK2 smoke generator for aerosol generation and a Fluke 985 air particle counter to measure air particles sized 0.3-10 m in the operating theatre environment. RESULTS Aerosol spread was contained almost to baseline levels with the application of the drape barrier and the negative pressure created using suction within the drape. CONCLUSION The method is an efficient adjunct that could reduce the risk of aerosol shedding and viral transmission to the operating theatre team. It potentially allows faster operating theatre turnover and more liberal use of powered instruments during endonasal surgery.","output":"Minimising aerosol spread during endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate adolescents viewership of the third season of the Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why (13RW-3) and their engagement with show-related content, paying special attention to mental health outcomes and conversational partners. METHODS: A panel-based research platform operated by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago recruited 157 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years from its nationally representative pool of participants. Participants answered questions about how they discussed and learned about social and mental health issues portrayed in 13RW-3 (eg, masculine role pressure and sexual assault) and questions about mental wellness (eg, mental health self-efficacy and depression). After the participants completed the survey (T1), they were directed to either watch 13RW-3 as it aired for the first time (intervention group) or not watch 13RW-3 (control group). Approximately one month later (T2), all the participants were asked to complete the postsurvey. Additional survey questions about conversational partners, information seeking because of watching the show, and use of show-related content were included in the intervention postsurvey. RESULTS: Our sample (N=157) was 52.2% (n=82) female and 54.8% (n=86) White, with a mean age of 14.99 (SD 1.4) years. At T2, viewers of 13RW-3 spoke about suicide significantly more frequently than nonviewers (P=.007). From T1 to T2, viewers increasingly discussed issues explored by 13RW-3 (P=.002), especially suicide, mental health, and bullying. Adolescent viewers were most likely to speak with friends, and parents were the second most commonly named. Two variables emerged as consistent moderators of conversational choiceshaving depressive symptoms and being impacted by sexual assault. There was no association between conversational frequency and information seeking around social and mental health issues, and neither mental health self-efficacy scores nor masculine role pressure scores significantly differed between viewers and nonviewers at T2. CONCLUSIONS: Viewing 13RW-3, a globally watched television show featuring social and mental health issues, led to adolescent conversations and information searches about topics explored by the show. Depressive symptoms and the impact of sexual assault moderated several relationships, guiding participants toward engaging with certain issues and seeking out specific conversational partners. As 13RW-3s stories drove conversationsand story-driven conversations can raise awareness, reduce stigma, shift attitudes, normalize certain behaviors, and strengthen supportive relationshipspotential wellness implications for television shows featuring social and mental health issues are considerable.","output":"Investigating Viewership of Season 3 of 13 Reasons Why and the Mental Wellness of Adolescents: Partially Randomized Preference Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), is likely to be originated from bat and transmitted through intermediate hosts.

Here, we used diversity analysis of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has been proved to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for spike protein priming. We also simulated the structure of receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2S RBD) with the ACE2s to investigate their binding affinity to determine the potential intermediate animal hosts that could spread the SARS-CoV-2 to humans in South Asia.

In addition, viruses encode for an array of non-structural accessory proteins important for replication, spread, and immune evasion in the host and are often linked to virus pathogenesis. Most virus accessory proteins are non-essential for growth in cell culture because of the simplicity of the infection barriers or because they have roles only during a state of the infection that does not exist in cell cultures (i.e., tissue-specific functions), or finally because host factors in cell culture can complement their absence. For these reasons, the study of most nonessential viral factors is more complex and requires development of suitable cell culture systems and in vivo models. Approximately half of the proteins encoded by the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome have been classified as non-essential. These proteins have essential roles in vivo in counteracting antiviral responses, facilitating the spread of the virus from the sites of initial infection to the peripheral nervous system, where it establishes lifelong reservoirs, virus pathogenesis, and other regulatory roles during infection. Understanding the functions of the non-essential proteins of herpesviruses is important to understand mechanisms of viral pathogenesis but also to harness properties of these viruses for therapeutic purposes.

This places RL practitioners in a position to design systems that have never existed before and lack prior documentation in law and policy. Public agencies could intervene on complex dynamics that were previously too opaque to deliberate about, and long-held policy ambitions would finally be made tractable. In this whitepaper we illustrate this potential and how it might be technically enacted in the domains of energy infrastructure, social media recommender systems, and transportation. Alongside these unprecedented interventions come new forms of risk that exacerbate the harms already generated by standard machine learning tools. We correspondingly present a new typology of risks arising from RL design choices, falling under four categories: scoping the horizon, defining rewards, pruning information, and training multiple agents. Rather than allowing RL systems to unilaterally reshape human domains, policymakers need new mechanisms for the rule of reason, foreseeability, and interoperability that match the risks these systems pose. We argue that criteria for these choices may be drawn from emerging subfields within antitrust, tort, and administrative law. It will then be possible for courts, federal and state agencies, and non-governmental organizations to play more active roles in RL specification and evaluation.

METHODS: Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type format or a membrane-anchored format lacking the polybasic cleavage site. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these NDV-based vaccines were investigated. FINDINGS: We report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly in mice. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.

METHODS: A cohort of 55 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was prospectively recruited C blood sampling was performed at baseline, post-treatment and hospital discharge. Serum IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and other laboratory investigations were compared between treatment groups and across timepoints. Acute serum IL-6 and CRP levels were then compared to those with suspected COVID-19 (SCOVID) and age and sex matched patients with SAB and patients hospitalized for any non-infectious condition (NIC). RESULTS: IL-6 was elevated at admission in the SARS-CoV-2 cohort but at lower levels compared to matched SAB patients. Median (IQR) IL-6 at admission was 73.89 pg/mL (30.9, 126.39) in SARS-CoV-2 compared to 92.76 pg/mL (21.75, 246.55) in SAB (p=0.017); 12.50 pg/mL (3.06, 35.77) in patients with NIC; and 95.51 pg/mL (52.17, 756.67) in SCOVID. Median IL-6 and CRP levels decreased between admission and discharge timepoints. This reduction was amplified in patients treated with remdesivir and/or dexamethasone. CRP and bedside vital signs were the strongest predictors of COVID-19 severity.

In less developed settings, the WHO recommended guidelines are useful for initiating care, but are non-specific. Blood culture has low sensitivity, while radiological findings are non-specific and do not discriminate between viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. In vaccine probe studies, efficacy is dependent on the specificity of the study outcome to detect pneumonia and the impact of the vaccine on the selected outcome, and may underestimate the true burden of bacterial pneumonia. The rising incidence of antibiotic resistance, emerging respiratory pathogens, potential replacement pneumococcal disease following widespread introduction of pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, the limited specificity of chest radiography, and the poor sensitivity of blood culture are substantial obstacles to accurate surveillance.

Currently, the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. However, one of the hallmarks in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is hypoxemic respiratory failure. Management of severe cases involves procedures such as non-invasive ventilation and endotracheal intubation that have the potential to generate respiratory aerosols. During the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we need to mitigate any risks related to resuscitation as best we can, even if this is disruptive or at some point proven to be overly cautious. Unless we are presented with new evidence, any maneuver performed during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be considered an aerosol generating procedure. Limited data from the SARS epidemic suggests baseline risk of infection among health care workers may be 10%. Performing endotracheal intubation is associated with a 3-5 times higher risk. If causative, this represents an enormous potential for harm (an absolute risk increase of up 40%). Thus, performing endotracheal intubation during CPR should be treated as a very high-risk procedure and managed with the highest precautions, including donning appropriate full enhanced personal protective equipment before entering the scene, to guard against contact with both airborne and droplet particles.

The cardiovascular (CV) risk distribution and outcomes, as well as health literacy, are likely to differ from the host population. Challenges related to migrant health status, cardiovascular risk distribution and health literacy are compounded by the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) crisis. METHODS: We performed a narrative review of available evidence on migrant CV and health literacy in Europe. RESULTS: Health literacy is lower in migrants but can be improved through targeted interventions. In some subgroups of migrants, rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, most importantly hypertension and diabetes, are higher. On the other hand, there is strong evidence for a so-called healthy migrant effect, describing lower rates of CV risk distribution and mortality in a different subset of migrants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CV risk factors, as well as health literacy, are key elements in optimally managing public health responses in the ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Migrants are both an opportunity and a challenge for public health in Europe. Research aimed at better understanding the healthy migrant effect is necessary.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in adaption of a comprehensive online education period that has not been previously experienced in modern education. Aim This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate dental students' experiences with emergency remote education practices, related levels of anxiety, and sociodemographic factors affecting anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects and Methods This study was conducted during the period when social isolation measures were applied at the maximum level and face-to-face education was suspended in all dentistry faculties in Turkey due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic data and anxiety experienced by dental students were investigated using an online questionnaire. The anxiety levels were evaluated by using a 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and attitudes of the students toward distance education were determined using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Results The study included 2.290 students. A total of 76.46% of these students attended to emergency remote education practices provided by their faculty. While 66.7% of students were satisfied with the transition process of their faculty to distance education, 18.4% of them found emergency remote learning to be completely unsuccessful. Mean PSS-10 score was 24.68  6.74 and 94.8% of the students experienced moderate-to-high anxiety during the process. The compulsory and emergency remote education was found to significantly increase anxiety in private university students compared to public university students (P = 0.03) and in those students with low family income than the moderate and high ones (P = 0.01). There was a significant relationship between PSS-10 levels and students' anxiety about their academic performance, career plans, transition process to distance education, and their desire to continue remote theoretical online educations. The increase in these aforementioned parameters significantly decreased PSS-10 scores (P = 0.000). Conclusions The emergency online remote education practices during the COVID-19 pandemic caused anxiety in dentistry students.

METHODS: Retrospective clinical assessment was performed for 223 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward in Brisbane, Australia, from March 25 to May 15, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed for variables associated with the length of stay and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 223 patients, 205 (92%) recovered without the need for escalation to hospital care. The median length of stay in the virtual ward was 8 days (range 1-44 days). In total, 18 (8%) patients were referred to hospital, of which 6 (33.3%) were discharged after assessment at the emergency department. Furthermore, 12 (5.4%) patients were admitted to hospital, of which 4 (33.3%) required supplemental oxygen and 2 (16.7%) required mechanical ventilation. No deaths were recorded. Factors associated with escalation to hospital care were the following: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% CI 1.28-9.87; P=.01), sputum production (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.74-15.49; P=.001), and arthralgia (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.21-11.71; P=.02) at illness onset and a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold of &#8804;20 on a diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.25-19.63; P=.02).

Participant demographics were also collected alongside information on clinical symptoms and time to recovery. Real time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) for viral RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 three gene target 2019-nCoV assay (SeeGene Inc., Rep. of Korea) or the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay on the GeneXpert platform (Cepheid, USA). Blood samples were obtained at the time of initial swab and at up to 4 time points thereafter, for the serological assessment of antibodies against both the spike and nucleocapsid protein antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Serological response was measured using the Captia Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA (Trinity Biotech) as part of a clinical performance evaluation.

However, agrochemicals such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have caused several devastating health and ecological challenges. The study was therefore aimed at assessing the bioaccumulation of OCPs and the associated parasitological and microbial susceptibility in P. obscura to determine the possible ecological impacts of the chemical. A total of 106 specimens of Parachanna obscura fish species were sampled between July and November 2019 from Lekki Lagoon in Lagos, Nigeria. Four culture media, namely nutrient agar (NA), MacConkay agar (MCA), eosin methylene blue (EMB), and sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) were employed in microbial culture. These microbes were subjected to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, gentamicin, ofloxacin, augmentin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin to test for resistance, susceptibility and intermediate statuses before and after curing. OCPs were tested in the water, sediment, and tissues of P. obscura using gas chromatography flame ionization detector (GC-FID). P. obscura sampled in the lagoon had poor growth exponent which was characterized by negative allometry (slenderness) in the sampled fish. Although the incidence of parasitic infection in the fish was not alarming, the situation might be aggravated if the prevalent anthropogenic activities persist, resulting in immunosuppression. Regulation of anthropogenic activities in the catchment area is recommended to forestall the prognosis of health and environmental hazards associated with the agricultural, industrial, pharmaceutical, and municipal activities around the lagoon. Bacteria that conferred the most resistance to the majority of the antibiotics were Staphylococcus sp., Micrococcus sp. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp., testing positive to plasmid profile. They conferred high resistance to the antibiotics before plasmid curing but became highly susceptible post- plasmid curing. This implies that the gene for resistance in the bacteria isolates was plasmid-mediated, that is, they were obtained from the environment. In the event of an outbreak of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery, and diarrhea, there may be non-response to treatment among the infected inhabitants. The incidence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria colonies recorded in this study is of great public health concern, given the possibility of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains being passed to humans through fish consumption, resulting in increased multi-drug resistance in humans. Regulation of anthropogenic activities around the lagoon is recommended to forestall prognosis of health and environmental hazards associated with OCPs from agricultural, industrial, pharmaceutical, and municipal sources.","output":"Bioaccumulation of Organochlorine Pesticides, Procamallanus sp.

On the other hand, there is no significant difference in gender and country in learning online. Originality/value: Online learning has become crucial in higher education as far as pandemic situation is concerned. Many higher education institutions across different countries are suffering various problems from student point of view. Middle-income countries who are with limited assets and less advancements in higher education need to adhere to certain guidelines in online learning. This empirical study will help to understand the perception of students in online learning across India and Turkey. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Online learning in COVID-19 pandemic: an empirical study of Indian and Turkish higher education institutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism on understanding energy balance in humans is a relatively new and exciting field of research. The pathogenesis of obesity can be largely explained by an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, but the underlying mechanisms are far more complex. Traditional non-selective sympathetic activators have been used to artificially elevate energy utilization, or suppress appetite, however undesirable side effects are apparent with the use of these pharmacological interventions. Understanding the role of BAT, in relation to human energy homeostasis has the potential to dramatically offset the energy imbalance associated with obesity. This review discusses paradoxical effects of caffeine on peripheral adenosine receptors and the possible role of adenosine in increasing metabolism is highlighted, with consideration to the potential of central rather than peripheral mechanisms for caffeine mediated BAT thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Research on the complex physiology of adipose tissue, the embryonic lineage and function of the different types of adipocytes is summarized. In addition, the effect of BAT on overall human metabolism and the extent of the associated increase in energy expenditure are discussed. The controversy surrounding the primary -adrenoceptor involved in human BAT activation is examined, and suggestions as to the lack of translational findings from animal to human physiology and human in vitro to in vivo models are provided. This review compares and distinguishes human and rodent BAT effects, thus developing an understanding of human BAT thermogenesis to aid lifestyle interventions targeting obesity and metabolic syndrome. The focus of this review is on the effect of BAT thermogenesis on overall metabolism, and the potential therapeutic effects of caffeine in increasing metabolism via its effects on BAT.","output":"Effects of Caffeine on Brown Adipose Tissue Thermogenesis and Metabolic Homeostasis: A Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this systematic review and meta\\\\analysis was to examine clinical outcomes associated with convalescent plasma therapy in COVID\\\\19 patients.

Even though many online news products have the goal of informing their users about the news, they lack scalable and reliable tools for measuring how well they are achieving this goal, and therefore have to resort to noisy proxy metrics (e.g., click-through rates or reading time) to track their performance. As a first step towards measuring news informedness at a scale, we study the problem of quiz-style multiple-choice question generation, which may be used to survey users about their knowledge of recent news. In particular, we formulate the problem as two sequence-to-sequence tasks: question-answer generation (QAG) and distractor, or incorrect answer, generation (DG). We introduce NewsQuizQA, the first dataset intended for quiz-style question-answer generation, containing 20K human written question-answer pairs from 5K news article summaries. Using this dataset, we propose a series of novel techniques for applying large pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder models, namely PEGASUS and T5, to the tasks of question-answer generation and distractor generation. We show that our models outperform strong baselines using both automated metrics and human raters. We provide a case study of running weekly quizzes on real-world users via the Google Surveys platform over the course of two months.

In doing this our analysis points out the relationship between pandemic risk and sustainable development by considering both negative and positive impacts on the achievement of the SDG 13 targets. The ongoing COVID-19 shows the urgent need to strengthen sustainability by reducing and managing climate and environmental risks that can be supported by radical solutions provided by sustainable finance, as the European Commission emphasized in its consultation on Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy.

The patient was in good general condition on arrival and had no evidence of systemic symptoms of infection, such as fever, body aches, and cough. However, the PCR test for COVID-19 was positive. CONCLUTION: Although many dermatological findings have been reported with Coronavirus Disease, but this case has reported with no symptoms other than skin manifestations that describe a viral infection.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.","output":"Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Overfeeding in critically ill patients is associated with many complications Propofol provide non-nutritional calories, potentially causing overfeeding Patients with COVID-19 in the ICU need a large amount of sedation and Propofol is one of the most widely used drug Methods: We retrospectively studied 51 adult mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 receiving enteral nutrition We collected and analyzed demographic, nutritional parameters, and dosage of Propofol used Descriptive data were reported as means and s d or median and interquartile range (IQR) in case of skewed distributions, frequencies and percentages or ranges (minimumCmaximum) Results: Of the 51 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 76% of patients received propofol during hospitalization The mean age was 66 years old (SD  14) and 37 (73%) were men;34 (66 %) are overweight or obese An adequacy of 88% and 86% of protein and energy goals, respectively, were achieved Among patients with propofol (N = 39) administration, median intake from propofol was 260 (IQR 20-594) kcal The proportion of calories from propofol was 15% (SD 8) and mean duration of use was 8 days (SD 5 5) The length of stay in the ICU was 18 (SD  11) days on average and 14 (27%) died Conclusion: The mean proportion of non-nutritional calories in patients who receive propofol is low However, it can reach more than 500 kcal/ day in some patients Patients must have close monitoring in order to prevent overfeeding Disclosure of Interest: None declared","output":"Relevance of non-nutritional calories by propofol in Covid-19 critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes the Tetraviridae family.

The genome consists of ssRNA and the viruses in the genus Betatetravirus have monopartite genomes. Betatetraviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and has three distinct types of genomic organization. Most of the members of the group are serologically interrelated but distinguishable. The majority of the isolates were identified on the basis of their serological reaction with antiserum raised against NV. All the virus species were isolated from Lepidoptera species (moths and butterflies), principally from Saturniid, Limacodid, and Noctuid moths, and no replication in other animals has been detected. In larvae, virus replication is restricted predominantly to the cells of the midgut. With the exception of PrV, no infections by members of the Betatetravirus genus have been achieved in cultured cells, even when gRNA was transfected directly into cells. At high host densities, horizontal spread appears to be the major route of infection. Suggestive evidence exists for vertical transmission, which could be responsible for the observed persistence of tetraviruses within insect populations. The viruses replicate primarily in the cytoplasm of gut cells of several Lepidoptera species.

Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In genetics and related fields, huge amounts of data, such as genome sequences, are accumulating, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) suitable for big data analysis has become increasingly important. Unsupervised AI that can reveal novel knowledge from big data without prior knowledge or particular models is highly desirable for analyses of genome sequences, particularly for obtaining unexpected insights. We have developed a batch-learning self-organizing map (BLSOM) for oligonucleotide compositions that can reveal various novel genome characteristics. Here, we explain the data mining by the BLSOM: unsupervised and explainable AI. As a specific target, we first selected SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) because a large number of the viral genome sequences have been accumulated via worldwide efforts. We analyzed more than 0.6 million sequences collected primarily in the first year of the pandemic. BLSOMs for short oligonucleotides (e.g., 4~6-mers) allowed separation into known clades, but longer oligonucleotides further increased the separation ability and revealed subgrouping within known clades. In the case of 15-mers, there is mostly one copy in the genome; thus, 15-mers appeared after the epidemic start could be connected to mutations. Because BLSOM is an explainable AI, BLSOM for 15-mers revealed the mutations that contributed to separation into known clades and their subgroups. After introducing the detailed methodological strategies, we explained BLSOMs for various topics.

However, most of these ESM approaches are only based on self-report assessments, and therefore, studies on the ecological trajectories of their underlying mechanisms are scarce (ie, cognitive biases) and require evaluation through experimental tasks. We developed a novel ESM tool that integrates self-report measures of emotion and emotion regulation with a previously validated app-based cognitive task that allows for the assessment of underlying mechanisms during daily functioning. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to test this new tool and study its usability and the possible factors related to compliance with it in terms of latency and missing responses. Among the compliance predictors, we considered psychological and time-related variables, as well as usability, measurement reactivity, and participants satisfaction with the tool. METHODS: We conducted 2 extensive ESM studiesstudy 1 (N=84; a total of 3 assessments per day for 5 days) and study 2 (N=135; a total of 3 assessments per day for 10 days). RESULTS: In both studies, participants found the tool highly usable (average usability score >81). By using mixed regression models, we found both common and specific results for the compliance predictors. In both study 1 and study 2, latency was significantly predicted by the day (P<.001 and P=.003, respectively). Participants showed slower responses to the notification as the days of the study progressed. In study 2 but not in study 1, latency was further predicted by individual differences in overload with the use of the app, and missing responses were accounted for by individual differences in stress reactivity to notifications (P=.04). Thus, by using a more extensive design, participants who experienced higher overload during the study were characterized by slower responses to notifications (P=.01), whereas those who experienced higher stress reactivity to the notification system were characterized by higher missing responses. CONCLUSIONS: The new tool had high levels of usability. Furthermore, the study of compliance is of enormous importance when implementing novel ESM methods, including app-based cognitive tasks. The main predictors of latency and missing responses found across studies, specifically when using extensive ESM protocols (study 2), are methodology-related variables. Future research that integrates cognitive tasks in ESM designs should take these results into consideration by performing accurate estimations of participants response rates to facilitate the optimal quality of novel eHealth approaches, as in this study.","output":"A Novel Experience Sampling Method Tool Integrating Momentary Assessments of Cognitive Biases: Two Compliance, Usability, and Measurement Reactivity Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human ability to flexibly reason using analogies with domain-general content depends on mechanisms for identifying relations between concepts, and for mapping concepts and their relations across analogs.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create \\"checkpoints\\" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of adding a rapid vulnerability screening to an illness acuity tool to predict mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Large university hospital dedicated to providing COVID-19 care. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included are 1,428 consecutive inpatients aged 50 years. METHODS: Vulnerability was assessed using the modified version of PRO-AGE score (0C7; higher = worse), a validated and easy-to-administer tool that rates physical impairment, recent hospitalisation, acute mental change, weight loss and fatigue. The baseline covariates included age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), a well-known illness acuity tool. Our outcome was time-to-death within 60 days of admission. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 66 years, and 58% were male. The incidence of 60-day mortality ranged from 22% to 69% across the quartiles of modified PRO-AGE. In adjusted analysis, compared with modified PRO-AGE scores 0C1 (lowest quartile), the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for 60-day mortality for modified PRO-AGE scores 2C3, 4 and 5C7 were 1.4 (1.1C1.9), 2.0 (1.5C2.7) and 2.8 (2.1C3.8), respectively. The modified PRO-AGE predicted different mortality risk levels within each stratum of NEWS and improved the discrimination of mortality prediction models.

While a hurdle for most educators, this transition posed an even greater challenge for anatomy educators, many of whom were forced to depart from the traditional cadaver-based laboratory to a virtual format. Recent publications have discussed the rapid transition to online formats necessitated by Covid-19 and the accompanying difficulties, but none have identified specific factors that influenced the difficulty of this transition. Anatomy educators were surveyed to examine how this transition was accomplished and perceived. Of the 165 educators who responded, the majority utilized cadaver-based laboratory instruction. Educators felt that transitioning the laboratory portion of their courses was significantly more difficult and required more time than converting lecture materials. Factors that impacted the difficulty of the transition included a number of pedagogical aspects of the pre-Covid-19 curricula, including the delivery format of prior content, availability of pre-existing electronic materials, and the laboratory technique previously used. Additionally, the length of time an educator had been teaching prior to Covid-19 impacted their perception of difficulty, with newer and more senior educators finding this much more challenging than mid-tenure educators. Ease of transition may be related to previous exposure to curricular reform, experience with multiple anatomy pedagogies, and educator adaptability. While not surprising that converting a cadaver-based laboratory to an online format was challenging, knowledge of the alignment of this difficulty with prior educator pedagogy can help guide future innovations to anatomy education.","output":"Factors Impacting the Rapid Transition of Anatomy Curricula to an Online Environment in Response to Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 raised global health concerns.

The predicted protease model was reasonably good based on reports generated by different validation servers. The study further revealed that all the protease inhibitor drugs got docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein. Molecular interaction studies showed that protease structure had multiple active site residues for remdesivir, while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each. From the output of multiple sequence alignment, it is evident that ligand binding sites were conserved. The current in silico study thus, provides structural insights about the protease of COVID-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors.","output":"Binding site analysis of potential protease inhibitors of COVID-19 using AutoDock"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In modern information society, advertising remains essential for the formation of social norms, value systems, and public consciousness, especially in the conditions of a pandemic. Despite the availability of a wide range of literature devoted to various aspects of advertising, the investigation of its influence on the processes occurring in society is still relevant. Previous researches in this field focused primarily on consumer behaviour influence techniques, the effectiveness of various marketing channels, and new forms of advertising centred at increasing trust among the target audience. The purpose of this study was to uncover how advertising impacts social processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology included system analysis (for comprehensive study of coronavirus-related advertisements) and comparative analysis (to review Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian advertising strategies and identify dominant ones). The examination of coronavirus-related advertisements revealed a shift from advertising directed at increasing consumption towards its reduction. A comparative analysis of samples from Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine showed that the advertising market is closely related to the government and often appeals to negative emotions in all countries under consideration. However, their influence strategies are somewhat different. Belarus and Ukraine tend to apply provocative methods to attract the viewers attention. In contrast, the Russian advertising industry prefers using the TV appeal of socially significant persons and emotionally neutral outdoor advertisements with information on the proper rules of conduct. The results of this study can be applied by officials for developing information policies especially those related to pandemic and other extraordinary circumstances.","output":"The impact of advertising on social processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an increasing proliferation of bilateral strategic partnerships in and beyond the Indo-Pacific region. Yet such a partnership between Japan and New Zealand is underexplored. The central aim of this article is to fill the gap. This article first clarifies the definition of, and then provides an analytical framework for, a strategic partnership. The article then analyses how these countries laid the foundation of their strategic partnership and how they have since built upon that foundation. In the implementation process of the strategic partnership, this article examines three elements: 1) the consolidation of their strategic partnership in official documents; 2) the institutionalisation of regular meetings; and 3) participation in defence and security exercises. Although the Japan-New Zealand strategic partnership is still in the early stages, this article argues that it has the potential to grow further given bipartisan support and positive perceptions in civil society in both countries. This article also analyses three factors that exert an impact on the development of their strategic partnership: Chinas continued assertive maritime presence, the rejuvenation of the US-New Zealand bilateral relationship, and Japan and New Zealands ongoing commitment to the South Pacific region.","output":"Strategic partnership between Japan and New Zealand: foundation, development and prospect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the United States (US) medical education system with the necessary, yet unprecedented Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) national recommendation to pause all student clinical rotations with in-person patient care. This study is a quantitative analysis investigating the educational and psychological effects of the pandemic on US medical students and their reactions to the AAMC recommendation in order to inform medical education policy. Methods: The authors sent a cross-sectional survey via email to medical students in their clinical training years at six medical schools during the initial peak phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey questions aimed to evaluate students' perceptions of COVID-19's impact on medical education;ethical obligations during a pandemic;infection risk;anxiety and burnout;willingness and needed preparations to return to clinical rotations. Results: 741 (29.5%) students responded. Nearly all students (93.7%) were not involved in clinical rotations with in-person patient contact at the time the study was conducted. Reactions to being removed were mixed, with 75.8% feeling this was appropriate, 34.7% guilty, 33.5% disappointed, and 27.0% relieved.Most students (74.7%) agreed the pandemic had significantly disrupted their medical education, and believed they should continue with normal clinical rotations during this pandemic (61.3%). When asked if they would accept the risk of infection with COVID-19 if they returned to the clinical setting, 83.4% agreed. Students reported the pandemic had moderate effects on their stress and anxiety levels with 84.1% of respondents feeling at least somewhat anxious. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (53.5%) was the most important factor to feel safe returning to clinical rotations, followed by adequate testing for infection (19.3%) and antibody testing (16.2%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the education of US medical students in their clinical training years. The majority of students wanted to return to clinical rotations and were willing to accept the risk of COVID-19 infection. Students were most concerned with having enough PPE if allowed to return to clinical activities.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Students: A Multicenter Quantitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers play a key role in responding to pandemics like the on-going COVID-19 one. Harmful alcohol use among them could result in inefficiencies in health service delivery. This is particularly concerning in sub-Saharan Africa where the health workforce is already constrained. The aim of this study is to document the burden and correlates of harmful alcohol use among healthcare workers at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya with the aim of informing policy and practice. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of data obtained from a parent online survey that investigated the burden and factors associated with mental disorders among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. We analyzed data obtained from a sub-population of 887 participants who completed the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and multivariate analysis to determine the factors associated with harmful alcohol use. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty nine (43.9%) participants reported harmful alcohol use. The factors significantly associated with increased odds of endorsing harmful alcohol use were: being male (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.14, 2.14; p = 0.006), being unmarried (AOR = 2.06; 95% CI = 1.48, 2.89; p < 0.001), having 11-20 years of experience as compared to having 20+ years of experience (AOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.18, 3.12; p = 0.009), and being a specialist (AOR = 2.78; CI = 1.64, 4.78; p = < 0.001) or doctor (AOR = 2.82; 95% CI = 1.74, 4.63; p < 0.001) as compared to being a nurse. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of healthcare workers reported harmful alcohol use at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Males, the unmarried, those with 11C20 years of experience in the health field, doctors and specialists, were more likely to report harmful alcohol use. These findings highlight the need to institute interventions for harmful alcohol use targeting these groups of healthcare workers in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to optimize functioning of the available workforce.","output":"Harmful Alcohol Use Among Healthcare Workers at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the restructuring of health-services to prioritize the treatment of COVID-19. The severe restrictions on daily life affected the management of chronic diseases. Patients with a previous history of premature myocardial infarction (MI) are a vulnerable group requiring frequent and continued medical attention both in the pandemic and non-pandemic era. The present study was conducted to provide insight into the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on heart-healthy lifestyle and management of patients with a history of premature MI. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 170 consecutive patients with a history of premature MI who were already in regular follow-up in a tertiary out-patient prevention clinic before the pandemic. Inclusion criteria included age &#8805;18 years and being on regular follow up with the diagnosis of premature MI (documented MI before the age of 55 years) at least for one year. All patients were contacted by phone-call and replied to a 23-item questionnaire measuring the impact of the pandemic on the management, healthy lifestyle habits, and anxiety level. Results: One patient died due to COVID-19 infection; therefore the analyses were conducted in 169 patients (age: 47.67 a?? a??11.84 years, 21.3% women). The median age at first MI was 39 (IQR 10) years and the median time elapsed since the first MI was 7 years (IQR 10). The study population was highly compliant with the follow-up visits (78.1%) and pharmacological therapy (97%) before the pandemic according to the medical files. The majority (82.2%) of the patients were aware that having a history of premature MI would increase the risk and harm of COVID-19. Anxiety level increased in 62.7% of the study patients. Overall, 65.7% of the patient group reported a disruption at least in &#8805;1 component(s) of healthy life-behaviors (non-compliance with the heart-healthy diet, an increase in alcohol intake, an increase in smoking, and/or reduced physical activity) since the emergence of the outbreak. The anxiety level (p a??= a??0.001) and the prevalence of appetite change (p a??< a??0.0001) and weight gain (p a??< a??0.0001) was lower in the lifestyle compliant group than the non-compliant group. Avoidance of seeking medical care was reported in 33.7% of the patients. Statin use was 99.4% before the pandemic and decreased to 89.9% (p a??< a??0.0001) a??despite the fact that medications were reimbursed and widely available. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the heart-healthy lifestyle and anxiety levels of patients with a history of premature MI who were already in regular follow-up in a tertiary prevention clinic and led to significant avoidance of medical care. More rigorous follow-up, education, and reassurance of these patients with telemedicine are necessary for the prevention of further increase in their risk.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with a previous history of premature myocardial infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exuberant inflammation manifesting as a \\"cytokine storm\\" has been suggested as a central feature in the pathogenesis of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study investigated two prognostic biomarkers, the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in patients with severe COVID-19 at the time of admission in the intensive care unit (ICU). Of 60 ICU patients with COVID-19 enrolled and analyzed in this prospective cohort study, 48 patients (80%) were alive at ICU discharge. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels at ICU admission were elevated compared with a healthy control, both in ICU nonsurvivors and ICU survivors. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels were higher in patients with a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (> 10), and the presence of septic shock or acute kidney injury. HMGB1 and IL-6 plasma levels were also higher in patients with a poor oxygenation status (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mm Hg) and a longer duration of ventilation (> 7 days). Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission also correlated with other prognostic markers, including the maximum neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer levels, and C-reactive protein levels. Plasma HMGB1 and IL-6 levels at ICU admission predicted ICU mortality with comparable accuracy to the SOFA score and the COVID-GRAM risk score. Higher HMGB1 and IL-6 were not independently associated with ICU mortality after adjustment for age, gender, and comorbidities in multivariate analysis models. In conclusion, plasma HMGB1 and IL6 at ICU admission may serve as prognostic biomarkers in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","output":"High Mobility Group Box 1 and Interleukin 6 at Intensive Care Unit Admission as Biomarkers in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acne is a common condition.

The introduction of these compounds constitutes a threat to human health and the environment, even at trace levels. Hence, new water treatment technologies are urgently required to effectively remove EDCs from water. The currently available technologies used in water remediation processes are expensive and ineffective, and some produce harmful by-products. Calcium-based metal-organic frameworks (Ca-MOFs) are porous synthetic materials that can potentially be applied as adsorbents. These MOFs are hydrolytically stable, biocompatible and low-cost compared with conventional porous materials. The structure of Ca-MOFs is maintained even though calcium metal centers in the structure can easily coordinate with water. Ca-MOFs and their composite derivatives have the potential for use in water purification because these biocompatible adsorbents have been shown to selectively extract a significant quantity of contaminants. This review highlights the potential of Ca-MOFs to adsorb EDCs from aqueous environments and discusses adsorbent preparation methods, adsorption mechanisms, removal capacity, water stability and recyclability.

The most affected countries are developing countries because of their weak HC infrastructure and meagre resources. Hence, building the resilience of the HC system of such countries becomes essential. Therefore, this study aims to build a resilience-based model on the HC sector of Pakistan to combat the COVID-19 and future pandemics in the country. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a novel hybrid approach to formulate a model based on resilient attributes (RAs) and resilient strategies (RSs). In the first step, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, i.e. full consistency method (FUCOM) is used to prioritize the RAs. Whereas, the fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) is used to rank the RSs. Findings: The findings suggest leadership and governance capacity to be the topmost RA. Whereas building the operational capacity of the management, resilience education and Strengthening laboratories and diagnostic systems are ranked to be the top three RSs, respectively. Practical implications: The model developed in this study and the prioritization REs and RSs will help build resilience in the HC sector of Pakistan. The policymakers and the government can take help from the prioritized REs and RSs developed in this study to help make the current HC system more resilient towards the current COVID-19 and future pandemics in the country. Originality/value: A new model has been developed to present a sound mathematical model for building resilience in the HC sector consisting of FUCOM and fuzzy QFD methods. The main contribution of the paper is the presentation of a comprehensive and more robust model that will help to make the current HC system of Pakistan more resilient. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"A new fuzzy FUCOM-QFD approach for evaluating strategies to enhance the resilience of the healthcare sector to combat the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the history of the South Dakota Mitigation Act (as it is commonly know by Lakota people) in the 1990s and early 2000s. The Mitigation Act, enacted in 1998 and implemented over a period of nine years, was meant to create a negotiated agreement between tribal governments and the state for jurisdiction over the regulation of hunting and fishing on the Missouri River that would avoid a long history of bitter litigation over jurisdictional contests. The act was also meant to return lands held by the US Army Corps of Engineers, originally acquired for the purpose of constructing three main-stem dams on the Missouri, to the tribes that had originally held the land, and to the State of South Dakota. Both the goal of negotiating state and tribal jurisdiction, and returning lands to the state and the tribes, led to heightened intensity of the very tribal-state conflicts that the act was meant avoid. Based primarily on the senatorial records of Senator Thomas Daschle (D-SD) and the gubernatorial papers of William Janklow (R), the article examines the logic of the treaty imaginary among Lakota tribal governments and their constituencies, and the liberal democratic principle of negotiation by all interested parties at the center of development of the Mitigation Act. The article ties the conflict over the act to its fundamental misrecognition of the continuing validity of treaties for Lakota people, and the family resemblance the act had to the illegal taking of the Black Hills for many Lakota and other Great Sioux Nation tribes.","output":"The Treaty Imaginary and Tribal Sovereignty in South Dakota"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a significant public health issue in China. Early warning and forecasting are one of the most cost-effective ways for HFMD control and prevention. However, relevant research is limited, especially in China with a large population and diverse climatic characteristics. This study aims to identify local specific HFMD epidemic thresholds and construct a weather-based early warning model for HFMD control and prevention across China. METHODS: Monthly notified HFMD cases and meteorological data for 22 cities selected from different climate zones from 2014 to 2018 were extracted from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System and the Meteorological Data Sharing Service System, respectively. A generalized additive model (GAM) based on meteorological factors was conducted to forecast HFMD epidemics. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to determine the value of optimal warning threshold. RESULTS: The developed model was solid in forecasting the epidemic of HFMD with all R square (R2) in the 22 cities above 85%, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) less than 1%. The warning thresholds varied by cities with the highest threshold observed in Shenzhen (n=7,195) and the lowest threshold in Liaoyang (n=12). The areas under the curve (AUC) was greater than 0.9 for all regions, indicating a satisfied discriminating ability in epidemics detection. CONCLUSIONS: The weather-based HFMD forecasting and early warning model we developed for different climate zones provides needed information on occurrence time and size of HFMD epidemics. An effective early warning system for HFMD could provide sufficient time for local authorities to implement timely interventions to minimize the HFMD morbidity and mortality.","output":"Forecast and early warning of hand, foot, and mouth disease based on meteorological factors: evidence from a multicity study of 11 meteorological geographical divisions in mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amblyomma nodosum is a Neotropical tick species distributed from Mexico to Argentina, with adult individuals infesting different mammal species, including anteaters (Pilosa: Myrmecophagidae).

While impacts are of a global magnitude, they have been felt at the most local of levels. Across the world pupils daily lives and experiences have been directly impacted by government-imposed measures and restrictions taken to address the pandemic. Existing research on the teaching of primary geography in Ireland, although both dated and limited, indicates the prevalence of didactic, textbook-based methods involving rote-learning. This points to a policy-practice gap whereby teaching methods are not aligned with those advocated by the curriculum. Primary teachers and student primary teachers have been found to hold knowledge-based encyclopaedic images of geography, failing to recognise the subjects relevance to the real-world lived experiences of pupils. This paper frames the Covid-19 as an authentic learning experience that can form the foundation for effective geography education. Pupils learn best and are more motivated to engage in a problem or issue that affects them or that they are connected to. By investigating Covid-19 through geography in the primary classroom, this paper argues that both pupils and teachers can recognise the relevance of geography to their lives and the wider world.

It was recently proposed to be involved in RNA metabolism because it was shown to associate with some cellular mRNA. Here, we identified ANXA2 as a RNA binding protein (RBP) that binds IBV (Infectious Bronchitis Virus) pseudoknot RNA. We first confirmed the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA by ultraviolet crosslinking and showed its binding to RNA pseudoknot with ANXA2 protein in vitro and in the cells. Since the RNA pseudoknot located in the frameshifting region of IBV was used as bait for cellular RBPs, we tested whether ANXA2 could regulate the frameshfting of IBV pseudoknot RNA by dual luciferase assay. Overexpression of ANXA2 significantly reduced the frameshifting efficiency from IBV pseudoknot RNA and knockdown of the protein strikingly increased the frameshifting efficiency. The results suggest that ANXA2 is a cellular RBP that can modulate the frameshifting efficiency of viral RNA, enabling it to act as an anti-viral cellular protein, and hinting at roles in RNA metabolism for other cellular mRNAs.","output":"Annexin A2 Binds RNA and Reduces the Frameshifting Efficiency of Infectious Bronchitis Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) officially announced the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency around the world on 30 January 2020 The lockdown across the countries has resulted in a postponement of routine immunization programs following the recommendations of maintaining a physical distance Delay of routine pediatric vaccinations, even for a short duration will result in an increased likelihood of vaccine preventable The primary objective of this research is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the routine childhood vaccination coverage rate in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia Methods: A cross-sectional study through an online questionnaire The targeted population was both male and female adults who have children at the age of vaccinations who are residents of the eastern region of Saudi Arabia during the period between July 2020 and September 2020 Results: 494 respondents participated in this study 378 of them have children 76 5% of them have Children had vaccination schedule during COVID-19 pandemic 66 9 vaccinated their children 33 1% of parents their children did not receive vaccines during COVID-19 82 8% of parents think vaccines should be given at its time even during the COVID pandemic Conclusion: One out of every three children has missed their routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 The pool of unimmunized children is expanding during the lockdown, making them susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases Most of the parent knows the importance of routine pediatric vaccinations","output":"Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on routine pediatric vaccination in Eastern Region, Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"HIV-1 protease (PR) is thought to be efficient targets of anti-AIDS drug design.

Binding free energies calculated by molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) suggest that compensation between binding enthalpy and entropy plays a vital role in binding of drugs to PR. Dynamics analyses show that binding of LPV, NFV and ATV highly affects structural flexibility, motion modes and dynamics behaviour of the PR, especially for two flaps.
