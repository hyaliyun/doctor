Adolescents are non-compliant in implementing health protocols during the pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the level of compliance with the 5M health protocols. It also examines the relationship between self-efficacy, motivation, and compliance with health protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data analysis was conducted on a cross-sectional survey of 978 adolescents in Surabaya, Indonesia. Multiple logistic regression was performed to analyze the relationship between the three. Furthermore, adolescent self-efficacy was measured using the General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES), while motivation scale and sociodemographic questionnaire were measured to assess the motivation and characteristics of the respondents. RESULTS: Adolescent self-efficacy in compliance with health protocols is around (92.0%) with an average GSES score of 25.52 + 4.64. The analysis showed that adolescents with high self-efficacy and motivation had a high level of adherence (OR 2.804, 95% CI 2.008, 3.915) and high motivation (OR 2.926, 95% CI 2.087, 4.102), compared to those with low self-efficacy and motivation.

However, the working mechanism on how the shared information might influence an individual decision to be vaccinated is still limited. This study embarks on adopting the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) framework. We examined the function of central route factors (information completeness and information accuracy) as well as peripheral route factors (experience sharing and social pressure) in influencing attitudes towards vaccination and the intention to obtain the vaccine. We use a factorial design to create eight different scenarios in the form of Twitter posts to test the interaction and emulate the situation on social media. In total, 528 respondents were involved in this study. Findings from this study indicated that both the central route and peripheral route significantly influence individually perceived informativeness and perceived persuasiveness. Consequently, these two factors significantly influence attitude towards vaccination and intention to obtain the vaccine. According to the findings, it is suggested that, apart from evidence-based communication, the government or any interested parties can utilize both experience sharing and social pressure elements to increase engagement related to COVID-19 vaccines on social media, such as Twitter.","output":"How Does Social Media Influence People to Get Vaccinated?

In this retrospective study, the used chest CT image dataset covered 422 subjects, including 72 confirmed COVID-19 subjects (260 studies, 30,171 images), 252 other pneumonia subjects (252 studies, 26,534 images) that contained 158 viral pneumonia subjects and 94 pulmonary tuberculosis subjects, and 98 normal subjects (98 studies, 29,838 images). In the experiment, subjects were split into training (70%), validation (15%) and testing (15%) sets. We utilized the convolutional blocks of ResNets pretrained on the public social image collections and modified the top fully connected layer to suit our task (the COVID-19 recognition). In addition, we tested the proposed method on a finegrained classification task; that is, the images of COVID-19 were further split into 3 main manifestations (ground-glass opacity with 12,924 images, consolidation with 7418 images and fibrotic streaks with 7338 images). Similarly, the data partitioning strategy of 70%-15%-15% was adopted. The best performance obtained by the pretrained ResNet50 model is 94.87% sensitivity, 88.46% specificity, 91.21% accuracy for COVID-19 versus all other groups, and an overall accuracy of 89.01% for the three-category classification in the testing set. Consistent performance was observed from the COVID-19 manifestation classification task on images basis, where the best overall accuracy of 94.08% and AUC of 0.993 were obtained by the pretrained ResNet18 (P < 0.05). All the proposed models have achieved much satisfying performance and were thus very promising in both the practical application and statistics. Transfer learning is worth for exploring to be applied in recognition and classification of COVID-19 on CT images with limited training data.

There is emerging evidence that the stress response caused by surgery as well as other perioperative therapies such as anesthesia and analgesia may promote growth of pre-existing micro-metastasis or potentially initiate tumor dissemination. Therapeutically targeting the perioperative period may therefore reduce the effect that surgical treatments have in promoting metastases, for example by combining -adrenergic receptor antagonists and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors in the perioperative setting. In this paper, we highlight some of the mechanisms that may underlie surgery-related metastatic development in colorectal cancer. These include direct tumor spillage at the time of surgery, suppression of the anti-tumor immune response, direct stimulatory effects on tumor cells, and activation of the coagulation system. We summarize in more detail results that support a role for catecholamines as major drivers of the pro-metastatic effect induced by the surgical stress response, predominantly through activation of -adrenergic signaling. Additionally, we argue that an improved understanding of surgical stress-induced dissemination, and more specifically whether it impacts on the level and nature of heterogeneity within residual tumor cells, would contribute to the successful clinical targeting of this process. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that ex-vivo analyses of colorectal cancer patient-derived samples using RGB-labeling technology can provide important insights into the heterogeneous sensitivity of tumor cells to stress signals. This suggests that intra-tumor heterogeneity is likely to influence the efficacy of perioperative -adrenergic receptor and COX-2 inhibition, and that ex-vivo characterization of heterogeneous stress response in tumor samples can synergize with other models to optimize perioperative treatments and further improve outcome in colorectal and other solid cancers.","output":"Surgical stress response and promotion of metastasis in colorectal cancer: a complex and heterogeneous process."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Web-based mindfulness programs may be beneficial in improving the well-being outcomes of those living with chronic illnesses. Adherence to programs is a key indicator in improving outcomes; however, with the digitization of programs, it is necessary to enhance engagement and encourage people to return to digital health platforms. More information is needed on how engagement strategies have been used in web-based mindfulness programs to encourage adherence. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to develop a list of engagement strategies for web-based mindfulness programs and evaluate the impact of engagement strategies on adherence. METHODS A narrative systematic review was conducted across the MEDLINE Complete, CINAHL Complete, APA PsycINFO, and Embase databases and followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Articles were screened using the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome framework. Adults aged >18 years with chronic health conditions were included in the study. Mindfulness interventions, including those in combination with mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, delivered on the web through the internet or smartphone technology were included. Interventions lasted at least 2 weeks. Studies with a randomized controlled trial design or a pilot randomized controlled trial design were included. Engagement strategies, including web-based program features and facilitator-led strategies, adherence, and retention, were included. RESULTS A total of 1265 articles were screened, of which 19 were relevant and were included in the review. On average, 70.98% (2258/3181) of the study participants were women with a mean age of 46 (SD 13) years. Most commonly, mindfulness programs were delivered to people living with mental health conditions (8/19, 42%). Of the 19 studies, 8 (42%) used only program features to encourage adherence, 5 (26%) used facilitator-led strategies, and 6 (32%) used a combination of the two. Encouraging program adherence was the most common engagement strategy used, which was used in 77% (10/13) of the facilitator-led studies and 57% (8/14) of the program feature studies. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of the studies provided a definition of adherence, which varied between 50% and 100% completion across studies. The overall mean participant compliance to the mindfulness programs was 56% (SD 15%). Most studies (10/19, 53%) had a long-term follow-up, with the most common follow-up period being 12 weeks after intervention (3/10, 30%). After the intervention, the mean retention was 78% (SD 15%). CONCLUSIONS Engagement strategies in web-based mindfulness programs comprise reminders to use the program. Other features may be suitable for encouraging adherence to interventions, and a facilitator-led component may result in higher retention. There is variance in the way adherence is measured, and intervention lengths and follow-up periods are inconsistent. More thorough reporting and a standardized framework for measuring adherence are needed to more accurately assess adherence and engagement strategies.","output":"Engagement Strategies to Improve Adherence and Retention in Web-Based Mindfulness Programs: Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the respiratory tract is the main target of SARS-CoV-2, other tissues and organs are permissive to the infection.

Bread is the commonly wasted food item in the developed world and presents a severe problem for the majority of European nations. It is the second most wasted food item in the UK after potatoes, with an equivalent of 20 million slices of bread thrown away daily. Bread is a starchy material and a rich and clean source of easily extractable fermentable sugars - this is in direct contrast to lignocellulosic feedstocks where harsh physical, chemical and/or enzymatic pretreatment processes are required for release of fermentable sugars. Furthermore, these necessary lignocellulosic pretreatment methods often produce sugars contaminated with fermentation inhibitors. Therefore, bread waste presents a clear opportunity as a potential carbon source for novel commercial processes and, to this end, several alternative routes have been developed to utilize bread waste. Possibilities for direct recycling of bread waste within the food industry are limited due to the relatively short material lifetime, stringent process and hygiene requirements. Anaerobic digestion (AD) and incineration are commonly employed methods for the valorisation of bread waste, generating limited amounts of green energy but with little other environmental or economic benefits. Most food wastes and by-products in the UK including bakery waste are treated through AD processes that fail to harness the full potential of the these wastes. This short communication reviews the challenges of handling bread waste, with a focus on a specific UK scenario. The review will consider how bread waste is generated across the supply chain, current practices to deal with the waste and logistics challenges in waste collection. The presence of clean and high-quality fermentable sugars, proteins and other nutrients in bread make it an ideal substrate for generating chemicals, fuels, bioplastics, pharmaceuticals and other renewable products through microbial fermentations. We suggest potential applications for recycling bread waste into its chemical building blocks through a fermentative route where a circular biorefining approach could maximize resource recovery and environmental savings and eliminate waste to as close to zero as possible.","output":"Recycling bread waste into chemical building blocks using a circular biorefining approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Program for Linking Academic Institutes with Industrial Sectors (Faculty for Factory) is distinguished as the first of its kind in Jordan and the region, and one of the best programs in the world Its idea is characterized as a non-traditional one, applicable to the mechanism of linking academic institutions to the productive community represented by the industrial sector Development of an applied model of cooperation between industrial companies (SMEs) and academic institutions During the life cycle of the program in 2020, Covid-19 virus appeared in the world, where the program worked to develop its goals and the nature of its work to confront the virus in all possible academic ways, starting from directing students and academics to work under one goal in proposing and adopting various ideas that contribute to supporting the Jordanian government in facing the virus FFF also participated in various governmental tasks such as providing the crisis cell responsible for planning in the Crisis Management Center with the academics who are required to complete the planning process according to the best scientific practices, in addition to participating in the various committees formed by the Prime Minister and concerned with the promotion of manufacturing operations ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"Using Innovation and Ecosystem to Transform Covide-19 from Crisis to an Opportunity: The Case of Jordanian Program Faculty for Factory (FFF)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In clinical trials with time-to-event outcome as the primary endpoint, the end of study date is often based on the number of observed events, which drives the statistical power and the sample size calculation.

Methods: We performed multi-level modeling analyses using data from the Ministry of Education on school-based infections in Ontario in the 2020-21 school year and on school-level demographics, the Ontario Marginalization Index, and census data to estimate the variability of the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections amongst elementary school students attributable to individual schools (school level, Level 1) and forward sortation areas (FSAs) of schools (area level, Level 2). We explored whether socio-economic factors within individual schools and/or factors common to schools within FSAs predicted the incidence of elementary school student infections. Results: At the school level, the proportion of students from low-income households within a school was positively related with the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 elementary school student infections ({beta}=.083,p<0.001). At the area level, the dimensions of FSA marginalization were significantly related with cumulative incidence.

Area-related variables were more likely to explain variance in cumulative incidence than school-related variables (58% versus 1%, respectively). Interpretation: Socio-economic characteristics of the geographic location of schools were more important in determining the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 elementary school student infections than individual school characteristics.

In many developed countries elimination of HBV could be targeted to special populations mostly immigrants from low resource settings. Elimination of HCV, however, remains a challenge globally. Barriers to HCV elimination include high cost of medications and the ability to engage specific at-risk populations as well as individuals who are out of medical care. In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, treatment access and screening have been further negatively impacted by social distancing rules and COVID-19-related anxieties. This threatens to throw most countries off course in their elimination efforts.

Recently, it has been shown that wearing face masks impairs social interaction by diminishing a person's ability to read the emotion of their counterparts, an essential prerequisite to respond adequately in social situations. It is easily conceivable that this may have a tangible negative influence on the communication and relationship between patients and healthcare personnel. We therefore investigated whether it has an effect on how patients perceive healthcare professionals when physicians and nursing staff wear portrait photos with their smiling faces in addition to face masks. METHODS: During the study period of 16 days, the medical staff of our Department wore surgical face masks at all times during any kind of interaction with patients. In a pseudorandomized order, all members of our staff additionally affixed their portrait photos to their work clothes on 8 of the 16 days.

The WHO has released several recommendations for coronavirus control. One of the best preventive measures is wearing a face mask in public places. According to research, wearing a face mask significantly decreases the chance of infection. As a result, a face mask detection deep learning model can be used to detect either individuals are wearing a mask or not, allowing the system to reduce the number of enforcing agents on the ground. Using the YOLOv4 architecture, the system is trained to capture facial mask features in images and real-time streams. After training 4000 epochs, the YOLOv4 object detection algorithm achieved remarkable results in real-time scenarios, with an average FPS of 49.5 and a mAP of 98%. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Real-time Covid-19 Face Mask Detection with YOLOv4"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aims to critically assess the published studies of Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for the treatment of COVID-19 and provide recommendations for future clinical trials for the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A rapid systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases on April 13, 2020. Three clinical trial registry platforms, including ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Register were also complementarily searched. Results: A total of 10 clinical studies were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 comparative nonrandomized trial, 5 single-arm trials, and 1 interim analysis. The heterogeneity among studies of the baseline disease severity and reported endpoints made a pooled analysis impossible. CQ and HCQ (with or without azithromycin) showed significant therapeutic benefit in terms of virologic clearance rate, improvement in symptoms and imaging findings, time to clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay in 1 RCT, 4 single-arm trials, and the interim analysis, whereas no treatment benefit of CQ or HCQ was observed in the remaining 4 studies. Limitations of the included studies ranged from small sample size, to insufficient information concerning baseline patient characteristics, to potential for selection bias without detailing the rationale for exclusion, and presence of confounding factors. Conclusion: Based on the studies evaluated, there still lacked solid evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ as a treatment for COVID-19 with or without azithromycin. This emphasized the importance of robust RCTs investing HCQ/CQ to address the evidence uncertainties.

We focused on the effect of fluoridation on the interaction of fullerene with metal ions and drugs in an aqueous solution. We considered three model systems, C(60), C(60)F(2) and C(60)F(48), and represented pristine, low-fluorinated and high-fluorinated fullerenes, respectively. Adsorption energies, deformation of fullerene and drug molecules, frontier molecular orbitals and vibrational spectra were investigated in detail. We found that different drugs and different ions interacted differently with fluorinated fullerenes. Cr(3+) and Fe(2+) ions lead to the defluorination of low-fluorinated fullerenes. Favipiravir also leads to their defluorination with the formation of HF molecules. Therefore, fluorinated fullerenes are not suitable for the delivery of favipiravir and similar drugs molecules. In contrast, we found that fluorine enhances the adsorption of Ni(2+) and Fe(3+) ions on fullerene and their activity to chloroquine. Ni(2+)-decorated fluorinated fullerenes were found to be stable and suitable carriers for the loading of chloroquine. Clear shifts of infrared, ultraviolet and visible spectra can provide control over the loading of chloroquine on Ni(2+)-doped fluorinated fullerenes.","output":"Ab Initio Insight into the Interaction of Metal-Decorated Fluorinated Carbon Fullerenes with Anti-COVID Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic declared by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, is caused by the infection of highly transmissible species of a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of July 25, 2021, there are 194,372,584 cases and 4,167,937 deaths with high variability in clinical manifestations, disease burden, and post-disease complications among different people around the globe. Overall, COVID-19 is manifested as mild to moderate in almost 90% of the cases and only the rest 10% of the cases need hospitalization. However, patients with older age and those having different comorbidities have made worst the pandemic scenario. The variability of pathological consequences and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is associated with differential hostCSARS-CoV-2 interactions, which are influenced by the factors that originated from the SARS-CoV-2 and the host. These factors usually include the genomic attributes and virulent factors of the SARS-CoV-2, the burden of coinfection with other viruses and bacteria, age and gender of the individuals, different comorbidities, immune suppressions/deficiency, genotypes of major histocompatibility complex, and blood group antigens and antibodies. We herein retrieved and reviewed literatures from PubMed, Scopus, and Google relevant to clinical complications and pathogenesis of COVID-19 among people of different age, sex, and geographical locations; genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its variants, host response under different variables, and comorbidities to summarize the dynamics of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection; and host response toward approved vaccines and treatment strategies against COVID-19. After reviewing a large number of published articles covering different aspects of host response to SARS-CoV-2, it is clear that one aspect from one region is not working with the scenario same to others, as studies have been done separately with a very small number of cases from a particular area/region of a country. Importantly, to combat such a pandemic as COVID-19, a conclusive understanding of the disease dynamics is required.

Here, we summarize our experience and successful treatment plan with a critical COVID-19 patient who required mechanical ventilation (MV). A 56-year-old man presented with a fever, cough, and dyspnea. He had not been to a medium/high risk epidemic area in the past year and had no family history of a disease cluster. COVID-19 was suspected based on clinical symptoms and radiologically detected ground-glass lung changes in the context of a normal white blood cell count (WBCC) and lymphocyte fraction (L%). A diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by nucleic acid testing. Initially, he was started on noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Because his respiratory distress worsened over the following 2 h, he was transitioned to mechanical ventilation (MV), placed in prone positioning 12 h/day, and given a multi-pronged pharmacotherapy regimen that included an antiviral cocktail (lopinavir/ritonavir plus -interferon), an immunity enhancer (thymosin 1), an anti-coagulant to prevent thrombosis (heparin). He was given an antibiotic to treat an opportunistic nosocomial infection. The patient has recovered well. The regimen applied in this case of timely evaluation, early prone positioning with MV, and a multi-pronged pharmacotherapy may be an effective strategy for patients with critical COVID-19, particularly with respect to preventing life-threatening worsening of the illness.

BACKGROUND Bariatric surgery is nowadays the only long term effective obesity treatment method. METHODS Twenty one consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with the use of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) in the Surgical Clinic of Faculty Hospital Ostrava between May 2012 and August 2012. Inclusion criteria were the body mass index (BMI) higher than 35 kg/m2 or higher than 32 kg/m2 accompanied with relevant comorbidities. RESULTS Among 21 patients in this series, there were three men (14.3%) and 18 women (85.7%). Their mean age was 40.910.2 years. Their mean preoperative BMI was 40.44.6 kg/m2. No patient had previous bariatric surgery, one patient had laparoscopic fundoplication. All operations were completed laparoscopically with no conversions to an open procedure. In two cases, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed and the gallbladder was extracted along with the gastric specimen by transgastric approach. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a safe and effective bariatric procedure with low morbidity and mortality. Based on our initial experiences it could be an indication for NOSE with transgastric approach. Obese patients would benefit from this approach due to the elimination of wound complications (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 22).","output":"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity with natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2018, an amendment to the Danish Health Care Act was passed making it a requirement for patients not proficient in Danish to pay for interpretation services in health care settings. Thereafter there has been a drastic decline in the use of professional interpreters, especially in general practice. We aimed to investigate the experiences of general practitioners (GPs) in establishing an understanding with these patients in consultations, without the presence of a professional interpreter. METHODS: The study was qualitative, based on semi-structured interviews with nine purposively selected GPs. Analysis was by interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The GPs said that after the amendment was passed, the patients chose to almost exclusively use family members or friends as ad hoc interpreters, or they attended consultations with no interpreter present at all. The GPs experienced that the use of family interpreters caused specific problems, due to both their relationship with the patient and their lack of professional interpretation skills. If no mediator was present the GPs perceived the establishment of understanding as extremely challenging. This was particularly the case if patients had chronic conditions, mental or psychosocial problems or if cultural barriers were present. According to the GPs, the challenges were not exclusively restricted to a lack of language translation, but could also involve intertwined cultural barriers or social problems. The impairment in mutual understanding had different consequences, and led to poorer treatment at many levels in health care. The lack of access to a professional interpreter also presented the GP with ethical and legal dilemmas. CONCLUSIONS: The GPs experienced that the changes in interpretation provision for patients in health care had led to professional interpretation being almost absent from general practice settings for patients subject to the fee. This led to several communication challenges, insufficient understanding in consultations, and poorer treatment of these, often very vulnerable, patients. The situation could, however, also involve the risk of epistemic injustice. The GPs experienced the situation as very unsatisfactory; it both comprised their ability to exercise their professionalism and their ethical obligations and restricted their legal rights.","output":"General practitioners experiences in consultations with foreign language patients after the introduction of a users fee for professional interpretation: a qualitative interview study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease associated with a high morbidity and mortality worldwide The accumulation of data through a prospective clinical registry enables public health authorities to make informed decisions based on real evidence obtained from surveillance of COVID-19 This registry is also fundamental to providing robust infrastructure for future research surveys The purpose of this study was to design a registry and its minimum data set (MDS), as a valid and reliable data source for reporting and benchmarking COVID-19 Methods: This cross sectional and descriptive study provides a template for the required MDS to be included in COVID-19 registry This was done by an extensive literature review and 2 round Delphi survey to validate the content, which resulted in a web-based registry created by Visual Studio 2019 and a database designed by Structured Query Language (SQL) Results: The MDS of COVID-19 registry was categorized into the administrative part with 3 sections, including 30 data elements, and the clinical part with 4 sections, including 26 data elements Furthermore, a web-based registry with modular and layered architecture was designed based on final data classes and elements Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, COVID-19 registry is the first designed instrument from information management perspectives in Iran and can become a homogenous and reliable infrastructure for collecting data on COVID-19 We hope this approach will facilitate epidemiological surveys and support policymakers to better plan for monitoring patients with COVID-19","output":"Design and development of a web-based registry for Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A possible source of microplastics has started to be released into nature because of the single-use face masks that protect us against the spread of COVID-19 and are being thrown onto the streets and into seas and nature.

In this context, the number of masks in an area of 1 km2 in 3 different cities was determined theoretically and experimentally. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were also used to evaluate plastic polymer characteristics of the single-use face mask. It was determined that the three cities produce roughly 10 tons of face masks in a day. With the increasing use of single-use plastics, the impact of face masks on microplastic pollution is of great concern.

As a result of poorly controlled activation, however, PMNs can also mediate tissue damage in numerous diseases, often by increasing tissue inflammation and injury. According to current knowledge, PMNs are not only part of the pathogenesis of infectious and autoimmune diseases but also of conditions with disturbed tissue homeostasis such as trauma and shock. Scientific advances in the past two decades have changed the role of neutrophils from that of solely immune defense cells to cells that are responsible for the general integrity of the body, even in the absence of pathogens. To better understand PMN function in the human organism, our review outlines the role of PMNs within the innate immune system. This review provides an overview of the migration of PMNs from the vascular compartment to the target tissue as well as their chemotactic processes and illuminates crucial neutrophil immune properties at the site of the lesion. The review is focused on the formation of chemotactic gradients in interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the influence of the ECM on PMN function. In addition, our review summarizes current knowledge about the phenomenon of bidirectional and reverse PMN migration, neutrophil microtubules, and the microtubule organizing center in PMN migration. As a conclusive feature, we review and discuss new findings about neutrophil behavior in cancer environment and tumor tissue.","output":"NeutrophilsFrom Bone Marrow to First-Line Defense of the Innate Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic disease globally.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the use of big data analytics on people's health based on the health indicators and core priorities in the World Health Organization (WHO) General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the European Programme of Work (EPW), approved and adopted by its Member States, in addition to SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Furthermore, we sought to identify the most relevant challenges and opportunities of these tools with respect to people's health. METHODS: Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Epistemonikos) were searched from the inception date to September 21, 2020. Systematic reviews assessing the effects of big data analytics on health indicators were included. Two authors independently performed screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessment using the AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) checklist. RESULTS: The literature search initially yielded 185 records, 35 of which met the inclusion criteria, involving more than 5,000,000 patients. Most of the included studies used patient data collected from electronic health records, hospital information systems, private patient databases, and imaging datasets, and involved the use of big data analytics for noncommunicable diseases. \\"Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease\\" and \\"suicide mortality rate\\" were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as \\"critically low\\" for 25 reviews, as \\"low\\" for 7 reviews, and as \\"moderate\\" for 3 reviews.

Though active transportation through bicycling and walking can increase physical activity and thereby positively affect health, factors that influence people's decisions to commute using active transportation modes remain underexplored and often fail to capture equity-related barriers. Increases in active transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic call for a better understanding of these influences. This study examines the commute mode choices of essential workers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA to explore the extent to which active transportation to work is explained by individual, social, and environmental factors and whether active transportation choices reflect inequalities. METHODS: Drawing on the theory of planned behavior and the social-ecological model, this study utilizes data from an online survey (N = 213) completed between June and August 2020. Bivariate analyses compare respondents who commuted using active transportation modes to those who did not using chi-square and ANOVA tests. A series of logistic regression models using forward stepwise selection, controlling for demographic characteristics and commute distance, identify salient individual, social, and environmental factors associated with active transportation. RESULTS: Nearly half of respondents changed their commute mode during the pandemic, most often to limit exposure to COVID-19. The full model, accounting for 54% of variation in active transportation commuting, indicated significantly lower odds of active transportation use among non-white (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.155) respondents and those who reported time constraints (OR: 0.450), concerns about safety from traffic (OR: 0.482), and greater satisfaction with community support for bicycling and pedestrian issues (OR: 0.551) and significantly higher odds among those who reported safety concerns around germs (OR: 1.580).

Our understanding of the disease burden is limited to data from single-center or 1-season studies in elderly patients. The HARTI study allows comparison of risk factors for progression to severe disease and medical resources utilization (MRU) during and post-hospitalization in adults diagnosed with influenza, RSV, or hMPV. METHODS: This was a prospective global study in adults hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infection (40 centers, 12 countries). Participants with influenza, RSV, or hMPV were enrolled in a substudy and followed for up to 3 months postdischarge. RESULTS: Overall, 366 influenza, 238 RSV, and 100 hMPV-infected participants enrolled in the substudy. RSV participants were older and had greater frequency of risk factors and longer duration of symptoms before hospitalization than influenza participants. The RSV and hMPV groups received more bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and oxygen supplementation. No significant differences in intensive care unit admissions or complications were observed. Readmission occurred in 20%C33% of patients within 3 months postdischarge, with the highest rates for RSV and hMPV. In-hospital death occurred in 2.5% of RSV, 1.6% of influenza, and 2% of hMPV participants. In multivariate analyses, length of stay was independently associated with country, renal disease, and increased age; probability of receiving supplemental oxygen was associated with pathogen (hMPV > RSV > influenza), abnormal chest x-ray, and increased age.

This study aimed to evaluate the validity and reliability of new instruments in the Arabic language that measure patient satisfaction with all types of removable dentures. METHODS: A three-step methodology was used to translate and test the instruments. In step one, the instruments were translated from tested German instruments to develop the pilot questionnaires. In step two, the face validity of the pilot questionnaires was tested through three rounds of interviews. There were 15, 13, and 15 participants per round, respectively. At the end of every round, the results of the interviews were discussed with an expert panel. The expert panel confirmed the form and the type of questionnaires adjustments before a new round of interviews began. At the end of step two, the final form of the questionnaires was reached. In step three, 235 questionnaires were distributed to 133 participants to estimate the construct validity of the upper jaw and the lower jaw questionnaires. After one week, the participants were asked to complete the questionnaires again. A total of 102 questionnaires were returned and used to assess the instruments reliability. Factor analysis was used to assess the construct validity. The intraclass correlation coefficient and Cronbachs alpha were used to estimate the reliability and suitability of the items in the indexes. RESULTS: The result of step one was two pilot questionnaires. The pilot questionnaires were adjusted in step two. At the end of step two, the questionnaires proved to have good face validity. Factor analyses in step three revealed that only one factor could be retained. The one-factor model explained 60.95% and 63.06 of the total variance of the upper jaw and lower jaw questionnaires, respectively. The items in every questionnaire shared the same cluster and could be summed to form an upper jaw index and lower jaw index that reflected patient satisfaction with removable dentures. Cronbachs alpha values indicated excellent internal consistency and reliability for the upper jaw questionnaire ( = 0.91) and the lower jaw questionnaire ( = 0.92). Intraclass correlation coefficient values ranged from 0.72 to 0.95, which can be considered moderate to excellent.

The occurrence of MN is increasing across China, but diagnostic methods for MN still rely on kidney biopsy and PLA2R and THSD7A detection in plasma and kidney tissue, and there has been no new biomarker for MN discovered since 2014. Immune infiltration status in MN patients suffers from the dearth of associated studies. In the present study, we aimed to find new bio-markers for MN and evaluate the role of immune cells infiltration in MN pathology. METHODS: We downloaded MN expression profile from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and used R-project to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and performed functional correlation analysis. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression and Radom Forest algorithms were used to screen and verify the bio-markers of MN. Finally, CIBERSORT was used to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells in MN tissues. RESULTS: A total of 463 DEGs were screened from the MN tissue in this study. ETS2 was identified as bio-marker for MN. The CIBERSORT results showed that there were statistical differences in monocytes, plasma cells, regulatory T cells, and memory B cells. In addition, ETS2 was positively related to monocytes, M1 phase macrophages, and neutrophils and negatively correlated to plasma cells, CD4+ T memory cells, M2 macrophages, CD8+ T cells, memory B cells, and resting mast cells. CONCLUSION: (1) Machine learning algorithms reveals Ets2 as a novel target for membranous nephropathy patients. (2) Immune infiltration plays an important part in membranous nephropathy.

CYP in LMICs are at utmost risk, given the COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures, resulting in reduced access to school-based services for nutritional and mental health needs. This study examined mental health of CYP during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Zambia and Sierra Leone. METHOD: A total of 468 disabled and disadvantaged CYP aged 12 to 25 completed a planning tool that comprised the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), as well as open-ended questions covering social connectedness, physical distancing and educational challenges during the lockdown. The community coaches screened individuals and families who could be eligible to receive emergency aid, and based on a convenience sample following distribution of aid, recipients were invited to complete the planning tool. RESULTS: The data showed that participants in the global south have increasing anxieties and fears centred on accessing offline educational resources and income loss in the family effecting food security and their ability to return to education. Mean (SD) SWEMWBS scores for all participants in Zambia and Sierra Leone, were 19.61 (3.45) and 21.65 (2.84), respectively. Mental well-being scores were lower in females, children aged 12-14 and participants with two or more disabilities. Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. CONCLUSION: The study shows that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.","output":"Mental health and wellbeing implications of the COVID-19 quarantine for disabled and disadvantaged children and young people: evidence from a cross-cultural study in Zambia and Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, older U.S. adults have been at increased risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death (1).

While remote care methods have long existed, their widespread use is unprecedented. There is little research about mental health care user and provider experiences with this transition, and no published studies to date have compared satisfaction between these groups. METHODS Canadian mental health care users (n = 332) and providers (n = 107) completed an online self-report survey from October 2020 to February 2021 hosted by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression. Using a mixed-methods approach, participants were asked about their use of remote care, including satisfaction, barriers to use, helpful and unhelpful factors, and suggestions for improvement. RESULTS Overall, 59% to 63% of health care users and 59% of health care providers were satisfied with remote care. Users reported the greatest satisfaction with the convenience of remote care, while providers were most satisfied with the speed of provision of care; all groups were least satisfied with therapeutic rapport. Health care providers were less satisfied with the user-friendliness of remote care (P < 0.001) than users, while health care users were less satisfied than providers with continuity of care (P < 0.001). The use of a video-based platform was associated with remote care satisfaction among health care users (P < 0.02), and qualitative responses support the importance of visual cues in maintaining therapeutic rapport remotely. The majority of users (55%) and providers (87%) reported a likelihood of using remote care after the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Remote mental health care is generally accepted by both users and providers, and the majority would consider using remote care following the pandemic. Suggestions for improvement include greater use of video, increased attention to body language and eye contact, consistency with in-person care, as well as increased provider training and administrative support.","output":"\\"One Degree of Separation\\": A Mixed-Methods Evaluation of Canadian Mental Health Care User and Provider Experiences With Remote Care During COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Among nursing home residents, for whom age and frailty can blunt febrile responses to illness, the temperature used to define fever can influence the clinical recognition of COVID\\\\19 symptoms. To assess the potential for differences in the definition of fever to characterize nursing home residents with COVID\\\\19 infections as symptomatic, pre\\\\symptomatic, or asymptomatic, we conducted a retrospective study on a national cohort of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Center (CLC) residents tested for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. METHODS: Residents with positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 tests were classified as asymptomatic if they did not experience any symptoms, and as symptomatic or pre\\\\symptomatic if the experienced a fever (>100.4F) before or following a positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 test, respectively. All\\\\cause 30\\\\day mortality was assessed as was the influence of a lower temperature threshold (>99.0F) on classification of residents with positive SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 tests. RESULTS: From March 2020 through November 2020, VA CLCs tested 11,908 residents for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 using RT\\\\PCR, with a positivity of rate of 13% (1557). Among residents with positive tests and using >100.4F, 321 (21%) were symptomatic, 425 (27%) were pre\\\\symptomatic, and 811 (52%) were asymptomatic. All\\\\cause 30\\\\day mortality among residents with symptomatic and pre\\\\symptomatic COVID\\\\19 infections was 24% and 26%, respectively, while those with an asymptomatic infection had mortality rates similar to residents with negative SAR\\\\CoV\\\\2 tests (10% and 5%, respectively).

With regard to COVID-19, there are still many unknowns, such as the exact case fatality rate (CFR). OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to explore the value of the discharged CFR (DCFR) to make more accurate forecasts of epidemic trends of COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS: We retrieved the epidemiological data of COVID-19 in Italy published by the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. We then used the proportion of deaths to discharged casesincluding deaths and recovered cases to calculate the total DCFR (tDCFR), monthly DCFR (mDCFR), and stage DCFR (sDCFR). Furthermore, we analyzed the trend in the mDCFR between January and December 2020 using joinpoint regression analysis, used ArcGIS version 10.7 to visualize the spatial distribution of the epidemic CFR, and assigned different colors to each province based on the CFR or tDCFR. RESULTS: We calculated the numbers and obtained the new indices of the tDCFR and mDCFR for calculating the fatality rate. The results showed that the tDCFR and mDCFR fluctuated greatly from January to May. They first showed a rapid increase followed by a rapid decline after reaching the peak. The map showed that the provinces with a high tDCFR were Emilia-Romagna, Puglia, and Lombardia. The change trend of the mDCFR over time was divided into the following 2 stages: the first stage (from January to May) and the second stage (from June to December). With regard to worldwide COVID-19 statistics, among 6 selected countries, the United States had the highest tDCFR (4.26%), while the tDCFR of the remaining countries was between 0.98% and 2.72%. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a new perspective for assessing the fatality of COVID-19 in Italy, which can use ever-changing data to calculate a more accurate CFR and scientifically predict the development trend of the epidemic.","output":"Determining the Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19 in Italy: Novel Epidemiological Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Acute myocarditis is commonly associated with viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has also been reported, however this is rare and usually resolves within days or weeks. We present a case of acute myocarditis reported after vaccination with mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) diagnosed using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). This report describes the utility of CMR in the diagnosis and follow-up of such patients using parameters which could suggest the clinical course of myocarditis. Case Summary A 23-year-old male presented in the emergency department with complaints of chest pain radiating to the left arm following vaccination with the second dose of COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna). Patient's history revealed an incidence of myocarditis in the past. CMR showed a mid-range left ventricular ejection fraction (38%) and subepicardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the inferolateral and apical myocardial segments with diffuse elevation of native T1 mapping relaxation times in all myocardial segments. The patient was admitted briefly in the intensive care unit and after a favorable clinical course was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. A follow-up CMR after 3 months revealed normalization of LVEF (57%) and native T1- times in most segments. Scarred myocardium reflecting chronic myocarditis continued to show elevated T1 times. Conclusions Our patient presenting with acute myocarditis after recent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination reported a favorable clinical course. CMR revealed increased T1 mapping relaxation times diffusely spread across the myocardium and an impairment of the left ventricular function (LVEF) during the acute phase. However, the LVEF as well as the T1 times normalized at follow-up in all segments except for myocardium affected by chronic myocarditis.","output":"Case Report: Transient Increase of CMR T1 Mapping Indices in a Patient With COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Induced Acute Myocarditis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The restoration and prosthetic rehabilitation of missing teeth are commonly performed using dental implants, which are extremely effective and long-lasting techniques due to their osteointegration ability with the preimplant tissues.

It is estimated that over 72% of Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians will be involved in a medical malpractice lawsuit by age 55. The majority of EM residencies do not include adequate education on medicolegal risk mitigation and litigation. The purpose of the study is implementation of an innovative interprofessional simulation to target this education gap. METHODS: An anonymous pre- and post-survey was distributed to participating EM providers electronically. The surveys evaluated baseline medicolegal knowledge, self-rated deposition comfort and concern regarding malpractice litigation. The simulation event involved an interactive lecture on basic tenets of medical malpractice and state legal statutes from medicolegal experts. Resident physician volunteers acted as defendant physicians during simulated depositions using a redacted, closed malpractice case. RESULTS: Eighty EM providers attended the event over two days. All attendees completed the pre-survey (80/80), and 66.3% (53/80) completed the post-survey. The majority incorrectly answered 4 of 5 medicolegal questions. The mean comfort level regarding being deposed is 1.53  0.94 on a 1-5 Likert scale (extremely uncomfortable to extremely comfortable); the mean level of concern/fear of malpractice litigation is 3.38  0.95 on a 1-5 Likert scale (not at all to extremely concerned). There was a statistically significant increase in deposition comfort level post-event (1.83, P < .01). CONCLUSION: The majority of EM physicians are inexperienced and concerned regarding litigation.

In Italy, a nationwide state of alert was declared on January 31st, leading to the confinement of the entire population from March 11 to May 18, 2020. Isolation and quarantine measures cause psychological problems, especially for individuals who are recognized as being vulnerable. Parental bonding and attachment styles play a role in the programming of the stress response system. Here, we hypothesize that the response to restricted social contact and mobility due to the pandemic has detrimental effects on mental-psychological health and that this relationship is, at least in part, modulated by parental bonding and attachment relationships that are experienced at an early age. Methods: A sample of 68 volunteer University students was screened for psychopathological symptoms (SCL-90-R and STAI-Y), stress perception (PSS), attachment style (RQ), and parental care and overcontrol (PBI) 6 months before the confinement. In the same subjects, psychopathological symptoms and stress perception were measured again during confinement. Results: Overall, psychological health and stress management deteriorated across the entire sample during confinement. Specifically, a significant increase in phobic anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and perceived stress was observed. Notably, parental bonding and attachment styles modulated the psychological status during the lockdown. Individuals with secure attachment and high levels of parental care (high care) showed increased levels of state anxiety and perceived stress in phase 2, compared with phase 1. In contrast, individuals with insecure attachment and low levels of parental care (low care) already showed a high rate of state anxiety and perceived stress in phase 1 that did not increase further during phase 2. Conclusion: The general deterioration of psychological health in the entire sample demonstrates the pervasiveness of this stressor, a decline that is partially modulated by attachment style and parental bonding. These results implicated disparate sensitivities to environmental changes in the high- and low care groups during the lockdown, the former of which shows the greatest flexibility in the response to environment, suggesting adequate and functional response to stress in high care individuals, which is not observable in the low care group.","output":"Psychological Health Issues Subsequent to SARS-Cov 2 Restrictive Measures: The Role of Parental Bonding and Attachment Style"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tripeptidyl-peptidase I, also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of sedolisins (serine-carboxyl peptidases). In humans, defects in expression of this enzyme lead to a fatal neurodegenerative disease, classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Similar enzymes have been found in the genomic sequences of several species, but neither systematic analyses of their distribution nor modeling of their structures have been previously attempted. RESULTS: We have analyzed the presence of orthologs of human CLN2 in the genomic sequences of a number of eukaryotic species. Enzymes with sequences sharing over 80% identity have been found in the genomes of macaque, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. Closely related, although clearly distinct, enzymes are present in fish (fugu and zebra), as well as in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis). A three-dimensional model of human CLN2 was built based mainly on the homology with Pseudomonas sp. 101 sedolisin. CONCLUSION: CLN2 is very highly conserved and widely distributed among higher organisms and may play an important role in their life cycles. The model presented here indicates a very open and accessible active site that is almost completely conserved among all known CLN2 enzymes. This result is somehow surprising for a tripeptidase where the presence of a more constrained binding pocket was anticipated. This structural model should be useful in the search for the physiological substrates of these enzymes and in the design of more specific inhibitors of CLN2.","output":"A model of tripeptidyl-peptidase I (CLN2), a ubiquitous and highly conserved member of the sedolisin family of serine-carboxyl peptidases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every continent, registering over 1,250,000 deaths worldwide. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on host targets remains largely limited, hampering our understanding of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. The present study used a comprehensive untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approach to capture the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that several circulating lipids acted as potential biomarkers, such as phosphatidylcholine 14:0_22:6 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96), phosphatidylcholine 16:1_22:6 (AUC = 0.97), and phosphatidylethanolamine 18:1_20:4 (AUC = 0.94). Furthermore, triglycerides and free fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid (AUC = 0.99) and oleic acid (AUC = 0.98), were well correlated to the severity of the disease. An untargeted analysis of non-critical COVID-19 patients identified a strong alteration of lipids and a perturbation of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA degradation, arachidonic acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The severity of the disease was characterized by the activation of gluconeogenesis and the metabolism of porphyrins, which play a crucial role in the progress of the infection. In addition, our study provided further evidence for considering phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity as a potential key factor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and a possible therapeutic target.

Here we developed a particulate malaria vaccine based on the same CSP epitopes but using biopolymer particles (BPs) as an antigen carrier system. Specific B- and T-cell epitope-coated BPs were assembled in vivo inside an engineered endotoxin-free mutant of Escherichia coli.

The epitope-coated BPs were purified and their composition, i.e., the polymer core and epitope identity, was confirmed. Epitope-coated BPs were used alongside soluble peptide epitopes and empty BPs to vaccinate sheep. Epitope-coated BPs showed enhanced immunogenicity by inducing anti-NANP antibody titre of EC50 > 150,000 that were at least 20 times higher than induced by the soluble peptides. We concluded that the additional T-cell epitope was not required as it did not enhance immunogenicity when compared with the B-cell epitope-coated BPs.

Synthetic lethal mutations (non-lethal when alone but lethal when combined in one genome) have been studied to develop cancer therapies. This principle can also be used against fast-evolving RNA-viruses. Indeed, targeting protein sites involved in SD + SL interactions with a drug would render any mutation of such sites, lethal. RESULTS: Here, we set up a strategy to detect intragenic pairs of SL and SD at the surface of the protein to predict less escapable drug target sites. For this, we detected SD + SL, studying HIV protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequence alignments from two groups of VIH(+) individuals: treated with drugs (T) or not (NT). Using a series of statistical approaches, we were able to propose bona fide SD + SL couples. When focusing on spatially close co-variant SD + SL couples at the surface of the protein, we found 5 SD + SL groups (2 in the protease and 3 in the reverse transcriptase), which could be good candidates to form pockets to accommodate potential drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, designing drugs targeting these specific SD + SL groups would not allow the virus to mutate any residue involved in such groups without losing an essential function. Moreover, we also show that the selection pressure induced by the treatment leads to the appearance of new mutations, which change the mutational landscape of the protein. This drives the existence of differential SD + SL couples between the drug-treated and non-treated groups. Thus, new anti-viral drugs should be designed differently to target such groups.

The primary inclusion criteria for the studies were studies that evaluated outcomes based on the etiology of the fistula (i.e. radiotherapy/ablation (RA) vs non-radiotherapy/ablation (NRA). Martini RUF classification was utilized for the subgroup analysis. RESULTS Out of 1948 papers, 7 studies with a total of 490 patients (251 in RA vs 239 NRA) were included in this study.

They have also recommended against the use of the laparoscopic approach. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of colorectal resections during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective review of a prospective institutional database. All consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergent colorectal resections between March 9 and April 15, 2020, were compared to those treated in the same period of time in 2019. Despite an overall reduction in the surgical activity of 56.3% in 2020, the two groups were similar in terms of absolute numbers of colorectal resections, type of surgery and use of laparoscopy. The overall postoperative complications rate was similar: 20% in 2019 versus 14.9% in 2020 (p = 0.518), without any difference in terms of severity. No patient during the postoperative course got infected by COVID-19, as well as none from the surgical team. Median length of hospital stay was 5 days in both groups (p = 0.555). Postponing surgery in colorectal cancer patients and performing more stomas rather than direct anastomosis is not justified. The routine use of laparoscopy should not be abandoned, thus not depriving patients of its clinically relevant early short-term benefits over open surgery.","output":"Colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak: do we need to change?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the fast global spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus C 2 (SARS-CoV-2), prevention and treatment options are direly needed in order to control infection-related morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Although drug and inactivated and attenuated virus vaccine development can require significant amounts of time and resources, DNA and RNA vaccines offer a quick, simple, and cheap treatment alternative, even when produced on a large scale. The spike protein, which has been shown as the most antigenic SARS-CoV-2 protein, has been widely selected as the target of choice for DNA/RNA vaccines. Vaccination campaigns have reported high vaccination rates and protection, but numerous unintended effects, ranging from muscle pain to death, have led to concerns about the safety of RNA/DNA vaccines. In parallel to these studies, several open reading frames (ORFs) have been found to be overlapping SARS-CoV-2 accessory genes, two of which, ORF2b and ORF-Sh, overlap the spike protein sequence. Thus, the presence of these, and potentially other ORFs on SARS-CoV-2 DNA/RNA vaccines, could lead to the translation of undesired proteins during vaccination. Herein, we discuss the translation of overlapping genes in connection with DNA/RNA vaccines. Two mRNA vaccine spike protein sequences, which have been made publicly-available, were compared to the wild-type sequence in order to uncover possible differences in putative overlapping ORFs. Notably, the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine sequence is predicted to contain no frameshifted ORFs on the positive sense strand, which highlights the utility of codon optimization in DNA/RNA vaccine design to remove undesired overlapping ORFs. Since little information is available on ORF2b or ORF-Sh, we use structural bioinformatics techniques to investigate the structure-function relationship of these proteins. The presence of putative ORFs on DNA/RNA vaccine candidates implies that overlapping genes may contribute to the translation of smaller peptides, potentially leading to unintended clinical outcomes, and that the protein-coding potential of DNA/RNA vaccines should be rigorously examined prior to administration.","output":"Are There Hidden Genes in DNA/RNA Vaccines?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite a similar mechanism of action underlying their glucose-lowering effects in type 2 diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have diverse molecular structures, raising the prospect of agent-specific, glucose-independent actions. To explore the issue of possible DPP-4 inhibitor cardiac heterogeneity, we perfused different DPP-4 inhibitors to beating mouse hearts ex vivo, at concentrations equivalent to peak plasma levels achieved in humans with standard dosing. We studied male and female mice, young non-diabetic mice, and aged diabetic high fat diet-fed mice and observed that linagliptin enhanced recovery after ischemia-reperfusion, whereas sitagliptin, alogliptin, and saxagliptin did not. DPP-4 transcripts were not detected in adult mouse cardiomyocytes by RNA sequencing and the addition of linagliptin caused 0.2% of cardiomyocyte genes to be differentially expressed. In contrast, incubation of C166 endothelial cells with linagliptin induced cell signaling characterized by phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, whereas the nitric oxide (NO) donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased serine 16 phosphorylation of the calcium regulatory protein, phospholamban in cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, linagliptin increased cardiomyocyte cGMP when cells were co-cultured with C166 endothelial cells, but not when cardiomyocytes were cultured alone. Thus, at a concentration comparable to that achieved in patients, linagliptin has direct effects on mouse hearts. The effects of linagliptin on cardiomyocytes are likely to be either off-target or indirect, mediated through NO generation by the adjacent cardiac endothelium.","output":"The Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitor Linagliptin Directly Enhances the Contractile Recovery of Mouse Hearts at a Concentration Equivalent to that Achieved with Standard Dosing in Humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of vaccine incidents have stimulated vaccine hesitance in China over the last decade. Many scholars have studied the institutional management of these incidents, but a qualitative study of stakeholders' perspectives on vaccine hesitancy in China is missing. To address this lacuna, we conducted in-depth interviews and collected online data to explore diverse stakeholders' narratives on vaccine hesitance. Our analysis shows the different perspectives of medical experts, journalists, parents, and self-defined vaccination victims on vaccination and vaccination hesitance. Medical experts generally consider vaccines, despite some flaws, as safe, and they consider most vaccine safety incidents to be related to coupling symptoms, not to vaccinations. Some parents agree with medical experts, but most do not trust vaccine safety and do not want to put their children at risk. Media professionals, online medical experts, and doctors who do not need to align with the political goal of maintaining a high vaccination rate are less positive about vaccination and consider vaccine hesitance a failure of expert-lay communication in China. Our analysis exhibits the tensions of medical expert and lay perspectives on vaccine hesitance, and suggests that vaccination experts 'see like a state', which is a finding consistent with other studies that have identified the over-politicization of expert-lay communication in Chinese public discourse.

The SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, both of which bind to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), have been implied to be a potential source of their differential transmissibility. However, the mechanistic details of prefusion spike protein binding to ACE2 remain elusive at the molecular level. Here, we performed an extensive set of equilibrium and nonequilibrium microsecond-level all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 prefusion spike proteins to determine their differential dynamic behavior. Our results indicate that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is more stable than that of SARS-CoV-1 and the energy barrier associated with the activation is higher in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that not only the receptor binding domain (RBD), but also other domains such as the N-terminal domain (NTD), could play a crucial role in the differential binding behavior of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 spike proteins.","output":"Prefusion Spike Protein Conformational Changes Are Slower in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies suggested that childhood maltreatment was associated with cyberbullying.

HFNC devices produced by different manufacturers may have varied performance. Whether there is a difference in these devices and the extent of the differences in performance remain unknown. METHODS: Four HFNC devices (AIRVO 2, TNI softFlow 50, HUMID-BH, and OH-70C) and a ventilator with an HFNC module (bellavista 1000) were evaluated. The flow was set at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, and 80 L/min, and the FiO(2) was set at 21%, 26%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%. Then, one side of the cannulas was clipped to simulate the compression, bending, or blocking of the nasal cannulas. The flow and FiO(2) of the delivered gas were recorded and compared among settings and devices. RESULTS: The actual-flow and actual-FiO(2) delivered by different settings and devices varied. AIRVO 2 had superior performance in flow and FiO(2) accuracy. bellavista 1000 and OH-70C had good performance in the accuracy of actual-flows and actual-FiO(2,) respectively. bellavista 1000 and HUMID-BH had a larger flow range from 10 to 80 L/min, but only bellavista 1000 could provide a stable flow with an excessive resistance up to 60 L/min. TNI softFlow 50 had the best flow compensation and could provide sufficient flow with excessive resistance at 20C50 L/min. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in flow, FiO(2) settings, and devices could influence the actual-flow and actual-FiO(2) delivered. AIRVO 2 and OH-70C showed better FiO(2) accuracy. TNI softFlow 50, bellavista 1000, and HUMID-BH could lower the risk of insufficient flow support due to accidental compression or blocking of the cannulas.

To evaluate the trend of the IES-score over time, we set a temporal cut-off on March 27th (the day with the highest number of deaths for COVID-19 in Italy during the first wave). 355 patients completed the questionnaire reporting an average IES-R score of 25.5 (16.4); 32.4% of participants reached a total IES-R score >32. Patients who came to visit after March 27th reported a higher psychologic impact since the IES-R score significantly increased from 23.6 (15.6) to 28.3 (17.2). A group reported higher scores (57.4% of participants reaching an IES-R score >32 were femen, versus 33.9% of men). We gathered that, at an early stage of events of this magnitude, it could be useful to submit the IES-R questionnaire in high-risk and oncological patients: we could be able to identify individuals at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorders, who may be tempted to postpone necessary medical consultations.

An in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), a useful tool for studying respiratory virus-host interactions, was used in this study to show that HPIV1 selectively infects ciliated cells within the HAE and that progeny virus is released from the apical surface with little apparent gross cytopathology. In HAE, type I interferon (IFN) is induced following infection with an HPIV1 mutant expressing defective C proteins with an F170S amino acid substitution, rHPIV1-C(F170S), but not following infection with wild-type HPIV1. IFN induction coincided with a 100- to 1,000-fold reduction in virus titer, supporting the hypothesis that the HPIV1 C proteins are critical for the inhibition of the innate immune response. Two recently characterized live attenuated HPIV1 vaccine candidates expressing mutant C proteins were also evaluated in HAE. The vaccine candidates, rHPIV1-C(R84G/Delta170)HN(T553A)L(Y942A) and rHPIV1-C(R84G/Delta170)HN(T553A)L(Delta1710-11), which contain temperature-sensitive (ts) attenuating (att) and non-ts att mutations, were highly restricted in growth in HAE at permissive (32 degrees C) and restrictive (37 degrees C) temperatures.

The existing literature fails to examine what caused this sudden outbreak from a crisis management perspective. This article attempts to fill this research gap through analysis of big data, officially released information and other social media sources to understand the root cause of the crisis as it relates to China's current management system and public health policy. The article draws the following conclusions: firstly, strict government control over information was the main reason for the early silencing of media announcements, which directly caused most people to be unprepared and unaware of COVID-19. Secondly, a choice between addressing a virus with an unknown magnitude and nature, and mitigating known public panic during a politically and culturally sensitive time, lead to falsehood and concealment. Thirdly, the weak autonomous management power of local public health management departments is not conducive for providing a timely response to the crisis. Finally, the privatization of many state-owned hospitals led to the unavailability of public health medical resources to serve affected patients in the Wuhan and Hubei Province. This article suggests that China should adopt a Singaporean-style public health crisis information management system to ensure information disclosure and information symmetry and should use it to monitor public health crises in real time. In addition, the central government should adopt the territorial administration model of a public health crisis and increase investment in public health in China.","output":"What Caused the Outbreak of COVID-19 in China: From the Perspective of Crisis Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a synopsis of the spread of epidemic influenza throughout Queensland in 1919C20 1 Statewide the story was, to a greater or lesser extent, the same C regardless of occupation or whether one was from the city or the bush, on the coast or in the far west, no one was immune;even being 300 kilometres from the nearest epicentre of the outbreak was no guarantee of safety An examination of the states newspapers, particularly the Brisbane Courier, makes it evident that outbreaks of influenza erupted almost simultaneously throughout the state Aided and abetted by Queenslands network of railways and coastal shipping, together with the crowding of people at country shows, race meetings and celebrations of the formal conclusion of World War I, the disease was swiftly diffused throughout the state This article hopes to give the reader a sense of how the sheer scale and urgency of the crisis at times overwhelmed authorities and communities","output":"Commentary: Just the tip of the iceberg: Queenslands experience of the influenza pandemic of 1918C20"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously showed that Trypanosomacruzi infection in C57BL/6 mice results in a lethal infection linked to unbalanced pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators production.

Treg cells showed a reduced proliferation rate and their frequency is progressively reduced along infection compared to effector T (Teff) cells. Also, a higher fraction of Treg cells showed a na?ve phenotype, meanwhile Teff cells were mostly of the effector memory type. T. cruzi infection was associated with the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, notably IL-27p28, and with the induction of T-bet and IFN- expression in Treg cells. Furthermore, endogenous glucocorticoids released in response to T. cruzi-driven immune activation were crucial to sustain the Treg/Teff cell balance.

Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an eating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public places. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high accuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and selecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a nonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable feature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method extracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good generalization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality problem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix with large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel multicolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d tree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each subset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel structures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the k-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For evaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using nine publically available datasets.

Previous studies found that indomethacin administered in the first 6 h of life reduces the incidence of severe IVH in VLBW neonates and decreases cerebral blood flow, suggesting a decrease in cerebral oxygen delivery. Using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we monitored cerebral oxygenation before, during and after slow indomethacin infusion in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) neonates to determine whether indomethacin decreases cerebral oxygen saturation and increases cerebral oxygen extraction.

A third vaccination in previously seronegative KTRs induced seroconversion in 56 of 174 (32.1%) KTRs with median antibody levels 119 (76-353) BAU/ml and median neutralizing capacity titer of 1:10 (0-1:40). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that initial antibody levels (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76), graft function (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.39), time after transplantation (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07) and MMF trough levels (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.88) correlated with seroconversion, p<0.05. After controlling for these confounders, the effect of MMF dose reduction was calculated using propensity score matching. KTRs in the MMF reduction group had significantly lower MMF serum concentrations prior to the third vaccination and were more likely to develop antibody levels <[]>35.2 BAU/ml than their matched KTRs (p=0.02). Conclusions: Temporary reduction in MMF dose might be a promising approach to improve the immune response in KTRs.","output":"Immune response to third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in seronegative kidney transplant recipients: possible improvement by mycophenolate mofetil reduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contrast in fluorescence microscopy images allows for the differentiation between different structures by their difference in intensities.

Children typically have very mild, or no, symptoms of infection. This makes estimations of seroprevalence in children difficult. Research is therefore required to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children. The primary objective of this study is to report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG antibodies in healthy children at baseline, 2 months and 6 months. This is the only longitudinal UK study of seroprevalence in an exclusively paediatric population. Determining the changing seroprevalence is of vital public health importance and can help inform decisions around the lifting of paediatric specific social distancing measures such as school closures and the cancellation of routine paediatric hospital services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: 1000 healthy children of healthcare workers aged between 2 and 15 years will be recruited from five UK sites (Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow, London and Manchester). The children will undergo phlebotomy at baseline, 2 months and 6 months to measure IgM and/or IgG positivity to SARS-CoV-2. A sample size of 675 patients is required to detect a 5% change in seroprevalence at each time point assuming an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.2. Adjusted probabilities for the presence of IgG and/or IgM antibodies and of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be reported using logistic regression models where appropriate.

In this field study, we evaluated the Panbio? COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott Diagnostics, Jena, Germany) for this purpose. METHODS: A total of 634 individuals (355 female; median age, 37 years; range, 9C87) were enrolled. Two nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from household (n = 338) and non-household contacts (n = 296) of COVID-19 cases. RAD testing was carried out at the point of care. The RT-PCR test used was the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). RESULTS: Household contacts were tested at a median of 2 days (range, 1C7) after diagnosis of the index case, whereas non-household contacts (n = 296) were tested at a median of 6 days (range, 1C7) after exposure. In total, 79 individuals (12.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of whom 38 (48.1%) yielded positive RAD results. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAD test was 48.1% (95% CI 37.4C58.9) and 100% (95% CI 99.3C100), respectively. Sensitivity was higher in household (50.8%; 95% CI 38.9C62.5) than in non-household (35.7%; 95% CI 16.3C61.2%) contacts. Individuals testing positive by RAD test were more likely (p < 0.001) to become symptomatic than their negative counterparts. DISCUSSION: The Panbio test displays low sensitivity in asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients, particularly in non-household contacts.

We demonstrated that E protein interacts physically with TLR2 receptor in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that this interaction is able to engage TLR2 pathway as demonstrated by its capacity to activate NF-B transcription factor and to stimulate the production of CXCL8 inflammatory chemokine in a TLR2-dependent manner. Furthermore, in agreement with the importance of NF-B in TLR signaling pathway, we showed that the chemical inhibition of this transcription factor led to significant inhibition of CXCL8 production, while blockade of P38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases resulted only in a partial CXCL8 inhibition. Overall, our findings suggest considering the envelope protein E as a novel target for COVID-19 interventions: (i) either by exploring the therapeutic effect of anti-E blocking/neutralizing antibodies in symptomatic COVID-19 patients, or (ii) as a promising non-Spike SARS-CoV-2 antigen candidate to include in the development of next generation prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 infection and disease. Importance Although, the exact mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis are unknown, recent data demonstrated that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum is associated with enhanced disease pathogenesis and mortality. Thus, determining the molecular mechanisms responsible for inflammatory cytokine production in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection could provide future therapeutic targets. In this context, to the best of our knowledge, our report is first to use a detailed molecular characterization to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 Envelope E protein binds to TLR2 receptor. Specifically, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 Envelope E protein binds to TLR2 in a direct, specific and dose-dependent manner. Investigating signalling events that control downstream activation of cytokine production show that E protein / TLR2 binding leads to the activation of NF-B transcription factor that control the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines including CXCL8.

Different levels of incorrect drape positioning relative to the field-of-view (FOV) were evaluated: slight, mild and severe. Real-time dosimeter systems (positioned on the operator's eye, chest and thyroid) were used to evaluate accumulative doses and dose rates. Different obstruction levels were evaluated and compared to the observer's perception. Additionally, patient exposure was evaluated for all scenarios using a dose area product. - Results: Up to a mild obstruction, by using the drape a dose reduction of up to 86\\\\% was obtained while a severe obstruction produced a 1000\\\\% increase in exposure, respectively for all dosimeter positions compared to the use of no drape. A similar order of magnitude was observed for patient exposure. Good agreement was obtained for the observer perception of the FOV obstruction up to 25\\\\% of the FOV; for larger obstructions, an overestimate of the obstruction was observed. - Conclusion: Patient lead drapes can reduce staff doses in interventional radiology procedures even when mildly malpositioned and obscuring the FOV.

METHODS Active phytoconstituents of NPK were filtered based on overall bioavailability and drug-likeness by Lipinski's and ADMETOX prediction. RESULTS Results indicate that IRF 7 can be selected as an efficient target in regulating immunomodulatory and anti-viral activity via network pharmacology.

The aim of this study is to assess lung perfusion changes with sCTA seen in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate them with clinical outcomes. Material: and Methods: A prospective cohort study was carried out with 45 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization at three different hospitals, between April and May 2020. In all cases, a basic clinical and demographic profile was obtained. Lung perfusion was assessed using sCTA. Evaluated imaging features included: Pattern predominance of injured lung parenchyma in both lungs (ground-glass opacities, consolidation and mixed pattern) and anatomical extension;predominant type of perfusion abnormality (increased perfusion or hypoperfusion), perfusion abnormality distribution (focal or diffuse), extension of perfusion abnormalities (mild, moderate and severe involvement);presence of vascular dilatation and vascular tortuosity.

In addition, there was significantly less total sleep for evening shifts (M=389), as compared to days off (M=408), p = 7.19E-05 and day shifts (M=417), p = 6.41E-07. Evening shifts also had less light sleep (M=229) as compared to day shift (M=243), p = 0.0009 and shifts off (M=247), p = 8.82E-08. Results also showed less REM sleep found between evening shifts (M=84) and day shifts (M=95), p = 1.28E-05. Conclusion: Night shifts and evening shifts resulted in statistically significant reduced sleep recorded on Fitbit? devices as compared to shifts off and day shifts. This is important to note because emergency physicians will spend a significant amount of their careers performing night or evening shifts. Thus it is critical for emergency medicine physicans to be aware of these sleeep changes and to adjust their sleep habits (naps before night shifts, installing blackout blinds, etc.) to ensure that they get optimal sleep amounts.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a delayed onset in America. Despite the time advantage for the implementation of preventative measures to contain its spread, the pandemic followed growth rates that paralleled those observed before in Europe. Objectives: To analyze the temporal and geographical distribution of the COVID-19 pandemic at district-level in Per during the full lockdown period in 2020. Methods: Analysis of publicly available data sets, stratified by altitude and geographical localization. Correlation tests of COVID-19 case and death rates to population prevalence of comorbidities. Results: We observe a strong protective effect of altitude from COVID-19 mortality in populations located above 2,500 m. We provide evidence that internal migration through a specific land route is a significant factor progressively overriding the protection from COVID-19 afforded by high altitude. This protection is independent of poverty indexes and is inversely correlated with the prevalence of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Discussion: Long-term adaptation to residency at high altitude may be the third general protective factor from COVID-19 severity and death, after young age and female sex. Multisystemic adaptive traits or acclimatization processes in response to chronic hypobaric hypoxia may explain the apparent protective effect of high altitude from COVID-19 death.","output":"Potential Protective Effect from COVID-19 Conferred by Altitude: A Longitudinal Analysis in Peru During Full Lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was conducted to explore the potential of associated traditional knowledge on marine resources for the sustainability of economic and general well-being among coastal communities in Terengganu.

The study used thematic analysis to identify the required themes according to the objectives. Drawing upon sustainable livelihood theory for data interpretation, the findings indicate that traditional knowledge of marine resources plays an essential role in achieving economic well-being for the coastal community in Terengganu. This is viewed from the aspect of increased living standards and improved health quality. Although exploration of traditional knowledge on marine resources is limited among the modern generation, the implications of this study highlight that identification of certain marine resources as traditional medicine for health problem solutions, selling fresh marine resources, and production of processed food from marine resources could offer ways to improve the economy of coastal communities. The study was carried out during the Covid-19 pandemic, which had limited the number of participants interviewed. Therefore, the sample size obtained is relatively small to find more significant results.

Results Similar to the vital force, telomere length and telomerase enzyme activity play an important role in maintaining cellular vitality, biological longevity, and physiological homeostasis. Telomere shortening functions as a biomarker of vital imbalance and is associated with numerous diseases and health disorders. On the other hand, health-promotion practices neutralize the pathological shortening of the telomeres, acting therapeutically in diseases or age-dependent health disorders.

There have been reports of eosinophilic infiltration of all esophageal layers in patients with achalasia. However, a routine endoscopic biopsy of the muscular layer is usually not feasible. We evaluate the safety and efficacy of muscle layer biopsy during per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) as well as the prevalence of eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa and muscular layer in patients with achalasia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All enrolled patients had diagnosed achalasia and had simultaneous biopsies of the muscular layer at the middle esophagus and distal esophageal sphincter as well as the mucosal layer of the proximal and distal esophagus during POEM. All POEM procedures took place from August 2018 to December 2018 or September 2019 to November 2019. Various demographic, disease-related, and procedure-related data were collected from chart review. Eosinophilic infiltration in the biopsy specimen was examined. KEY RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients (65% female, age range: 21C84) with a pre-procedure Eckardt score of >6 were enrolled during the study period, with the duration of their achalasia ranging from 1 to 32 years. Eighteen patients had clinical symptomatic improvement after POEM, as defined by an Eckardt score <3. Endoscopic examination did not reveal any signs of eosinophilic esophagitis. Pathologic examination of biopsies revealed eosinophilic infiltration in three of 20 patients (15%) in the distal esophageal mucosa (all <15 eosinophils/HPF) and none in the proximal esophageal mucosa. There was no eosinophilic infiltration in the distal esophageal sphincter and the middle esophageal muscle. No complication was noted due to muscle biopsy. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Submucosal tunneling during POEM provides a safe access for direct esophageal muscle biopsy. This is the first report of the simultaneous biopsy of the esophageal mucosa and muscle in patients with achalasia. Contrary to all previously published studies, the association of esophageal eosinophilic infiltration and achalasia was not observed in this small sample study. Based on our findings, immune or autoimmune reaction rather than direct eosinophilic infiltration in the muscle is more likely the cause of achalasia.","output":"Simultaneous Examination of Eosinophil Infiltration in Esophageal Mucosa and Muscle in Patients with Achalasia: Direct Biopsy of the Esophageal Muscle at Per-oral Endoscopic Myotomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social norms govern human behavior and usually change slowly over time.

In a nationwide online survey in Germany, we find that higher levels of conscientiousness and neuroticism, but none of the economic preferences (time and risk), are significantly and robustly associated with a higher willingness to sanctioning norm violators. Furthermore, there is a strong relationship between supervisors and their subordinates willingness to sanction norm violation, and we observe that females have a higher value for the appropriate fine for norm violating behavior than men.

Seven and 14 days after the first e-mail contact, dental schools received a reminder e-mail. After four and six weeks, the dental schools were contacted by telephone and asked to participate in the online survey. The processing time was eight weeks in total. RESULTS: The response rate was 89%. Preclinical endodontic education at the participating dental schools differs considerably. Theory classes ranged from 1 to 70 h (15 h mean), and practical classes ranged from 3 to 78 h (39 h mean). The faculty-to-student ratio varied between 1:4 and 1:38 (1:15 mean). Forty-five per cent of the dental schools had a specialist in endodontics teaching theory. Several dental microscopes were available for preclinical teaching purposes at 82% of the dental schools.

The purpose of this study was to validate the performance of Corona-Score in a cohort of Pakistani patients pursuing care for suspected infection. METHODS: After seeking institution's ethical committee exemption, results of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, chest x-ray findings and demographics of suspected COVID-19 cases with respiratory symptoms were recouped from electronic medical record. The pre-validated score as proposed by Kurstjens S et al., was calculated. The subjects were divided into SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative on the basis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) findings. Median and interquartile range (IQR) was calculated for the score in the two groups and the difference was assessed using the independent sample median test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was plotted. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 26, with statistical significance set at p value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of sixty cases, 30 (50%) RT-PCR positive and 30 (50%) negative with a median Corona-Score of 3.5 (IQR: 0C6) and 1.5 (IQR: 0C4) respectively, were evaluated.

Given its potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs or vaccines, MERS is one of the WHO priority diseases warranting urgent research and development of countermeasures. We aimed to assess safety and tolerability of an anti-MERS-CoV modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)-based vaccine candidate that expresses the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, MVA-MERS-S, in healthy adults. METHODS: This open-label, phase 1 trial was done at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). Participants were healthy men and women aged 18C55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 185C300 kg/m(2) and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. A key exclusion criterion was a previous MVA vaccination. For the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1  10(7) plaque-forming unit (PFU; low-dose group) or 1  10(8) PFU (high-dose group) MVA-MERS-S intramuscularly. A second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. As a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections. The primary objectives of the study were safety and tolerability of the two dosage levels and reactogenicity after administration. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary endpoint by ELISA and neutralisation tests. T-cell immunity was evaluated by interferon--linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay. All participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. Immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03615911, and EudraCT, 2014-003195-23 FINDINGS: From Dec 17, 2017, to June 5, 2018, 26 participants (14 in the low-dose group and 12 in the high-dose group) were enrolled and received the first dose of the vaccine according to their group allocation. Of these, 23 participants (12 in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group) received a second dose of MVA-MERS-S according to their group allocation after a 28-day interval and completed follow-up. Homologous primeCboost immunisation with MVA-MERS-S revealed a benign safety profile with only transient mild-to-moderate reactogenicity. Participants had no severe or serious adverse events. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group, and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. Solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) participants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. Headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine in the high-dose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events. All adverse events resolved swiftly (within 1C3 days) and without sequelae. Following booster immunisation, nine (75%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 (100%) participants in the high-dose group showed seroconversion using a MERS-CoV S1 ELISA at any timepoint during the study. Binding antibody titres correlated with MERS-CoV-specific neutralising antibodies (Spearman's correlation r=086 [95% CI 06960C09427], p=00001). MERS-CoV spike-specific T-cell responses were detected in ten (83%) of 12 immunised participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 immunised participants in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Vaccination with MVA-MERS-S had a favourable safety profile without serious or severe adverse events. Homologous primeCboost immunisation induced humoral and cell-mediated responses against MERS-CoV. A doseCeffect relationship was demonstrated for reactogenicity, but not for vaccine-induced immune responses. The data presented here support further clinical testing of MVA-MERS-S in larger cohorts to advance MERS vaccine development.

The results likewise pointed to individuals who scored high in symbolic threat and in outgroup morality as being those who felt greater rejection towards the refugees. Accordingly, our results confirm the importance of feeling of threat in relation to prejudice, and highlight two important moderating factors: precarious employment and perceived outgroup morality.","output":"Prejudice and Feeling of Threat towards Syrian Refugees: The Moderating Effects of Precarious Employment and Perceived Low Outgroup Morality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus is currently extremely contagious for humankind, which is a zoonotic tropical disease.

A novel syndrome called \\"multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\\" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease (KD), toxic shock syndrome (TSS), and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of pediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology, hematology, immunology, infectious disease, and neurology. Our protocol and recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a pediatric intensive care setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients' phenotypes. Plasmapheresis may be useful as a standard treatment to control hypercytokinemia in cases of MIS-C with severe symptoms. Long-term follow-up of patients with cardiac involvement is required to identify any sequelae of MIS-C.","output":"Algorithm for the Diagnosis and Management of the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RNA extraction is an important checkpoint for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in swab samples, but it is a major barrier to available and rapid COVID-19 testing In this study, we validated the extraction-free RT-qPCR method by heat-treatment as an accurate option to nucleic acid purification in Algerian population","output":"Improved COVID-19 Testing by Extraction-Free SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online social networks (ONSs) such as Twitter have grown to be very useful tools for the dissemination of information.

Participants were identified from a multicenter cohort of 6,361 PWH on regular follow-up at 2 university hospitals. Of 99 HIV-infected individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 63 had complete data and were included in this analysis. CALL and COVID-GRAM scores were calculated and participants were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups for each. Discrimination was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Calibration was evaluated using observed versus expected (O:E) ratios and the Hosmer-Lemeshow &#967;2 goodness-of-fit statistic. Scores were adjusted by increasing one category level in individuals with nadir CD4 lymphocyte count <200/L. Participants had a median nadir and current CD4 counts of 207 [interquartile range (IQR) 119-345] and 440 (IQR 280-719) cells/L. Ten (15.9%) individuals progressed to critical disease and 4 (6.3%) died. Assessed scores showed acceptable discrimination (area under the curve 0.701-0.771) and were overall calibrated (O:E ratio 1.01). However, both overestimated the risk of progression among individuals in the low- and high-risk categories, whereas they underestimated the risk in the intermediate category (O:E 1.20-1.21). Thus, 50% of critically ill individuals were not identified as high risk. Assigning PWH with low nadir CD4 counts a higher risk of progression reduced the proportion of individuals not identified to 20%. COVID-19 risk scores had lower performance in PWH compared with that described in the general population and failed to adequately identify individuals who progressed to critical disease.

Quality assurance metrics for these reverse transcriptase PCR tests are still evolving as testing becomes widely implemented. As testing increases, it is important to understand performance characteristics and the errors associated with these tests. Herein, we investigate a high-throughput, laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase PCR assay to determine whether modeling can generate quality control metrics that identify false-positive (FP) results due to contamination. This study reviewed repeated clinical samples focusing on positive samples that test negative on re-extraction and PCR, likely representing false positives. To identify and predict false-positive samples, we constructed machine learning derived models based on the extraction method used. These models identified variables associated with false-positive results across all methods, with sensitivities for predicting FP results ranging between 67% and 100%. Application of the models to all results predicted a total FP rate of 0.08% across all samples, or 2.3% of positive results, similar to reports for other reverse transcriptase PCR tests for RNA viruses. These models can predict quality control parameters, enabling laboratories to generate decision trees that reduce interpretation errors, allow for automated reflex testing of samples with a high FP probability, improve workflow efficiency, and increase diagnostic accuracy for patient care.","output":"Prediction of False-Positive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Molecular Results in a High-Throughput Open-Platform System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Despite their impact on daily functioning, we have limited understanding of the executive functioning of older adults with bipolar disorder (OABD).

METHODS: After excluding acutely ill patients, the executive functioning of OABD was compared to that of OADEP and healthy controls (n = 22, n = 20, n = 22; respectively). Cognitive insight, a sub-domain of executive functioning, was operationalized as the discrepancy between the participants' self-reported cognitive functioning and appraisals that were made by their care partners. To complement the cognitive profiling, the groups were compared in information processing speed, verbal memory, and visual-spatial memory. RESULTS: OABD were impaired in several cognitive domains compared to healthy controls, most prominently in executive functioning and memory. OABD had poorer executive functioning and visual-spatial memory than OADEP. The findings also tentatively point toward intact cognitive insight among OABD, while OADEP seem to have a heightened level of awareness of their cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: OABD have a unique profile of cognitive impairment compared to OADEP. It is characterized by a more severe cognitive impairment, accompanied by relatively intact cognitive insight.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to explore the views and experiences of clinical pharmacists in relation to the provision of clinical pharmacy services during COVID-19. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with pharmacists working in clinical roles in healthcare settings across Europe. Participants were recruited through professional organisations of clinical and hospitals pharmacists combined with a snowballing technique. The Pharmacy Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework and Disaster Preparedness Framework for pharmacy services were used to generate data which were analysed using the thematic framework method. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants from 16 European countries described a range of measures to protect patients, public and healthcare staff against virus transmission including developing and disseminating educational materials. Most described their involvement in aspects of evidence provision such as facilitating clinical trials, gathering and appraising evidence and disseminating clinical information. Many hospital-based pharmacists were reassigned to new roles such as intensive care. Routine clinical services were extensively interrupted and remote forms of communication were used. Most were motivated by a strong sense of professionalism to continue delivering services. A number of facilitators and barriers to prevention, preparedness and response actions were identified which related to uptake of new roles, recognition of pharmacists roles in the healthcare team, information gathering, communication with patients and healthcare professionals, and provision of routine clinical services. CONCLUSIONS: Participants in this multinational qualitative study described a range of service adaptations and adoption of novel roles to prevent and mitigate the public health impact of the pandemic.

Similar data for non\\\\tree species with separated genders are inconclusive. Recent studies on pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms (Arecaceae) suggest that species are either insect\\\\ or wind\\\\pollinated. However, the wide variety of inflorescence and floral attributes within the genus suggests mixed pollination mode involving entomophily and anemophily. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the pollination of Chamaedorea costaricana,C. macrospadix,C. pinnatifrons and C. tepejilote in two montane forests in Costa Rica. A complementary morphological analysis of floral traits was carried out to distinguish species groups within the genus according to their most probable pollination mechanism. We conducted pollinator exclusion experiments, field observations on visitors to pistillate and staminate inflorescences, and trapped airborne pollen. A cluster analysis using 18 floral traits selected for their association with wind and insect pollination syndromes was carried out using 52 Chamaedorea species. Exclusion experiments showed that both wind and insects, mostly thrips (Thysanoptera), pollinated the studied species. Thrips used staminate inflorescences as brood sites and pollinated pistillate flowers by deception. Insects caught on pistillate inflorescences transported pollen, while traps proved that pollen is wind\\\\borne. Our empirical findings clearly suggest that pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms is likely to involve both insects and wind. A cluster analysis showed that the majority of studied species have a combination of floral traits that allow for both pollination modes.

Most of these therapeutics focus only on the ectodomain of the protein leaving the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein largely unexplored. Our study focuses on the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein as it conserved amongst coronaviruses. This domain contains numerous highly conserved cysteine (cys) residues that are potential sites of S\\\\palmitoylation; a post\\\\translational modification mediated by the host enzymes (palmitoyltransferases) that add palmitate to the target protein. In other coronaviruses, palmitoylation of the cytosolic domain of the Spike protein is required for its partitioning into de novo synthesized viral progeny. Here we investigated the cytosolic domain of Spike and its interaction with the protein palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5. We have found that the Spike protein is palmitoylated on multiple juxtamembrane cysteine residues. Additionally, increased abundance of ZDHHC5 resulted in hyper\\\\palmitoylation of Spike while silencing of ZDHHC5 reduced palmitoylation as well as the ability of the human coronavirus 229E to form viral plaques in cell monolayers.

The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after 4 months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation, despite the low phylogenetic signal since fortnight 3.

The main focus of this study is to collect and prepare data on air passengers traffic worldwide with the scope of analyze the impact of travel ban on the aviation sector. Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to these hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02% to 0.12% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban.

The aims of this longitudinal survey study of 586 middle school students in the Northeast U.S. were to examine (a) changes in positive and negative social technology behaviors prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (fall 2019) compared to during the pandemic (fall 2020) including any differences by subgroups and (b) whether changes in social technology behaviors were associated with well-being outcomes and any moderating factors. We found that during this time period, there were significant increases in frequency of checking social media, social technology use before bedtime, and problematic internet use. Students also experienced significant increases in social anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms, but also increased strategies of coping when stressed. By following our preregistered analytical plan, each research aim was addressed within a multilevel modeling framework with time nested within students. We found extremely small effects of social technology behaviors associated with well-being, such as online support seeking being related to strategies when coping with stress. Though we found statistically significant effects, none of the findings met our effect size criteria (i.e., effect of >=.05). Overall, we did not find any strong support that the changes in well-being that adolescents experienced during the COVID-19 social distancing was meaningfully related to their social technology use, which is counter to the popular assumption that adolescent well-being is intricately tied to their social technology use.

Clinical information about patients undergoing lung resection while infected with this virus and pathological information about early COVID-19 pneumonia are still scarce. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old male patient underwent a right pneumonectomy for squamous cell lung carcinoma. Until the fourth postoperative day, the patient, who had minor radiological changes on chest x-ray, was asymptomatic. From this day, the COVID-19 test, which was performed after the appearance of symptoms such as fever and shortness of breath, lymphopenia and diffuse ground glass opacity in the left lung on computed tomography, was reported to be positive. The patient was given NIMV (non-invasive mechanical ventilation), and hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and azithromycin in isolation intensive care, with the diagnosis of severe pneumonia. He was discharged on the 17th postoperative day with healing of the lung lesions. The pathology specimen of the patient, who was found to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before the day of surgery, was examined retrospectively. Irregular and severe pneumocyte hyperplasia, interstitial thickening, oedema, pronounced protein exudates, diffuse enlargement of the alveolar walls, macrophage infiltration and fibroblastic proliferation, which is an indicator of early organisation, were detected. CONCLUSION: We believe that the clinical course and pathology findings obtained after right pneumonectomy in a patient with pre-symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia will guide the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient undergoing pneumonectomy and pathology findings during the incubation period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Vaccines are urgently needed to control the ongoing pandemic COVID-19 and previously-emerging MERS/SARS caused by coronavirus (CoV) infections. The CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. Structure-guided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, achieving 10-100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further clinical development. The framework of immunogen design can be universally applied to other beta-CoV vaccines to counter emerging threats.","output":"A universal design of betacoronavirus vaccines against COVID-19, MERS and SARS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has posed the greatest challenge to the water sector in the 21st century.

We evaluated attachment formation, fastener engagement, and mesh/tissue integration associated with laparoscopic fixation using a novel permanent capped helical coil fastener (HC-Capped) compared to permanent non-capped helical coil fasteners (HC-Non-Capped) in a porcine model. METHODS Twelve female pigs underwent bilateral laparoscopic intraperitoneal fixation of Composix? L/P Mesh (10  15 cm oval) with HC-Capped or HC-Non-Capped fasteners. Thirty-two fasteners were used to secure each mesh utilizing a \\"double-crown\\" technique. Laparoscopy at 30 days was used to evaluate the presence and area coverage of attachments (Diamond Score) and percentage of engaged fasteners. At 90 days, following necropsy, each mesh was evaluated for the presence, percentage, and tenacity (Butler Score) of attachments and fastener engagement. Samples were biomechanically evaluated to assess tissue integration via T-peel testing. RESULTS HC-Capped fasteners demonstrated a significantly lower attachment area score compared to the HC-Non-Capped group at 30 days (0.92  0.26 vs. 2.50  0.29/3.00, p = 0.002) and 90 days (0.60  0.22 vs. 2.08  0.29/3.00, p = 0.004). At 90 days, the HC-Capped group evidenced significantly lower attachment tenacity score (1.00  0.37 vs. 2.75  0.33/4.00, p = 0.013). Furthermore, at 30 and 90 days, a significantly greater percentage of HC-Capped fasteners remained properly engaged (30 days: 99.7 % vs. 86.5 %, p < 0.001 and 90 days: 99.4 % vs. 74.5 %, p = 0.001). T-peel biomechanical testing demonstrated significantly greater mesh/tissue integration for HC-Capped group (2.16  0.24 vs. 1.16  0.29 N/cm, p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS In a porcine model, HC-Capped fasteners demonstrated significantly less attachment coverage and tenacity in the early postoperative period. Furthermore, the HC-Capped cohort evidenced significantly greater percentage of properly engaged fasteners and greater mesh/tissue integration. Data suggest that shielding exposed fastener points on the visceral mesh surface with polymer caps may reduce attachment formation and aid in mesh fixation and integration.","output":"Evaluation of a novel permanent capped helical coil fastener in a porcine model of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently many studies have shown the effectiveness of using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) in biomedical image analysis.

It also centered on developing patient questionings and medical staff qualitative feedback, which led to advances in scalability and higher levels of engagement/evaluations. The extensive computer simulations on CT image classification show a better efficiency against the state-of-the-art methods using a COVID-19 dataset of 500 Algerian patients.

The impact of CV19 on pregnancy are still under investigation and are potentially long-lasting. However studies have reported that pregnant women affected by CV19 have an increased risk of preterm delivery, pregnancy complications, organ failure, respiratory distress, increased inflammation, increased hospitalization and poor fetal outcomes compared to women who do not contract CV19 during pregnancy. Outside of the pregnant literature, data reports that comorbidities associated with CV19 are associated with inflammation and hypertension (i.e. endothelial damage, kidney damage). In the current study we investigated the relationship between endothelial damage and CV19, hypothesizing that women who contract CV19 during pregnancy will have an increase in endothelial damage and poor birth outcomes. Women were enrolled into an IRB approved study and whole blood was collected at the time of hospital admission for delivery. Pregnant women (n=7/group) were grouped into one of three categories: Normotensive with no history of CV19, early (eCV19) a positive CV19 test > 10 weeks prior to delivery or term (tCV19) a positive CV19 test < 10 weeks prior to delivery. After centrifugation, plasma and serum was frozen at -20oC for future use. Endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to 10% serum for 24 hours, followed by media collection after an additional 24hr serum-free media exposure. Circulating ET-1 was extracted from plasma samples and ET-1, sVCAM and ICAM were assayed via ELISA from both circulating and media samples. Data are expressed as meanSEM. Comparisons between groups were analyzed via ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Endothelin is increased plasma of eCV19 (7.080.31,p<0.0001) and tCV19 (6.820.25,p<0.0001) normotensive women when compared to normotensive women (0.940.22) without the CV19 virus. SVCAM is also increased in plasma of eCV19 (133869.37, p<0.0001) and tCV19 (135536.18, p<0.0001) when compared to normotensive women without CV19 (75.514.67). There is no significance across groups in ICAM measurement in plasma from these women p=0.9024. There is also an increase in endothelin 1 measured in HUVEC media in eCV19 normotensive women (10.104.04, p=0.0318) when compared to normotensive women without CV19 (2.050.64) and an increase in SVCAM in eCV19 (72.655.69, p=0.0008) and tCV19 (50.7810.68, p=0.002) normotensive women when compared to non-CV19 normotensive women (4.940.86). There was no significance in birth outcomes as Gestational Age at delivery (37.79-38.92 weeks, p=0.72), baby weight (2880-3534 grams, p=0.33), systolic blood pressure (118.7-123.1 mmHg, p=0.43) across groups. Results above shows that despite all women being normotensive, CV19 causes an increase in endothelial dysfunction regardless of when a patient contracted the virus. These results suggests that CV19 causes vasculature damage as endothelial damage markers are increased in both normotensive women who contracted the virus early and late as opposed to normotensive women without the virus.

With no prior warning or anticipation, patient appointments were temporarily ceased as institutions and clinics were indefinitely closed. To our knowledge, no study addresses the orthodontic patient perspective in such testing times, where they are entirely restricted to the confines of their homes. Aim: To assess the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on the treatment and psychology of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Material and methods: A self-designed online exploratory questionnaire of 15 questions was distributed to 500 potential responders selected from obtained lists through messages and emails. It was mandatory to answer all questions and the survey was anonymized and did not contain any identifying information. Online consent was taken before participation in the study. The obtained data were evaluated using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The response rate was 81.6%. The study revealed that the majority of patients were affected by the lack of access to orthodontic visits. The reasons for the same were attributed to fear of increased treatment duration, inconveniences caused by poking wires, broken brackets, etc., and lack of communication between the orthodontists and patients, among the various other reasons. The importance of orthodontic appointments was also understood by patients. Conclusion: The study threw light on the essential need for understanding the psychology of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.

Calibrated and validated against measurements of LV mechanics and coronary perfusion, the model is applied to investigate changes in the transmural distribution of passive coronary perfusion, myocardial work density, and their ratio in response to changes in LV contractility, preload, afterload, wall thickness, and cavity volume. The model predicts the following: (1) Total passive coronary flow varies from a minimum value at the endocardium to a maximum value at the epicardium transmurally that is consistent with the transmural distribution of IMP; (2) Total passive coronary flow at different transmural locations is increased with an increase in either contractility, afterload, or preload of the LV, whereas is reduced with an increase in wall thickness or cavity volume; (3) Myocardial work density at different transmural locations is increased transmurally with an increase in either contractility, afterload, preload or cavity volume of the LV, but is reduced with an increase in wall thickness; (4) Myocardial work density-perfusion mismatch ratio at different transmural locations is increased with an increase in contractility, preload, wall thickness or cavity volume of the LV, and the ratio is higher at the endocardium than the epicardium.

Only scarce information is available about the diversity of viruses present in the faeces of pigs. Here we describe a protocol, which was optimized for the purification of the total fraction of viral particles from pig faeces. The genomes of the purified DNA and RNA viruses were simultaneously amplified by PCR and subjected to deep sequencing followed by bioinformatic analyses. The efficiency of the method was monitored using a process control consisting of three bacteriophages (T4, M13 and MS2) with different morphology and genome types. Defined amounts of the bacteriophages were added to the sample and their abundance was assessed by quantitative PCR during the preparation procedure. RESULTS: The procedure was applied to a pooled faecal sample of five pigs. From this sample, 69,613 sequence reads were generated. All of the added bacteriophages were identified by sequence analysis of the reads. In total, 7.7% of the reads showed significant sequence identities with published viral sequences. They mainly originated from bacteriophages (73.9%) and mammalian viruses (23.9%); 0.8% of the sequences showed identities to plant viruses. The most abundant detected porcine viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus C, astrovirus, enterovirus B, sapovirus and picobirnavirus. In addition, sequences with identities to the chimpanzee stool-associated circular ssDNA virus were identified. Whole genome analysis indicates that this virus, tentatively designated as pig stool-associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV), represents a novel pig virus. CONCLUSION: The established protocol enables the simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA viruses in pig faeces including the identification of so far unknown viruses. It may be applied in studies investigating aetiology, epidemiology and ecology of diseases.

Hence, this present review article will explore the possible connection between the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and climate change. The utilization of various scientific domains for climate change studies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and exploring the positive influences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and measures to avoid the negative impacts on climate change owing to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discussed.","output":"Influence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: a review from the climate change perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the period of health emergency linked to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the paediatric dentists' management of oral health problems in children must have as primary objective the control of the spread of the disease according to specific protocols aimed at minimizing the risk of viral transmission. AIM: This paper examines the possible clinical conditions that may require intervention by the paediatric dentist, distinguishing clinical situations that fall into the category of paediatric dental emergencies from conditions of oral pathologies that normally do not represent an emergency. The definition of rigorous and highly effective infection control protocols in the dental settings must therefore be complemented by the development and strengthening of remote communication techniques with the parents, who must be adequately educated on preventive and palliative measures for the management of their children's oral health, with the aim of postponing clinical attendance to when the circumstances become favourable. CONCLUSIONS: The experience gained with these approaches and models of treatment, where remote interaction techniques play a central role, will hone the communication skills of the paediatric dentist and will retain its usefulness even at the end of the current emergency period.","output":"Paediatric Oral Health during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the one shot is probably sufficient, as there is some level of antibodies against the virus exist in people who were already infected and with one shot, they basically develop the level of antibodies that most people get with two shots of vaccine;b] Is the infection has primed the immune system and the on shot vaccine is effectively boosting those existing immune responses?

Experimental evidence has already been obtained for use of the standardized extract of Brazilian green propolis (EPP-AF) against viral targets, and clinical rationality has been demonstrated for testing this extract as an adjunct to treatment in patients affected by COVID-19. The BeeCovid2 study aims to assess whether EPP-AF has an impact on the improvement of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 by reducing the length of hospital stay. METHODS: BeeCovid2 is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study being conducted in Brazil to provide further evidence on the effectiveness of standardized green propolis extract as an adjunctive treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Hospitalized patients over 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and up to 14 days of symptoms were included. Patients under mechanical ventilation at randomization, pregnant women, cancer patients, transplanted or using immunosuppression, HIV patients, patients who used propolis in the last 30 days, bacterial or fungal infection at randomization, impossibility of using medication orally or enterally, and advanced chronic diseases (e.g., advanced heart failure, severe liver disease, and end-stage chronic kidney disease). Enrolled patients are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or standardized propolis extract (900 mg/day) for 10 days. The study treatments are administered in a double-blinded manner, and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is the difference in length of hospital stay in days between groups. Secondary outcomes include the need for mechanical ventilation, the rate of secondary infection, rate of acute kidney injury, the need for renal replacement therapy, the requirement for vasoactive drugs, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). DISCUSSION: This trial is very useful and will provide more data on the effectiveness of using the standardized Brazilian green propolis extract as an adjunctive treatment in association with standard care in adults hospitalized with moderate to severe acute COVID-19.

Impediments to address this question are primarily due to critical experimental barriers. An integrated perspective on large scale neural information processing requires an in vivo approach that can combine the advantages of exhaustively observing all neurons dedicated to a given type of stimulus, and simultaneously achieve a resolution that is precise enough to capture individual neuron activity. Current experimental data from in vivo observations are either restricted to a small fraction of the total number of neurons, or are based on larger brain volumes but at a low spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, fundamental questions as to how sensory information is represented on a population scale remain unanswered. In Drosophila melanogaster, the mushroom body (MB) represents an excellent model to analyze sensory coding and memory plasticity. In this work, we present an experimental setup coupled with a dedicated computational method that provides in vivo measurements of the activity of hundreds of densely packed somata uniformly spread in the MB. We exploit spinning-disk confocal 3D imaging over time of the whole MB cell body layer in vivo while it is exposed to olfactory stimulation. Importantly, to derive individual signal from densely packed somata, we have developed a fully automated image analysis procedure that takes advantage of the specificities of our data. After anisotropy correction, our approach operates a dedicated spot detection and registration over the entire time sequence to transform trajectories to identifiable clusters. This enabled us to discard spurious detections and reconstruct missing ones in a robust way. We demonstrate that this approach outperformed existing methods in this specific context and made possible high-throughput analysis of approximately 500 single somata uniformly spread over the MB in various conditions. Applying this approach, we find that learned experiences change the population code of odor representations in the MB. After long-term memory (LTM) formation, we quantified an increase in responsive somata count and a stable single neuron signal. We predict that this method, which should further enable studying the population pattern of neuronal activity, has the potential to uncover fine details of sensory processing and memory plasticity.","output":"In vivo large-scale analysis of Drosophila neuronal calcium traces by automated tracking of single somata."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Diabetic microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy may occur at hemoglobin A1c levels (HbA1c) below the 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) diagnostic threshold. Our objective was to assess the validity of the HbA1c diagnostic cutpoint of 6.5% based upon published evidence of the prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy as markers of diabetes. METHODS Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and CINAHL from 1990-March 2019, grey literature sources. Study Selection All studies reported after 1990 (to ensure standardized HbA1c values) where HbA1c levels were presented in relation to prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy in subjects not known to have diabetes. Data Extraction Studies were screened independently, data abstracted, and risk of bias appraised. Data Synthesis Data were synthesized using HbA1c categories of < 6.0% (< 42 mmol/mol), 6.0-6.4% (42-47 mmol/mol) and  6.5% ( 48 mmol/mol). Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy prevalence stratified by HbA1c categories. Random-effects multivariable meta-regression was conducted to identify predictors of retinopathy prevalence and sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS Pooled mean prevalence was: 4.0%(95% CI: 3.2-5.0%) for retinopathy, 10.5% (95% CI: 4.0-19.5%) for nephropathy, 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1-4.3%) for neuropathy. Mean prevalence when stratified for HbA1c < 6.0%, 6.0-6.4% and  6.5% was: retinopathy: 3.4% (95% CI: 1.8-5.4%), 2.3% (95% CI: 1.6-3.2%) and 7.8%(95% CI: 5.7-10.3%); nephropathy: 7.1% (95% CI: 1.7-15.9%), 9.6% (95% CI: 0.8-26.4%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 1.0-46.9%); neuropathy: 2.1% (95% CI: 0.0-6.8%), 3.4% (95% CI: 0.0-11.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.0-12.8%). Multivariable meta-regression showed HbA1c  6.5% (OR: 4.05; 95% CI: 1.92-8.57%), age > 55 (OR: 3.23; 95% CI 1.81-5.77), and African-American race (OR: 10.73; 95% CI: 4.34-26.55), to be associated with higher retinopathy prevalence. Marked heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was found across all meta-analyses (Cochran's Q-statistic p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of nephropathy and moderate retinopathy was increased in subjects with HbA1c values  6.5% confirming the high specificity of this value for diagnosing T2DM; however, at HbA1c < 6.5% retinopathy increased at age > 55 years and, most strikingly, in African-Americans, suggesting there may be excess microvascular complication prevalence (particularly nephropathy) in individuals below the diabetes diagnostic threshold.","output":"Diagnosing type 2 diabetes using Hemoglobin A1c: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic cutpoint based on microvascular complications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Health professionals who are constantly working to treat the patients of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at great risk. So the only method they can prevent themselves while working is the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The use of PPE has increased with the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Aim: To evaluate the knowledge and practice of students of different healthcare specialties regarding the use of PPE. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2020 to December 2020 on healthcare students of different healthcare specialties of Najran university, Saudi Arabia. Participants were asked questions about the practice and knowledge of PPE via an electronic link of a questionnaire. Collected data were statistically analysed for frequency and association of responses by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0. Results: Total of 606 students (female were 122,male were 484) from different health specialities i.e., Medical (25.4%), Dental (42.1%), Pharmacy (11.2%), Nursing (13.4%) and Physiotherapy (7.9%) participated in this survey. Most of the participants (110 from the medical field, 142 from dental, 42 from pharmacy and 63 from nursing and 28 from physiotherapy) were familiar with the word PPE before this pandemic. There was a significant relation relationship (p-value<0.0001) between the specialty and practice of PPE. The majority of the participants (52%) did not know the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guideline and 55.9% were not aware of donning and doffing. Only 44.7% of professionals used N95 before the pandemic and 41.9% did not use N95 before COVID-19. While using the N95 mask 58.2% felt comfortable and 11.4% didn't feel comfortable and the remaining participants were not sure. Conclusion: Although most participants practiced and had knowledge about the use and handling of PPE, but still there is a need to improve their knowledge and train them about its importance during COVID-19.

In this work, we introduce a new privacy-preserving and inclusive system for epidemic risk assessment and notification that aims to address the above limitations. Rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones as done by existing apps, our system captures encounters between inexpensive, zero-maintenance, small devices carried by users, and beacons placed in strategic locations where infection clusters are most likely to originate. Epidemiological simulations using an agent-based model demonstrate several beneficial properties of our system. By achieving bidirectional interoperability with manual contact tracing, our system can help control disease spread already at low adoption. By utilizing the location and environmental information provided by the beacons, our system can provide significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than existing app-based systems. In addition, our simulations also suggest that it is sufficient to deploy beacons in a small fraction of strategic locations for our system to achieve high utility.","output":"Listening to Bluetooth Beacons for Epidemic Risk Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Over the last few years, the introduction of newer systemic therapies (e.g. CDKi) significantly changed the treatment paradigm of patients (pts) with MBC. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the impact of CDKi introduction in clinical practice in terms of medical oncology workload. Methods: We examined a consecutive series of 492 pts who received therapy for MBC in Academic Hospital of Udine during two historical cohorts A (2016-2017) and B (2018-2019), respectively before and after the first CDKi approval in Italy. Data about 2020 were not collected due to confounding effect of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Pts with no luminal MBC or enrolled in clinical trial were excluded. We performed descriptive analyses to examine any differences in terms of number and type of outpatient visits to the oncology department (i.e. planned visits, unplanned presentations and i.v. treatment sessions) between the two cohorts. Results: We analyzed a total number of 2,645 oncology activities deriving from 42 pts (cohort A) and 57 pts (cohort B) who started first line treatment for luminal MBC. Median age was 66 and 70 years respectively. In the first group, pts receiving chemotherapy were 23.8% and those treated with CDKi were 7,14%. In the second group, chemotherapy was administered in 22.8% of pts and CDKi in 49.12%. In cohort A, number of planned visits, unplanned presentations and i.v. treatment sessions were respectively 643, 82 and 418. In cohort B, number of planned visits, unplanned presentations and treatment sessions were 892, 114 and 496. During the period of observation (two years), for each pts mean number of planned visits were 15,30 (cohort A) vs 15,64 (cohort B), mean number of unplanned presentations were 1,95 (cohort A) vs 2 (cohort B), treatment i.v. sessions were 9,9 (cohort A) vs 8,7 (cohort B). Conclusions: With the limits of a retrospective analysis, no differences were found between two cohorts of pts. Notably, there was a slight decrease of i.v. treatment sessions after CDKi introduction. Other analysis are ongoing to evaluate the workload in terms of instrumental and blood chemistry tests.

Many centers in the USA have created collaborative multidisciplinary clinics to support the management of these patients; however, similar structures do not appear to exist in Canada. METHODS: This mixed methods study used a combination of structured interviews and a cross-sectional national survey. Interviewees included members of the Canadian Rhinology Working Group and survey participants were a combination of academic and community Rhinologists, Respirologists and Allergists. All participation was voluntary and selection criteria was based on their involvement in treating complex airway disease. Our objective was to identify the current state of diagnosis and treatment of complex airway patients in Canada between Rhinology, Respirology and Allergy and understand the barriers, challenges and propose solutions to establishing a multidisciplinary airway clinic in Canada. RESULTS: Four Rhinologists participated in qualitative interviews and a convenience sample of 42 specialists through our known network responded to our quantitative survey. From our survey, 54.8% believed multidisciplinary clinics were necessary in the management of complex airway disease, providing better outcomes and cost-savings (69%, 45.2%). Most specialties agreed that history, physical, pulmonary function and skin prick testing was important for diagnosis (92.9%, 92.9%, 88.1%). If clinicians were to participate in a multidisciplinary clinic, they would be willing to forego an average of 14.2% of their mean daily income for that clinic. The ideal clinic location was split between a neutral shared location vs. a Rhinology clinic space (38.1%, 45.2%).

They allow the flexibility to represent epidemic systems as networks of components with complex and interconnected structures. However, most of previous studies are based on networks of individuals as nodes and their social relationships (e.g., friendship, workplace connections) as links during the virus spread process. Notably, the transmission and spread of infectious viruses are more pertinent to human dynamics (e.g., their movements and interactions with others) in the spatial environment. This paper presents a novel network-based simulation model of human traffic and virus spread in community networks. We represent spatial points of interests (POI) as nodes where human subjects interact and perform activities, while edges connect these POIs to form a community network. Specifically, we derive the spatial network from the geographical information systems (GIS) data to provide a detailed representation of the underlying community network, on which human subjects perform activities and form traffics that impact the process of virus transmission and spread. The proposed framework is evaluated and validated in a community of university campus. Experimental results showed that the proposed simulation model is capable of describing interactive human activities at an individual level, as well as capturing the spread dynamics of infectious diseases. This framework can be extended to a wide variety of infectious diseases and shows strong potentials to aid the design of intervention policies for epidemic control.","output":"Spatial Modeling and Analysis of Human Traffic and Infectious Virus Spread in Community Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), also referred to as the host shutoff factor, suppresses host innate immune functions.

RESULTS: Overall, 824 (55%) children had any comorbidity and 646 (43%) had any neurologic manifestation. Children with comorbidity were older (median [interquartile range] 9.5 [4-15] vs. 6.4 [0.5-12], had more COVID-19 (58%) vs. MIS-C (32%) and ICU admissions (39% vs. 29%), and longer hospital length of stay (9 [2-9] vs. 5 [2-6] days), all p< .001;mortality was similar (1.5% vs. 0.5%, p=.067).

Methods Retrospective data from a single tertiary care academic institution were analyzed from elective adult surgical cases performed from 2017 through 2019. Emergent or urgent add-on cases were excluded. Variables included primary procedure, age, diabetes status, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, and surgical start time. Analysis of the median LOS following surgery was performed using Mann-Whitney tests and Cox hazards model. Matched-cohort analysis of mean total hospitalization costs was performed using the Students t-test. Results 9,258 patients were analyzed across five surgical service lines, of which 777 patients had surgical start time after 3 PM. The median LOS for the after 3 PM group was 1 day longer than the before 3 PM start time cohort (3.0 vs 2.1, p < 0.001). Service line analysis revealed increased LOS for Orthopedics and Neurosurgery (3.0 vs 1.9, p < 0.001; 3.0 vs 2.0, p < 0.05).

Use of synthetic mesh in the pelvis may be associated with complications such as fistulation, erosion and dyspareunia. Biological meshes may avoid these complications, but the long-term outcome is uncertain. Debate continues as to which type of mesh is optimal for laparoscopic VMR. METHOD A literature search was performed of electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus (2000-12). Studies describing outcomes relating to the mesh were included for review. Only English language studies were included. RESULTS Thirteen observational studies reported the outcome of 866 patients following laparoscopic VMR. Eleven reported the outcome using synthetic mesh with a median follow-up ranging from 7 to 74 months. Two studies reported the outcome with biological mesh with a median follow-up of 12 months. Pooled analysis of the studies demonstrated that 767 patients had a repair with synthetic mesh and 99 with a biological implant. There was no difference in recurrence (3.7 vs 4.0%, P = 0.78) or mesh complications (0.7 vs 0%, P = 1.0%) between synthetic and biological mesh repair.

In this review, we discuss the historical record and epidemiology of mucormycosis as well as pathogenesis and associated host immune response, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment. Special emphasis is given to its association with the current COVID-19 pandemic, including latest updates on COVID-19-associated mucormycosis cases globally, with recommendations for efficacious management.","output":"New insights on mucormycosis and its association with the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melasma is a common, difficult to treat hyperpigmentary disorder.

The study uses the retrospective analysis of space-time scan statistic to detect the clusters of COVID-19 in mainland China with a different maximum clustering radius at the family-level based on case dates of onset. The results show that the detected clusters vary with the clustering radius. Forty-three space-time clusters were detected with a maximum clustering radius of 100 km and 88 clusters with a maximum clustering radius of 10 km from 2 December 2019 to 20 June 2020. Using a smaller clustering radius may identify finer clusters. Hubei has the most clusters regardless of scale. In addition, most of the clusters were generated in February. That indicates Chinas COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control strategy is effective, and they have successfully prevented the virus from spreading from Hubei to other provinces over time. Well-developed provinces or cities, which have larger populations and developed transportation networks, are more likely to generate space-time clusters. The analysis based on the data of cases from onset may detect the start times of clusters seven days earlier than similar research based on diagnosis dates. Our analysis of space-time clustering based on the data of cases on the family-level can be reproduced in other countries that are still seriously affected by the epidemic such as the USA, India, and Brazil, thus providing them with more precise signals of clustering.","output":"Fine-Scale Space-Time Cluster Detection of COVID-19 in Mainland China Using Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness are paramount to vaccine development. Following the isolation of rotavirus particles in 1969 and its evidence as an aetiology of severe dehydrating diarrhoea in infants and young children worldwide, the quest to find not only an acceptable and reliable but cost-effective vaccine has continued until now. Four live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines (LAORoVs) (Rotarix(?), RotaTeq(?), Rotavac(?), and RotaSIIL(?)) have been developed and licensed to be used against all forms of rotavirus-associated infection. The efficacy of these vaccines is more obvious in the high-income countries (HIC) compared with the low- to middle-income countries (LMICs); however, the impact is far exceeding in the low-income countries (LICs). Despite the rotavirus vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, more than 90 countries (mostly Asia, America, and Europe) are yet to implement any of these vaccines. Implementation of these vaccines has continued to suffer a setback in these countries due to the vaccine cost, policy, discharging of strategic preventive measures, and infrastructures. This review reappraises the impacts and effectiveness of the current live-attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines from many representative countries of the globe. It examines the problems associated with the low efficacy of these vaccines and the way forward.

Recent evidence suggests a potential bidirectional relationship between loneliness and unemployment in working age individuals. As most existing research focuses on the outcomes of unemployment, this paper seeks to understand the impact of loneliness on unemployment, potential interaction with physical health, and assess bidirectionality in the working age population. METHODS: This study utilised data from waves 9 (2017C19) and 10 (2018C2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study. Nearest-neighbour probit propensity score matching with at least one match was used to infer causality by mimicking randomisation. Analysis was conducted in three steps: propensity score estimation; matching; and stratification. Propensity scores were estimated controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, education, marital status, household composition, number of own children in household and region. Findings were confirmed in panel data random effect models, and heterogeneous treatment effects assessed by the matching-smoothing method. RESULTS: Experience of loneliness in at least one wave increased the probability of being unemployed in wave 10 by 17.5 [95%CI: 14.8, 20.2] percentage points. Subgroup analysis revealed a greater effect from sustained than transitory loneliness. Further exploratory analysis identified a positive average treatment effect, of smaller magnitude, for unemployment on loneliness suggesting bidirectionality in the relationship. The impact of loneliness on unemployment was further exacerbated by interaction with physical health. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to directly consider the potentially bidirectional relationship between loneliness and unemployment through analysis of longitudinal data from a representative sample of the working age population. Findings reinforce the need for greater recognition of wider societal impacts of loneliness. Given the persisting and potentially scarring effects of both loneliness and unemployment on health and the economy, prevention of both experiences is key. Decreased loneliness could mitigate unemployment, and employment abate loneliness, which may in turn relate positively to other factors including health and quality of life. Thus, particular attention should be paid to loneliness with additional support from employers and government to improve health and well-being.

In high- and middle-income settings, plant-based meat and dairy alternatives present potential substitutes for animal sourced foods, and a pathway to transition to more sustainable diets. We examined plant-based alternative foods (PBAF) consumption trends in the UK by analysing repeated cross-sectional food consumption data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey 2008C2019. Dietary data for 15,655 individuals aged 1.5 years and over were analysed to assess aggregate change in intake of PBAF and six other food groups that play a role in transformative dietary change. Characteristics associated with consumption of PBAF were explored using logistic regression, and consumption patterns in high and low meat consumers were explored by examining intake of potential animal product substitute food groups. The proportion of individuals reporting consumption of any PBAFs increased from 6.7% in 2008C2011, to 13.1% in 2017C2019 (p < 0.01). Compared to 2008C2011 PBAF consumption rose by 115% in 2017C2019 (p < 0.01). Females were 46% more likely than males to report consumption of PBAF (p < 0.01). Millennials (age 24C39 years) were the most likely generation to report PBAF consumption (p < 0.01 compared to generation Z (age 11C23 years) and traditionalists (age 75+ years)), as were individuals of the highest income tertile (p < 0.01). Among low meat consumers, PBAF consumption was on average higher than high meat consumers (18.6 g versus 4.8 g PBAF per day, p < 0.01). Our results support the hypothesis of a pivotal role of PBAF in the transition towards sustainable food systems in the UK, by demonstrating they are becoming increasingly popular among UK consumers. This highlights the urgent need to assess in detail the environmental and health impacts of large scale and population-wide consumption of PBAF in comparison to their animal-based equivalents.","output":"The role of plant-based alternative foods in sustainable and healthy food systems: Consumption trends in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The series, Mastering your Fellowship, provides examples of the different question formats encountered in the written and clinical examinations, that is, Part A of the Fellowship of the College of Family Physicians South Africa (FCFP SA) examination.

METHODS: During the pandemic, 80 participants (25 patients with small fibre neuropathy (SFN), 42 patients with chronic migraine (CM) and 13 patients healthy family members (HFM)) were asked to evaluate their COVID-19 complains, changes in habits and clinical management, behaviour, mood, loneliness, quality of life (QoL), physical and mental health and coping strategies. Data were analysed by Spearman rho correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Patients had lower QoL, lower physical health and higher catastrophizing attitude towards pain than HFM. During the pandemic, SFN patients referred greater decline in clinical symptoms, worries about contagion and discomfort for disease management changes than CM patients. In the SFN group, the higher levels of disability were associated with suffering from changes in neurologist-patient relationship. CM patients complained of agitation/anxiety that was related to feelings of loneliness, depressive mood and catastrophism. DISCUSSION: Despite similar complains of change in habits and worries about COVID-19 pandemic, SFN and CM patients had distinct reactions. In SFN patients, pandemic distress impacted on physical health with worsening of clinical conditions, especially suffering from changes in their care. In CM patients, pandemic distress affected behaviour, mainly with psychological frailty. This suggests the need to customize public health care for patients with distinct chronic pain conditions.","output":"Life with chronic pain during COVID-19 lockdown: the case of patients with small fibre neuropathy and chronic migraine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of all healthcare workers. Anesthesiologists frequently perform virus-aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation and extubation, that place them at increased risk of infection. We sought to determine how the initial COVID-19 outbreak affected members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) on both personal and professional levels. Specifically, we examined the potential effects of gender and age on personal stress, burnout, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression, assessed job satisfaction, and explored financial impact. METHODS: After receiving approval from the SPA Committees for Research and Quality and Safety, and the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, we emailed a questionnaire to all 3,245 SPA members. The survey included 22 questions related to well-being and 13 questions related to effects of COVID-19 on current and future practice, finances, retirement planning, academic time and productivity, and clinical and home responsibilities. To address low initial response rates and quantify nonresponse bias, we sent a shortened follow-up survey to a randomly selected subsample (n=100) of SPA members who did not respond to the initial survey. Response differences between the two cohorts were determined. RESULTS: A total of 561 (17%) members responded to the initial questionnaire. Because of COVID-19, 21.7% of respondents said they would change their clinical responsibilities and 10.6% would decrease their professional working time. Women were more likely than men to anticipate a future COVID-19-related job change (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.63, P = 0.011), perhaps because of increased home responsibilities (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.00, P <0.001). Additionally, 14.2% of respondents planned to retire early and 11.9% planned to retire later. Women and non-whites had higher likelihoods of burnout on univariate analysis (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.94, P = 0.026 and OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08 to 3.04, P = 0.017, respectively) and 25.1% of all respondents felt socially isolated. In addition, both changes in retirement planning and future occupational planning were strongly associated with total job satisfaction scores (both P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of pediatric anesthesiologists, albeit not equally, as women and non-whites have been disproportionately impacted. The pandemic has significantly affected personal finances, home responsibilities, and retirement planning, reduced clinical and academic practice time and responsibilities, and increased feelings of social isolation, stress, burnout, and depression/anxiety.","output":"The effects of COVID-19 on pediatric anesthesiologists: A survey of the members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Post hoc analyses of clinical trial data suggested that linezolid may be more effective than vancomycin for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial pneumonia. This study prospectively assessed efficacy and safety of linezolid, compared with a dose-optimized vancomycin regimen, for treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, controlled, multicenter trial involving hospitalized adult patients with hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated MRSA pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) or vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 7-14 days. Vancomycin dose was adjusted on the basis of trough levels. The primary end point was clinical outcome at end of study (EOS) in evaluable per-protocol (PP) patients. Prespecified secondary end points included response in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population at end of treatment (EOT) and EOS and microbiologic response in the PP and mITT populations at EOT and EOS. Survival and safety were also evaluated. RESULTS Of 1184 patients treated, 448 (linezolid, n = 224; vancomycin, n = 224) were included in the mITT and 348 (linezolid, n = 172; vancomycin, n = 176) in the PP population. In the PP population, 95 (57.6%) of 165 linezolid-treated patients and 81 (46.6%) of 174 vancomycin-treated patients achieved clinical success at EOS (95% confidence interval for difference, 0.5%-21.6%; P = .042). All-cause 60-day mortality was similar (linezolid, 15.7%; vancomycin, 17.0%), as was incidence of adverse events. Nephrotoxicity occurred more frequently with vancomycin (18.2%; linezolid, 8.4%). CONCLUSIONS For the treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia, clinical response at EOS in the PP population was significantly higher with linezolid than with vancomycin, although 60-day mortality was similar.","output":"Linezolid in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nosocomial pneumonia: a randomized, controlled study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Higher education institutions in the United States resorted to remote instruction after the disruption caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

ScO2 readings are based on the fraction of reduced and oxidized hemoglobin as an indirect estimate of brain tissue oxygenation and assume a static ratio of arterial to venous intracranial blood. Conditions that alter cerebral blood flow, such as acute changes in PaCO2, may decrease accuracy. We assessed the performance of two commercial cerebral oximeters across a range of oxygen concentrations during normocapnia and hypocapnia. METHODS Casmed FORE-SIGHT Elite (CAS Medical Systems, Inc., USA) and Covidien INVOS 5100C (Covidien, USA) oximeter sensors were placed on 12 healthy volunteers. The fractional inspired oxygen tension was varied to achieve seven steady-state levels including hypoxic and hyperoxic PaO2 values. ScO2 and simultaneous arterial and jugular venous blood gas measurements were obtained with both normocapnia and hypocapnia. Oximeter bias was calculated as the difference between the ScO2 and reference saturation using manufacturer-specified weighting ratios from the arterial and venous samples. RESULTS FORE-SIGHT Elite bias was greater during hypocapnia as compared with normocapnia (4  9% vs. 0  6%; P < 0.001). The INVOS 5100C bias was also lower during normocapnia (5  15% vs. 3  12%; P = 0.01). Hypocapnia resulted in a significant decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen tension, as well as increased oxygen extraction across fractional inspired oxygen tension levels (P < 0.0001). Bias increased significantly with increasing oxygen extraction (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Changes in PaCO2 affect cerebral oximeter accuracy, and increased bias occurs with hypocapnia. Decreased accuracy may represent an incorrect assumption of a static arterial-venous blood fraction. Understanding cerebral oximetry limitations is especially important in patients at risk for hypoxia-induced brain injury, where PaCO2 may be purposefully altered.","output":"Effects of Changes in Arterial Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen Partial Pressures on Cerebral Oximeter Performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBSS) students are the largest group of international students.

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study. To estimate the cumulative live birth rate we only included couples who had used all embryos from their initial stimulation or achieved a live birth. We constructed a logistic regression model using live birth as a dependent variable and age group, duration of infertility, primary vs. secondary infertility, insemination method, cause of infertility, Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and antral follicle count (AFC) as our independent variables and used a backward elimination method to create the best fitting regression models to predict the probability of a cumulative live birth (p < 0.05 for elimination). RESULTS There were 516 complete cycles of ovarian stimulation resulting in 357 livebirths giving a cumulative livebirth rate of 69.2 % (95 % CI 66.0-74.0). Women with a live birth had significantly lower median age (34 years [IQR 31-37] vs. 36 years [IQR 33-39], p = 0.01) and FSH (6.7 iu/L [IQR 5.8-7.9] vs. 7.4 iu/L [IQR 6.2-8.6] and a significantly higher median AMH (22.1 pmol/L [IQR 12.1-30.9] vs. 10.5 pmol/L [IQR 7.3-20.7], p = 0.01) and AFC (18 [IQR 12-26] vs. 12 [IQR 9-19], p = 0.01).

The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV infected cells. Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release. ZIKV NS1 was also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells. These results suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1. The association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1. Dengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.","output":"The dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is secreted from mosquito cells in association with the intracellular cholesterol transporter chaperone caveolin complex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CoCC) is a rare liver tumor arising from the canals of Hering found between the cholangioles and interlobular bile ducts. Although morphologically CoCC mimics intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), CoCC exhibits a unique intermediate biologic behavior between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ICC. Curative resection is required for prolonged survival in patients with CoCC. However, effective therapy for postoperative hepatic recurrence has not yet been standardized. CASE PRESENTATION A 40-year-old man had an asymptomatic liver mass found during a regular medical examination. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-enhanced mass, 15 cm in diameter, in the right liver. He underwent right hemihepatectomy at a local hospital under the preoperative diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathologic examination confirmed a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, leading to a diagnosis of ordinary ICC. Twelve months after surgery, he was referred to our hospital due to three hepatic recurrences in the left medial segment. He underwent partial hepatectomy for the recurrence, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine alone. After the second hepatectomy, hepatic recurrences developed an additional seven times. The numbers and sizes of the recurrent tumors were very limited at each recurrence, satisfying the standard criteria for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of HCC. All lesions were treated by percutaneous RFA, although this was an exceptional approach for ICC. He is now alive without evidence of disease 9.2 years after the first hepatectomy. Because his clinical outcome was satisfactory and not compatible with the typical negative outcomes of ordinary ICC, we re-reviewed the histological findings of his tumor. The tumor was composed of small gland-forming cells proliferating in an anastomosing pattern; the cell membrane was strongly immunoreactive for epithelial membrane antigen. These findings were in accordance with the typical features of CoCC, revising his final diagnosis from ICC to CoCC. CONCLUSIONS This case report demonstrates a satisfactory outcome using repeated local treatments, such as hepatectomy and RFA, for hepatic recurrences of CoCC, suggesting that a localized treatment approach can be considered to be a therapeutic option. We should be careful in making a definitive diagnosis of ICC and ruling out CoCC because the diagnosis potentially dictates the treatment strategy for recurrences.","output":"Successful local treatment for repeated hepatic recurrences of cholangiolocellular carcinoma: a report on a long-term survivor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2017, the Colorado Commission on Higher Education laid out an ambitious goal for the state: increasing the percentage of adults, aged 25C34, who hold a postsecondary credential from 49% to 66% by 2025.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. SETTING: A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N = 442). RESULTS: Of all patients studied, 48% required hospitalization, 17% required intensive care, and 12% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P<0.001), male (OR 2.0, P = 0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P = 0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P = 0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P = 0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P<0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (P(interaction)<0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P = 0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care.

The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which is responsible for the proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as virus priming for cell entry, appears as a rational therapeutic target for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Accordingly, selective inhibitors of TMPRSS2 represent potential tools for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we tested the inhibitory capacities of the human milk glycoprotein lactoferrin and its N-terminal peptide pLF1, which we identified as inhibitors of plasminogen, a serine protease homologous to TMPRSS2. In vitro proteolysis assays revealed that, unlike full-length lactoferrin, pLF1 significantly inhibited the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2. pLF1 inhibited both the proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the SARS-CoV-2 infection of simian Vero cells. Because lactoferrin is a natural product and several biologically active peptides, such as the N-terminally derived lactoferricins, are produced naturally by pepsin-mediated digestion, natural or synthetic peptides from lactoferrin represent well-achievable candidates for supporting prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Blockade of TMPRSS2-mediated priming of SARS-CoV-2 by the N-terminal peptide of lactoferrin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countless evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in human malignant cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), although their exact function remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of the lncRNA LOC440173 in ESCC progression. Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to measure the expression levels of LOC440173 and miR-30d-5p. The biological function of this lncRNA was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, clone formation, and transwell assays, as well as flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The function of LOC440173 was validated in vivo using tumor xenografts. The regulatory network of LOC440173/miR-30d-5p/HDAC9 was established using bioinformatic analysis and verified with dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, and rescue experiments. The expression level of LOC440173 was significantly increased in ESCC tissues and esophageal carcinoma cells. High LOC440173 expression was correlated with histological grade, tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. Overexpression of LOC440173 promoted esophageal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in vitro, and facilitated tumor growth in vivo. MicroRNA-30d-5p (miR-30d-5p) was downregulated in ESCC tissues and acted as a direct binding target of LOC440173 during the regulation of HDAC9 expression in esophageal carcinoma cells. In conclusion, LOC440173 exerts a promotive role in ESCC tumorigenesis by targeting the miR-30d-5p/HDAC9 axis and regulating the EMT process.

Here, we use mice selectively deficient in IAV-activated apoptosis to show that necroptosis drives robust antiviral immune responses and promotes effective virus clearance from infected lungs when apoptosis is absent.

In this report, we describe an adjuvanted subunit candidate vaccine that affords elevated, sustained, and cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in multiple animal models. Alhydroxiquim-II is a Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7/8 small-molecule agonist chemisorbed on aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel). Vaccination with Alhydroxiquim-II combined with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (termed CoVac-II) resulted in high-titer NAbs in mice, with no decay in responses over an 8-month period. NAbs from sera of CoVac-II-immunized mice, horses and rabbits were broadly neutralizing against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Boosting long-term CoVac-II-immunized mice with adjuvanted spike protein from the Beta variant markedly increased levels of NAb titers against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants; notably, high titers against the Delta variant were observed. These data strongly support the clinical assessment of Alhydroxiquim-II-adjuvanted spike proteins to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. IMPORTANCE There is an urgent need for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines that are safe, demonstrate high protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants and can be manufactured at scale. We describe a vaccine candidate (CoVac-II) that is based on stabilized, trimeric spike antigen produced in an optimized, scalable and chemically defined production process. CoVac-II demonstrates strong and persistent immunity after vaccination of mice, and is highly immunogenic in multiple animal models, including rabbits and horses. We further show that prior immunity can be boosted using a recombinant spike antigen from the Beta variant; importantly, plasma from boosted mice effectively neutralize multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro, including Delta. The strong humoral and Th1-biased immunogenicity of CoVac-II is driven by use of Alhydroxiquim-II (AHQ-II), the first adjuvant in an authorized vaccine that acts through the dual Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and TLR8 pathways, as part of the Covaxin vaccine. Our data suggest AHQ-II/spike protein combinations could constitute safe, affordable, and mass-manufacturable COVID-19 vaccines for global distribution.","output":"High-Titer Neutralizing Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant Induced by Alhydroxyquim-II-Adjuvanted Trimeric Spike Antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies whether and how differently projected information about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic affects individuals' prosocial behavior and expectations on future outcomes.

However, interindividual variability in the response to adenosine has been claimed as a major limitation to the use of adenosine for the measurement of FFR, carrying the risk of underestimating the severity of coronary stenoses, with potential negative prognostic consequences. Genetic variants of the adenosine receptor A2a (ADORA2A gene), located in the coronary circulation, have been involved in the modulation of the hyperemic response to adenosine. However, no study has so far evaluated the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs5751876 of ADORA2A on the measurement of FFR in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention that was, therefore, the aim of our study. We included patients undergoing coronary angiography and FFR assessment for intermediate (40-70%) coronary lesions. FFR measurement was performed by pressure-recording guidewire (Prime Wire, Volcano), after induction of hyperemia with intracoronary boli of adenosine (from 60 to 1440 g, with dose doubling at each step). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed to assess the presence of rs5751876 C>T polymorphism of ADORA2a receptor. We included 204 patients undergoing FFR measurement of 231 coronary lesions. A total of 134 patients carried the polymorphism (T allele), of whom 41 (30.6%) in homozygosis (T/T).Main clinical and angiographic features did not differ according to ADORA2A genotype.

Finland is a country with extraordinary sauna culture and bathing opportunities. However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic introduced regulations and unprecedented closures to shared sauna facilities. In this study we aimed to examine the previously unknown baseline bathing frequency and its possible change during the epidemic. DESIGN We investigated several aspects of sauna bathing with self-reports: the frequency, its possible changes, reasons for change, and beliefs about its health effects among a representative sample of thousand Finns aged 18-75 years. This online survey was administered in May 2020. RESULTS Before the pandemic, 59 % of our respondents had enjoyed sauna at least once a week. Since the pandemic began, up to 23 % had reduced or stopped their bathing. This was often due to restricted sauna access. However, 11 % of respondents bathed more frequently and attributed this change to seeking relaxation and passing time. These findings demonstrate a surprising flexibility in this health-promoting national pastime. Men were more active bathers than women overall and women under 35 enjoy sauna more seldom than older women. Only 7.9 % of all respondents bathed at least four times a week, exceeding a suggested threshold for maximum health benefits. CONCLUSIONS Finnish people are active sauna bathers.

In the face of this medical challenge threatening humans, the development of rapid and accurate methods for early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 became crucial to containing the emerging public health threat, and prevent further spread within the population. Despite the large number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China, some problematic cases with inconsistent laboratory testing results, were reported. Specifically, a high false-negative rate of 41% on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was observed in China. Although serological testing has been applied worldwide as a complementary method to help identify SARS-CoV-2, several limitations on its use have been reported in China. Therefore, the use of both qRT-PCR and serological testing in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in China and elsewhere, presented considerable challenges, but when used in combination, can be valuable tools in the fight against COVID-19. In this review, we give an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different molecular techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection that are currently used in several labs, including qRT-PCR, gene sequencing, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid mass spectrometry (MS), and gene editing technique based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas13) system.

Methods: We collected 184 serum samples from 70 consecutively qRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients at four participating hospitals from 23 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. COVID-19 pneumonia was defined as the presence of new pulmonary infiltration. Serum samples were grouped by the duration after symptom onset on a weekly basis for antibody testing and analysis. The four immunoassays: Beckman SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (Beckman Test), Siemens (ADVIA Centaur?) SARS-CoV-2 Total (COV2T) (Siemens Test), SBC COVID-19 IgG ELISA (SBC Test) and EliA SARS-CoV-2-Sp1 IgG/IgM/IgA P2 Research (EliA Test) were used for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Results: The sensitivity of all tests reached 100% after 42 days of symptom onset. Siemens Test, the only test detecting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, had the best performance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 infection (day 0-7: 77%; day 8-14: 95%) compared to the other 3 serological tests. All tests showed 100% specificity except SBC Test (98%). COVID-19 patients with pneumonia had significantly higher testing signal values than patients without pneumonia (all p values < 0.05, except EliA IgM Test). However, Siemens Test and SBC Test had highest probability in early prediction of the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: Chronological analysis of immune response among COVID-19 patients with different serological tests provides important information in the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prediction of the risk of pneumonia after infection.","output":"Multicenter evaluation of four immunoassays for the performance of early diagnosis of COVID-19 and assessment of antibody responses of patients with pneumonia in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction 'Multimorbidity' describes the presence of two or more long-term conditions, which can include communicable and non-communicable diseases, and mental disorders. The rising global burden from multimorbidity is well-documented, but trial evidence for effective interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. Selection of appropriate outcomes is fundamental to trial design to ensure cross-study comparability, but there is currently no agreement on a core outcome set (COS) to include in trials investigating multimorbidity specifically in LMIC. Our aim is to develop international consensus on two COS for trials of interventions to prevent and treat multimorbidity in LMIC settings. Methods and Analysis Following methods recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET initiative), the development of these two COS will occur in three stages: (1) generation of a long list of potential outcomes for inclusion; (2) two-round online Delphi surveys; and (3) consensus meetings. First, to generate an initial list of outcomes, we will conduct a systematic review of multimorbidity intervention and prevention trials and interviews with people living with multimorbidity and their caregivers in LMICs. Outcomes will be classified using an outcome taxonomy. Two-round Delphi surveys will be used to elicit importance scores for these outcomes from people living with multimorbidity, caregivers, healthcare professionals, policy makers, and researchers in LMICs. Finally, consensus meetings will be held to discuss the Delphi survey results and agree outcomes for inclusion in the two COS. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Research Governance Committee of the Department of Health Sciences, University of York, UK [HSRGC/2020/409/D:COSMOS].

The rapid advancements of modern technology have disseminated the superficial benefits of medical infrastructure, but significant improvements are still extremely necessary over the massive e-healthcare system (mHS). Considering the fact of limited resources and unlimited demands, a highly stable end-to-end optimization model is required. Healthcare also struggles with real-time communication. The next-generation communication networks (e.g 5G and beyond) proficiently influence the network resource distribution for URLLC. In this work, we have envisioned a novel on-demand e-Healthcare dynamic network slice architecture that uses the ML algorithms at the edge server for real-time classification and access of the offloaded data from the central controller (vSDN-Control layer to Data plane layer). The comparative analysis over the datasets of patients consisting of special index parameters shows that our proposed model allows the end-user more efficient data accessibility over the conventional approaches. We have studied the model over the multi-classification ML models (kNN, DT and RF) and we have found an average improvement of 10% to 15% of average data offloading time efficiency from the local machines from the edge servers.

SARS-CoV-2 is a 29,811 nucleotides positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to inefficient proofreading ability of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex, coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations following replication, which constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its genome and the emergence of new genetic variants. In the last few months, the identification of new B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOC) highlighted the importance of tracking the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their impact on transmissibility, infectivity, and neutralizing antibody escape capabilities. These VOC demonstrate increased transmissibility and antibody escape, and reduce current vaccine efficacy. Here we analyzed the appearance and prevalence trajectory of mutations that appeared in all SARS-CoV-2 genes from December 2019 to January 2021. Our goals were to identify which modifications are the most frequent, study the dynamics of their spread, their incorporation into the consensus sequence, and their impact on virus biology. We also analyzed the structural properties of the spike glycoprotein of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants.

The distribution of the pandemic-induced job losses for women and men or for different racial/ethnic categories has been studied in the recent literature. We contribute to this literature by providing an intersectional analysis of unemployment under COVID-19, where we examine the differences in the likelihood of unemployment across groups of White men, White women, Black men, Black women, Hispanic men, and Hispanic women. As a case of study of the COVID-19 recession, our work engages with the broader empirical literature testing the discrimination theories based on the unexplained gap after accounting for observable characteristics of women, men, and different races/ethnicities and their labor market positions. Controlling for individual characteristics such as education and age, as well as industry and occupation effects, we show that women of all three racial/ethnic categories are more likely to be unemployed compared to men, yet there are substantial differences across these groups based on different unemployment measures. Hispanic women have the highest likelihood of being unemployed, followed by Black women, who are still more likely to be unemployed than White women. We also examine if the ability to work from home has benefited any particular group in terms of lowering their likelihood of unemployment during the pandemic. We find that in industries with a high degree of teleworkable jobs, White women, Black men, and Hispanic men are no longer more likely to be unemployed relative to White men. However, Black women and Hispanic Women still experience a significantly higher probability of job loss compared to White men even if they are employed in industries with highly teleworkable jobs.

METHOD: Patients  18 years old who either had not received corticosteroid or had taken corticosteroids within 14 days from symptom onset were included. Patients receiving corticosteroids beyond 15 days or other investigational treatment within 21 days from symptom onset were excluded. Of 1313 eligible patients, 1287 with major corticosteroid dosage-type combinations were analysed. RESULTS: Crude death rate was lower among 1188 steroid-treated patients compared to 99 patients in Group No Steroid (17.0% vs. 28.3%). Among four corticosteroid groups studied, mortality was lowest in the low-dose oral prednisolone (Group P) and high-dose methylprednisolone (Group MP) groups. On multivariate analysis of the corticosteroid groups, independent factors related to death were: corticosteroid group, older age, co-morbidity, worse chest X-ray score, worse respiratory status at Days 8C10 and higher admission white cell count. Again Groups P and MP had significantly lower adjusted odds ratios for death and lower bacterial and fungal culture rates. Despite worse chest X-ray scores and higher cumulative corticosteroid dosages in Group MP compared to Group P, fewer patients required rescue pulsed corticosteroid. Patients on hydrocortisone (Group HC) had the highest positive culture rates.

M(pro) is highly conserved among all seven human coronaviruses, with certain M(pro) inhibitors having broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In this study, we designed two hybrid inhibitors UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 based on the superimposed X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with GC-376, telaprevir, and boceprevir. Both UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 showed potent binding and enzymatic inhibition against the M(pro)s from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1. Cell-based Flip-GFP M(pro) assay results show that UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 inhibited the intracellular protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). In addition, UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 had potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E, with UAWJ9-36-3 being more potent than GC-376 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Selectivity profiling revealed that UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 had an improved selectivity index over that of GC-376 against host cysteine proteases calpain I and cathepsin L, but not cathepsin K. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 were both solved at 1.9 ?, which validated our design hypothesis.

Immunoglobulins differ from conventional antimicrobial agents in that they mediate direct and indirect antimicrobial effects that work in concert with other components of the immune system. The field of infectious diseases pioneered antibody therapies in the first half of the 20th century but largely abandoned them with the arrival of conventional antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, much of the knowledge gained from the historical development and use of immunoglobulins such as serum and convalescent antibody therapies was forgotten; principles and practice governing their use were not taught to new generations of medical practitioners, and further development of this modality stalled. This became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 when convalescent plasma was initially deployed as salvage therapy in patients with severe disease. In retrospect, this was a stage of disease when it was less likely to be effective. Lessons of the past tell us that antibody therapy is most likely to be effective when used early in respiratory diseases. This article puts forth three principles of antibody therapy, namely, specificity, temporal, and quantitative principles, connoting that antibody efficacy requires the administration of specific antibody, given early in course of disease in sufficient amount. These principles are traced to the history of serum therapy for infectious diseases.

OBJECTIVE We aim to assess the overall impacts of fathers' previous and current migration experiences on children's nutritional status in India and how the impacts are shaped by community socioeconomic contexts and community gender norms. METHODS Using data from the Indian Human Development Survey collected in 2011-2012, we estimated community fixed-effect regression models predicting the nutritional status of children (ages 10-15) and examined the interactions among fathers' migration, child's gender, and community contexts. RESULTS The results showed that children of returned migrants had lower height and Body Mass Index (BMI) than children of non-migrants. Fathers' current absence was associated with lower height and BMI for adolescents in communities with high levels of socioeconomic development but not for those in communities with low levels of development. Fathers' current absence due to migration was especially harmful for girls in communities with strict norms of female seclusion. CONTRIBUTION Our findings highlight that the effects of father's out-migration on children are conditioned by the level of communities' socioeconomic development and community gender contexts, which helps to reconcile the previously mixed findings on the effects of parental migration on child outcomes.","output":"Fathers' Migration and Nutritional Status of Children in India: Do the Effects Vary by Community Context?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated a global health crisis. In an effort to decrease person-to-person transmission, societal-level non-pharmacologic interventions (NPIs) to maintain social distancing have been enacted. As SARS-CoV-2 shares similar routes of transmission with other respiratory viruses, implementation of these NPIs may have decreased transmission for multiple viral pathogens. We compared influenza and respiratory syncytial (RSV) rates in prior seasons to rates during the 2019 - 2020 season at two large academic centers in Atlanta and Boston. METHODS: The clinical records were queried for adults with respiratory virus testing conducted at the Emory Healthcare system and associated clinics in Atlanta and the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Healthcare System in Boston. Total cases for influenza A and B, RSV and SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed for each week of the past 5 seasons (07/01/2015-05/30/2020) for the Atlanta and Boston sites. Systematic changes in viral infection rates were calculated using viral reproduction rates, R(t), between consecutive weeks. R(t) is the ratio of the number of positive cases in one week to the number of positive cases in the previous week. We used statistical bootstrapping to determine whether R(t) for influenza and RSV were lower in 2019C2020 following the introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Analyses were conducted using R (v 4.0.0). Absolute respiratory virus activity by season, Boston (panel A) v. Atlanta (panel B) [Image: see text] RESULTS: For the 2019C2020 Atlanta season, R(t) < 1 (which reflects steady decline in infection rates) occurred at week 28 for influenza A, week 33 for influenza B, and week 35 for RSV, which corresponded with the increase of SARS-Cov-2 cases. The R(t) of these viruses stayed at or near 1 during weeks 33C35 in prior seasons, and R(t) was greater than 1 up to week 47. Data from MGB sites showed similar trends with a sudden decline in R(t) to < 1 at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. CONCLUSION: We note decreased transmission of influenza and RSV during a time window where widespread movement restrictions and social distancing were imposed to control COVID-19. This trend was most pronounced for influenza A in Atlanta and influenza B in Boston. These data suggest that NPIs can have important effects across multiple pathogens.

But there are many emerging market economies which have been prevented from doing what is needed by their high existing levels of public debt andespeciallyby the external financial constraints which they face. We argue in the present paper that there is a need for international cooperation to allow such countries to undertake the kind of massive fiscal response that all countries now need, and that many advanced countries have been able to carry out. We show what such cooperation would involve. We use a global macroeconomic model to explore how extraordinarily beneficial such cooperation would be. Simulations of the model suggest that GDP in the countries in which extra fiscal support takes place would be around two and a half per cent higher in the first year, and that GDP in other countries in the world be more than one per cent higher. So far, such cooperation has been notably lacking, in striking contrast with what happened in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis in 2008. The necessary cooperation needs to be led by the Group of Twenty (G20), just as happened in 2008C9, since the G20 brings together the leaders of the worlds largest economies. This cooperation must also necessarily involve a promise of international financial support from the International Monetary Fund, otherwise international financial markets might take fright at the large budget deficits and current account deficits which will emerge, creating fiscal crises and currency crises and so causing such expansionary policies which we advocate to be brought to an end.","output":"Global macroeconomic cooperation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a roadmap for the G20 and the IMF"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Plasmodium berghei ANKA mouse model of malaria, accumulation of CD8+ T cells and infected RBCs in the brain promotes the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM).

Using a combination of techniques, including intravital multiphoton and confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis, we showed that, shortly before onset of ECM, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations exit the spleen and begin infiltrating the brain blood vessels. Although dominated by CD8+ T cells, a proportion of both T cell subsets enter the brain parenchyma, where they are largely associated with blood vessels. Intravital imaging shows these cells moving freely within the brain parenchyma. Near the onset of ECM, leakage of RBCs into areas of the brain can be seen, implicating severe damage. If mice are cured before ECM onset, brain infiltration by T cells still occurs, but ECM is prevented, allowing development of long-term resident memory T cell populations within the brain. This study shows that infiltration of malaria-specific T cells into the brain parenchyma is associated with cerebral immunopathology and the formation of brain-resident memory T cells.

METHODS: Eight indicators of positive maternity care experience and 18 indicators of negative maternity care experience were investigated. We compared the responses from exit interviews with women about their childbirth care experience (reference standard) to follow-up telephone interviews with the same women 14 months after childbirth. We calculated individual-level validity metrics including, agreement, sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We compared the characteristics of women included in the telephone follow-up interviews to those from the exit interviews. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics were similar between the original exit interview group (n=388) and those subsequently reached for telephone interview (n=294). Seven of the eight positive maternity care experience indicators had reported prevalence higher than 50% at both exit and telephone interviews.

The partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) results revealed that the TPB components, as well as the AR, have positive associations with the COVID-19 vaccination behavior.

Following 1998 CDC recommendations for screening in high-risk populations, we estimated the proportion of Medicaid recipients with and without schizophrenia screened for HCV across states and over time. Examining patterns of screening will inform the current public health imperative to test all adults for HCV now that safer and more effective treatments are available. METHODS: Data are drawn from 1 353 424 Medicaid recipients aged 15C64 years with schizophrenia and frequency-matched controls from 2002 to 2012. Participants with known HCV infection one year prior and those dual-eligible for Medicare were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression estimated associations between predictor variables and HCV screening. RESULTS: HCV screening was low (<4%) but increased over time. Individuals with schizophrenia consistently showed higher screening compared to controls across years and states. Several demographic and clinical characteristics predicted higher screening, especially comorbid HIV (OR = 6.5; 95% CI = 6.0C7.0). Outpatient medical care utilization increased screening by nearly double in 2002 (OR = 1.8; CI = 1.7C1.9) and almost triple in 2012 (OR = 2.7; CI = 2.6C2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Low screening was a missed opportunity to improve HCV prevention efforts and reduce liver-related mortality among people with schizophrenia. Greater COVID-19 disease severity in HCV patients and the availability of effective HCV treatments increase the urgency to improve HCV screening. Eliminating Medicaid restrictions and expanding statewide HIV policies to include HCV would have multiple public health benefits, particularly for people with schizophrenia.","output":"Hepatitis C Screening Among Medicaid Patients With Schizophrenia, 2002C2012"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of COVID-19, there has been a surfeit of commentary arguing that 2020 will have transformative effects on world politics This paper asks whether, decades from now, the pandemic will be viewed as an inflection point Critical junctures occur when an event triggers a discontinuous shift in key variables or forces a rapid acceleration of preexisting trends Pandemics have undeniably had this effect in the far past A welter of economic and medical developments, however, have strongly muted the geopolitical impact of pandemics in recent centuries A review of how the novel coronavirus has affected the distribution of power and interest in its first six months suggests that COVID-19 will not have transformative effects on world politics Absent a profound ex post shift in hegemonic ideas, 2020 is unlikely to be an inflection point","output":"The Song Remains the Same: International Relations After COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have limited exports of medical supplies and medicines.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study comparing frequency and rates of community respiratory viruses detected in NIHCC patients between January 2015 and March 2021. Test results from nasopharyngeal swabs and washes, bronchoalveolar lavages, and bronchial washes were included in this study. Results from viral-challenge studies and repeated positives were excluded. A quantitative data analysis was completed using cross tabulations. Comparisons were performed using mixed models, applying the Dunnett correction for multiplicity. RESULTS: Frequency of all respiratory pathogens declined from an annual range of 0.88%C1.97% between January 2015 and March 2020 to 0.29% between April 2020 and March 2021. Individual viral pathogens declined sharply in frequency during the same period, with no cases of influenza A/B orparainfluenza and 1 case of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use and in-hospital mortality in geriatric patients hospitalized for COVID-19. DESIGN: This observational retrospective study was conducted in a French geriatric department. Patients were included between March 17 and April 18, 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All consecutive 201 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methods) were included. All nondeceased patients had 30 days of follow-up and no patient was lost to follow-up. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and biological data and medications were collected. In-hospital mortality of patients treated or not by ACEI/ARB was analyzed using multivariate Cox models. RESULTS: Mean age of the population was 86.3 (8.0) years, 62.7% of patients were institutionalized, 88.6% had dementia, and 53.5% had severe disability (activities of daily living [ADL] score <2). Sixty-three patients were treated with ACEI/ARB and 138 were not. Mean follow-up was 23.4 (10.0) days, 66 (33.8%) patients died after an average of 10.0 days (6.0).

In public health crisis events, adolescents are prone to negative psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Hence, this research focuses on the use of reasonable and efficient methods to intervene in adolescents' psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From February to April 2020, we conducted an anonymous online survey on a total of 1,200 adolescents in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi in China. Moreover, we randomly divided a total of 150 middle school students with anxiety scores greater than 50 and volunteered to participate in the intervention experiment into control and intervention groups, with 75 members in each group. On the basis of the proposed routine treatment, we conducted 8 weeks of model 328-based peer education intervention in the intervention group. RESULTS After the intervention, the self-rating anxiety scale scores (SAS) of the intervention group are better than those of the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, the self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group (P<0.001) than on the control group. Finally, the total Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group than on the control group (P=0.001 and <0.001, respectively).

Relevant vulnerabilities to COVID-19 in people who suffer substance use disorders are described in previous communications. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to reshape and update addiction treatment networks. MAIN BODY: Renewed treatment systems should be based on these seven pillars: (1) telemedicine and digital solutions, (2) hospitalization at home, (3) consultation-liaison psychiatric and addiction services, (4) harm-reduction facilities, (5) person-centered care, (6) promote paid work to improve quality of life in people with substance use disorders, and (7) integrated addiction care. The three \\"best buys\\" of the World Health Organization (reduce availability, increase prices, and a ban on advertising) are still valid. Additionally, new strategies must be implemented to systematically deal with (a) fake news concerning legal and illegal drugs and (b) controversial scientific information.

MethodsUtilizing national COVID-19 notification, hospitalization, and vaccination datasets from Brazil, we performed a case-control study using a test-negative design to assess the effectiveness of four vaccines (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2) among individuals with laboratory-confirmed prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched RT-PCR positive, symptomatic COVID-19 cases with RT-PCR-negative controls presenting with symptomatic illnesses, restricting both groups to tests performed at least 90 days after an initial infection. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of test positivity, and the odds of hospitalization or death due to COVID-19, according to vaccination status and time since first or second dose of vaccines. FindingsAmong individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection [] 14 days from vaccine series completion was 39.4% (95% CI 36.1-42.6) for CoronaVac, 56.0% (95% CI 51.4-60.2) for ChAdOx1, 44.0% (95% CI 31.5-54.2) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 64.8% (95% CI 54.9-72.4) for BNT162b2. For the two-dose vaccine series (CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, and BNT162b2), effectiveness against symptomatic infection was significantly greater after the second dose compared with the first dose. Effectiveness against hospitalization or death [] 14 days from vaccine series completion was 81.3% (95% CI 75.3-85.8) for CoronaVac, 89.9% (95% CI 83.5-93.8) for ChAdOx1, 57.7% (95% CI -2.6-82.5) for Ad26.COV2.S, and 89.7% (95% CI 54.3-97.7) for BNT162b2.

We found several studies evaluating ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2, and one additionally reporting on mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2.S, which found that previously infected individuals who were vaccinated had lower risk of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. One study found that risk of hospitalization was lower for previously infected individuals after a full series of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Limited evidence is available comparing effectiveness of one versus two doses among individuals with prior infection. No studies reported effectiveness of inactivated vaccines among previously infected individuals. Added value of this studyWe used national databases of COVID-19 case surveillance, laboratory testing, and vaccination from Brazil to investigate effectiveness of CoronaVac, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S and BNT162b2 among individuals with a prior, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We matched >22,000 RT-PCR-confirmed re-infections with >145,000 RT-PCR-negative controls using a test-negative design. All four vaccines were effective against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, with effectiveness from 14 days after series completion ranging from 39-65%. For vaccines with two-dose regimens, the second dose provided significantly increased effectiveness compared with one dose. Effectiveness against COVID-19-associated hospitalization or death from 14 days after series completion was >80% for CoronaVac, ChAdOx1and BNT162b2. Implications of all the available evidenceWe find evidence that four vaccines, using three different platforms, all provide protection to previously infected individuals against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes, with a second dose conferring significant additional benefits.

Serum concentrations of soluble CD25 (sCD25)/soluble IL2 receptor  (sIL2-R) were significantly elevated and were inversely correlated with the percentage of NK cells. Impaired NK-cell cytolytic activity together with other laboratory trends including elevated sCD25 were consistent with a hyperinflammatory state in keeping with macrophage-activation syndrome. Our findings suggest that impaired counts and cytolytic activity of NK cells are important characteristics of severe COVID-19 and can potentially facilitate strategies for immunomodulatory therapies.","output":"Impaired natural killer cell counts and cytolytic activity in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented health emergency, has devastated the nation, and disproportionately affected persons of color, especially Black Americans.

We analyzed experiences of 167 Black Americans, ages 65 and older, recruited from Wayne State Institute of Gerontology Healthier Black Elders Center and surrounding communities. Participants were telephoned starting September 2020 and given the GAD-7 anxiety scale and a COVID-19 questionnaire measuring demographics, stressors, and emotional responses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A scale was also designed, adapted from the Health Belief Model, to measure fear of getting COVID-19, beliefs about the origins of COVID-19, uncertainty about vaccine safety, and intent to be vaccinated (5-point Likert scale). Of the 167 participants, 112 (67%) said they would agree to vaccination, 24 (14%) were ambivalent, and 31 (19%) said they would decline. T-tests comparing pro- and anti-vaccine participants showed that those not planning to get vaccinated expressed lower generalized anxiety (p=.002), COVID-19 fear (p<.001), and concerns about vaccine safety (p=.01), but greater belief that COVID-19 is man-made (p=.05). The current study provides a snapshot of urban Black American older adults who are in general eager to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Counterintuitively, those unwilling to accept the COVID-19 vaccine also had lower concerns for vaccine safety.

To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference (RNAi) as a strategy against TGEV infection, three plasmids (pRNAT-1, pRNAT-2, and pRNAT-3) expressing short hairpin RNAs were designed to target three different coding regions of the M gene of TGEV. The plasmids were constructed and transiently transfected into a porcine kidney cells, PK-15, to determine whether these constructs inhibited TGEV production. The analysis of cytopathic effects demonstrated that pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 could protect PK-15 cells against pathological changes specifically and efficiently. Additionally, indirect immunofluorescence and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) assays showed that pRNAT-2 and pRNAT-3 inhibited the multiplication of the virus at the protein level effectively.

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme in coronavirus, represents an attractive pharmacological target for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we evaluated whether the anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen, may act as a potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor, using an in silico study. From molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we also evaluated the influence of ionic strength on the affinity and stability of the IbuprofenCMpro complexes. The docking analysis shows that R(?)Ibuprofen and S(+)Ibuprofen isomers can interact with multiple key residues of the main protease, through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with favourable binding energies (?6.2 and ?5.7 kcal/mol, respectively). MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA calculations confirm the affinity of these complexes, in terms of binding energies. It also demonstrates that the ionic strength modifies significantly their binding affinities. Different structural parameters calculated from the MD simulations (120 ns) reveal that these complexes are conformational stable in the different conditions analysed. In this context, the results suggest that the condition 2 (0.25 NaCl) bind more tightly the Ibuprofen to Mpro than the others conditions. From the frustration analysis, we could characterize two important regions (Cys44-Pro52 and Linker loop) of this protein involved in the interaction with Ibuprofen. In conclusion, our findings allow us to propose that racemic mixtures of the Ibuprofen enantiomers might be a potential treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of VTE in COVID-19 patients. Methods: : The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for studies reporting VTE in COVID-19 patients up to June 27, 2020. The selected studies were predefined into the suspected screening group and the routine screening group. The VTE prevalence was calculated using random-effect models. Results: : We selected 20 studies including a total of 2763 COVID-19 patients. In 2203 COVID-19 patients from the suspected screening group, the pool VTE incidence was 15.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.5C21.6%). In 560 COVID-19 patients from the routine screening group, the VTE prevalence was 40.8% (95% CI: 20.6C64.7%). Furthermore, the VTE incidence of critically ill COVID-19 patients from the two groups was 19.6% and 61.4%, respectively, which indicates that critically ill COVID-19 patients were more susceptible to VTE. Conclusions: : A high incidence of VTE was observed in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. The incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients from the routine screening group was higher than that in patients from the suspected screening group. This indicates that a lower threshold of suspicion to perform VTE imaging tests may be reasonable and there is an urgent need to adapt a regular screening strategy for VTE.","output":"High Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Call for Improved Awareness and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza A virus infection causes a series of diseases, but the factors associated with disease severity are not fully understood.

This prospective observational study included 53 patients with influenza A (H1N1) during the influenza season, and 30 healthy controls in our hospital. Patients were grouped by severity and survival. We collected clinical data and blood samples at admission. Inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-6, interleukin-10) and endothelial glycocalyx components (syndecan-1, hyaluronan, heparan sulfate) were measured. The plasma levels of syndecan-1, hyaluronan, and heparan sulfate were significantly higher in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1) than in mild cases. Syndecan-1 and hyaluronan were positively correlated with disease severity, which was indicated by the APACHE II and SOFA scores and lactate levels, and negatively correlated with albumin levels. At a cutoff point  173.9 ng/mL, syndecan-1 had a 81.3% sensitivity and 70.3% specificity for predicting of 28-day mortality. KaplanCMeier analysis demonstrated a strong association between syndecan-1 levels and 28-day mortality (log-rank 11.04, P = 0.001).

Under ultrasonography (US)-guidance, the surgical clips were placed prior to NAC. Additional mammography, breast US, and breast magnetic resonance examinations were performed within 10 days before surgery. The time period from marker insertion to operation date was documented. Images acquired via the three modalities were evalu-ated for the following parameters: location of clip, clip migration (>1 cm), the presence of complications from clip placement, and the effect of clips on the assessment of treatment. RESULTS The mean time period was 128.634.4 days (median, 132.0 days) from the date of clip insertion to the date of surgery. The mean number of inserted clips was 2.30.7 (median, 2.0). Clip migration was not visualized by imaging in any patient, and there were no complications reported. Surgical clips did not negatively affect the assessment of treatment responses to NAC. CONCLUSION Surgical clips may replace commercial tissue markers for tumor localization in breast cancer patients undergoing NAC without migration.

This study aims to investigate whether intravenous alteplase is of potential benefit in reducing PE after successful MT. METHODS Patients from a prospective study treated at a tertiary care stroke center between 08/2017 and 12/2019 were analyzed. The main inclusion criterion was successful reperfusion after MT (defined as expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) scale  2b50) of large vessel occlusion anterior circulation stroke. All patients received a high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) follow-up 24 h after MT for PE detection. Patients were grouped as \\"direct MT\\" (no alteplase) or as MT plus additional intravenous alteplase. The number and volume of ischemic core lesions and PE were then quantified and analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-six patients were prospectively enrolled. Additional intravenous alteplase was administered in 46.3% (26/56). There were no statistically significant differences of PE compared by groups of direct MT and additional intravenous alteplase administration regarding mean numbers (12.1, 95% CI 8.6-15.5 vs. 11.1, 95% CI 7.0-15.1; p = 0.701), and median volume (0.70 mL, IQR 0.21-1.55 vs. 0.39 mL, IQR 0.10-1.62; p = 0.554). In uni- and multivariable linear regression analysis, higher eTICI scores were significantly associated with reduced PE, while the administration of alteplase was neither associated with numbers nor volume of peripheral emboli. Additional alteplase did not alter reperfusion success. CONCLUSIONS Intravenous alteplase neither affects the number nor volume of sub-angiographic DWI-PE after successful endovascular reperfusion. In the light of currently running randomized trials, further studies are warranted to validate these findings. KEY POINTS ? Thrombus microfragmentation during endovascular stroke treatment may cause peripheral emboli that are only detectable on diffusion-weighted imaging and may directly compromise treatment effects. ? In this prospective study, the application of intravenous alteplase did not influence the occurrence of peripheral emboli detected on high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging. ? A higher degree of recanalization was associated with a reduced number and volume of peripheral emboli and better functional outcome, while contrariwise, peripheral emboli did not modify the effect of recanalization on modified Rankin Scale scores at day 90.","output":"Impact of intravenous alteplase on sub-angiographic emboli in high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging following successful thrombectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES In mechanical ventilation, normoventilation in terms of PCO2 can be achieved by titration of the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume. Although a linear relationship has been found between changes in respiratory rate and resulting changes in end-tidal cO2 (PetCO2) as well as between changes in respiratory rate and equilibration time (teq) for mechanically ventilated patients without lung injury, it is unclear whether a similar relationship holds for acute lung injury or altered hemodynamics. DESIGN We performed a prospective randomized controlled animal study of the change in PetCO2 with changes in respiratory rate in a lung-healthy, lung-injury, lung-healthy + altered hemodynamics, and lung-injury + altered hemodynamics pig model. SETTING University research laboratory. SUBJECTS Twenty mechanically ventilated pigs. INTERVENTIONS Moderate lung injury was induced by injection of oleic acid in 10 randomly assigned pigs, and after the first round of measurements, cardiac output was increased by approximately 30% by constant administration of noradrenalin in both groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We systematically increased and decreased changes in respiratory rate according to a set protocol: +2, -4, +6, -8, +10, -12, +14 breaths/min and awaited equilibration of Petco2. We found a linear relationship between changes in respiratory rate and PetCO2 as well as between changes in respiratory rate and teq. A two-sample t test resulted in no significant differences between the lung injury and healthy control group before or after hemodynamic intervention. Furthermore, exponential extrapolation allowed prediction of the new PetCO2 equilibrium and teq after 5.7  5.6 min. CONCLUSIONS The transition between PetCO2 equilibria after changes in respiratory rate might not be dependent on moderate lung injury or cardiac output but on the metabolic production or capacity of cO2 stores. Linear relationships previously found for lung-healthy patients and early prediction of PetCO2 equilibration could therefore also be used for the titration of respiratory rate on the PetCO2 for a wider range of pathologies by the physician or an automated ventilation system.","output":"The Equilibration of PCO2 in Pigs Is Independent of Lung Injury and Hemodynamics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human language permits us to call to mind objects, events, and ideas that we cannot witness directly.

Active video games could be a way to maintain physical therapy at home as part of the rehabilitation. The aim of this review is to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of home-based active video games on gait and balance, user compliance, feasibility and safety for pwMS. METHODS: We searched for studies in five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and Science direct) up to October 2020. Selection of studies, extraction of data and methodological quality assessment through the PEDro scale were made independently by two authors and discussed with a third author. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this systematic review. We found significant improvements in balance; results were mixed concerning mobility, physical activity and gait. Home-based active video games are feasible and safe, with good compliance and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (PEDro scale: 5.3  2). CONCLUSION: Overall, home-based active video games were found safe and effective improving static and dynamic balance in pwMS. Compliance was good, probably because it is a motivating and enjoyable training. Active video games can be a relevant alternative for physical rehabilitation at home in pwMS.

Data analysis was performed by SPSS for Windows software (version 15.0) and Chi-square test and Exact test were used for analyzing data. RESULTS The frequency of OCD in patients with MS was 16.1%. The OCD was significantly correlated with a higher EDSS score (X(2) = 86.515, P = 0.0001). OCD was also significantly correlated with the duration of disease, phenotypic subgroup, cranial nerve involvement, cerebellar, autonomic, sensory and motor nerve involvement. CONCLUSIONS OCD might be considered in quantifying disability of patients with MS. It might be suggested that all the patients with MS to be screened for OCD.","output":"Frequency of obsessive-compulsive disorder in patients with multiple sclerosis: A cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death in the most severe cases. Immune dysregulation with altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to disease severity. Here, we characterized in depth host cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelia (HAE) and immortalized cell lines. Our results demonstrate that primary HAE and model cells elicit a robust induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs). Importantly, we show for the first time that melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5 is the main sensor of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells. IFN exposure strongly inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions. However, despite high levels of IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN response was unable to control viral replication in lung cells, contrary to what was previously reported in intestinal epithelial cells. Altogether, these results highlight the complex and ambiguous interplay between viral replication and the timing of IFN responses.IMPORTANCE Mammalian cells express sensors able to detect specific features of pathogens and induce the interferon response, which is one of the first line of defenses against viruses and help controlling viral replication. The mechanisms and impact of SARS-CoV-2 sensing in lung epithelial cells remained to be deciphered. In this study, we report that despite a high production of type I and III interferons specifically induced by MDA-5-mediated sensing of SARS-CoV-2, primary and immortalized lung epithelial cells are unable to control viral replication. However, exogenous interferons potently inhibited replication, if provided early upon viral exposure. A better understanding of the ambiguous interplay between the interferon response and SARS-CoV-2 replication is essential to guide future therapeutical interventions.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 triggers an MDA-5-dependent interferon response which is unable to control replication in lung epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently facing a serious coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).

Obese breast cancer patients have at least a 30% increased risk of death from breast cancer compared to non-obese breast cancer patients because they present with larger tumors and generally have increased rates of metastasis. Moreover, obese breast cancer patients respond more poorly to treatment compared to non-obese patients, particularly pre-menopausal women diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased metastasis associated with obesity, we previously established a three-dimensional culture system that permits the co-culture of adipocytes and TNBC cells in a manner that mimics an in vivo milieu. Using this system, we demonstrate that white adipose tissue from both lean and obese mice can induce a partial mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Triple negative breast cancer cells adopt an epithelial morphology and have an increased expression of some epithelial markers, but they maintain the expression of mesenchymal markers, furnishing the breast cancer cells with hybrid properties that are associated with more aggressive tumors. Thus, these data suggest that adipose tissue has the potential to promote secondary tumor formation in lean and obese women. Further work is needed to determine if targeting the partial MET induced by adipose tissue could reduce metastasis.","output":"Adipose Tissue from Lean and Obese Mice Induces a Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition-Like Effect in Triple Negative Breast Cancers Cells Grown in 3-Dimensional Culture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent increase of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) has been commanding global attention. However, basic epidemiologic characteristics have not firmly been established. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to determine the clinical manifestations, potential risk factors, and outcomes of CAM. Observational studies reporting CAM were searched with PubMed and EMBASE databases in January 2022. We collected data on comorbidities and treatment for COVID-19, and performed a one-group meta-analysis on the frequency of orbital exenteration procedure and mortality of CAM using a random-effect model. Fifty-one observational studies, including a total of 2,312 patients with proven CAM, were identified. Among the 51 studies, 37 were conducted in India, 8 in Egypt, and 6 in other countries. The most common comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (82%). While 57% required oxygenation, 77% received systemic corticosteroids. Among CAM, 97% were rhino-orbital-cerebral (ROCM), and 2.7% were pulmonary mucormycosis. Usual presentations were headache (54%), periorbital swelling/pain (53%), facial swelling/pain (43%), ophthalmoplegia (42%), proptosis (41%), and nasal discharge/congestion (36%). Regarding the outcomes, orbital exenteration was performed in 17% (95% CI: 12C21%, I(2) = 83%) of the COVID-19-associated ROCM patients. The mortality of CAM was 29% (95% CI; 22C36%, I(2) = 92%).

INTRODUCTION: According to data collected by the World Health Organization, by the autumn of 2020, all regions of the world were affected by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. In Hungary, the first cases were detected in March 2020, and the epidemic, among several other patient rights issues, drew attention to the paramount importance of patient information, its compliance with the law, and the difficulties encountered in its application. During the last decades, the possibility of male partner involvement in birth has become increasingly popular in the process of family planning and starting a life together. Preparing fathers for childbirth and coordinating information restrictions that have changed due to the epidemic is a priority for obstetric departments. The full application of patient information requires a number of considerations to ensure that childbirth remains a positive memory for mother and father, even in a situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to analyze how the obstetric wards in Hungary were able to comply with the laws and procedures in force at the time of the pandemic, what measures became necessary for creating male partner involvement in births, and at the same time to ensure that the rights of the mother and the father are not violated. METHOD: We sent an online questionnaire to the head of the obstetrics department of all Hungarian state hospitals and clinics, using 14 multiple-choice questions. The data of the received questionnaires were also compared with the information related to male partner involvement in births published on the websites of the institutions. RESULTS: In the period from 20 March to 20 September 2020, in terms of informing pregnant couples, the service providers always followed the procedures in force, but in several cases this meant more financial expenditure and organization for them. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that those who give birth insist on the best possible information about conditions of male partner involvement in births, have the same expectations about the conditions of childbirth as during the epidemic-free period. If the information is satisfactory and detailed for them, they are more tolerant of adverse changes. In view of the epidemic, the possibility of father involvement in birth remained in all departments available, while maintaining appropriate epidemiological measures.

METHODS: A restricted systematic review is employed to generate knowledge synthesis about housing and mental recovery for the COVID-19 context in a resource-efficient manner. This review is conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook guideline and PRISMA statement. We searched in Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. Included studies need to be peer-reviewed, written in English and meet pre-defined eligibility criteria.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020, in all 3139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent the speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without SIP orders. RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to &#8804;10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% compared with the counties that did not implement SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP.

The MHV PS is an RNA structure that maps to the region of the replicase gene encoding the nonstructural protein 15 subunit of the viral replicase-transcriptase complex. To begin to understand the role and mechanism of action of the MHV PS in its native genomic locus, we constructed viral mutants in which this cis-acting element was altered, deleted, or transposed. Our results demonstrated that the PS is pivotal in the selection of viral genomic RNA for incorporation into virions. Mutants in which PS RNA secondary structure was disrupted or entirely ablated packaged large quantities of subgenomic RNAs, in addition to genomic RNA. Moreover, the PS retained its function when displaced to an ectopic site in the genome. Surprisingly, the PS was not essential for MHV viability, nor did its elimination have a severe effect on viral growth. However, the PS was found to provide a distinct selective advantage to MHV.

We studied 5,857 patients younger than 20 years old, all of them hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models to study mortality, stratifying the analysis by age, region of the country, presence of noncommunicable diseases, ethnicity, and socioeconomic development. FindingsIndividually, most of the comorbidities included were risk factors.

This study aimed to determine the effect of applying the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model on the treatment adherence among these patients METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 112 patients with cardiovascular disease in Nemazee and Al-zahra hospitals in Shiraz, Iran, from October 2019 to July 2020. Eligible patients were selected and divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention was based on an integration of IMB model constructs and included 10 motivational-educational sessions for three months, followed by telephone consultations for six months. Data were collected before, and three and six months after the end of the motivational-educational sessions using adherence questionnaire in patients with chronic diseases, and adherence in chronic disease scale for medication adherence. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22, and descriptive statistics, chi-square, independent t-test, and repeated measure ANOVA were performed. P<0.05 was considered significant RESULTS: The intervention and control groups were homogenous based on demographic characteristics. Repeated measure ANOVA findings revealed an increasing trend in the mean scores of the intervention group in treatment adherence from 51.103.20 at baseline to 66.405.50 three months and 73.806.80 six months after the end of the intervention (P<0.001).

METHODS: We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9a? years and 686 (42.7%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95% CI) 2.681 (1.424-5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03-2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07-2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60-7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points.

RECENT FINDINGS: Vitamin K acts as a coenzyme of y-glutamyl carboxylase, transforming undercarboxylated in carboxylated vitamin K-dependent proteins. Furthermore, through the binding of the nuclear steroid and xenobiotic receptor, it activates the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in the maintenance of bone quality and bone remodeling. There are three main types of K vitamers: phylloquinone, menaquinones, and menadione. SUMMARY: CKD patients, for several conditions typical of the disease, are characterized by lower levels of vitamin K than the general populations, with a resulting higher prevalence of bone fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality. Therefore, the definition of vitamin K dosage is an important issue, potentially leading to reduced bone fractures and improved vascular calcifications in the general population and CKD patients.","output":"The Role of Vitamin K in CKD-MBD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As health systems rapidly respond to COVID\\\\19, it is unclear how these changes influence the experiences and well\\\\being of female healthcare providers (FHCPs), including the potential for FHCPs to develop compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress.

METHODS From March 2008 to June 2013, we could identify 14 patients (average age: 62.1, median age: 62, range: 50-79) with 'Carotid S occlusion', who underwent endovascular recanalization procedures. Patient's clinical presentations were collected and the imaging findings also analyzed. The technical success rate, 24-hour and follow-up imaging outcome, and the clinical outcome using the 90-day mRS (modified Rankin scale) score were evaluated. RESULTS Patients presented with gradually progressing (n = 8), fluctuating (n = 3), transient ischemic attack (n = 2) and stationary (n = 1) symptoms. DWI showed internal and external border-zone lesions in six patients, only internal ICA border-zone lesions in three patients, and only external border-zone lesions in two patients.

Immunotherapy with convalescent plasma (CPT) is one such therapeutic option. Methods: A systematized search was conducted for articles published between December 2019 and 18th January 2021 focusing on convalescent plasma efficacy and safety in COVID-19. The primary outcomes were defined as mortality benefit in patients treated with convalescent plasma compared to standard therapy/placebo. The secondary outcome was pooled mortality rate and the adverse event rate in convalescent plasma-treated patients. Results: A total of 27,706 patients were included in the qualitative analysis, and a total of 3,262 (2,127 in convalescent plasma-treated patients and 1,135 in the non-convalescent plasma/control group) patients died. The quantitative synthesis in 23 studies showed that the odds of mortality in patients who received plasma therapy were significantly lower than those in patients who did not receive plasma therapy [odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.80, p &lt; 0.0001, I (2) = 15%). The mortality benefit remains the same even for 14 trials/prospective studies (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.81, p = 0.001, I (2) = 22%) as well as for nine case series/retrospective observational studies (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65-0.94, p = 0.01, I (2) = 0%). However, in a subgroup analysis for 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), there was no statistically significant reduction in mortality between the CPT group compared to the non-CPT group (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53-1.08, p = 0.13, I (2) = 7%). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of 10 RCTs, excluding the study with the highest statistical weight, displayed a lower mortality rate compared to that of non-CPT COVID-19 patients (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.97, p = 0.04, I (2) = 0%). The observed pooled mortality rate was 12.9% (95% CI 9.7-16.9%), and the pooled adverse event rate was 6.1% (95% CI 3.2-11.6), with significant heterogeneity. Conclusions and Relevance: Our systemic review and meta-analysis suggests that CPT could be an effective therapeutic option with promising evidence on the safety and reduced mortality in concomitant treatment for COVID-19 along with antiviral/antimicrobial drugs, steroids, and other supportive care. Future exploratory studies could benefit from more standardized reporting, especially in terms of the timing of interventions and clinically relevant outcomes, like days until discharge from the hospital and improvement of clinical symptoms.","output":"Mortality Benefit of Convalescent Plasma in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly affected health care workers (HCWs), including their mental health. However, there has been limited evidence on this topic in the Vietnamese context. Therefore, this study aimed to explore COVID-19-related, psychological stress risk factors among HCWs, their concerns and demands for mental health support during the pandemic period. Methods: We employed a cross-sectional study design with convenience sampling. An online, self-administered questionnaire was used and distributed through social media among medical and non-medical HCWs from April 22 to May 12, 2020. HCWs were categorized either as frontline or non-frontline. We measured the prevalence of psychological stress using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with psychological stress among HCWs. Results: Among the 774 enrolled participants, 761 (98.3%) eligible subjects were included in the analysis. Most respondents were females (58.2%), between 31 and 40 years of age (37.1%), lived in areas where confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported (61.9%), medical HCWs (59.9%) and practiced being at the frontline (46.3%). The prevalence of stress was 34.3%. We identified significant risk factors such as being frontline HCWs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.67]), perceiving worse well-being as compared to those before the COVID-19 outbreak [OR = 4.06 (95% CI: 2.15-7.67)], and experiencing chronic diseases [OR = 1.67 (95% CI: (1.01-2.77)].

Because these products do not require the oversight of a physician or pharmacist, labeling plays a key role in communicating information required for their safe and effective use. Research suggests that current labels are not terribly effective at communicating potential risk. One reason for their lack of effectiveness is that few consumers attend to critical information (active ingredients and warnings) when making purchases. In two experiments, we used a change detection task to objectively evaluate how novel label designs that employ highlighting and a warning label placed on the packages front impact attention to critical information among older participants (65 and older). The change detection task is a unique form of visual search which allowed us to assess the attentional priority of critical information among participants who were not explicitly instructed to search for this critical information. This unique aspect of the task is important given research suggesting that consumers rarely have the explicit goal of seeking out warnings and active ingredients when making OTC selections. Our results provide empirical support that both highlighting critical information and positioning it on the packages front increase its attentional prioritization relative to current, commercial practice. Given that attending to the critical information is prerequisite to utilizing that information, strategies that elicit attention in this way are likely to reduce medication errors.","output":"Using change detection to objectively evaluate whether novel over-the-counter drug labels can increase attention to critical health information among older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID 19 pandemic represents an emergency for public health services and containment measures to reduce the risk of infection have been promptly activated worldwide.

Currently, >200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere. The decline initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China's energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution. The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment.

Indeed, it does appear that no-one has yet reported phonological priming effects in such situations. The question of whether it is possible to observe phonological priming in such situations was more fully examined in the present experiments. Experiment 1 involved a masked priming SDT using Japanese Kanji script in which the primes and targets were homophonic but shared no characters. Experiment 2 was a parallel experiment using Chinese stimuli. In both experiments, phonological priming effects were observed for both one- and two-character words. These experiments indicate that, although the priming effects in masked priming SDTs undoubtedly have a strong orthographic basis, phonological codes also play a role even when the prime and (word) target are written in the same script.","output":"Phonological priming effects with same-script primes and targets in the masked priming same-different task."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore the causes, clinical features, and laboratory examination characteristics of subacute necrotizing lymphadenitis to improve the understanding of this disease, reduce misdiagnosis, and make appropriate diagnoses and treatments.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe patient characteristics associated with successful transition from in-person to virtual care, and video vs audio-only participation. METHODS This was a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from all patients with ambulatory visits from 1 October 2019-30 September 2020 in a large integrated health system in the Northeast USA. The outcome of interest was receipt of virtual care, and video vs audio-only participation. We matched home addresses with census-tract level area social vulnerability index (SVI) and Internet access. Among ambulatory care patients, we used logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with virtual participation. Among virtual participants, we identified characteristics associated with video vs audio-only visits. RESULTS Among 1,241,313 patients, 528,542 (42.6%) were virtual participants. Relative to in-person only, virtual participants were older, more often English-proficient and with activated patient portal. Characteristics associated with virtual participation included patients with: only behavioural health visits, COVID patients, highest quartile of visit frequency, and multiple visit types. Characteristics associated with video participation (relative to audio-only) included being younger and patients with: only behavioural health visits, highest quartile of visit frequency, non-Hispanic black race, limited English proficiency and inactivated portal account.

This brings into line the zero-waste hierarchy concept for a circular economy by taking specific initiatives like rethink/refuse/redesign, implementing 3R's, composting, material and chemical recovery, etc. The outbreak of COVID-19 has forced the textile sector to focus on developments that will enhance human beings protection by producing antiviral clothing materials such as personal protective gears like private protective suits, masks, hand gloves, etc. This personal protective equipment (PPE) has generated a waste mountain of PPE worldwide and has created havoc in terms of sustainability. This chapter will emphasise the impact on sustainability in terms of textiles and clothing industries in detail. It will contribute towards cleaner production and sustainability in the textile sector because of COVID-19 by taking a step towards the opportunities for change in textile processes as per the laws. In addressing these inquiries, we use a structure for analysing sustainability and the textile and garments sector, featuring the chances and difficulties for a sustainable change concerning design, production, utilisation and end-of-life.

The presence of these comorbidities affects viral load suppression, treatment adherence, quality of life, treatment outcomes, and functionality. Despite this fact, there is a dearth of studies that examined the triple burden of neurocognitive impairment and co-occurring depression and anxiety among antiretroviral therapy attendees in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the magnitude of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment and co-occurring depression and anxiety at the same time among people living with HIV/AIDS. METHOD: We conducted an institution-based multicenter cross-sectional study in Bahir Dar, Northwest Ethiopia. A total of 410 study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. Neurocognitive impairment was assessed using the International HIV Dementia Scale. Co-occurring depression and anxiety were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to collect data on sociodemographic and clinical-related characteristics. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Two-thirds (66.8%) of the people living with HIV had neurocognitive impairment. The prevalence of co-occurring depression and anxiety was found in 39.8%. Women with HIV, people with comorbid chronic medical illness, and those under a second-line treatment regimen were factors associated with neurocognitive impairment. Furthermore, pill burden, second-line treatment regimen, HIV clinical stages, social support, HIV-perceived stigma, and neurocognitive impairment were associated factors with co-occurring depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of neurocognitive impairment and co-occurring depression and anxiety among people living with HIV/AIDs.

The disease is notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and is responsible for high mortality and serious economic losses. PCR and real-time PCR (qPCR) are the OIE-recommended standard methods for the direct detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV) DNA. The aim of our work was the simplification and standardization of the molecular diagnostic workflow in the lab. For validation of this easy lab workflow, different sample materials from animal trials were collected and analyzed (EDTA blood, serum, oral swabs, chewing ropes, and tissue samples) to identify the optimal sample material for diagnostics in live animals. Based on our data, the EDTA blood samples or bloody tissue samples represent the best specimens for ASFV detection in the early and late phases of infection. The application of prefilled ready-to-use reagents for nucleic acid extraction or the use of a Tissue Lysis Reagent (TLR) delivers simple and reliable alternatives for the release of the ASFV nucleic acids. For the qPCR detection of ASFV, different published and commercial kits were compared. Here, a lyophilized commercial kit shows the best results mainly based on the increased template input. The good results of the easy lab strategy could be confirmed by the ASFV detection in field samples from wild boars collected from the 2020 ASFV outbreak in Germany. Appropriate internal control systems for extraction and PCR are key features of the easy lab concept and reduce the risk of false-negative and false-positive results. In addition, the use of easy-to-handle machines and software reduces training efforts and the misinterpretation of results. The PCR diagnostics based on the easy lab strategy can realize a high sensitivity and specificity comparable to the standard PCR methods and should be especially usable for labs with limited experiences and resources.","output":"Swift and Reliable Easy Lab Methods for the Sensitive Molecular Detection of African Swine Fever Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multivalent antibody constructs have a broad range of clinical and biotechnological applications.

We demonstrated the viability of this approach by generating constructs with the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobody Ty1. We compared the ability of the different constructs to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and infectious virus in neutralization assays. The generated dimers neutralized the virus similarly to a nanobody-Fc fusion variant, while a 4-arm PEG based tetrameric Ty1 construct dramatically enhanced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, with an IC(50) in the low picomolar range.","output":"Picomolar SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Using Multi-Arm PEG Nanobody Constructs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectivesTo evaluate heterologous scheme in children 3-18 y/o using two SARS-CoV-2 r-RBD protein vaccines.

As a social media platform with billions of daily views, YouTube has tremendous potential to both support and hinder public health efforts. However, the usefulness and accuracy of most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 have not been investigated. METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 2020 using keywords coronavirus and COVID-19, and the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and non-visual, exceeding 1 hour in duration, live and unrelated to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the source, content and characteristics of included videos. The primary outcome was usability and reliability of videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score (CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA (mJAMA) scores. RESULTS: Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, totalling 257 804 146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos contained non-factual information, totalling 62 042 609 views. Government and professional videos contained only factual information and had higher CSS than consumer videos (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.32, p=0.037); mDISCERN scores than consumer videos (MD 2.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.42, p=0.008), internet news videos (MD 2.20, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.21, p=0.027) and entertainment news videos (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.49, p=0.004); and mJAMA scores than entertainment news videos (MD 1.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.36, p=0.033) and consumer videos (MD 1.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.44, p=0.028). However, they only accounted for 11% of videos and 10% of views. CONCLUSION: Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide.

This article refers to the justification of the use of vitamin C in high doses as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis in healthy subjects. Does it make sense or not? As it turns out, any effects of vitamin C supplementation may be more prominent when the baseline vitamin C level is low, for example in physically active persons.

A growing body of evidence points to an inseparable link between attributes of the nursing work environment and nurse and patient outcomes. While most studies have adopted a survey design to examine the workforce and work environment issues, this study employed a phenomenological approach to provide empirical evidence regarding nurses perceptions of their work and work environment. AIM: The aim of this study was to advance our understanding of the phenomenon of increasing nurse turnover through exploring frontline registered nurses lived experiences of working in Hong Kong public hospitals. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: A modified version of Van Kaam's controlled explication method was adopted. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 frontline nurses recruited from ten acute regional, district and non-acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. Their perspectives in regard to their work and work environment, such as workload, manpower demand and professional values, were extensively examined, and a hypothetical description relating the nursing work environment with nurses turnover intention was posited. RESULTS: Contemplation of nurses experiences revealed the vulnerable aspects of nursing work and six essential constituents of the nursing work environment, namely staffing level, work responsibility, management, co-worker relationships, job, and professional incentives. These essential constituents have contributed to two sets of forces, stabilizing and destabilizing forces, which originate from the attributes of the nursing work environment. Nurses viewed harmonious co-worker relationships, recognition and professional development as the crucial retaining factors. However, nurses working in an unfavorable environment were overwhelmed by destabilizing forces; they expressed frustration and demonstrated an intention to leave their work environment.

This paper explores the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown based on an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission inventory, in situ air quality observations, and a localized numerical modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its imbalanced emission abatement of NO(x) (76%, 125.3 Mg/day) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, 53%, 52.9 Mg/day) led to a significant rise of atmospheric oxidants in urban areas, resulting in a modest increase in secondary aerosols due to inadequate precursors, which still offset reduced primary emissions. Moreover, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors, which was transported into Beijing and mainly responsible for the aggravated haze pollution. We recommend that mitigation policies should focus on accelerating VOC emission reduction and synchronously controlling regional sources to release the benefits of local traffic emission control.","output":"SourceCReceptor Relationship Revealed by the Halted Traffic and Aggravated Haze in Beijing during the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic is a treatment challenge in the acute infection stage but the recognition of chronic COVID-19 symptoms termed post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) may affect up to 30% of all infected individuals.

Here, we describe how a national network of acoustic tracking receivers can be leveraged to assess the effects of human activity on animal movement and space use during such global disruptions. We outline variation in restrictions on human activity across Australian states and describe four mechanisms affecting human interactions with the marine environment: 1) reduction in economy and trade changing shipping traffic; 2) changes in export markets affecting commercial fisheries; 3) alterations in recreational activities; and 4) decline in tourism. We develop a roadmap for the analysis of acoustic tracking data across various scales using Australia's national Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) Animal Tracking Facility as a case study. We illustrate the benefit of sustained observing systems and monitoring programs by assessing how a 51-day break in white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) cage-diving tourism due to COVID-19 restrictions affected the behaviour and space use of two resident species. This cessation of tourism activities represents the longest break since cage-diving vessels started day trips in this area in 2007. Long-term monitoring of the local environment reveals that the activity space of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) was reduced when cage-diving boats were absent compared to periods following standard tourism operations. However, white shark residency and movements were not affected.

We evaluated the impact of the lockdown on water quality by measuring the levels of physico-chemical variables and metal(loid)s in water samples taken from 25 sampling stations in the basin. BOD, COD, EC, turbidity, TSS and Mn levels did not show significant differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to the ongoing domestic wastewater discharges and agricultural activities in the basin during the lockdown period. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Pb and Cd concentrations decreased considerably during the lockdown. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index values showed a significant improvement in water quality of almost all stations during the lockdown period. Also, total hazard index values for children and adults reduced by 67% and 69%, respectively during the lockdown period, while total carcinogenic risk values for As and Cr reduced by 60% and 94%, respectively. The limited operational status of most industrial facilities in the basin during the lockdown reduced the amount of industrial effluents, leading to significant improvement in surface water quality for metal(loid)s. The lockdown has shown that the solution for preservation and sustainability of natural water resources lies in our hands, and the efficient management of pollution sources can prevent surface water pollution at a very rapid pace.

Humans become infected through exposure to rodent host secreta and excreta and the resulting infection can lead to an acute inflammatory disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Little is understood about the molecular pathogenesis of arenavirus hemorrhagic fever infections. We utilized Reverse Phase Protein Microarrays (RPPA) to compare global alterations in the host proteome following infection with an attenuated vaccine strain, Candid#1 (CD1), and the most parental virulent strain, XJ13, of JUNV in a human cell culture line. Human small airway epithelial cells were infected with CD1 or XJ13 at an MOI of 10, or mock infected. To determine proteomic changes at early timepoints (T = 1, 3, 8 and 24 h), the JUNV infected or mock infected cells were lysed in compatible buffers for RPPA. Out of 113 proteins that were examined by RPPA, 14 proteins were significantly altered following JUNV infection. Several proteins were commonly phosphorylated between the two strains and these correspond to entry and early replication events, to include p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFB). We qualitatively confirmed the alterations of these three proteins following infection by western blot analysis. We also determined that the inhibition of either p38 MAPK, with the small molecule inhibitor SB 203580 or siRNA knockdown, or HSP27, by siRNA knockdown, significantly decreases JUNV replication.

Ontologies formalize conceptualizations at either the domain or application level. Application ontologies cross domains and are specified through testable use cases. Our use case was an extension of the role of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) to monitor the current pandemic and become an in-pandemic research platform. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an application ontology for COVID-19 that can be deployed across the various use-case domains of the RCGP RSC research and surveillance activities. METHODS: We described our domain-specific use case. The actor was the RCGP RSC sentinel network, the system was the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcomes were the spread and effect of mitigation measures. We used our established 3-step method to develop the ontology, separating ontological concept development from code mapping and data extract validation. We developed a coding system-independent COVID-19 case identification algorithm. As there were no gold-standard pandemic surveillance ontologies, we conducted a rapid Delphi consensus exercise through the International Medical Informatics Association Primary Health Care Informatics working group and extended networks. RESULTS: Our use-case domains included primary care, public health, virology, clinical research, and clinical informatics. Our ontology supported (1) case identification, microbiological sampling, and health outcomes at an individual practice and at the national level; (2) feedback through a dashboard; (3) a national observatory; (4) regular updates for Public Health England; and (5) transformation of a sentinel network into a trial platform. We have identified a total of 19,115 people with a definite COVID-19 status, 5226 probable cases, and 74,293 people with possible COVID-19, within the RCGP RSC network (N=5,370,225). CONCLUSIONS: The underpinning structure of our ontological approach has coped with multiple clinical coding challenges.

Previous studies suggest that perioperative Covid-19 infection has significant implications on surgical morbidity with perioperative mortality rates as high as 23.8%. Complication profiles increase with any additional treatment burden such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy. Design We investigated the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on gynaecological-cancer surgery in an international prospective multi-centre study. Participating centres entered consecutive patient's data into a customized electronic database for 12 weeks from the first COVID positive patient managed in their hospital between March and June 2020. Patients were eligible for enrolment into the present study if they were planned to undergo surgery for gynaecological cancer during the study duration, regardless of their COVID-19 status and whether they underwent surgery as recommended or not. Those patients who did not undergo their planned surgery were followed up for 12-weeks to observe outcomes. Method 4722 patients with gynecological cancer were recruited across 56 countries from 4 continents. The distribution of sites of origin was: 42% (n = 2024) uterine, 39% (n = 1872) ovarian, 11% (n = 538) cervical and 5.93% (n = 275) vulva-vagina cancer.

Results The main impact was on surgical timing;1.1% (n = 50) of patients experienced &gt; 12-week delay in surgery, 2% (n = 119) a change in choice of operation, 0.02% (n = 50) change in neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, 2.7% (n = 452) received surgery in alternative hospital. Patients in this study had confirmed resolved COVID-19 prior to surgery in 0.95% (n = 45) of patients with an additional 0.34% (n = 16) with probable resolved COVID-19 infection.

The present study aims at predicting the antiviral activity of two novel compounds using in silico approaches that might become potential leads against SARS-CoV-2. The 3D structures of the new compounds are elucidated by single-crystal X-ray techniques. The interactions between different units of 4 and 5 were emphasized by analyzing their corresponding Hirshfeld surfaces and ESP plots. NBO and FMO analyses were investigated as well. Molecular docking combined with molecular dynamics simulations (MDs) was performed to investigate the binding modes and molecular interactions of 4 and 5 with the amino acids of coronavirus main protease (6LU7) protein. The best docking scores were obtained for both ligands through the major binding interactions via hydrogen/hydrophobic bonds with the key amino acids in the active site: HIS41, CYS145, MET49, MET165, HIS172, and GLU166 amino acids. A MD simulation study was also performed for 100 ns to validate the stability behavior of the main protease 3CLpro-ligand complexes. The MD simulation study successfully confirmed the stability of the ligands in the binding site as potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) inhibitors.

The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent skin microvascular reactivity in patients with critical COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. We investigated skin microvascular reactivity on two separate days during hospitalization (study day 1 and 2) and at least three months after disease onset (study day 3). Twelve controls with no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during 2020 were also examined. Skin perfusion was investigated through Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) before and after iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine the endothelial-dependent and the endothelial-independent vasodilation, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with critical COVID-19 had higher basal skin perfusion and reduced responses to endothelial-dependent (ACh, pa=a0.002) and endothelial-independent (SNP, pa=a0.01) vasodilator drugs on study day 1. In addition, the ACh/SNP ratio was significantly reduced in patients (0.50aa0.36 versus 0.91aa0.49 in controls, pa=a0.02).

Furthermore, a window of opportunity is thought to exist for timely immunosuppression in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia shortly after clinical presentation. In this Viewpoint, we explore the shortcomings of a universal immunosuppression approach in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 due to disease heterogeneity related to ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication, which can manifest as RNAaemia in some patients treated with immunotherapy. By contrast, immunomodulatory therapy has overall benefits in patients with rapid SARS-CoV-2 clearance, via blunting of multifaceted, excessive innate immune responses in the lungs, potentially uncontrolled T-cell responses, possible autoimmune responses, and immunothrombosis. We highlight this therapeutic dichotomy to better understand the immunopathology of moderate-to-severe COVID-19, particularly the role of RNAaemia, and to refine therapy choices.","output":"Therapeutic implications of ongoing alveolar viral replication in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the last decade social media has seen a significant growth and influence that reached an unprecedent levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic and troponin: indirect myocardial injury, myocardial inflammation or myocarditis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: One of the important COVID-19 management considerations was to prevent delayed intubation. There is a lack of objective criteria to decide the time of intubation. Previously, respiratory parameters were the only tools used to determine the success of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy, but several studies have reported on the role of respiratory rate oxygenation (ROX) index which combined respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) in predicting intubation after receiving high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of the ROX index in predicting intubation in COVID-19 pneumonia receiving HFNC. Methods: This study is a systematic review that used online databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and CENTRAL) in obtaining eligible journals. The sources of data were from published observational studies and preprints. The outcomes of this study were ROX index validity, intubation predictors, and factors associated with the ROX index. Results: Seven journals were yielded during the search. ROX index was significantly lower in the HFNC failure group at any time interval with high sensitivity and specificity in predicting intubation (p  0.001). ROX index can be used to predict intubation starting at 4 hours after HFNC initiation and calculated repeatedly. Conclusion: ROX index was a good parameter in predicting intubation in COVID-19 pneumonia patients who receive HFNC. The higher value of the ROX index was associated with a higher chance of HFNC success and a lower risk of mortality.","output":"The role of ROX index in predicting intubation in COVID-19 pneumonia receiving high flow nasal cannula: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Typically, a community-based specialty practice is prepared for a limited public health crisis that is driven by a natural disaster or a localized environment event. This article describes the unexpected impact that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had on community-based specialty practices across the United States, especially oncology practices. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic national survey of community-based specialty practice administrators to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their practices and their ability to manage through a global pandemic. The 22-question survey focused on an initial observation period of March 15, 2020, to May 15, 2020, compared with a second period of May 16, 2020, to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: Oncology practices accounted for 46% of the 155 specialty practices that participated in the survey. Overall, 57% of respondents saw at least a 30% decline in total patient volume and/or financial impact during the initial observation period, compared with a 38% decline for the oncology practices. More than 70% of all practices experienced improvement after May 15, 2020, with at least 60% improving regardless of specialty. The initial decline was primarily driven by declines in new patient volume and procedures. Approximately 62% of practices anticipate a moderate-to-significant impact on patient outcomes over the next 12 months. The impact expected was slightly higher in retina and ophthalmology practices than oncology.

This sequence functions as a retrieval signal at post-ER compartment(s), but the exact compartment(s) where the retrieval occurs remains unresolved. With an affinity-purified antibody against the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the mammalian KDEL receptor, we have investigated its subcellular localization using immunogold labeling on thawed cryosections of different tissues, such as mouse spermatids and rat pancreas, as well as HeLa, Vero, NRK, and mouse L cells. We show that rab1 is an excellent marker of the intermediate compartment, and we use this marker, as well as budding profiles of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in cells infected with this virus, to identify this compartment. Our results demonstrate that the KDEL receptor is concentrated in the intermediate compartment, as well as in the Golgi stack. Lower but significant labeling was detected in the rough ER. In general, only small amounts of the receptor were detected on the trans side of the Golgi stack, including the trans- Golgi network (TGN) of normal cells and tissues. However, some stress conditions, such as infection with vaccinia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, as well as 20 degrees C or 43 degrees C treatment, resulted in a significant shift of the distribution towards the trans- TGN side of the Golgi stack. This shift could be quantified in HeLa cells stably expressing a TGN marker. No significant labeling was detected in structures distal to the TGN under all conditions tested. After GTP gamma S treatment of permeabilized cells, the receptor was detected in the beta-COP-containing buds/vesicles that accumulate after this treatment, suggesting that these vesicles may transport the receptor between compartments. We propose that retrieval of KDEL- containing proteins occurs at multiple post-ER compartments up to the TGN along the exocytotic pathway, and that within this pathway, the amounts of the receptor in different compartments varies according to physiological conditions.","output":"Localization of the Lys, Asp, Glu, Leu tetrapeptide receptor to the Golgi complex and the intermediate compartment in mammalian cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT.-: In the early months of the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM) (Baltimore, Maryland) leadership reached out to faculty to develop and implement virtual clinical clerkships after all in-person medical student clinical experiences were suspended. OBJECTIVE.-: To develop and implement a digital slide-based virtual surgical pathology (VSP) clinical elective to meet the demand for meaningful and robust virtual clinical electives in response to the temporary suspension of in-person clinical rotations at JHUSOM. DESIGN.-: The VSP elective was modeled after the in-person surgical pathology elective to include virtual previewing and sign-out with standardized cases supplemented by synchronous and asynchronous pathology educational content. RESULTS.-: Validation of existing Web communications technology and slide-scanning systems was performed by feasibility testing. Curriculum development included drafting of course objectives and syllabus, Blackboard course site design, electronic-lecture creation, communications with JHUSOM leadership, scheduling, and slide curation. Subjectively, the weekly schedule averaged 35 to 40 hours of asynchronous, synchronous, and independent content, approximately 10 to 11 hours of which were synchronous. As of February 2021, VSP has hosted 35 JHUSOM and 8 non-JHUSOM students, who have provided positive subjective and objective course feedback. CONCLUSIONS.-: The Johns Hopkins VSP elective provided meaningful clinical experience to 43 students in a time of immense online education need. Added benefits of implementing VSP included increased medical student exposure to pathology as a medical specialty and demonstration of how digital slides have the potential to improve standardization of the pathology clerkship curriculum.","output":"Continuing Undergraduate Pathology Medical Education in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Global Pandemic: The Johns Hopkins Virtual Surgical Pathology Clinical Elective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite being around for more than 40 years, DNA sequencing is regarded as young technology in clinical medicine.

As a vulnerable population to adverse events, the health status of the COVID-19 recovered pediatric patients is of great concern. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral problems among pediatric patients recovered from the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Methods A total of 122 children who were suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases and hospitalized for treatment were enrolled in the study between April 2020 and May 2020 in Wuhan, China. We collected related information about hospitalization and discharge of the children and emotional symptoms of their parents through electronic medical records and questionnaire. The behavioral problems of children were examined by applying the parent-reported the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results The participant children were discharged from hospital after about two months. Among them, 76 (62%) were boys, and the mean age was 6.71 years old. The highest prevalence of behavioral problems among pediatric children with COVID-19 was for prosocial behavior (15%), followed by total difficulties (13%), emotional symptoms (11%), hyperactivity (10%), conduct problems (9%), and peer problems (1%). With regarding to their parents, 26% reported having symptoms of anxiety and 23% as having symptoms of depression.

We investigated this claim by developing, and rigorously analyzing, a vaccination model that incorporates various forms of heterogeneity and compared it with a model that considers a homogeneous population. By employing a two-group vaccination model in heterogeneous populations, we theoretically established conditions under which heterogeneity leads to different HIT values, depending on the relative values of the contact rates for each group, the type of mixing between the groups, the relative vaccine efficacy, and the relative population size of each group. For example, under biased random mixing assumption and when vaccinating a given group results in disproportionate prevention of higher transmission per capita, we show that it is optimal to vaccinate that group before vaccinating the other groups. We also found situations, under biased assortative mixing assumption, where it is optimal to vaccinate more than one group. We show that regardless of the form of mixing between the groups, the HIT values assuming a heterogeneous population are always lower than the HIT values obtained from a corresponding model with a homogeneous population. Using realistic numerical examples and parametrization (e.g., assuming assortative mixing together with vaccine efficacy of 95% and the value of the basic reproduction number, [Formula: see text] , of the model set at [Formula: see text] 2.5), we demonstrate that the HIT value generated from a model that considers population heterogeneity (e.g., biased assortative mixing) is significantly lower (40%) compared with a HIT value of 63% obtained if the model uses homogeneous population.","output":"Vaccination and herd immunity thresholds in heterogeneous populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fructose consumption increases risk factors for cardiometabolic disease. It is assumed that the effects of free sugars on risk factors are less potent because they contain less fructose. We compared the effects of consuming fructose, glucose or their combination, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), on cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS: Adults (18-40a?years; BMI 18-35a?kg/m2) participated in a parallel, double-blinded dietary intervention during which beverages sweetened with aspartame, glucose (25% of energy requirements (ereq)), fructose or HFCS (25% and 17.5% ereq) were consumed for two weeks. Groups were matched for sex, baseline BMI and plasma lipid/lipoprotein concentrations. 24-h serial blood samples were collected at baseline and after the intervention. Primary outcomes were 24-h triglyceride AUC, LDL-cholesterol (C), and apolipoprotein (apo)B. Interactions between fructose and glucose were assessed post hoc. FINDINGS: 145 subjects (26.0a?a?5.8a?years; body mass index 25.0a?a?3.7a?kg/m2) completed the study. As expected, the increase of 24-h triglycerides compared with aspartame was highest during fructose consumption (25%: 6.66a?mmol/Lx24h 95% CI [1.90 to 11.63], Pa?=a?0.0013 versus aspartame), intermediate during HFCS consumption (25%: 4.68a?mmol/Lx24h 95% CI [-0.18 to 9.55], Pa?=a?0.066 versus aspartame) and lowest during glucose consumption. In contrast, the increase of LDL-C was highest during HFCS consumption (25%: 0.46a?mmol/L 95% CI [0.16 to 0.77], Pa?=a?0.0002 versus aspartame) and intermediate during fructose consumption (25%: 0.33a?mmol/L 95% CI [0.03 to 0.63], Pa?=a?0.023 versus aspartame), as was the increase of apoB (HFCS-25%: 0.108a?g/L 95%CI [0.032 to 0.184], Pa?=a?0.001; fructose 25%: 0.072a?g/L 95%CI [-0.004 to 0.148], Pa?=a?0.074 versus aspartame). The post hoc analyses showed significant interactive effects of fructose*glucose on LDL-C and apoB (both Pa?<a?0.01), but not on 24-h triglyceride (Pa?=a?0.340). CONCLUSION: A significant interaction between fructose and glucose contributed to increases of lipoprotein risk factors when the two monosaccharides were co-ingested as HFCS. Thus, the effects of HFCS on lipoprotein risks factors are not solely mediated by the fructose content and it cannot be assumed that glucose is a benign component of HFCS. Our findings suggest that HFCS may be as harmful as isocaloric amounts of pure fructose and provide further support for the urgency to implement strategies to limit free sugar consumption.","output":"Synergistic effects of fructose and glucose on lipoprotein risk factors for cardiovascular disease in young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Cases of COVID-19 family clusters have been reported across the globe.

This theory was supported by the observation that the use of an imperfect vaccine to control Mareks disease virus in chickens resulted in the virus evolving to be more lethal to unvaccinated birds. This raises the concern that the use of some other vaccines may lead to similar pernicious outcomes. We examine that theory with a focus on considering the regimes in which such outcomes are expected. METHODOLOGY: We evaluate the plausibility of assumptions in the original theory. The previous theory rested heavily on a particular form of transmissionCmortalityCrecovery trade-off and invoked other assumptions about the pathways of evolution. We review alternatives to mortality in limiting transmission and consider evolutionary pathways that were omitted in the original theory. RESULTS: The regime where the pernicious evolutionary outcome occurs is narrowed by our analysis but remains possible in various scenarios. We propose a more nuanced consideration of alternative models for the within-host dynamics of infections and for factors that limit virulence. Our analysis suggests imperfect vaccines against many pathogens will not lead to the evolution of pathogens with increased virulence in unvaccinated individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Evolution of greater pathogen mortality driven by vaccination remains difficult to predict, but the scope for such outcomes appears limited. Incorporation of mechanistic details into the framework, especially regarding immunity, may be requisite for prediction accuracy. LAY SUMMARY: A virus of chickens appears to have evolved high mortality in response to a vaccine that merely prevented disease symptoms. Theory has predicted this type of evolution in response to a variety of vaccines and other interventions such as drug treatment. Under what circumstances is this pernicious result likely to occur? Analysis of the theory in light of recent changes in our understanding of viral biology raises doubts that medicine-driven, pernicious evolution is likely to be common. But we are far from a mechanistic understanding of the interaction between pathogen and host that can predict when vaccines and other medical interventions will lead to the unwanted evolution of more virulent pathogens. So, while the regime where a pernicious result obtains may be limited, caution remains warranted in designing many types of interventions.","output":"Which imperfect vaccines encourage the evolution of higher virulence?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular techniques are frequently employed to treat large artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients presenting to 13 high volume stroke centers with AIS due to proximal occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent endovascular treatment within 8 h from symptom onset. Logistic regression was performed to determine the variables associated with ICH, hemorrhagic infarction (HI), and parenchymal hematomas (PHs), as well as 90 day poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3) and mortality. RESULTS There were a total of 363 ICHs (overall rate 32.3%; HI=267, 24%; PH=96, 8.5%) among the 1122 study patients (mean age 6715 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 17 (IQR 13-20)). Independent predictors for HI included diabetes mellitus (OR 2.27, 95% CI (1.58 to 3.26), p<0.0001), preprocedure IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (1.43 (1.03 to 2.08), p<0.037), Merci thrombectomy (1.47 (1.02 to 2.12), p<0.032), and longer time to puncture (1.001 (1.00 to 1.002), p<0.026). Patients with atrial fibrillation (1.61 (1.01 to 2.55), p<0.045) had a higher risk of PH while the use of IA tPA (0.57 (0.35 to 0.90), p<0.008) was associated with lower chances of PH. Both the presence of HI (2.23 (1.53 to 3.25), p<0.0001) and PH (6.24 (3.06 to 12.75), p<0.0001) were associated with poor functional outcomes; however, only PH was associated with higher mortality (3.53 (2.19 to 5.68), p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Greater understanding about the predictors and consequences of ICH post endovascular stroke therapy is essential to improve risk assessment, patient selection/clinical outcomes, and early prognostication. Our data suggest that patients with atrial fibrillation are particularly prone to severe ICH and question the 'benign' nature of HI suggested by earlier studies.","output":"Predictors and clinical relevance of hemorrhagic transformation after endovascular therapy for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion strokes: a multicenter retrospective analysis of 1122 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present study, we report a new sub-lineage of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant called AY.29, which has C5239T and T5514C mutations.

Comparing the efficiency of different RNA templates, we found that JEV NS5 protein was more efficient in using negative-strand RNA templates, indicating that the JEV NS5 protein is involved in regulating the ratio of positive- to negative-strand RNA. Four amino acid sequence motifs crucial for RdRp activity were also identified using site-directed mutagenesis analysis. All substitutions of the conserved residues within these motifs led to a complete inactivation or severe loss of enzyme activity.","output":"Identification and characterization of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in recombinant Japanese encephalitis virus NS5 protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore antecedents of helping behaviors among nurses using a social exchange framework. The paper reports an investigation into the effects of reciprocity, perceived coworker efficacy and stress on active and passive helping behaviors. Design/methodology/approach To test hypotheses, the authors performed random coefficient modeling on Mplus with data from 155 full-time nurses. Findings Nurses were willing to help coworkers regardless of perceived reciprocity levels in the relationship. Rather, their perceptions of the coworker's efficacy and previous behavior predicted helping. Originality/value This manuscript contributes to the literature in a number of ways. First, it provides empirical evidence that individuals will suppress or ignore reciprocity norms during an interdependent task. This lends credence to the idea that social exchanges may need to be examined in light of other variables or at other levels of analysis. Second, it demonstrates that investment behaviors (i.e. helping) can and do occur in exchange relationships despite low reciprocity. Overall, the data suggest that individuals are willing to maintain relationships despite a lack of returns.","output":"Above and beyond: helping behaviors among nurses in positive and negative reciprocity relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Approximately a fifth of all total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients suffers from bilateral osteoarthritis of the hip. It is unclear whether mortality risks differ between simultaneous bilateral THA and staged bilateral THA. We investigated mortality after simultaneous THA compared with staged bilateral THA in the largest cohort hitherto reported. METHODS The 42,238 patients reported to have received bilateral primary THA from 1992 to 2012 in the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register were included. Tumours and fractures as underlying diagnoses were excluded. The time interval between the first and second THA was divided into four categories or treated as a continuous variable. Unadjusted survival was calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox regression models were fitted in order to calculate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of death within different time frames. RESULTS Patients selected for simultaneous bilateral surgery were younger, more often male, and had lower ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) class than patients receiving staged procedures. The adjusted 90-day mortality after the second procedure did not differ between the four investigated groups (simultaneous bilateral [HR 1.3, CI 0.5-3.3], surgeries within 6 months [HR 1.1, CI 0.6-2.0], surgeries between 7 and 12 months [HR 0.7, CI 0.4-1.2], with second surgery after >12 months as the reference group). For patients older than 75 years, men, patients with ASA class 3 or above, and for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the 90-day mortality was increased. The unadjusted risk of implant revision of any hip was slightly higher for patients with simultaneous bilateral THA compared to those with staged procedure within one year, but after adjustment for age, gender, diagnosis and implant fixation these differences were no longer statistically significant. CONCLUSION There were no clinically relevant differences in early postoperative mortality between simultaneous and staged bilateral surgery in healthy patients. Advanced age, RA, a high ASA class and male sex increased the risk of death within 90 days. There may be an issue with enhanced risk of implant revision in patients with simultaneous bilateral THA that needs to be explored further.","output":"Early postoperative mortality after simultaneous or staged bilateral primary total hip arthroplasty: an observational register study from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a single-strand RNA virus that first began spreading in December 2019 and evolved to a global pandemic within a few months. It's transmission is primarily through direct contact of the virus with mucous membranes which possess angiotensin-converting enzyme) ACE2(. Ocular manifestations of COVID-19 are extremely rare and there is only evidence of low quantities of ACE2 in ocular tissue. Yet both the environment of the contact lens practice and the wearing of contact lenses present high potential risk of inadvertent infection. The data to date suggests no evidence of contracting COVID-19 through contact lenses and very little data supporting the possibility of coronavirus adherence to the ocular surface. To minimize opportunity for infection, practitioners may decide to delay non-essential visits. When they do examine, clinicians should wear personal protective gear as well as protective shields on equipment and include a thorough disinfecting of surfaces and equipment protocol between each examination. Patients should be reminded about the importance of appropriate contact lens hygene, namely hand washing with soap and water, drying with single use paper prior and after handling of lenses, proper disinfection and replacement of lenses and cases. Patients should not wear lenses when feeling ill and should be advised to consciously refrain from face touching to avoid unintentional contamination.

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by Computed Tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) formed the case group. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and without confirmed diagnose of pulmonary embolism formed the control group.

Results: A total of 159 patients participated were included in the study, of which 51 were the cases (patients with pulmonary embolism) and 108 patients formed the control group (patients without pulmonary embolism). The incidence of PE among those hospitalized was around 32%. Smoking history, low level of oxygen saturation, and higher D-dimer values were important risk factors that were associated with a higher risk of developing PE (p < 0.05). Higher respiratory rate was associated with higher odds of death, and decreased the possibility of survival among hospitalized patients with PE.

We aimed to evaluate changes in PTB and stillbirth rates before and during the pandemic period and assess the potential effect modification of socioeconomic status (SES). Methods Using the linked administrative health databases from Manitoba, Canada, we conducted a quasi-experimental study among all pregnant women, comparing 3.5 years pre-pandemic (1 October 2016 to 29 February 2020) to the first year of the pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2021). We used interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average models to assess the quarterly rates of PTB (<37 weeks) and stillbirths. We calculated the predicted trends based on pre-pandemic period data. Finally, we evaluated the lower and higher SES (average annual household income) using subgroup analysis and interaction models. Results We examined 70,931 pregnancies in Manitoba during the study period. Following the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions in March 2020, there were no statistically significant changes in the rates of both PTB (p=0.094) and stillbirths (p=0.958). However, over the pandemic, the PTB rate significantly decreased as a rebound effect by 0.63% per quarter(p=0.005); whereas the stillbirth rate did not change significantly (p=0.878) compared to pre-pandemic period. During the first quarter of 2021, the absolute differences in the observed and expected PTB and stillbirth percentages were 2.05% and 0.04%, respectively. We observed a statistically significant effect modification by SES for PTB rates (p=0.047). Conclusion While the onset of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions was not associated with significant effects on PTB and stillbirth rates, we observed a statistically significant rebound effect on PTB rates.

Conventional manual cluster detection is usually restricted to certain areas of the hospital and multidrug resistant organisms. Automation can increase the comprehensiveness of cluster surveillance without depleting human resources. We aimed to describe the application of an automated cluster alert system (CLAR) in the routine IPC work in a hospital. Additionally, we aimed to provide information on the clusters detected and their properties. METHODS: CLAR was continuously utilized during the year 2019 at Charit university hospital. CLAR analyzed microbiological and patient-related data to calculate a pathogen-baseline for every ward. Daily, this baseline was compared to data of the previous 14 days. If the baseline was exceeded, a cluster alert was generated and sent to the IPC team. From July 2019 onwards, alerts were systematically categorized as relevant or non-relevant at the discretion of the IPC physician in charge. RESULTS: In one year, CLAR detected 1,714 clusters. The median number of isolates per cluster was two. The most common cluster pathogens were Enterococcus faecium (n = 326, 19 %), Escherichia coli (n = 274, 16 %) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 250, 15 %). The majority of clusters (n = 1,360, 79 %) comprised of susceptible organisms. For 906 alerts relevance assessment was performed, with 317 (35 %) alerts being classified as relevant. CONCLUSIONS: CLAR demonstrated the capability of detecting small clusters and clusters of susceptible organisms. Future improvements must aim to reduce the number of non-relevant alerts without impeding detection of relevant clusters. Digital solutions to IPC represent a considerable potential for improved patient care.

It is, therefore, vital to accelerate the screening of new molecules or vaccines to win the battle against this pandemic. Experiences from previous epidemiological data on coronaviruses guide investigators in designing and exploring new compounds for a safe and cost-effective treatment. Several reports on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the novel COVID-19 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for binding to the host cell in the lung epithelia through the spike protein on their virion surface. ACE2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase best known for cleaving major peptides and substrates. Its degree in human airway epithelia positively correlates with coronavirus infection.

The fact that women often report a negative experience with vaginal childbirth, with physical pain and feelings of unsafety, neglect, or abuse, may explain the high acceptability of elective cesarean sections. The recognition of information needs and of the right to informed choice during childbirth can help change this reality. The internet has been the main source of health information, but its quality is highly variable. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an information and communication strategy through a smartphone app with respect to childbirth, to facilitate informed choices for access to safer and evidence-based care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, with 2 arms (intervention and control) and a closed, blind, parallel design, will be conducted with a smartphone app designed for behavior and opinion research in Brazil, with women of reproductive age previously registered on the app. After completing an entry questionnaire to verify the eligibility criteria and obtaining ethical consent, approximately 20,000 participants will be randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups at a 1:1 ratio. Participants allocated to the intervention group will be invited to engage in a digital information and communication strategy, which is designed to expand evidence-based knowledge on the advantages and disadvantages of options for labor and childbirth and the safety of the care processes. The information is based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for a positive childbirth experience and has been updated to include the new challenges and disruptions in maternity care within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The control group will receive information regarding disposable and reusable diapers as a placebo intervention. The groups will be compared in their responses in generating the birth plan and the entry and exit questionnaires, regarding responses less or more aligned with the guidelines for a positive childbirth experience. A qualitative component to map information needs is included. RESULTS: The digital trial started recruiting participants in late October 2020, and data collection has been projected to be complete by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This study will evaluate an innovative intervention that has the potential to promote better communication between women and providers, such that they can make better choices using an approach suitable for use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We present a near-optimal coverage planner for mobile UV disinfection robots. The formulation optimizes the irradiation time efficiency, while ensuring that a sufficient dosage of radiation is received by each surface. The trajectory and dosage plan are optimized taking collision and light occlusion constraints into account.

The aim of this coping review is to identify the usage of telerehabilitation and its common platform of delivery among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive frailty (CF). Articles published from January 2015 until October 2020 were selected. Out of the 1738 articles retrieved, six studies were identified. Two articles were randomized controlled trials, one was a pilot study and three were qualitative studies. The outcome suggests that telerehabilitation may improve the quality of life among participants as well as it can be a useful and supportive digital platform for health care. Some types of technologies commonly used were smartphones or telephones with internet, television-based assistive integrated technology, mobile application and videoconference. Telerehabilitation utilization in managing cognitive frailty among older adults is still limited and more research is required to evaluate its feasibility and acceptability. Although telerehabilitation appears to be implemented among older adults with MCI and CF, some social support is still required to improve the adherence and effectiveness of telerehabilitation. Future research should focus on the evaluation of acceptance and participants existing knowledge towards telerehabilitation to achieve its target.","output":"A Scoping Review for Usage of Telerehabilitation among Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Cognitive Frailty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral respiratory infections have been related to asthma in several ways. It is well established that viral common colds precipitate exacerbations of asthma. Severe bronchiolitis in early life is related to subsequent wheezing and therefore may represent a marker of susceptibility to asthma; alternatively, it could be involved in the initiation of the disease. Finally, it is possible that some infections may protect from the development of asthma and allergies by promoting a type-1 host response. However, whether respiratory or other viruses could mediate such a protective effect is debated. The design and implementation of novel anti- or proviral strategies targeting asthma depends on the resolution of these questions. This review presents current evidence on the epidemiologic correlations and proposed mechanisms for the involvement of viral infections in the development and progression of asthma.","output":"The role of viruses in the induction and progression of asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty aims at giving the patients the best available treatment at all times, being a dynamic entity. Fast-track combines evidence-based, clinical features with organizational optimization including a revision of traditions resulting in a streamlined pathway from admission till discharge C and beyond. The goal is to reduce morbidity, mortality and functional convalescence with an earlier achievement of functional milestones including functional discharge criteria with subsequent reduced length of stay and high patient satisfaction. Outcomes are traditionally measured as length of stay; safety aspects in the form of morbidity/mortality; patient satisfaction; and C as a secondary parameter C economic savings. Optimization of the clinical aspects include focusing on analgesia; DVT-prophylaxis; mobilization; care principles including functional discharge criteria; patient-characteristics to predict outcome; and traditions which may be barriers in optimizing outcomes. Patients should be informed and motivated to be active participants and their expectations should be modulated in order to improve satisfaction. Also, organizational aspects need to be analyzed and optimized. New logistical approaches should be implemented; the ward ideally (re)structured to only admit arthroplasties; the staff educated to have a uniform approach; extensive preoperative information given including discharge criteria and intended length of stay. This thesis includes 9 papers on clinical and organizational aspects of fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty (ICIX). A detailed description of the fast-track set-up and its components is provided. Major results include identification of patient characteristics to predict length of stay and satisfaction with different aspects of the hospital stay (I); how to optimize analgesia by using a compression bandage in total knee arthroplasty (II); the clinical and organizational set-up facilitating or acting as barriers for early discharge (III); safety aspects following fast-track in the form of few readmissions in general (IV) and few thromboembolic complications in particular (V); feasibility studies showing excellent outcomes following fast-track bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty (VI) and non-septic revision knee arthroplasty (VII); how acute pain relief in total hip arthroplasty is not enhanced by the use of local infiltration analgesia when multi-modal opioid-sparing analgesia is given (VIII); and a detailed description of which clinical and organizational factors detain patients in hospital following fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty (IX). Economic savings following fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty is also documented in studies, reviews, metaanalyses and Cochrane reviews C including the present fast-track (ANORAK). In conclusion, the published results (ICIX) provide substantial, important new knowledge on clinical and organizational aspects of fast-track hip and knee arthroplasty C with concomitant documented high degrees of safety (morbidity/mortality) and patient satisfaction. Future research strategies are multiple and include both research strategies as efforts to implement the fast-track methodology on a wider basis. Research areas include improvements in pain treatment, blood saving strategies, fluid plans, reduction of complications, avoidance of tourniquet and concomitant blood loss, improved early functional recovery and muscle strengthening.

While reliable nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays were rapidly available, only a limited number of validated serological assays were available in the early phase of the pandemic. Here, we evaluated a novel flow cytometric approach to assess spike-specific antibody responses.HEK 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in its natural confirmation on the surface were used to detect specific IgG and IgM antibody responses in patient sera by flow cytometry. A soluble angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE-2) variant was developed as external standard to quantify spike-specific antibody responses on different assay platforms. Analyses of 201 pre-COVID-19 sera proved a high assay specificity in comparison to commercially available CLIA and ELISA systems, while also revealing the highest sensitivity in specimens from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The external standard allowed robust quantification of antibody responses among different assay platforms. In conclusion, our newly established flow cytometric assay allows sensitive and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, which can be easily adopted in different laboratories and does not rely on external supply of assay kits. The flow cytometric assay also provides a blueprint for rapid development of serological tests to other emerging viral infections.","output":"Rapid response flow cytometric assay for the detection of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Key Points: \\"[1] Food insufficiency rates since the start of the pandemic--that is, not having enough food to eat--have hovered around 11 percent of all US households and 14 percent for US households with children, with little fluctuation week to week [2] Assessing households' perceived changes in food insufficiency from before the pandemic to after shows only slight increases, indicating that federal economic relief efforts likely protected many households from increases in severe food hardship [3] Food insufficiency levels remained elevated for households that experienced employment disruptions and recent unemployment, especially when households did not report receiving unemployment compensation [4] For food insufficiency levels to remain stable, these findings point to a continued need for providing economic relief to households that have experienced employment disruptions \\"","output":"Food Insufficiency During the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To eradicate most infectious diseases, mathematical modelling of contagious diseases has revealed that a combination of quarantine, vaccination, and cure is frequently required. However, eradicating the disease will remain a difficult task if they aren't provided at the appropriate time and in the right quantity. Control analysis has been shown to be an effective way for discovering the best approaches to preventing the spread of contagious diseases through the development of disease preventive interventions. The method comprises reducing the cost of infection, implementing control measures, or both. In order to gain a better understanding of COVID-19's future dynamics, this study presents a compartmental mathematical model. The problem is modelled as a highly nonlinear coupled system of classical order ODEs, which is then generalised using the Mittag-Leffler kernel's fractal-fractional derivative. The uniqueness of the fractional model under discussion has also been demonstrated. The boundedness and non-negativity of the considered model are also established. The next generation technique is used to examine basic reproduction, anddisease free and endemic equilibrium. We used reported cases from Australia in this investigation due to the high risk of infection. The reported cases are considered between 1st July 2021 and 20th August 2021. On the basis of previous data, the spread of infection is predicted for the next 600 days which is shown through different graphs. The graphical solution of the considered nonlinear model is obtained via numerical scheme by implementing the MATLAB software. Based on the fitted values of parameters, the basic reproduction number R 0 is calculated as R 0  1.58276 . Furthermore, the impact of fractional and fractal parameter on the disease spread among different classes is demonstrated. In addition, the impact of quarantine and vaccination on infected people is dramatically depicted. It's been argued that public awareness of the quarantine and effective vaccination can drastically reduce infection rates in the population.","output":"Sensitivity Analysis of COVID-19 with Quarantine and Vaccination: A Fractal-Fractional Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak. Objective: To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32a?583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification. Exposures: Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results: Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1.

As a result, I would like to point Out the following issues. (i) Special Approval for Emergency is a system for approving drugs approved overseas, not a system for approving drugs originally developed in Japan. A system to approve drugs that have not been approved in foreign countries needs to be considered. (ii) In the Special Approval for Emergency system, it is necessary to ensure that postmarketing activities are conducted in accordance with the Risk Management Plan and the conditions of approval, to disclose the results in a timely and speedy manner, and to judge the appropriateness of continued approval based on the results of postmarketing activities.","output":"Japan's Special Approval for Emergency System During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is currently a global health threat. Healthcare workers are on the front-line of the COVID-19 outbreak response and therefore at heightened risk of infection. There is a dearth of evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa about healthcare worker experiences in managing COVID-19. We have reported on healthcare worker responses, experiences, and perspectives on epidemic response strategies at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Malawis largest referral hospital. Methods We conducted 39 face-to-face in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 in Malawi (March 2020 to October 2020). The study included healthcare workers who provided direct and indirect patient care. Results During the early phase of the first wave (March to May 2020), healthcare workers expressed concerns with inadequate working space, unconducive infrastructure, delayed and rushed training on the management of COVID-19, and lack of incentives. Additionally, the hospital had staff shortages and limited essential resources such as piped oxygen and personal protective equipment. This increased healthcare worker fears of contracting COVID-19 and they were less willing to volunteer at COVID-19 isolation units. Resource constraints and limited preparedness compromised the care pathway particularly with increased numbers of COVID-19 patients. By the peak of the first wave (June to August 2020) many of these issues had been resolved. The hospital provided refresher training courses, personal protective equipment became available, incentives were offered to healthcare workers working in COVID-19 units and piped oxygen was installed. Staff morale was boosted, and more staff were willing to work at the COVID-19 isolation centres. Conclusion Experiences of healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 are critical for improving care in future COVID-19 waves. Response strategies in resource-constrained areas should prioritise timely training of staff, creation of adequate isolation areas, provision of adequate medical supplies and strengthening leadership.","output":"An increase in COVID-19 patients would be overwhelming: A qualitative description of healthcare workers experiences during the first wave of COVID-19 (March 2020 to October 2020) at Malawis largest referral hospital (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper describes the example of an interesting distance visit approach carried out during the COVID-19 emergency, applied to an underground oil-mill in the town of Gallipoli (Puglia, Italy).

However, little is known about the associations of different types of CM with social support in Chinese patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which was the goal of the current study. Methods: One hundred and sixty-six patients with moderate-to-severe MDD were enrolled. Participants were assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-28 item Short Form, Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the 24-item Hamilton rating scale for depression, and the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Correlation analysis and Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis were adopted to investigate associations of types of CM with social support. Results: (1) Physical neglect (PN) and emotional neglect (EN) were the most commonly reported types of CM in patients with MDD. (2) EN was the only type of CM significant in the regression models of the SSRS total score, the score of subjective support, and the score of utilization of support. Limitations: The data of CM was collected retrospectively and recall bias may be introduced. Assessment of CM and social support were self-reported and could be influenced by the depression status.

While the increasing lifespan contributes to a higher incidence of CKD among the elderly, the diagnostic picture in this age group is complicated by senescence-related changes. A better understanding of the etiology and progression of the disease warrants renal biopsy in such patients. This study aims to explore the histopathological spectrum of native renal biopsies leading to CKD in elderly patients in a tertiary care hospital. Methods Among the list of patients who had undergone renal biopsy at our institute from January 2015 to March 2020, elderly patients aged  60years were chosen for this study. Their demographic details, lab investigations and histopathological reports were collected. The sex distribution and prevalence of different renal diseases was calculated. The subjects were classified into four broad diagnostic groups - primary glomerular disease, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, and tubulointerstitial disease. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values were calculated and used to stage chronic kidney disease in these patients. Statistical analysis was carried out to find a correlation between diagnostic groups and CKD presence and between serum C3 values and immunofluorescence for the same on biopsy. Results One hundred thirty-two patients formed the study sample with a male to female ratio of 1.28:1, showing a slight male predominance. The most common diagnostic group was primary glomerular disease (46%), among which focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was the most common entity (12%). 47.7% and 66.6% of patients in the study sample showed elevated serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values, respectively. 86% of our study sample had low eGFR values, and the majority (35%) of the patients were classified under CKD stage 3. CKD incidence was high among patients with primary glomerular diseases, but no significant statistical correlation was found. 43.5% of all IF positive cases showed low serum C3 values and established a positive correlation between IF and serum C3 values. Conclusion There is no statistically significant correlation of the four diagnostic groups to the CKD. CKD in the elderly may be multifactorial, and a collaborative study across the nations may be needed to further evaluate the etiology.","output":"A Spectrum of Biopsy C Proven Renal Disorders and Their Clinicopathological Correlation in Elderly Population From a Tertiary Care Center in South India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury are life-threatening manifestations of severe viral infection. The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to respiratory complications, such as endothelialitis, intussusceptive angiogenesis, and vascular leakage remain unclear. In this study, by using an immunofluorescence assay and in situ RNA-hybridization, we demonstrate the capability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect human primary lung microvascular endothelial cells (HL-mECs) in the absence of cytopathic effects and release of infectious particles. Preliminary data point to the role of integrins in SARS-CoV-2 entry into HL-mECs in the absence of detectable ACE2 expression. Following infection, HL-mECs were found to release a plethora of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic molecules, as assessed by microarray analyses. This conditioned microenvironment stimulated HL-mECs to acquire an angiogenic phenotype. Proteome analysis confirmed a remodeling of SARS-CoV-2-infected HL-mECs to inflammatory and angiogenic responses and highlighted the expression of antiviral molecules as annexin A6 and MX1. These results support the hypothesis of a direct role of SARS-CoV-2-infected HL-mECs in sustaining vascular dysfunction during the early phases of infection. The construction of virus-host interactomes will be instrumental to identify potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19 aimed to inhibit HL-mEC-sustained inflammation and angiogenesis upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection Remodels the Phenotype and Promotes Angiogenesis of Primary Human Lung Endothelial Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2-Phenoxyacetamide group has been identified as one of markers in the discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agent through its main protease (M(pro)) inhibition pathway.

Dentists in this region have incorporated several changes to their practices to help minimize risks of person-to-person transmission inside dental offices. This narrative review aimed to provide an in-depth overview of the current situation in the Southeast Asian region regarding the use of teledentistry during the pandemic. Teledentistry involves the transfer of patient information across remote distances for online consultation and treatment planning. A few years back, it used to be a lesser-known entity but has seen an exponential rise in its incorporation into dental practices all around the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) region. Many clinics in the Southeast Asian region have started using online consultations to ensure that patients can be diagnosed or followed up during their treatment. Teledentistry is the clear answer in the coming months as it will help reduce the risk of virus transmission and help patients get access to oral healthcare and dentists to see their patients. This article reviews the current pandemic situation in the ASEAN region, the recent evidence, and the scope of teledentistry. It also provides recommendations for the future and sheds light on the different types of teledentistry and how it can be incorporated into practices by regulatory authorities in this region.","output":"The Exponential Rise of Teledentistry and Patient-Oriented Protective Measures in Southeast Asian Dental Clinics: Concerns, Benefits, and Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019 and has affected millions of lives worldwide, while many aspects of the illness are still unknown. Current data show that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffer from kidney damage, in the form of proteinuria, hematuria or acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is especially prevalent among severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients and is a predictor of mortality. The pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19 is unclear. Early reports of histopathologic examination from autopsied kidney tissue show SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in renal tubular cells and podocytes, suggesting direct viral infection, as well as findings of acute tubular necrosis, while rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI and glomerulopathies may also occur. As of today, only remdesivir has been authorized to treat COVID-19. Ongoing research investigates potential of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents along with safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed drugs such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers.

CAR-induced immune cell (CARi) products have achieved impressive success rates in treating some difficult-to-treat hematological malignancies. Here, we describe effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on CARi publication landscape. Due to the pandemic, the total number of publications decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 in all fields of cancer immunotherapy except CARi. Nearly exponential increases in the number of CARi publications slowed-down in 2020 for the first time in the past 11 years. There were more CARi than coronavirus publications until 2020 when coronavirus publications increased over 5,000% compared to 2019 (575 publications in 2019 vs. 30,390 in 2020). Unlike cancer immunotherapy where the majority of the publications consist of conference abstracts and review articles, majority of the coronavirus publications are original research articles. There are more coronavirus publications in Pubmed than Embase. The opposite is true for CARi publications. Our analysis of the data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) show significantly higher death rate in patients treated with Kymirah than Yescarta (28.14% vs. 16.02%). Kymirah and Yescarta are the two main CAR T cell products for treatment of DLBCL and/or B-ALL. However, despite being highly significant, this result is not easily interpretable due to multiple confounding variables in the FAERS data. Our analysis additionally suggest that the significant effects of co-stimulatory domains (4-1BB vs. CD28) consistently reported in preclinical studies do not translate into clinical results. Our manual curation of the CARi publications in PubMed shows that only 5.2% of the publications report results from CARi clinical trials, although we found 663 clinical trials listed on ClinicalTrials.gov database. In conclusion, publication landscape in CARi as well as other fields of cancer immunotherapy has changed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. This trend will likely continue in the near future. CARi research is now in need of increased measures by publishers to reduce repetitive and/or duplicate publications and more stringent criteria for data entry into public databases including PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and FAERS to advance this important field of medical research.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on publication landscape in chimeric antigen receptor-modified immune cell research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objective was to perform competitive usability testing to assess the user experience of conventional laparoscopic and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) devices. BACKGROUND Recent advancements in single-incision instrumentation have created more interest in and usage of LESS. However, neither LESS nor its novel multichannel access devices have been thoroughly studied. METHOD Using a simulation test bed and standardized laparoscopic surgery task, the user experience of three commercially available LESS devices was compared to conventional laparoscopic ports based on time on task, errors, task success, and perceived ease of use. RESULTS There were no significant differences between devices for time on task, errors, or task success (p > .05). For all devices, there were significantly more recoverable than unrecoverable errors, and errors occurred more frequently during the second phase of the task when the dominant hand was more active (p < .0001). Conventional laparoscopy was rated as easier to use than were the LESS devices (p < .01). CONCLUSION Device performance of a basic laparoscopic task was similar in both conventional laparoscopy and LESS. Each of the LESS devices facilitated efficient and accurate aiming and grasping movements compared to conventional laparoscopy. Further investigation of human factors and ergonomics of LESS is needed to further develop, evaluate, and refine single-site surgery technologies to create a user experience equivalent to conventional laparoscopy.

To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of anxiety state is still based on some subjective questionnaires and there is no objective standard assessment yet. Unlike other methods, our approach focuses on study the neural changes to identify and classify the anxiety state using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. METHODS: We designed a closed neurofeedback experiment that contains three experimental stages to adjust subjects mental state. The EEG resting state signal was recorded from thirty-four subjects in the first and third stages while EEG-based mindfulness recording was recorded in the second stage. At the end of each stage, the subjects were asked to fill a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). According to their VAS score, the subjects were classified into three groups: non-anxiety, moderate or severe anxiety groups. RESULTS: After processing the EEG data of each group, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were able to classify and identify two mental states (non-anxiety and anxiety) using the Power Spectral Density (PSD) as patterns. The highest classification accuracies using Gaussian kernel function and polynomial kernel function are 92.48  1.20% and 88.60  1.32%, respectively. The highest average of the classification accuracies for healthy subjects is 95.31  1.97% and for anxiety subjects is 87.18  3.51%.

By reviewing the literature and engaging with key stakeholders, we developed an intervention, which included collaborative goal-setting, education and medicines optimisation, for testing in a feasibility study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility (recruitment, intervention delivery, and data collection methods) of a pharmacist-facilitated medicines review intervention for Mori older adults, and proposed intervention outcomes. METHODS: This study was reported in accordance with the CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to randomised controlled pilot and feasibility trials and the Consolidated criteria for strengthening reporting of health research involving indigenous peoples: the CONSIDER statement. Participant eligibility criteria were: Mori; aged 55-plus; community-dwelling; enrolled in a general practice in Waitemat District Health Board (Auckland, NZ). Consented participants engaged in a medicines education component (participant and pharmacist) and an optional medicines optimisation component (participant, pharmacist and prescriber). Outcomes measures included: the feasibility of data collection tools and methods, time taken to conduct the intervention and research processes; medicines knowledge, medicines appropriateness and quality of life (QoL); pharmacist recommendations and prescriber acceptance rate. RESULTS: Seventeen consented participants took part in the intervention from December 2019CMarch 2020 with the majority (n = 12) recruited through general practice mail-outs. Data collection was feasible using the predetermined outcome measure tools and was complete for all patient participants. Pharmacist intervention delivery was feasible.

Cytokines, chemokines, and antibodies can be assayed to determine the extent to which a patient responded to a pathogen. We examined serum and plasma from a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic and compared them to negative-control sera. Cytokine and chemokine concentrations varied depending on the severity of infection, and antibody responses were significantly increased in severe cases compared to mild to moderate infections. Neutralization data revealed that patients with high titers against an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate had detectable but limited neutralizing antibodies against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta and Delta variants.

Understanding factors that can influence the participation of community-dwelling older adults in PA is crucial in an ageing society. This will be paramount in aiding the design of future interventions to effectively promote PA in this population. The main aim of this qualitative study was to explore influences on PA among community-dwelling older people, and the secondary aim was to explore gender differences. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected in 2014 by conducting focus group discussions using a semi-structured discussion guide with older people resident in Hertfordshire, UK. Discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. RESULTS: Ninety-two participants were recruited to the study (47% women; 74C83 years) and a total of 11 focus groups were conducted. Findings indicated six themes that appeared to affect older adults participation in PA: past life experiences; significant life events; getting older; PA environment; psychological/personal factors; and social capital. Overall, the findings emphasised the role of modifiable factors, namely psychological factors (such as self-efficacy, motivation, outcome expectancy) and social factors (such as social support and social engagement). These factors exerted their own influence on physical activity participation, but also appeared to mediate the effect of other largely non-modifiable background and ageing-related factors on participants engagement with PA in later life. CONCLUSION: In view of these findings, intervention designers could usefully work with behavioural scientists for insight as to how to enhance psychological and social factors in older adults. Our data suggest that interventions that aim to build self-efficacy, motivation and social networks have the potential to indirectly promote PA participation in older adults. This would be best achieved by developing physical activity interventions through working with participants in an empowering and engaging way.","output":"Understanding influences on physical activity participation by older adults: A qualitative study of community-dwelling older adults from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Envelope glycoproteins of many viruses are heavily glycosylated Among other functions, virus glycans can mediate interactions with host receptors and contribute to internalization and virus dissemination The C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN, which is expressed by cells of the innate immune system, can act as an entry receptor for pathogens, including pandemic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, ebola, and HIV In the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this mechanism has been linked to severe cases of COVID-19 Inhibition of the interaction between","output":"Poly-L-lysine Glycoconjugates Inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated Attachment of Pandemic Viruses (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the emergence of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in China at the end of 2019, the virus has spread rapidly across the globe leading to millions of infections and subsequent deaths.

Use of CO(2) laser in laryngeal surgery has been observed to generate aerosols, however, other techniques, such cold dissection and microdebrider, have not been sufficiently investigated. We aimed to assess whether aerosol generation occurs during laryngeal operations and the effect of different instruments on aerosol production. METHODS: We measured particle concentration generated during surgeries with an Optical Particle Sizer. Cough data collected from volunteers and aerosol concentration of an empty operating room served as references. Aerosol concentrations when using different techniques and equipment were compared with references as well as with each other. RESULTS: Thirteen laryngological surgeries were evaluated. The highest total aerosol concentrations were observed when using CO(2) laser and these were significantly higher than the concentrations when using microdebrider or cold dissection (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001) or in the background or during coughing (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). In contrast, neither microdebrider nor cold dissection produced significant concentrations of aerosol compared with coughing (p = 0.146, p = 0.753). In comparing all three techniques, microdebrider produced the least aerosol particles. CONCLUSIONS: Microdebrider and cold dissection can be regarded as aerosol-generating relative to background reference concentrations, but they should not be considered as high-risk aerosol-generating procedures, as the concentrations are low and do not exceed those of coughing.

The arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct Colombian municipalities (Bello, Ccuta and Moniquir). These locations were confirmed as three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature, minimum temperature and wind speed were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016 epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Ccuta, an area of sustained high incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Ccuta, fleeing political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable local knowledge base.

There is no research on potential healthcare inequities in the context of joint classes or on the impact of the recent shift toward telehealth due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using data from a large metropolitan health system, we aimed to (1) identify demographic patterns in prepandemic joint class attendance and (2) understand the impact of telehealth on attendance. METHODS: We included data on 3,090 TJA patients from three centers, each with a separately operated joint class. Attendance patterns were assessed prepandemic and after the resumption of elective surgeries when classes transitioned to telehealth. Statistical testing included standardized differences (SD > 0.1 indicates significance) and a multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: The in-person and telehealth attendance rates were 69.9% and 69.2%, respectively. Joint class attendance was significantly higher for non-White, Hispanic, non-English primary language, Medicaid, and Medicare patients (all SD > 0.1). Age was a determinant of attendance for telehealth (SD > 0.1) but not for in-person (SD = 0.04). Contrastingly, physical distance from hospital was significant for in-person (SD > 0.1) but not for telehealth (SD = 0.06).

Non-critical patients (n = 186) with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity reported persistent symptoms using a standardized questionnaire and underwent pulmonary function and 6-minute walk testing between 30 and 90 days following the onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms. Patients were divided into those with (n = 70) and without (n = 116) persistent dyspnoea.

Therefore, physiologically relevant animal models under realistic SARS-CoV-2 infection conditions would be helpful to our understanding of dysregulated inflammation response in lung in the context of targeted therapeutics. Here, we characterized the single-cell landscape in lung and spleen upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in an acute severe disease mouse model that replicates human symptoms, including severe lung pathology and lymphopenia. We showed a reduction of lymphocyte populations and an increase of neutrophils in lung and then demonstrated the key role of neutrophil-mediated lung immunopathology in both mice and humans. Under severe conditions, neutrophils recruited by a chemokine-driven positive feedback produced elevated fatal signature proinflammatory genes and pathways related to neutrophil activation or releasing of granular content. In addition, we identified a new Cd177(high) cluster that is undergoing respiratory burst and Stfa(high) cluster cells that may dampen antigen presentation upon infection. We also revealed the devastating effect of overactivated neutrophil by showing the highly enriched neutrophil extracellular traps in lung and a dampened B-cell function in either lung or spleen that may be attributed to arginine consumption by neutrophil.

Although such thrombotic events are more commonly seen during phases of active AAV, they are also recognized to occur during AAV in remission. Endothelial injury is a key pathogenic event in AAV. Endothelial injury can be caused by neutrophil activation and release of thrombogenic tissue factor into the circulation. Neutrophil activation further results in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs contribute to thrombosis by expressing tissue factor. NETs have also been detected in cutaneous thrombi from patients with AAV induced by hydralazine. Activated neutrophils in AAV patients release thrombogenic microparticles loaded with tissue factor which further enhances clotting of blood. Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs) have been detected in up to a third of AAV and might also be induced by drugs such as cocaine adulterated with levamisole and propylthiouracil, which are known to trigger AAV. Such APLs further drive the thrombosis in AAV. Once thrombogenesis occurs, the homeostatic mechanisms resulting in clot dissolution are further impaired in AAV due to anti-plasminogen antibodies. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with endothelial injury and NETosis, mechanisms which are in common with AAV.

In this study, we evaluate the effect of xenon treatment on functional outcome, lesion volume, neuronal loss and neuroinflammation after severe TBI in rats. METHODS: Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) brain trauma or sham surgery followed by treatment with either 50% xenon:25% oxygen balance nitrogen, or control gas 75% nitrogen:25% oxygen. Locomotor function was assessed using Catwalk-XT automated gait analysis at baseline and 24 h after injury. Histological outcomes were assessed following perfusion fixation at 15 min or 24 h after injury or sham procedure. RESULTS: Xenon treatment reduced lesion volume, reduced early locomotor deficits, and attenuated neuronal loss in clinically relevant cortical and subcortical areas. Xenon treatment resulted in significant increases in Iba1-positive microglia and GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes that was associated with neuronal preservation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that xenon improves functional outcome and reduces neuronal loss after brain trauma in rats. Neuronal preservation was associated with a xenon-induced enhancement of microglial cell numbers and astrocyte activation, consistent with a role for early beneficial neuroinflammation in xenons neuroprotective effect.

Participants were 129 football professional players (all males, 24.4  4.7 years), who underwent anthropometrics, flexibility, and RAG and CODS (both evaluated on non-dominant and dominant side) at the beginning of second half-season 2019/20 (predictors). Over the following half-season, occurrence of injury was registered (outcome). To identify the differences between groups based on injury occurrence, t-test was used. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were calculated to identify the associations between predictors and outcome. Results showed incidence of 1.3 injuries per 1000 h of training/game per player, with higher likelihood for injury occurrence during game than during training (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.1, 95%CI: 1.63C5.88) Univariate logistic regression showed significant associations between players age (OR = 1.65, 95%CI: 1.25C2.22), playing time (OR = 2.01, 95%CI: 1.560C2.58), and RAG (OR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.09C1.35, and OR = 1.18, 95%CI: 1.04C1.33 for RAG on dominant- and non-dominant side, respectively), and injury occurrence.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of total fat intake on measures of weight and body fatness in children and young people not aiming to lose weight. SEARCH METHODS For this update we revised the previous search strategy and ran it over all years in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and Embase (Ovid) (current to 23 May 2017). No language and publication status limits were applied. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished studies (5 June 2017). SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children aged 24 months to 18 years, with or without risk factors for cardiovascular disease, randomised to a lower fat (30% or less of total energy (TE)) versus usual or moderate-fat diet (greater than 30%TE), without the intention to reduce weight, and assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We included prospective analytical cohort studies in these children if they related baseline total fat intake to weight or body fatness at least 12 months later. We duplicated inclusion decisions and resolved disagreement by discussion with other authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We extracted data on participants, interventions or exposures, controls and outcomes, and trial or cohort quality characteristics, as well as data on potential effect modifiers, and assessed risk of bias for all included studies. We extracted outcome data using the following time point ranges, when available: RCTs: baseline to six months, six to 12 months, one to two years, two to five years and more than five years; cohort studies: baseline to one year, one to two years, two to five years, five to 10 years and more than 10 years. We planned to perform random-effects meta-analyses with relevant subgrouping, and sensitivity and funnel plot analyses where data allowed. MAIN RESULTS We included 24 studies comprising three parallel-group RCTs (n = 1054 randomised) and 21 prospective analytical cohort studies (about 25,059 children completed). Twenty-three were conducted in high-income countries. No meta-analyses were possible, since only one RCT reported the same outcome at each time point range for all outcomes, and cohort studies were too heterogeneous.For the RCTs, concerns about imprecision and poor reporting limited our confidence in our findings. In addition, the inclusion of hypercholesteraemic children in two trials raised concerns about applicability. Lower versus usual or modified total fat intake may have made little or no difference to weight over a six- to twelve month period (mean difference (MD) -0.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.78 to 0.78; 1 RCT; n = 620; low-quality evidence), nor a two- to five-year period (MD -0.60 kg, 95% CI -2.39 to 1.19; 1 RCT; n = 612; low-quality evidence). Compared to controls, lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) probably decreased BMI in children over a one- to two-year period (MD -1.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -2.45 to -0.55; 1 RCT; n = 191; moderate-quality evidence), with no other differences evident across the other time points (two to five years: MD 0.00 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.63; 1 RCT; n = 541; greater than five years; MD -0.10 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.55; 1 RCT; n = 576; low-quality evidence). Lower fat intake probably slightly reduced total cholesterol over six to 12 months compared to controls (MD -0.15 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), but may make little or no difference over longer time periods. Lower fat intake probably slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol over six to 12 months (MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04; 1 RCT; n = 618, moderate-quality evidence) and over two to five years (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01; 1 RCT; n = 623; moderate-quality evidence), compared to controls. However, lower total fat intake probably made little or no difference to HDL-C over a six- to 12-month period (MD -0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.02; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence), nor a two- to five-year period (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; 1 RCT; n = 522; moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, lower total fat intake probably made little or no difference to triglycerides in children over a six- to 12-month period (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; 1 RCT; n = 618; moderate-quality evidence). Lower versus usual or modified fat intake may make little or no difference to height over more than five years (MD -0.60 cm, 95% CI -2.06 to 0.86; 1 RCT; n = 577; low-quality evidence).Over half the cohort analyses that reported on primary outcomes suggested that as total fat intake increases, body fatness measures may move in the same direction. However, heterogeneous methods and reporting across cohort studies, and predominantly very low-quality evidence, made it difficult to draw firm conclusions and true relationships may be substantially different. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We were unable to reach firm conclusions. Limited evidence from three trials that randomised children to a lower total fat intake (30% or less TE) versus usual or modified fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed small reductions in body mass index, total- and LDL-cholesterol at some time points with lower fat intake compared to controls, and no consistent differences in effects on weight, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or height. Associations in cohort studies that related total fat intake to later measures of body fatness in children were inconsistent and the quality of this evidence was mostly very low. Twenty-three out of 24 included studies were conducted in high-income countries, and may not be applicable in low- and middle-income settings. High-quality, longer-term studies are needed, that include low- and middle-income settings and look at both possible benefits and risks.","output":"Effects of total fat intake on bodyweight in children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, considerable attention has been focused on thymus\\\\derived CD4(+) regulatory T cells that constitutively express CD25 and have a contact\\\\dependent, cytokine\\\\independent mechanism in vitro.

Here we review our studies using the combination of IL\\\\2 and transforming growth factor  (TGF\\\\) to generate regulatory T cell subsets ex vivo, and the work of others using IL\\\\10 to induce suppressive activity. Under certain conditions, the autocrine effects of TGF\\\\ and IL\\\\10 induce peripheral T cells to produce immunosuppressive levels of each of these cytokines. This effect of TGF\\\\ is IL\\\\2 dependent. Under other conditions IL\\\\2 and TGF\\\\ can induce CD4(+) cells to develop potent contact\\\\dependent, cytokine\\\\independent regulatory activity. At present, there is considerable confusion concerning the mechanism of action of CD4(+) CD25(+) cells because cytokine\\\\producing regulatory T cells generated in the periphery can express CD25 and other markers displayed by naturally occurring, thymus\\\\derived regulatory T cells. We, therefore, propose a nomenclature that identifies thymus\\\\derived and peripheral regulatory cells, and that also differentiates T regulatory cells from T helper cells. Because T regulatory cells broadly control T helper cell reactivity, the mechanisms that control regulatory cell function are also reviewed. Finally, the potential use of regulatory T cells generated ex vivo as an adoptive immunotherapy for certain autoimmune diseases, to prevent organ graft rejection, or to prevent pathologic host responses to infectious agents is discussed.","output":"The role of the combination of IL\\\\2 and TGF\\\\ or IL\\\\10 in the generation and function of CD4(+) CD25(+) and CD8(+)regulatory T cell subsets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the increasing use of artificial insemination techniques, little importance has been given to seminal plasma, since it is substituted by other diluters.

Little is known about the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The participants in the CREDENCE study had type 2 diabetes mellitus, a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >300-5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 30 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at screening. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at randomization. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS Effects of eGFR slope through week 130 were analyzed using a piecewise, linear, mixed-effects model. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population, on the basis of Cox proportional hazard models, and safety was analyzed in the on-treatment population. At randomization (an average of 29 days after screening), 174 of 4401 (4%) participants had an eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (mean [SD] eGFR, 26 [3] ml/min per 1.73 m2). RESULTS From weeks 3 to 130, there was a 66% difference in the mean rate of eGFR decline with canagliflozin versus placebo (mean slopes, -1.30 versus -3.83 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; difference, -2.54 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 4.17). Effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes were consistent for those with eGFR <30 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (all P interaction >0.20). The estimate for kidney failure in participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.27) was similar to those with eGFR 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P interaction=0.80). There was no imbalance in the rate of kidney-related adverse events or AKI associated with canagliflozin between participants with eGFR <30 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (all P interaction >0.12).

As one of the European countries experiencing one of the worst COVID-19 epidemics, the UK government at the end of March 2020 implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. While the lockdown has been maintained for seven weeks in UK, the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing the transmission of the disease remains incompletely understood. Here we applied a Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. We found that the basic reproduction number (R0) in England is relatively high compared with China. Our estimation of the net reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forceful lockdown, were effective to reduce the transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, our forecasting highlights the possibility of a second wave of the disease in several regions, which may be currently underway in one of the cities there (e.g. Leicester, East Midlands).

In this article, we go beyond bibliometric data by using a range of machine learning techniques to find patterns predictive of citation count using both article content and available metadata. As the input collection, we use the CORD-19 corpus containing research articlesmostly from biology and medicineapplicable to the COVID-19 crisis. Our study employs a combination of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for text understanding, including embeddings-based language model BERT, several systems for detection and semantic expansion of entities: ConceptNet, Pubtator and ScispaCy. To interpret the resulting models, we use several explanation algorithms: random forest feature importance, LIME, and Shapley values. We compare the performance and comprehensibility of models obtained by black-box machine learning algorithms (neural networks and random forests) with models built with rule learning (CORELS, CBA), which are intrinsically explainable. Multiple rules were discovered, which referred to biomedical entities of potential interest. Of the rules with the highest lift measure, several rules pointed to dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4), a known MERS-CoV receptor and a critical determinant of camel to human transmission of the camel coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Some other interesting patterns related to the type of animal investigated were found. Articles referring to bats and camels tend to draw citations, while articles referring to most other animal species related to coronavirus are lowly cited. Bat coronavirus is the only other virus from a non-human species in the betaB clade along with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. MERS-CoV is in a sister betaC clade, also close to human SARS coronaviruses. Thus both species linked to high citation counts harbor coronaviruses which are more phylogenetically similar to human SARS viruses. On the other hand, feline (FIPV, FCOV) and canine coronaviruses (CCOV) are in the alpha coronavirus clade and more distant from the betaB clade with human SARS viruses. Other results include detection of apparent citation bias favouring authors with western sounding names. Equal performance of TF-IDF weights and binary word incidence matrix was observed, with the latter resulting in better interpretability. The best predictive performance was obtained with a black-box methodneural network. The rule-based models led to most insights, especially when coupled with text representation using semantic entity detection methods.

While many U.S. universities replaced their traditional nine-day spring 2021 break with multiple breaks of shorter duration, the effects these schedules have on reducing COVID-19 incidence remains unclear. The main objective of this study is to quantify the impact of alternative break schedules on cumulative COVID-19 incidence on university campuses. Using student mobility data and Monte Carlo simulations of returning infectious student size, we developed a compartmental susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered (SEIAR) model to simulate transmission dynamics among university students. As a case study, four alternative spring break schedules were derived from a sample of universities and evaluated. Across alternative multi-break schedules, the median percent reduction of total semester COVID-19 incidence, relative to a traditional nine-day break, ranged from 2 to 4% (for 2% travel destination prevalence) and 8C16% (for 10% travel destination prevalence). The maximum percent reduction from an alternate break schedule was estimated to be 37.6%. Simulation results show that adjusting academic calendars to limit student travel can reduce disease burden.

We compared the 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 seasons evaluating the plasma volume, hematological parameters, iron/ferritin, creatine kinase, vitamin D, cortisol, testosterone, and physiological state of players of the Italian football major league (Serie A). Measurements were performed before the preparatory period (T0), at the beginning (T1) and in the middle (T2) of the championship, and in March (T3) and at the end of season (T4). The results showed that in the 2019/2020 season affected by the lockdown, the weight, BMI, and fat mass percentage were higher than in the previous season. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cells, and ferritin decreased during both seasons, more significantly than in the regular season. During both seasons, creatine kinase increased from T2 whilst iron concentrations decreased in T3. Testosterone increased in both seasons from T0 to T3 and returned to initial levels at T4; cortisol increased in T2 and T3 during the 2018/2019 season but not during the COVID-19 season. Physical performance tests revealed differences associated with lockdown. Thus, although from a medical point of view, none of the evaluated changes between the two seasons were clinically relevant, training at home during lockdown did not allow the players to maintain the jumping power levels typical of a competitive period.","output":"Biological, Psychological, and Physical Performance Variations in Football Players during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: The emergence of COVID-19 caused a new public health crisis, leading to major changes in daily life routines, often including physical activity (PA) levels. The main goal of this study was to analyze the differences in self-reported physical activity of people with complete spinal cord injuries between the time prior to the COVID-19 lockdown and the lockdown period itself. METHODS: A sample of 20 participants with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries completed the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: The results showed differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown measurements in total self-reported PA (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.28), recreational PA (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.18) and occupational PA (z=-2.03; P=0.042; d=0.55). Nevertheless, no differences were found in housework PA between the two time periods. Furthermore, the results showed differences in total minutes (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.75), minutes spent on recreational activities (z=-3.82; P<0.001; d=1.56) and minutes spent on occupational activities (z=-2.032; P=0.042; d=0.55) of moderate/vigorous intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with thoracic spinal cord injuries who were full-time manual wheelchair users displayed lower levels of PA during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The results suggest that the prohibition and restrictions on carrying out recreational and/or occupational activities are the main reasons for this inactivity. Physical activity promotion strategies should be implemented within this population to lessen the effects of this physical inactivity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on the self-reported physical activity of people with complete thoracic spinal cord injury full-time manual wheelchair users"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ECIR 2020 https://ecir2020.org/ was one of the many conferences affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 triggers de novo type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) linked to age-associated cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers, and neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 induces inflammation, possibly through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signaling and cytokine storm, causing insulin resistance and the adiponectin (APN) paradox, a phenomenon linking metabolic dysfunction to chronic disease. Accordingly, preventing the APN paradox by suppressing APN-related inflammatory signaling might prove beneficial.

The majority of the sample (71%) suffered from somatization and 55% of distress. Female care workers experienced higher levels of anxiety (d = 0.50) and somatization symptoms (d = 0.82) and stated they needed psychological care more than men (p < .001). Younger participants (aged <40 years-old) reported higher levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms (effects size range from d = 0.22 to d = 0.31). Working in a high infected area (red-zones) and directly with COVID-19 patients (front-line) affected the psychological health of participants to a smaller degree. Health-care workers who lost one of their patients reported higher levels of depression (d = 0.22), anxiety (d = 0.19), post-traumatic symptoms (d = 0.30), and psychological care needs than those who did not have the same experience (p < .01). Health-care workers who perceived the need for psychological support scored above the clinical alarming level (cut-off scores) in all the psychological scales, ranging from 76% to 88%. Psychological distress (p < .01), anxiety (p < .05), depression (p < .05), and being women (p < .01) contribute to explain the need for psychological care and accounted for 32% of the variance in this sample.

End-stage lung disease from COVID-19 is a new and growing entity that may benefit from lung transplant, however there is limited data on the patient selection, perioperative management and expected outcomes of transplantation for this indication. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed with searches of MEDLINE and Web of Science databases as well the gray literature. All manuscripts, editorials, commentaries and gray literature reports of lung transplantation for COVID related respiratory failure were included. A case from the University of Virginia is described and included in the review. RESULTS A total of 27 studies were included; 11 manuscripts, 5 commentaries, and 11 gray literature reports. The total number of transplantations for COVID related lung disease was 21. The mean age was 55  12 years, 16 (76%) were male, and the acuity was high with 85% on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation preoperatively. There was a 95% early survival rate, with one additional late death. There is growing histopathologic evidence for permanent structural damage with no replicating virus at the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral lung transplantation is an effective treatment option with reasonable short-term outcomes for patients suffering from end-stage lung failure secondary to COVID-19. However, specific considerations in this new population require a multidisciplinary approach. As we move into the second wave of the COVID-19 global pandemic, lung transplantation will likely have a growing role in management of these complex patients.","output":"Lung Transplantation for Severe Post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 Respiratory Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim and Background TJ-100 is a traditional Japanese medicine that affects inflammation and gastrointestinal motility, and is used as a preventive and treatment for paralytic ileus.

Methods This was a subsidiary study of the clinical trial investigating the effect of TJ-100 on postoperative bowel function. Ascites was collected from 180 patients using an abdominal drainage tube on postoperative day 1 and 3 after PD (POD 1 or POD 3) and used to measure 27 cytokines. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses using several perioperative variables and administration of TJ-100/placebo to determine the effect of TJ-100 on the levels of IFN- and IL-9.

However, the biological mechanisms behind these conditions remain unexplored. Herein, we report on changes of the immune transcriptome in autoptic thyroid tissues of people who have died from COVID-19. METHODS: Twenty-five autoptic thyroid specimens of subjects dying from COVID-19 were investigated. Eleven autoptic thyroid specimens of subjects dying from causes other than infectious conditions served as controls. RNA transcripts of 770 immune-related genes together with RNA genomes of multiple coronavirus types were measured by the nCounter system. RT-PCR for two SARS-CoV-2 genes was used to assess virus positivity. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome and antigens were detected in nine out of 25 (36%) thyroid specimens from the COVID-19 cohort. Virus-negative thyroid tissues from COVID-19 subject did not show changes of gene transcription nor significant numbers of infiltrating immune cells. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2-positive thyroid specimens showed marked up-regulation of immune genes, especially those proper of the type I and type II interferon (IFN) pathways. In infected tissues, infiltrates of innate immune cells (macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: The thyroid gland can be directly infected by the SARS-CoV-2.

The hypothalamus is a complex structure that is composed of many nuclei and diverse neuronal cell groups. It is characterized by intricate intrahypothalamic circuits that orchestrate a finely tuned communication within the CNS and with the PNS. Hypothalamic circuits are critical for maintaining homeostatic challenges including immune responses to viral infections.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Beni, Butembo and Katwa health zones, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). PARTICIPANTS: 223 adult Ebola survivors, 102 sexual partners and 74 comparison respondents. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, substance use, suicidal ideation and attempts, stigma, condom use and sexual behaviour. RESULTS: Most respondents reported to be married, Christian, from the Nande ethnic group, and farmers/herders. Survivors met symptom criteria for depression at higher rates than partners (23.5% (95% CI 18.0 to 29.1) vs 5.7 (1.2 to 10.1); p<0.001). PTSD symptom criteria for survivors (24.1%, 95% CI 18.5% to 29.7%) and partners (16.7%, 95% CI 9.4% to 23.9%) were four times greater than the comparison participants (6.0%, 95% CI 0.6% to 11.4%). Two times as many survivors as partners reported that sexual activity precautions were discussed at discharge (71.5% (95% CI 65.6 to 77.5) vs 36.2% (95% CI 26.9 to 45.5); p<0.001). The majority of survivors (95.0 (95% CI 85.1% to 98.5%) and partners 98.5% (95% CI 89.6% to 99.8%; p=0.26) participated in risky sexual behaviour after the survivor left the Ebola treatment centre.

This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony.

Crude and age-adjusted incidence rates and relative survival for years of diagnosis 2000-2007 and with trends during 1995-2007 were calculated overall, by age and by country. RESULTS The crude annual incidence rate was 0.28 per 100,000 and age-adjusted incidence was 0.23 per 100,000; incidence increased with age, from 0.18/100,000 at age 0-44 to 0.25/100,000 at age 45-64 and 0.69/100,000 at age 65 and over. Age-adjusted incidence in males was more than four times that in females. Portugal, which had the highest incidence of AIDS in Europe, had by far the highest incidence of KS at age 0-44, 1.44/100,000, more than four times the rate in any other country. Incidence among males in Europe aged 0-44 fell significantly between 1995-1998 and 1999-2002, followed by a significant increase in 2003-2007. Younger patients, with predominantly AIDS-related KS, formerly had a worse prognosis, but since 1999-2001 5-year relative survival increased for patients aged under 65, and by 2005-2007 was 83-86 % for all three age groups 0-44, 45-64, and 65 and over.

Risk mitigation was generally limited in scope, localized, and again determined by cultural logic that may not necessarily have been aware of more than symptoms, rather than actual causes.

In this context, the population is concerned about the potential health risks associated with the Radio Frequency (RF) emissions from 5G equipment, with several communities actively working toward stopping the 5G deployment. To face these concerns, in this work, we analyze the health risks associated with 5G exposure by adopting a new and comprehensive viewpoint, based on the communications engineering perspective. By exploiting our background, we analyze the alleged health effects of 5G exposure and critically review the latest works that are often referenced to support the health concerns from 5G. We then precisely examine the up-to-date metrics, regulations, and assessment of compliance procedures for 5G exposure, by evaluating the latest guidelines from IEEE, ICNIRP, ITU, IEC, and FCC, as well as the national regulations in more than 220 countries. We also thoroughly analyze the main health risks that are frequently associated with specific 5G features (e.g., MIMO, beamforming, cell densification, adoption of millimeter waves, and connection of millions of devices). Finally, we examine the risk mitigation techniques based on communications engineering that can be implemented to reduce the exposure from 5G gNB and UE. Overall, we argue that the widely perceived health risks that are attributed to 5G are not supported by scientific evidence from communications engineering. In addition, we explain how the solutions to minimize the health risks from 5G are already mature and ready to be implemented. Finally, future works, e.g., aimed at evaluating long-term impacts of 5G exposure, as well as innovative solutions to further reduce the RF emissions, are suggested.","output":"Health Risks Associated with 5G Exposure: A View from the Communications Engineering Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a pediatric life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 who presented as myocarditis with heart failure.

We performed a follow-up study analyzing chest computed tomography (CT) findings of COVID-19 patients at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. Methods: Between February 2020 and May 2020, a total of 273 patients with COVID-19 at the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital were recruited and followed for 6 months after discharge. Chest CT scanning was performed with the patient in the supine position at end-inspiration. A total of 957 chest CT scans was obtained at different timepoints. A semi-quantitative score was used to assess the degree of lung involvement. Results: Most chest CT scans showed bilateral lung involvement with peripheral location at 3 and 6 months follow-up. The most common CT findings were ground-glass opacity and parenchymal band, which were found in 136 (55.3%) and 94 (38.2%) of the 246 patients at 3 months follow-up, and 82 (48.2%) and 76 (44.7%) of 170 patients at 6 months follow-up, respectively.

The extent to which this change in health news consumption practice impacts health knowledge is not known. This study investigates the relationship between most trusted information source and COVID-19 knowledge. METHODS A cross-sectional online survey was sent to a convenience sample from a list of adults on a central Pennsylvania health system's marketing database 25-31 March 2020. Respondents were grouped by their trusted news sources and comparison of respondent COVID-19 knowledge was made between these groups for 5948 respondents. RESULTS Those who selected government health websites as their most trusted source were more likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who selected other internet news sources or television news (OR 1.21, p < .05; 1.08, p > .05; and 0.87, p < .05, respectively).

We used the model, calibrated until January 25, 2021, to simulate the impact of a full national lockdown (FNL) with schools closed until April 19, 2021 versus four different partial national lockdown (PNL) scenarios with different elements of schooling open: 1) staggered PNL with primary schools and exam-entry years (years 11 and 13) returning on March 8, 2021 and the rest of the schools years on March 15, 2020; 2) full-return PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021; 3) primary-only PNL with primary schools and exam critical years (Y11 and Y13) going back only on March 8, 2021 with the rest of the secondary schools back on April 19, 2021 and 4) part-Rota PNL with both primary and secondary schools returning on March 8, 2021 with primary schools remaining open continuously but secondary schools on a two-weekly rota-system with years alternating between a fortnight of face-to-face and remote learning until April 19, 2021. Across all scenarios, we projected the number of new daily cases, cumulative deaths and effective reproduction number R until April 30, 2020. Results Our calibration across different scenarios is consistent with the new variant B.1.1.7 being around 60% more transmissible. Strict social distancing measures, i.e. national lockdowns, are required to contain the spread of the virus and control the hospitalisations and deaths during January and February 2021. The national lockdown will reduce the number of cases by early March levels similar to those seen in October with R also falling and remaining below 1 during the lockdown. Infections start to increase when schools open but if other parts of society remain closed this resurgence is not sufficient to bring R above 1. Reopening primary schools and exam critical years only or having primary schools open continuously with secondary schools on rotas will lead to lower increases in cases and R than if all schools open. Under the current vaccination assumptions and across the set of scenarios considered, R would increase above 1 if society reopens simultaneously, simulated here from April 19, 2021. Findings Our findings suggest that stringent measures are necessary to mitigate the increase in cases and bring R below 1 over January and February 2021. It is plausible that a PNL with schools partially open from March 8, 2021 and the rest of the society remaining closed until April 19, 2021 may keep R below 1, with some increase evident in infections compared to continual FNL until April 19, 2021. Reopening society in mid-April, with the vaccination strategy we model, could push R above 1 and induce a surge in infections, but the effect of vaccination may be able to control this in future depending on the transmission blocking properties of the vaccines.","output":"Modelling the impact of reopening schools in early 2021 in the presence of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant and with roll-out of vaccination against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe a robot-assisted intracorporeal pyramid neobladder reconstruction technique and report operative and perioperative metrics, postoperative upper tract imaging, neobladder functional outcomes, and oncological outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 20 patients (19 male and one female) with a mean (sd; range) age of 57.2 (12.4; 31.0-78.2) years underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). Most cases were pT1 (17 patients) and the remaining three patients had muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) at RARC histopathology. Although half of the patients (10) actually had MIBC at transurethral resection histopathology. All patients underwent RARC, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and intracorporeal neobladder formation using a pyramid detubularised folding pouch configuration. RESULTS The median estimated blood loss was 250 mL and operating time was 5.5 h. The mean (sd) number of lymph nodes removed was 16.5 (7.8) and median hospital stay was 10 days. Early postoperative complications included urinary tract infection (UTI) (four patients), ileus (four), diarrhoea and vomiting (three), postoperative collection (two), and blocked stent (one). Late postoperative complications included UTI (seven patients), neobladder stone (two), voiding Hem-o-Loc (two), neobladder leak (two), diarrhoea and vomiting (one), uretero-ileal stricture (one), vitamin B12 deficiency (one), and port-site hernia (one). There was no evidence of hydronephrosis in 18 patients with a median follow-up of 21.5 months. At 24 months, recurrence-free survival was 86% and overall survival was 100%. In all, 19 patients and 13 patients reported 6-month day time and night time continence, respectively.

Previously, the 3D structure of TcaR in its apo form and its complex structure with several antibiotics have been analyzed. However, the detailed mechanism of multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) family proteins such as TcaR is unclear and only restricted on the binding ability of double-strand DNA (dsDNA). Here we show by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), electron microscopy (EM), circular dichroism (CD), and Biacore analysis that TcaR can interact strongly with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), thereby identifying a new role in MarR family proteins. Moreover, we show that TcaR preferentially binds 33-mer ssDNA over double-stranded DNA and inhibits viral ssDNA replication. In contrast, such ssDNA binding properties were not observed for other MarR family protein and TetR family protein, suggesting that the results from our studies are not an artifact due to simple charge interactions between TcaR and ssDNA. Overall, these results suggest a novel role for TcaR in regulation of DNA replication. We anticipate that the results of this work will extend our understanding of MarR family protein and broaden the development of new therapeutic strategies for Staphylococci.","output":"Functional Studies of ssDNA Binding Ability of MarR Family Protein TcaR from Staphylococcus epidermidis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the mettle of political, healthcare and public health leaders over the past year.

Consequently, scientific strategies to combat coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) were targeted to arrest SARS-CoV-2 invasion by blocking ACE2. While blocking ACE2 appears a beneficial approach to treat COVID-19, clinical concerns have been raised primarily due to the various intrinsic roles of ACE2 in neurological functions. Selective reports indicate that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) upregulate ACE2 levels. ACE2 metabolizes angiotensin II and several peptides, including apelin-13, neurotensin, kinetensin, dynorphin, [des-Arg9] bradykinin, and [Lys-des-Arg9]-bradykinin, which may elicit neuroprotective effects. Since ARBs and ACEIs upregulate ACE2, it may be hypothesized that patients with hypertension receiving ARBs and ACEIs may have higher expression of ACE2 and thus be at a greater risk of severe disease from the SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, recent clinical reports indicate the beneficial role of ARBs/ACEIs in reducing COVID-19 severity. Together, this warrants a further study of the effects of ACE2 blockades in hypertensive patients medicated with ARBs/ACEIs, and their consequential impact on neuronal health. However, the associations between their blockade and any neuroinflammation also warrant further research. OBJECTIVE: This review collates mechanistic insights into the dichotomous roles of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 invasion and neurometabolic functions and the possible impact of ACE2 blockade on neuroinflammation.

Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The urokinase receptor system is a key regulator of the intersection between inflammation, immunity, and coagulation, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been identified as an immunologic risk factor for AKI. Whether suPAR is associated with COVID-19-related AKI is unknown. METHODS: In a multinational observational study of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we measured suPAR levels in plasma samples from 352 adult patients that had been collected within 48 hours of admission. We examined the association between suPAR levels and incident in-hospital AKI. RESULTS: Of the 352 patients (57.4% were male, 13.9% were black, and mean age was 61 years), 91 (25.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, of whom 25 (27.4%) required dialysis. The median suPAR level was 5.61 ng/ml. AKI incidence rose with increasing suPAR tertiles, from a 6.0% incidence in patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml (first tertile) to a 45.8% incidence of AKI in patients with suPAR levels >6.86 ng/ml (third tertile). None of the patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml required dialysis during their hospitalization. In multivariable analysis, the highest suPAR tertile was associated with a 9.15-fold increase in the odds of AKI (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.64 to 22.93) and a 22.86-fold increase in the odds of requiring dialysis (95% CI, 2.77 to 188.75). The association was independent of inflammatory markers and persisted across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Admission suPAR levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are predictive of in-hospital AKI and the need for dialysis.

Cross-sectional studies already evidence deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was not paralleled by daytime mental complaints predicting relatively poorer sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement.","output":"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An epidemiological model for COVID-19 developed earlier was extended to determine the effects of behavioral changes, immunity loss, and vaccination on second and subsequent wave dynamics of the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among ordinary citizens. In addition to demographic and vaccine-related information, a five-point Likert scale was used to measure vaccine-related misinformation beliefs and how to counter them. Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationship between demographic variables and vaccine acceptance. A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify vaccine hesitancy by different demographic groups. Nonparametric MannCWhitney and KruskalCWallis tests were performed to determine the significance of difference between demographic groups in terms of their vaccine-related misinformation beliefs. Finally, the total misinformation score was computed to examine the correlation between vaccine hesitancy and the total score. Findings: This study found that nearly half of the respondents were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine, whereas more than one third of the participants were unsure about taking the vaccine. Demographic variables (e.g., gender, age and education) were found to be significantly related to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The results of binary logistic regression analysis showed that respondents who were below 40 years of age, females and those who had lower education attainments had significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy. There were significant differences in participants vaccine-related misinformation beliefs based on their demographic characteristics, particularly in the case of educational accomplishments. A highly significant negative correlation was found between total misinformation score and vaccine acceptance. Research limitations/implications: The survey was conducted online, and therefore, it automatically precluded non-internet users from completing the survey. Further, the number of participants from villages was relatively low. Overall, the results may not be representative of the entire population in Bangladesh. Practical implications: The findings of this paper could guide government agencies and policymakers in devising appropriate strategies to counter COVID-related misinformation to reduce the level of vaccine hesitancy in Bangladesh.

A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated towards modification by MG C residues with predicted or expected low pKa by neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1638 pregnant women from three local cities in China underwent online survey on sleep quality, somatization, and PTSD symptoms tested by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the subscale somatization of Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90-S) and the Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), respectively. RESULTS: Insomnia was positively correlated with PTSD symptoms in pregnant women (p = 1.7910(?5)). Interestingly, insomnia and somatization showed a complex non-primary linear interaction in predicting PTSD (p = 2.0010(?16)). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that insomnia is a prominent predictor of PTSD symptoms in pregnant women in the context of public emergencies. In addition, the effects of insomnia and somatization on PTSD symptoms are characterized by complex non-primary linear relationships.","output":"Interaction of Insomnia and Somatization with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Pregnant Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this era, almost all healthcare workflows are digital and rely on robust institutional networks; a ransomware attack in a healthcare system can have catastrophic patient care consequences. The usual downtime processes in an institution might not address the breadth of this disruption and timelines for recovery. This article shares our lessons learned from ransomware recovery. From this experience, a four-phase recovery planning framework has been developed. The primary focus is on acute patient care, incident communication, and emergency imaging operations in the initial phase. In the next phase, continued digital asset unavailability necessitates a transition to long-term analog workflows. In the infrastructure recovery and reconciliation phases, each taking weeks or months, the emphasis is on rebuilding a ransomware-free environment and reconciling the data accrued during extended downtime. In preparation for future events, we have initiated a continuous readiness process. A response task force has been formed to guide physicians, technologists, nurses, and informatics units on recovery workflows appropriate for extended downtime and keeping these procedures updated. Incident command structure has been discussed for communications and resource allocation during a ransomware attack, possibly in the context of a multi-incident scenario such as that involving concurrent staffing shortage amidst a pandemic.

A viral suspension in the form of a microspray aerosol was delivered by intratracheal instillation into the distal lung of 6-8-week-old Fischer 344 rats. SDAV inoculation produced a 7 % body weight loss over a 5 day period that was followed by recovery over the next 7 days. SDAV caused focal lesions in the lung, which were most severe on day 4 post-inoculation (p.i.). Immunofluorescent staining showed that four cell types supported SDAV virus replication in the lower respiratory tract, namely Clara cells, ciliated cells in the bronchial airway and alveolar type I and type II cells in the lung parenchyma. In bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) a neutrophil influx increased the population of neutrophils to 45 % compared with 6 % of the cells in control samples on day 2 after mock inoculation. Virus infection induced an increase in surfactant protein SP-D levels in BALF of infected rats on days 4 and 8 p.i. that subsided by day 12. The concentrations of chemokines MCP-1, LIX and CINC-1 in BALF increased on day 4 p.i., but returned to control levels by day 8. Intratracheal instillation of rats with SDAV coronavirus caused an acute, self-limited infection that is a useful model for studying the early events of the innate immune response to respiratory coronavirus infections in lungs of the natural virus host.","output":"Rat respiratory coronavirus infection: replication in airway and alveolar epithelial cells and the innate immune response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Automated analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data is a complementary tool for public health surveillance.

SPT may also be relevant in the context of parenting a child with chronic pain, as many of these parents report clinically elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). This study aimed to develop and validate a measure of parent SPT by adapting the SPTS-12 and evaluating its psychometric properties in a sample of parents whose children have chronic pain. In total, 170 parents (90.6% female) and children (aged 10C18 years, 71.2% female) were recruited from a tertiary chronic pain program. Parents completed the parent version of the SPTS-12 (SPTS-P) and measures of PTSS, depression, anxiety and anxiety-related constructs, and parenting behaviors. Youth completed measures of pain. Consistent with the SPTS-12, the SPTS-P demonstrated a one-factor structure that accounted for 45% of the variance, adequate to good reliability and moderate construct validity. Parent SPT was positively related to their protective and monitoring behaviors but was unrelated to youth pain intensity, unpleasantness, and interference.

Determinants of COVID-19 clinical severity are commonly assessed by transverse or longitudinal studies of the fatality counts. However, the fatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility, as more infected also lead to more deaths. Instead, we use epidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure that accounts for the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of population-averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r), is independent of the disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number), and has a direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic, medical, meteorological, and environmental factors associated with the disease severity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze different US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component Analysis, followed by univariate, and multivariate analyses based on machine learning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors. The usefulness of the introduced severity measure and the validity of the approach are confirmed by the fact that, without using prior knowledge from clinical studies, we recover the main significant predictors known to influence disease severity, in particular age, chronic diseases, and racial factors. Additionally, we identify long-term pollution exposure and population density as not widely recognized (though for the pollution previously hypothesized) significant predictors. The proposed measure is applicable for inferring severity determinants not only of COVID-19 but also of other infectious diseases, and the obtained results may aid a better understanding of the present and future epidemics. Our holistic, systematic investigation of disease severity at the human-environment intersection by epidemiological dynamical modeling and machine learning ecological regressions is aligned with the One Health approach.

As the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is widely distributed in various tissues and organs of the human body. Simultaneously, ACE2 acts as the physiological counterbalance of ACE providing homeostatic regulation of circulating angiotensin II levels. Given that some ACE2 variants are known to cause an increase in the ligand-receptor affinity, their roles in acquisition, progression and severity of COVID-19 disease have aroused widespread concerns. Therefore, we summarized the latest literature and explored how ACE2 variants and epigenetic factors influence an individuals susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease outcome in aspects of ethnicity, gender and age. Meanwhile, the possible mechanisms for these phenomena were discussed. Notably, recombinant human ACE2 and ACE2-derived peptides may have special benefits for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants and further studies are warranted to confirm their effects in later stages of the disease process. As the uncertainty regarding the severity and transmissibility of disease rises, a more in-depth understanding of the host genetics and functional characteristics of ACE2 variants will not only help explain individual clinical differences of the disease, but also contribute to providing effective measures to develop solutions and manage future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The Impact of ACE2 Polymorphisms on COVID-19 Disease: Susceptibility, Severity, and Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccine response  HM<solid Breakthrough infections  HM>solid Vaccine effectiveness  Population studies urgently needed Early #COVID19CP could be lifesaving in immunocompromised HM pts This article is protected by copyright.

The identification of the putative natural reservoir suggests that a re-emergence is possible. The functions of many coronaviral proteins have now been elucidated, resulting in many novel approaches to therapy. OBJECTIVE To review anticoronaviral therapies based on inhibition of viral entry into the host cell and to cast light on promising approaches and future developments. METHOD The published literature, in particular patent publications, is searched for relevant documents. The information is organized and critiqued. RESULTS/CONCLUSION The approaches to combating coronaviral infections are built on the foundation of antivirals against other viruses and the fundamental insights gained by dissection of the coronaviral lifecycle. These approaches include the prevention of viral entry, reviewed here, and interference with the intracellular lifecycle of the virus in the infected cell, reviewed next. Of the viral-entry inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated efficacy, clinical application in other viral infections, and the potential to impact a future epidemic. Moreover, combinations of monoclonal antibodies have been shown to have a broader spectrum of antiviral activity.","output":"Therapies for coronaviruses.

The 4.9- and 4.8-kDa proteins appear to be vestiges of an 11-kDa protein for which a single nucleotide deletion event in the central part of the gene gave rise to a stop codon. The consensus CYAAAC sequence precedes the 4.9-, 12.7-, and 9.5-kDa ORFs and predicts that transcription will start from each of these sites. Northern analyses using sequence-specific probes and oligo(dT)-selected RNA demonstrated that the predicted transcripts are made, and that these correspond to mRNAs 4, 5, and 5-1. BCV mRNA 4 appears to be a counterpart to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mRNA 4 which, in the MHV JHM strain, encodes the putative 15.2-kDa nonstructural protein. BCV mRNAs 5 and 5-1 appear to be used for the synthesis of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins, respectively, which demonstrates a pattern of expression strikingly different from that utilized by MHV. MHV makes its homologs of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins from the single mRNA 5. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the BCV 9.5-kDa protein, unlike its MHV counterpart, is poorly made from downstream initiation of translation. Thus, from a comparison between BCV and MHV we find evolutionary evidence for the importance of the CYAAAC sequence in regulating coronavirus transcription.","output":"Sequence and expression analysis of potential nonstructural proteins of 4.9, 4.8, 12.7, and 9.5 kDa encoded between the apike and membrane protein genes of the bovine coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China and has infected more than 571000 people leading to more than 26000 deaths. Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar GA rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology.

PREMs are increasingly being adopted in pediatric population, however knowledge gaps exist around understanding the use of PREMs in pediatrics. Objective: To identify and synthesize evidence on the use of PREMs in pediatric healthcare settings and their characteristics. Evidence Review: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines governed the conduct and reporting of this review. An exhaustive search strategy was applied to MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases to identify relevant peer-reviewed articles from high-income countries. Additionally, gray literature was searched to capture real-world implementation of PREMs. All the articles were screened independently by two reviewers in two steps. Data was extracted independently, synthesized, and tabulated. Findings from gray literature was synthesized and reported separately. Risk of bias for the studies identified through scientific databases was assessed independently by two reviewers using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: The initial search identified 15,457 articles. After removing duplicates, the title and abstracts of 11,543 articles were screened. Seven hundred ten articles were eligible for full-text review. Finally, 83 articles met the criteria and were included in the analyses. Of the 83 includes studies conducted in 14 countries, 48 were conducted in USA, 25 in European countries and 10 in other countries. These 83 studies reported on the use of 39 different PREMs in pediatric healthcare settings. The gray literature retrieved 10 additional PREMs. The number of items in these PREMs ranged from 7 to 89. Twenty-three PREMs were designed to be completed by proxy, 10 by either pediatric patients or family caregivers, and 6 by pediatric patients themselves. Conclusion and Relevance: This comprehensive review is the first to systematically search evidence around the use of PREMs in pediatrics. The findings of this review can guide health administrators and researchers to use appropriate PREMs to implement patient and family-centered care in pediatrics.","output":"Use of Patient-Reported Experience Measures in Pediatric Care: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Ebola outbreak that took hold in West Africa in 2014 outran the epidemic response capacity of many organizations.

At the same time, vaccination passports could be a false hope: The requirement of vaccine passports could adversely embed social and economic inequalities that reflect the power dynamics in international relations. Specifically, the ability to secure vaccines relates to the varying market and economic power across countries. This paper focuses on Taiwan as a case study to explore ways in which the use of COVID-19 certifications, if used as a precondition for international travel, would further exacerbate a binary of exclusion and inclusion as a function of geopolitics. With its relative success in containing the COVID-19 pandemic within its borders, Taiwan represents a low priority for vaccine distribution in the COVAX initiative. Furthermore, due to Taiwan's contentious political status and its exclusion from the World Health Organization regime, if vaccination passports are required as a precondition for international travel, then outbound passengers from Taiwan potentially could be subjected to restriction of movement absent wide availability of vaccines domestically. This paper argues that insofar as sustainable pandemic control requires a global concerted effort, vaccination passports could further polarise a global response. This paper suggests that equitable access to effective vaccines worldwide and governance reform of global health would help to rebuild global solidarity and mitigate the unimaginable human, social and economic suffering arising from the pandemic. ? 2021 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVES To determine the impact of continuous control of tracheal cuff pressure (P(cuff)) on microaspiration of gastric contents. METHODS Prospective randomized controlled trial performed in a single medical intensive care unit. A total of 122 patients expected to receive mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours through a tracheal tube were randomized to receive continuous control of P(cuff) using a pneumatic device (intervention group, n = 61) or routine care of P(cuff) (control group, n = 61). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was microaspiration of gastric contents as defined by the presence of pepsin at a significant level in tracheal secretions collected during the 48 hours after randomization. Secondary outcomes included incidence of VAP, tracheobronchial bacterial concentration, and tracheal ischemic lesions. The pneumatic device was efficient in controlling P(cuff). Pepsin was measured in 1,205 tracheal aspirates. Percentage of patients with abundant microaspiration (18 vs. 46%; P = 0.002; OR [95% confidence interval], 0.25 [0.11-0.59]), bacterial concentration in tracheal aspirates (mean  SD 1.6  2.4 vs. 3.1  3.7 log(10) cfu/ml, P = 0.014), and VAP rate (9.8 vs. 26.2%; P = 0.032; 0.30 [0.11-0.84]) were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the control group. However, no significant difference was found in tracheal ischemia score between the two groups.

We aimed to study the plasma glucose at the admission of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care referral hospital at Jodhpur, India and its relation with mortality. DESIGN: A hospital-based clinical study of plasma glucose of COVID-19 patients conducted from May 15 to June 30, 2020 after ethical approval. MEASUREMENTS: Random blood samples at admission were collected for plasma glucose, interleukin-6 (IL6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) after written informed consent was obtained. Plasma glucose was analyzed by the automated analyzer, IL6 by chemiluminescent immunoassay and hsCRP by immune-turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients were studied (female 39.6%); 11.1% had severe disease and 4.1% expired. There were 67 (17.4%) patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with a history of DM had three times higher mortality (6/67, 9%) than those without DM (10/309, 3.1%). Patients with moderate and severe disease according to ICMR and WHO grading had higher plasma glucose than those with asymptomatic or mild disease (P < 0.0001). Plasma glucose levels at admission were significantly higher in non-survivors when compared to those who survived (297  117 vs 131  73; P < 0.0001).

Currently, there is no effective treatment for PRRSV and PEDV, and commercial vaccines do not induce sterilizing immunity. In this study, we screened a library of 1000 compounds and identified two specific inhibitors, designated compounds 2 and 3, which target the PRRSV 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP). First, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of compounds 2 and 3 on PRRSV 3CLSP activity. Next, we determined the anti-PRRSV capacity of compounds 2 and 3 in MARC-145 cells and obtained EC(50) and CC(50) values of 57 M (CC(50) = 479.9 M) and 56.8 M (CC(50) = 482.8 M), respectively. Importantly, compounds 2 and 3 also targeted the PEDV 3C-like protease (3CL protease) and inhibited PEDV replication, showing EC(50) and CC(50) values of 100 M (CC(50) = 533.8 M) and 57.9 M (CC(50) = 522.3 M), respectively. Finally, our results indicated that the active sites (His39 in 3CLSP and His41 in 3CL protease) were conservative, and contacted compounds 2 and 3 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces in the putative substrate-binding models.

An online questionnaire was administered to 3,040 respondents between the ages of 18C30. This cross-sectional study was conducted from Apr 2 to Apr 8, 2020. While questions related to the outbreak were created by members of our neuroscience department, the Turkish version of the Abbreviated Beck Anxiety Inventory was included in our survey to measure anxiety status. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. We found that 90% of respondents report washing hands more frequently since the outbreak while %50 wear protective gloves. Respondents were more fearful of their relatives catching the coronavirus disease than they were of themselves catching it. In response to the question, What are your emotions about the coronavirus?, 38% responded with worried. There was a significant correlation between anxiety status and consumption information from the media about COVID-19. Individual early protection behaviors might slow transmission of the outbreak. Our results showed that the behavior of the participants has changed in predictable ways during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Endothelial abnormalities are caused by inflammatory stimuli interacting with intracellular messengers to remodel cytoskeletal junctions and adhesion proteins. Those phenomena are associated with sepsis, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The molecular processes beyond those responses are the main interest of our group. Unfolded protein response (UPR) is a highly conserved molecular pathway resolving protein-folding defects to counteract cellular threats. An emerging body of evidence suggests that UPR is a promising target against lung and cardiovascular disease. In the present study, we reveal that Tunicamycin (TM) (UPR inducer) protects against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury. The barrier function of the inflamed endothelium was evaluated in vitro (transendothelial and paracellular permeability); as well as in mice exposed to TM after LPS. Our study demonstrates that TM supports vascular barrier function by modulating actomyosin remodeling. Moreover, it reduces the internalization of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), enhancing endothelial integrity.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 85 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled and divided into low and high MPR group. Data from repeated measures were compared by the generalized estimating equations. Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of MPR on the incidence of severe pneumonia (SP), with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) used to reduce confounding bias. The primary outcome is the incidence of SP of COVID-19. RESULTS: During follow-up, 17 (20.0%) patients were developed to SP. Compared with mild patients, patients with SP developed showed a higher MPR level at baseline, day 1, day 2, and day 3 after admission (P = .005, P = .015, P = .009, and P = .032, respectively). Kaplan-Meier method showed a higher incidence of SP in the high MPR group than the low MPR group (log-rank test = 10.66, P = .001). After adjustment, high MPR was associated with an elevated incidence of SP (HR, 5.841, 95% CI, 1.566-21.791, P = .009). The IPTW method also suggested that MPR was a significant factor related to the incidence of SP (HR, 8.337, 95% CI, 4.045-17.182, P < .001).

This psychological impact might vary in different countries, and thus we compared the prevalence of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among young people in the United Kingdom (UK) and China at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data of this study came from two sources. One source was the first wave of COVID-19 study in Understanding Society, a special wave of the UK household longitudinal study, which provided the high-quality, national-wide representative panel data. The sample comprised 1054 young people. The other source was an online survey on the mental health of 1033 young people from Shanghai, a highly developed area in China. The questionnaire included questions on the prevalence of common mental disorders (cut-off score &#8805; 4), loneliness and potential PTSS (cut-off &#8805; 33). Univariable analyses were conducted to test the differences in the self-reported prevalence of psychological distress and loneliness between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were run to explore the predictors of psychological distress and loneliness among all the young people from England and Shanghai.. RESULTS: Among the samples with self-reported psychological distress, the UK sample accounted for 34.4% (n=1054) and the Chinese sample accounted for 14.1%(n=1033). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Additionally, 57.1% of people in the UK and 46.7% in China reported that they sometimes or often felt lonely, of which the difference is statistically significant (p < 0.001). Regression analysis of the entire samples showed that nationality, gender, psychotherapy and loneliness were significant predictors of 12-item General Health Questionnaire scores, while the variables of age and living alone were not. Significant predictors of self-reported loneliness were the nationality, gender, age, living alone and psychotherapy. In China, 123 (12.3%) young people, 49 men (11.3%) and 74 women (13.0%), met the criteria of PTSS symptoms (cut-off scores &#8805; 33). These scores were only collected in China. CONCLUSION: This evidence suggests that mental health and loneliness reported by young people were lower in China than that in the UK during the studied period. More research is needed to understand these differences. If the differential negative psychological impacts are confirmed, country-specific measures of prevention and intervention should be adopted to improve the mental health of young people under the ongoing impact of the pandemic.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people: A comparison between China and the United Kingdom"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently overwhelmed by a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Clinically, COVID-19 shows a broad range of manifestations: from asymptomatic to severe and possibly lethal interstitial pneumonia. Several studies suggested the involvement of Vitamin-D (VitD) in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections/severity. However, most of them are based on circumstantial evidences, like the association between latitude-related sunlight exposure and mortality rate, while studies based on patients' VitD measurements are still scarce. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the VitD levels (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D) from a cohort of 347 patients admitted to a northern Italian Hospital as suspected COVID-19s. Of them, 128 were positive (83 males, aged 62.7  14.2 and 45 females, aged 69.3  15.6) and 219 were negative (107 males, aged 62.8  19.5 and 112 females, aged 54.3  20.1).

Digital flat-panel detectors enhance image quality during angiography and might allow use of more dilute contrast material to decrease risk of complications that might be dose-dependent, such as CIN and NSF. OBJECTIVE To assess the maximum dilution factors for iodine- and gadolinium-based contrast agents suitable for vascular imaging with fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on digital flat-panel detectors in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed selective catheterization of the abdominal aorta, renal artery and common carotid artery on a rabbit. In each vessel we performed fluoroscopy and DSA during contrast material injection using iodinated and gadolinium contrast material at 100%, 80%, 50%, 33% and 20% dilutions. An image quality score (0 to 3) was assigned by each of eight evaluators. Intracorrelation coefficient, paired t-test, one-way repeated analysis of variance, Spearman correlation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were applied to the data. RESULTS Overall the image quality scores correlated linearly with dilution levels. For iodinated contrast material, the optimum cut-off level for DSA when a score of at least 2 is acceptable is above 33%; it is above 50% when a score of 3 is necessary. For gadolinium contrast material, the optimum cut-off for DSA images is above 50% when a score of at least 2 is acceptable and above 80% when a score of 3 is necessary.

Our objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of various types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in patients with CKD stages G4-G5 or on KRT. METHODS: In this national prospective observational cohort study we will follow patients with CKD stages G4-G5 or on KRT (n = 12,000) after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to the Dutch vaccination program. Blood will be drawn for antibody response measurements at day 28 and month 6 after completion of vaccination. Patient characteristics and outcomes will be extracted from registration data and questionnaires during 2 years of follow-up. Results will be compared with a control group of non-vaccinated patients. The level of antibody response to vaccination will be assessed in subgroups to predict protection against COVID-19 breakthrough infection. RESULTS: The primary endpoint is efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination determined as the incidence of COVID-19 after vaccination. Secondary endpoints are the antibody based immune response at 28 days after vaccination, the durability of this response at 6 months after vaccination, mortality and (serious) adverse events. CONCLUSION: This study will fulfil the lack of knowledge on efficacy and safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with CKD stages G4-G5 or on KRT.

Current knowledge about this subject: COVID-19 has devastating impact on patients with CKD stages G4-G5, on dialysis or after kidney transplantation. Effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is very important in these vulnerable patient groups. Recent studies on vaccination in these patient groups are small short-term studies with surrogate endpoints. Contribution of this study: Assessment of incidence and course of COVID-19 after various types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during a two-year follow-up period in not only patients on dialysis or kidney transplant recipients, but also in patients with CKD stages G4-G5.

We cloned the Omicron spike from a diagnostic sample which allowed us to rapidly establish an Omicron pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, sharing initial neutralization results only 13 days after the variant was first reported to the WHO, 8 days after receiving the sample. Here we show that Omicron is substantially resistant to neutralization by several monoclonal antibodies that form part of clinical cocktails. Further, we find neutralizing antibody responses in pooled reference sera sampled shortly after infection or vaccination are substantially less potent against Omicron, with neutralizing antibody titers reduced by up to 45 fold compared to those for the pandemic founder. Similarly, in a cohort of convalescent sera prior to vaccination, neutralization of Omicron was low to undetectable. However, in recent samples from two cohorts from Stockholm, Sweden, antibody responses capable of cross-neutralizing Omicron were prevalent. Sera from infected-then-vaccinated healthcare workers exhibited robust cross-neutralization of Omicron, with an average potency reduction of only 5-fold relative to the pandemic founder variant, and some donors showing no loss at all. A similar pattern was observed in randomly sampled recent blood donors, with an average 7-fold loss of potency. Both cohorts showed substantial between-donor heterogeneity in their ability to neutralize Omicron. Together, these data highlight the extensive but incomplete evasion of neutralizing antibody responses by the Omicron variant, and suggest that increasing the magnitude of neutralizing antibody responses by boosting with unmodified vaccines may suffice to raise titers to levels that are protective.","output":"Variable loss of antibody potency against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorders (OUD). The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has introduced many concerns surrounding access to opioid treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidance allowing for the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment facilities for OUD. METHODS: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics in central North Carolina in June and July 2020. Surveys collected information on demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020). RESULTS: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days' supply of take-home doses at each clinic ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19.

According to the definition of clinical classification, we divided confirmed cases into four types, and summarize epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiograph findings, treatments, and outcomes, respectively. Moreover, we used univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 788 patients were enrolled in our study, of whom 52 cases (6.6%) were mild type, 658 cases (83.5%) were common type, 61 cases (7.2%) were severe type, and 17 cases (2.2%) were critical type.

DESIGN Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING Seven institutions in Italy. PATIENTS Forty-six patents with early cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA2-IB1/IIA1) were included in the study. Nineteen patients (41.3%) underwent LESS-RH, and 27 (58.7%) underwent mLPS-RH. Pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. INTERVENTIONS In the LESS-RH group, all surgical procedures were performed through a single umbilical multichannel port. In the mLPS-RH group, the procedure was completed using a 5-mm umbilical optical trocar and 3 additional 3-mm ancillary trocars, placed suprapubically and in the left and right lower abdominal regions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There was no difference in clinicopathologic characteristics at the time of diagnosis between the LESS-RH and mLPS-RH groups. Median operative time was 270 minutes (range, 149-380 minutes) for LESS-RH, and was 180 minutes (range, 90-240 minutes) for mLPS-RH (p = .001). No further differences were detected between the 2 groups insofar as type of radical hysterectomy, number of lymph nodes removed, or perioperative outcomes. In the LESS-RH group, conversion to laparotomy was necessary in 1 patient (5.3%) because of external iliac vein injury, and in another patient, conversion to standard laparoscopy was required because of truncal obesity. In the mLPS-RH group, no conversions were observed; however, a repeat operation was performed to repair a ureteral injury. The percentage of patients discharged 1 day after surgery was significantly higher in the LESS-RH group (57.9%) compared with the mLPS-RH group (25.0%) (p = .03).

Although airway epithelial cells represent an important target for infection, the respiratory epithelium is also composed of an elaborate network of dendritic cells (DCs) that are essential sentinels of the immune system, sensing pathogens and presenting foreign antigens to T lymphocytes. In this report, we show that in vitro infection by human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) induces massive cytopathic effects in DCs, including the formation of large syncytia and cell death within only few hours. In contrast, monocytes are much more resistant to infection and cytopathic effects despite similar expression levels of CD13, the membrane receptor for HCoV-229E. While the differentiation of monocytes into DCs in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-4 requires 5 days, only 24 h are sufficient for these cytokines to sensitize monocytes to cell death and cytopathic effects when infected by HCoV-229E. Cell death induced by HCoV-229E is independent of TRAIL, FasL, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and caspase activity, indicating that viral replication is directly responsible for the observed cytopathic effects. The consequence of DC death at the early stage of HCoV-229E infection may have an impact on the early control of viral dissemination and on the establishment of long-lasting immune memory, since people can be reinfected multiple times by HCoV-229E.","output":"A human coronavirus responsible for the common cold massively kills dendritic cells but not monocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The advent of vaccination against COVID-19 brought great expectations for the control of the pandemic.

Design: Two-center observational study Setting: A university hospital and a core hospital in Yokohama, Japan Patients: Adults with COVID-19 whose serum iron levels were measured within the first 5 days of hospitalization were included. Patients who refused mechanical ventilation were excluded from the study. Measurements and Main Results: One hundred thirty-six patients were included in this study. We analyzed the association between COVID-19 severity and serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Disease severity was defined as the worst respiratory status during hospitalization. Serum iron levels were significantly lower in patients with mild respiratory failure (RF) (n=55, median serum iron level: 24 [interquartile range: 19-42] mg/dL) than in the non-RF group (n=44, 40 [24-80] mg/dL) and the severe RF group (n=37, 60 [23.5-87] mg/dL); however, there were no significant differences in iron levels between the non-RF and severe RF groups (non-RF vs. mild RF: p=0.019, non-RF vs. severe RF: p>0.999, and mild RF vs. severe RF: p=0.009). That is, there was a U-shaped association between serum iron levels and disease severity. TIBC levels decreased significantly with increasing severity; consequently, TSAT was significantly higher in patients with severe RF than in other patients. Multivariate analysis including only patients with RF adjusted for age and sex demonstrated that higher serum iron or TSAT levels were independently associated with development of severe RF. Conclusions: A U-shaped association between serum iron level and RF severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was observed. Higher serum iron levels in COVID-19 patients with RF are associated with the development of severe RF, indicating that inadequate response to lower serum iron might be an exacerbating factor for COVID-19.","output":"The U-shaped association of serum iron level with COVID-19 severity: Is iron a potential therapeutic target?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blood is a vital body fluid and can be instrumental in identifying various pathological conditions Nowadays, a lot of people are suffering from COVID-19 and every country has its own limited testing capacity Consequently, a system is required to help doctors analyze a patients blood structure including COVID-19 Therefore, in this paper, we extracted and selected blood features by proposing a new feature extraction and selection method named stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) SWLDA emphasizes on picking confined features from blood structure images and discerning its class based on reversion value such as partial F value SWLDA begins with picking an equivalence comprising the sole finest X variable and then puts in effort to add more Xs individually, providing the situations are adequate The process of adding and picking is based on F value to determine which variable would be entered Then, the picked or the default F-to-enter value is compared with the uppermost partial F value After this step, the forward addition or backward removal begins and whether the partial test values for all the predictor variables already in the line are estimated is known Then, the comparison is made between the lowermost partial test value (FL) and preselected or defaulting consequence levels such as F0 (i e , if F0 &gt; FL, the variable ZL is removed, and the F test is started again;otherwise, the regression equation is adopted) Finally, the system is trained by employing support vector machine (SVM) to label the blood images The performance of the proposed approach is assessed by employing 8 different datasets of blood structures It is assured that the proposed method has achieved significant results under different blood structure images including COVID-19","output":"An Intelligent Medical Imaging Approach for Various Blood Structure Classifications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There was a five-fold increase in COVID-19 hospitalization case counts among children and adolescents between June and October 2021. However, polls suggest that adolescent COVID-19 vaccination coverage has plateaued in the United States. METHODS: Using the Census Bureaus Household Pulse Survey, we assessed trends in COVID-19 vaccination among adolescents ages 12C17 years, parents intention to vaccinate their adolescent children, and their reasons for not intending to vaccinate their children from July to October 2021 using a large, nationally representative survey of U.S. households (n = 59,424). Trends in COVID-19 adolescent vaccination coverage, nationally and by sociodemographic characteristics, factors associated with adolescent vaccination status and parental intent to vaccinate their adolescent children, as well as changes in reasons for non-vaccination were examined using regression models. RESULTS: Receipt of 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine among adolescents ages 12C17 years increased five percentage points, from 56% (July) to 61% (October), with significant increases across most sociodemographic variables. However, there were no significant changes in parental intention to vaccinate their adolescent children during the same time period. Approximately one-quarter of parents were unsure about or reluctant to vaccinate their children, which remained consistent from July to October. Among those who had not vaccinated their children, lack of trust in the government and vaccines, and the belief that the COVID-19 vaccine is not needed or effective, was higher in October compared to July. CONCLUSIONS: Parental intention to vaccinate their children has remained relatively stable throughout the late summer and early fall of 2021. Encouraging paediatricians to discuss the importance and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, addressing concerns and misinformation, as well as recommending and offering vaccines are important for increasing parental confidence in vaccines as well as vaccination uptake among adolescents.

Barriers to implementing such prevention programs have previously been identified such as lack of resources, logistic issues or motivation. The COVID-19 pandemic associated with restrictions on daily life dramatically impacted sports participation from training to competition. It is therefore reasonable to assume that such lockdown-like context has exacerbated the challenge to implement exercise-based injury prevention programs, potentially leading to a greater musculoskeletal injury risk. In this narrative review, recommendations are proposed for building an expertise- and evidence-based Standard Operating Procedure for injury prevention in lockdown-like contexts for high-level and professional athletes. The following recommendations can be provided: (1) assess the global and sport-specific risks in the light of the ongoing cause of isolation; (2) adapt remote training materials and programs; (3) ensure regular quality communication within the staff, between athletes and the staff as well as between athletes; (4) follow the athlete's mental well-being; and (5) plan for a safe return-to-sports as well as for an ongoing monitoring of the load-recovery balance. These key domains should further be addressed to comply with local policies, which are subject to change over time in each individual country.

In the past, epidemics have been monitored by various statistical and model metrics, such as evaluation of the effective reproduction number, [Formula: see text]. However, [Formula: see text] can be difficult and time consuming to compute. This paper suggests two relatively simple data-based metrics that could be used in conjunction with [Formula: see text] estimation and provide rapid indicators of how the epidemics dynamic behaviour is progressing. The new metrics are the epidemic rate of change (RC) and a related state-dependent response rate parameter (RP), recursive estimates of which are obtained from dynamic harmonic and dynamic linear regression (DHR and DLR) algorithms. Their effectiveness is illustrated by the analysis of COVID-19 data in the UK and Italy. The paper also shows how similar methodology, combined with the refined instrumental variable method for estimating hybrid Box-Jenkins models of linear dynamic systems (RIVC), can be used to relate the daily death numbers in the Italian and UK epidemics and then provide 15-day-ahead forecasts of the UK daily death numbers. The same approach can be used to model and forecast the UK epidemic based on the daily number of COVID-19 patients in UK hospitals. Finally, the paper speculates on how the state-dependent parameter (SDP) modeling procedures may provide data-based insight into a nonlinear differential equation model for epidemics such as COVID-19.","output":"Monitoring and forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every year we see an increase in the number of patients with indications for surgical treatment of coronary artery disease.

To analyze the current literature data on comorbidity in patients hospitalized for coronary artery bypass grafting. Results. According to the literature data, there is a high Charlson comorbidity index, in average 5.7  1.7, in the baseline status of patients with coronary artery disease. High comorbidity index is known for its negative effect on the functioning of grafts in the long-term period after surgical myocardial revascularization. Among patients who underwent surgical revascularization of the myocardium, 22.8-46.9% had diabetes mellitus, 37.5% had obesity, 1.1% had rheumatoid arthritis and 10-12% suffered from chronic kidney disease. There is no statistical data on preoperative status of gastrointestinal tract, but the main complications and predictors of death were identified.

We further evaluated the development of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with RMDs. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare patients with COVID-19 (COVID-19+) with those who did not develop the disease (COVID-19-) and patients with mild/moderate disease with those exhibiting severe/critical COVID-19. COVID-19+ patients were asked to collect a blood sample for IgG testing >= 3 months after infection and results were compared with age-, sex- and sampling date-matched controls. Overall, 179 cases of COVID-19 were registered in Reuma.pt in the period of interest (median age 55 (IQR 20); 76.5% females) in a total of 6404 registered appointments. We found that patients treated with TNF inhibitors had reduced odds of infection (OR=0.16, 95%CI 0.10-0.26, p<0.001), severe disease (OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.01-0.84, p=0.010) and seroconversion rates (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.02-0.91, p=0.040).

different phases of COVID-19 pneumonia and to assess the potential role of AI in quantitative assessment of lung parenchymal involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia Materials and Methods: The present retrospective observational study which was conducted between 1st May 2020 to 13th August 2020 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) positive 2169 COVID-19 patients who underwent HRCT chest were included in the study Presence and distribution of lesions like: Ground Glass Opacity (GGO), consolidation and any specific patterns like septal thickening, reverse halo, sign, etc , were noted in the HRCT images HRCT chest findings in different phases of disease (Early: 10 days) were assessed CT Severity Score (CTSS) was calculated based on the extent of lung involvement on HRCT, which was then correlated with the clinical severity of the disease Artificial Intelligence powered \\"CT Pneumonia analysis\\" algorithm was used to quantify the extent of involvement of lungs by calculating Percentage of Opacity (PO) and Percentage of High Opacity (PHO) in lungs Tests of statistical significance, like Chi-square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Post-hoc tests were applied

rapidly spreading throughout the world, with robust growth in the United States Its drastic impact on the global population and international health care is swift, evolving, and unpredictable The effects on orthopaedic surgery departments are predominantly indirect, with widespread cessation of all nonessential orthopaedic care Although this is vital to the system-sustaining measures of isolation and resource reallocation, there is profound detriment to orthopaedic training programs METHODS: In the face of new pressures on the finite timeline on an orthopaedic residency, the Emory University School of Medicine Department of Orthopaedics has devised a 5-pronged strategy based on the following: (1) patient and provider safety, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) system sustainability, (4) adaptability, and (5) preservation of vital leadership structures RESULTS: Our 5 tenants support a 2-team system, whereby the residents are divided into cycling \\"active-duty\\" and \\"working remotely\\" factions In observation of the potential incubation period of viral symptoms, phase transitions occur every 2 weeks with strict adherence to team assignments Intrateam redundancy can accommodate potential illness to ensure a stable unit of able residents Active duty residents participate in in-person surgical encounters and virtual ambulatory encounters, whereas remotely working residents participate in daily video-conferenced faculty-lead, case-based didactics and pursue academic investigation, grant writing, and quality improvement projects To sustain this,

Therefore, identifying biomarkers using the integrative phenotype-genotype approach in severe asthma is needed. The study aims to identify novel biomarkers as genes or pathways representing the core drivers in asthma development, progression to the severe form, resistance to therapy, and tissue remodeling regardless of the sample cells or tissues examined. Comprehensive reanalysis of publicly available transcriptomic data that later was validated in vitro, and locally recruited patients were used to decipher the molecular basis of asthma. Our in-silicoanalysis revealed a total of 10 genes (GPRC5A, SFN, ABCA1, KRT8, TOP2A, SERPINE1, ANLN, MKI67, NEK2, and RRM2) related to cell cycle and proliferation to be deranged in the severe asthmatic bronchial epithelium and fibroblasts compared to their healthy counterparts. In vitro, RT qPCR results showed that (SERPINE1 and RRM2) were upregulated in severe asthmatic bronchial epithelium and fibroblasts, (SFN, ABCA1, TOP2A, SERPINE1, MKI67, and NEK2) were upregulated in asthmatic bronchial epithelium while (GPRC5A and KRT8) were upregulated only in asthmatic bronchial fibroblasts. Furthermore, MKI76, RRM2, and TOP2A were upregulated in Th2 high epithelium while GPRC5A, SFN, ABCA1 were upregulated in the blood of asthmatic patients. SFN, ABCA1 were higher, while MKI67 was lower in severe asthmatic with wheeze compared to nonasthmatics with wheezes. SERPINE1 and GPRC5A were downregulated in the blood of eosinophilic asthmatics, while RRM2 was upregulated in an acute attack of asthma. Validation of the gene expression in PBMC of locally recruited asthma patients showed that SERPINE1, GPRC5A, SFN, ABCA1, MKI67, and RRM2 were downregulated in severe uncontrolled asthma. We have identified a set of biologically crucial genes to the homeostasis of the lung and in asthma development and progression.

METHODS: This study used a quantitative cross-sectional design through an electronic survey form for the collection of required data. The 22-item Quality of Life Evaluation Scale (QOLES) was adopted as the survey instrument. A total of 283 NISs from five public universities in KSA completed the survey. RESULTS: The students' age, gender, and nursing-related experience prior to their internship were all found to be significantly associated with the overall QOLES score (p values of 0.001, 0.001, and 0.01, respectively). The NISs GPA was found to be marginally significant (p = 0.08). A significant difference was identified in the overall QOLES score based on age (p = 0.02), gender (p = 0.02), and GPA (p = <0.001).

RESULTS: The patients who regularly ate Okinawan vegetables had higher IgA, IgG, and IgM levels than those who did not. On the other hand, patients who did not consume Okinawan vegetables and had influenza had lower IgA, IgG, and IgM levels. In addition, the IgA and IgG levels showed significant positive correlations with the sIL-2R levels in both groups.

We have chosen four foci, each of which contributes to the formation of a historical and theoretical context. First, we embed representations of death within a broad horizon informed by history of religion and cultural history. Beginning with early Christianity's ascent in a cult of the dead and, later, a cult of saints, to the change from burials inside the church to graveyards, we track the coinciding weakening of representations of the afterlife in the modern era. This naturally leads to a discussion of two prior cases in which an epidemic has elicited reactions from Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Denmark: The Cholera epidemic of 1853 and the Spanish Flu in 1918-20. Then we expand our line of inquiry to a more general discussion of how major theories in the Study of Religion have modelled the relation between religion, death and suffering. Following a short introduction to how the human consciousness of death has been conceived as a major causal factor in both the emergence and maintenance of religious beliefs and institutions by major theoreticians of religion, we discuss a number of more recent psychological and sociological theories, that have informed the theoretical foundation of our investigation. In order to capture the praxis dimension of religion, we shortly discuss the particular role of ritual, before, finally presenting the 16 research questions that informed the construction of our survey. ? 2021 Aarhus Universitet.

We developed a novel technique for rapid and direct portal pressure measurements using a digital pressure wire delivered through an EUS-guided 22-gauge FNA needle. Our aims were to evaluate (1) the short-term safety and technical feasibility, (2) procedural duration and subjective workload assessment, and (3) accuracy compared with a transjugular criterion standard approach. METHODS The subjects were Yorkshire pigs, weighing 40 to 55 kg. The portal vein was identified by using a linear array echoendoscope and accessed with a commercially available 22-gauge FNA needle preloaded with a digital pressure wire. Access was confirmed by portal venography. Mean digital pressure measurements were recorded over 30 to 60 seconds, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index was scored. The control measurements were conventional transjugular catheterization with a balloon occlusion catheter to obtain free and wedged hepatic pressures, with subsequent HVPG calculation. RESULTS The total time required for EUS identification and needle access of the portal vein, venography, and digital pressure measurement was less than 5 minutes in 5 of 5 pigs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores revealed a low subjective workload. Baseline portal pressure measurements via EUS ranged from 5 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg (mean, 6.4 mm Hg). HVPG measurements were consistently 1 mm Hg of portal pressure. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first report of direct EUS-guided portal pressure measurements by using a digital pressure wire. This method is routinely performed in minutes and provides real-time pressure tracings via wireless transmission.

This complex health system strengthening programme has been implemented in South London since April 2018 and will be evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled trial with an embedded process evaluation. This protocol describes the within-trial and beyond-trial economic evaluation of CYPHP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The economic evaluation will identify, measure and value resources and health outcome impacts of CYPHP compared with enhanced usual care from a National Health Service/Personal Social Service and a broader societal perspective. The study population includes 90 000 CYP under 16 years of age in 23 clusters (groups of general practitioner (GP) practices) to assess health service use and costs, with more detailed cost-effectiveness analysis of a targeted sample of 2138 CYP with asthma, eczema or constipation (tracer conditions). For the cost-effectiveness analysis, health outcomes will be measured using the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the Child Health Utility 9 Dimensions (CHU-9D) measure. To account for changes in parental well-being, the Warwick-Edinburg Mental Well-being Scale will be integrated with QALYs in a costCbenefit analysis.

PARTICIPANTS: Staff working in the clinical area and therefore requiring full personal protective equipment (PPE). INTERVENTION: Survey of all staff members sampled from a single shift at the Nightingale Hospital. This investigated perceived utility and actual use of identification methods (name and role labels on visors and gowns, coloured role identification tapes) and formal hand signals as an adjunctive communication method.

RESULTS: Fifty valid responses were received (72% response rate), covering all clinical professional groups. Prominent name/role identifications and coloured role identification tapes were very frequently used and were perceived as being highly useful. Formal hand signals were infrequently used and not perceived as being beneficial, with respondents citing use of individual hand signals only in specific circumstances. CONCLUSION: PPE is highly depersonalizing, and interpersonal identification aids are very useful. Despite being difficult, verbal communication is not completely prohibited, which could explain the low utility of formal hand signals.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore and compare the community pharmacists' roles, practices, implemented safety measures, and psychological toll in Croatia and Serbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study employing an online survey was conducted in 2 countries over a period of 6 weeks during 2020. The survey consisted of 65 items that explored sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their workplaces, including safety measures, pharmaceutical care, and their psychology while working during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 574 pharmacists participated in the study, of which, 90% were female, with a mean age of 38 years (interquartile range 30.5-47). The study identified new pharmacists' roles that evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic: manufacturing hand sanitizers in community pharmacies, online patient counseling, and home delivery of medicines. Croatian and Serbian pharmacists exhibited disparities in their incorporated safety measures (higher for Croatia; P &#8804; 0.001) and satisfaction with work organization and counseling activities (higher for Serbia; P < 0.001). Serbian participants were less satisfied with the public perception of their role during the pandemic, and overall satisfaction was low, with a negative impact on mood and productivity.

Adenovirus is a mildly pathogenic human virus that propagates prolifically in epithelial cells, the origin of most human cancers. While virologists have revealed many details about its molecular interactions with the cell, applied scientists have developed powerful technologies to genetically modify or regulate every viral protein. In tandem, the limited success of nonreplicative adenoviral vectors in cancer gene therapy has brought the old concept of adenovirus oncolysis back into the spotlight. Major efforts have been directed toward achieving selective replication by the deletion of viral functions dispensable in tumor cells or by the regulation of viral genes with tumor-specific promoters. However, the predicted replication selectivity has not been realized because of incomplete knowledge of the complex virus-cell interactions and the leakiness of cellular promoters in the viral genome. Capsid modifications are being developed to achieve tumor targeting and enhance infectivity. Cellular and viral functions that confer greater oncolytic potency are also being elucidated. Ultimately, the interplay of the virus with the immune system will likely dictate the success of this approach as a cancer therapy.","output":"Replicative adenoviruses for cancer therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic complication during pregnancy and is associated with serious maternal and fetal complications such as pre-eclampsia and stillbirth. Further, women with GDM have approximately 10 times higher risk of diabetes later in life. Children born to mothers with GDM also face a higher risk of childhood obesity and diabetes later in life. Early prediction/diagnosis of GDM leads to early interventions such as diet and lifestyle, which could mitigate the maternal and fetal complications associated with GDM. However, no biomarkers identified to date have been proven to be effective in the prediction/diagnosis of GDM. Proteomic approaches based on mass spectrometry have been applied in various fields of biomedical research to identify novel biomarkers. Although a number of proteomic studies in GDM now exist, a lack of a comprehensive and up-to-date meta-analysis makes it difficult for researchers to interpret the data in the existing literature. Thus, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis on proteomic studies and GDM. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus from inception to January 2022. We searched Medline, Embase, CINHAL and the Cochrane Library, which were searched from inception to February 2021. We included cohort, case-control and observational studies reporting original data investigating the development of GDM compared to a control group. Two independent reviewers selected eligible studies for meta-analysis. Data collection and analyses were performed by two independent reviewers. The PROSPERO registration number is CRD42020185951. Of 120 articles retrieved, 24 studies met the eligibility criteria, comparing a total of 1779 pregnant women (904 GDM and 875 controls). A total of 262 GDM candidate biomarkers (CBs) were identified, with 49 CBs reported in at least two studies. We found 22 highly replicable CBs that were significantly different (nine CBs were upregulated and 12 CBs downregulated) between women with GDM and controls across various proteomic platforms, sample types, blood fractions and time of blood collection and continents. We performed further analyses on blood (plasma/serum) CBs in early pregnancy (first and/or early second trimester) and included studies with more than nine samples (nine studies in total). We found that 11 CBs were significantly upregulated, and 13 CBs significantly downregulated in women with GDM compared to controls. Subsequent pathway analysis using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics resources found that these CBs were most strongly linked to pathways related to complement and coagulation cascades. Our findings provide important insights and form a strong foundation for future validation studies to establish reliable biomarkers for GDM.","output":"Proteomics Studies in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency affecting the lives of millions of people globally.

EXPOSURES: US Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCidentified medical risk factors for COVID-19 complications and older age. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were perceived percentage chance of infection and hospitalization and death if infected; whether 9 potentially higher infection risk activities were undertaken in the past week and, if so, whether a mask was worn; whether a mask was worn anywhere in the past week; and attitudes toward 12 aspects of mask wearing. RESULTS: In Understanding America Study wave 18 (n = 5910 participants with nonmissing data), the mean age was 48 years, and 52% were women. The response rate was 77%. Adults with 7 of 9 medical risk factors and aged 70 years and older reported a higher perceived chance of complications if infected.

The pandemic situation is declared. This study aimed to evaluate the role of biomarkers in estimating the severity and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 116 confirmed patients were included in this study. The patients were evaluated clinically. The disease severity was assessed. The measured and calculated laboratory tests were done. The primary outcome is the 30-day mortality. Patients were assigned to the severe (14.7%) and non-severe (85.3%) groups. At IL-6 level of 32.3 pg/mL (the highest Youdens index = 0.77), IL-6 can differentiate severe from non-severe patients with 82.4% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity. IL-6 can predict the severity [odds ratio of 87.7 (95% CI = 18.9-408.2) (P < 0.0001)]. After adjustment to the significant clinical and laboratory parameters, IL-6 had an adjusted odds ratio of 30.8 (95% CI = 1.1-728.3) (P = 0.046). A high CRP/albumin ratio of > 11.4 was associated with COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio = 59.9 (95% CI = 7.4C488.3) (P < 0.0001)]. High CRP/albumin ratio had an adjusted hazard ratio of 26.5 (95% CI = 2.6-270.7) after adjustment of age and presence of co-morbidities (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: IL-6 level could effectively discriminate COVID-19 severity. CRP/albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality rate in patients with COVID-19.

Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n = 8; NL, n = 6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n = 7; NL, n = 4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value <0.01 and absolute expression >40. In addition, a fold effect >1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregnancy (407 downregulated and 295 upregulated). The interaction effect of pregnancy and lactation affected 61 genes. Genes up- and downregulated in pregnant cows were associated with several gene ontology terms, such as defense response and interferon regulatory factor, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix. The gene ontology analyses of up- and downregulated genes of lactating cows revealed terms related to immunoglobulin-like fold, immune response, COMM domain, and non-membrane-bounded organelle. Several genes upregulated by lactation, such as IGHG1, IGLL1, IGK, and TRD, were related to immune function, particularly for B cells and æ T cells. Developmental genes related to limb and neural development and glucose homeostasis (e.g., DKK1, RELN, PDK4) were downregulated by lactation, whereas an interaction was also detected for RELN.

For liver transplant candidates on the waiting list, deciding to accept a donor organ with known or potential risk factors can be stressful and can lead to declined offers. Current education for patients and family often takes place during transplant evaluations and can be overwhelming and result in low retention and poor understanding of donor quality. METHODS. In the first phase, we sought to understand provider experiences when counseling patients about donor risks and donor offers. We conducted interviews and focus groups with liver transplant providers at 1 local center and at a national clinician conference. Twenty providers participated: 15 hepatologists and 5 surgeons. The provider feedback was used to create an initial outline of content that is consistent with decision support frameworks. In a second phase, graphic design collaborators created mockups of a patient-friendly tool. We reviewed mockups with 4 transplant coordinators and 9 liver transplant candidates for feedback on clarity and utility to prepare for an organ offer. Patient responses allowed a comparison of perceived readiness to receive an offer call before and after viewing mockups. RESULTS. We identified themes relating to the offer process, repetition and timing of education, and standardization and tailoring of content. The results indicated a gap in available education after the evaluation session, and information specific to offer decisions is needed. Patient feedback emphasized the need to review the offer process before a real offer. CONCLUSIONS. Patients and providers responded favorably to a patient tool addressing existing gaps in education while waiting for a donor offer.

Although vaccine incentivisation has been cited as a motivating factor for vaccine passports, it is unclear whether vaccine passports are likely to increase inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale national survey in the UK of 17,611 adults between 9 and 27 April 2021. Bayesian multilevel regression and poststratification is used to provide unbiased national-level estimates of the impact of the introduction of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccines and identify the differential impact of passports on uptake inclination across socio-demographic groups. FINDINGS: We find that a large minority of respondents report that vaccination passports for domestic use (465%) or international travel (420%) would make them no more or less inclined to accept a COVID-19 vaccine and a sizeable minority of respondents also state that they would definitely accept a COVID-19 vaccine and that vaccine passports would make them more inclined to vaccinate (488% for domestic use and 429% for international travel). However, we find that the introduction of vaccine passports will likely lower inclination to accept a COVID-19 vaccine once baseline vaccination intent has been adjusted for. This decrease is larger if passports were required for domestic use rather than for facilitating international travel. Being male (OR 087, 076 to 099) and having degree qualifications (OR 084, 072 to 094) is associated with a decreased inclination to vaccinate if passports were required for domestic use (while accounting for baseline vaccination intent), while Christians (OR 123, 108 to 141) have an increased inclination over atheists or agnostics. Change in inclination is strongly connected to stated vaccination intent and will therefore unlikely shift attitudes among Black or Black British respondents, younger age groups, and non-English speakers. INTERPRETATION: Our findings should be interpreted in light of sub-national trends in uptake rates across the UK, as our results suggest that passports may be viewed less positively among socio-demographic groups that cluster in large urban areas. We call for further evidence on the impact of vaccine certification and the potential fallout for routine immunization programmes in both the UK and in wider global settings, especially those with low overall trust in vaccinations.","output":"The potential impact of vaccine passports on inclination to accept COVID-19 vaccinations in the United Kingdom: Evidence from a large cross-sectional survey and modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background A flow diverter (FD) has been a promising endovascular therapeutic modality for challenging intracranial aneurysms. However, stent migration has been an unusual complication. Until recently, among some types of FDs, the migration of the flow-redirection endoluminal device (FRED; MicroVention Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) has almost never been reported. Herein, we report a case of acute distal migration of a single FRED secondary to in-stent thrombi with symptomatic ischemic stroke and review the literature on the distal migration of FDs. Case Description A 35-year-old woman was diagnosed with a left unruptured internal carotid-ophthalmic artery aneurysm. A 3.5 mm diameter and 17 mm long FRED was adequately deployed. The patient awoke from general anesthesia without neurological deficits. However, shortly after the procedure, the patient presented with conjugate deviation toward the left side, right severe hemiparesis, and total aphasia. Although the symptoms gradually improved, angiography was performed. Angiography revealed some in-stent thrombi and distal migration of the FRED, and initially, one of the left M2 inferior trunk branches was occluded by an embolic thrombus. However, the thrombus spontaneously migrated distally without any specific treatment. Finally, despite leaving the migrated stent in situ, the flow almost completely improved, and the patient's neurologic deficits disappeared. Magnetic resonance imaging following treatment revealed only a small cerebral infarction in the left temporo-occipital area. Conclusion Distal migration of an FD in an acute setting, including the FRED, may occur even following appropriate placement.

The postural balance test with open and closed eyes was performed on two surfaces (hard/soft) on a force platform. Gait was recorded with cameras to analyze cycle duration and speed, step length, stride length, and foot clearance. The area of postural balance was greater in men in all tests (p < 0.001). Foot clearance height and cycle duration were lower in women (p < 0.05). Men showed a negative correlation between the area of balance and gait parameters. In women, a positive correlation was observed between foot clearance and balance with eyes closed. The postural balance and gait suggest discrepancies by sex, showing that older men behave differently according to the requirement of the motor task compared to women. These findings suggest being corroborated in more complex studies in the future.","output":"Postural Balance and Gait Parameters of Independent Older Adults: A Sex Difference Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is anticipated that effective vaccines will enable the resumption of social and economic normalcy. Current calls for masking, social distancing and other restrictive measures for the public-good are difficult to enforce and are unstainable. As ~2-4% of the 50 million SARS-CoV2-infected have succumbed to Covid-19, the US department of Health and Human Services has organized a public-private partnership called Operation Warp Speed (OWS) to develop, produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with a January 2021 target. While a majority of the 300+ Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in various stages of preclinical and early-stage clinical testing, 6 clinical candidates are supported with over 10 billion USD plus integrated resources under the OWS agenda. This unprecedented approach is investing in the manufacture of product candidates ahead of product approval. It is enabled by new gene and recombinant pharmaceutical platform technologies that are accelerating the clinical study timeline from ~10 to less than 1 year. It is anticipated that one or more of the 6 candidates under the OWS initiative will be safe, effective and provide a sustained immune response to prevent infection and disease progression.

Widespread dissemination of BEAR into clinical practice should also be informed by a multicenter RCT to demonstrate exportability and compare efficacy with bone--patellar tendonCbone (BPTB) ACL reconstruction, another clinically standard treatment. PURPOSE: To present the design and initial preparation of a multicenter RCT of BEAR versus BPTB ACL reconstruction (the BEAR: Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network [BEAR-MOON] trial). Design and analytic issues in planning the complex BEAR-MOON trial, involving the US National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the US Food and Drug Administration, the BEAR implant manufacturer, a data and safety monitoring board, and institutional review boards, can usefully inform both clinicians on the trials strengths and limitations and future investigators on planning of complex orthopaedic studies. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical trial. METHODS: We describe the distinctive clinical, methodological, and operational challenges of comparing the innovative BEAR procedure with the well-established BPTB operation, and we outline the clinical motivation, experimental setting, study design, surgical challenges, rehabilitation, outcome measures, and planned analysis of the BEAR-MOON trial. RESULTS: BEAR-MOON is a 6-center, 12-surgeon, 200-patient randomized, partially blinded, noninferiority RCT comparing BEAR with BPTB ACL reconstruction for treating first-time midsubstance ACL tears. Noninferiority of BEAR relative to BPTB will be claimed if the total score on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form and the knee arthrometer 30-lb (13.61-kg) side-to-side laxity difference are both within respective margins of 16 points for the IKDC and 2.5 mm for knee laxity. CONCLUSION: Major issues include patient selection, need for intraoperative randomization and treatment-specific postoperative physical therapy regimens (because of fundamental differences in surgical technique, initial stability construct, and healing), and choice of noninferiority margins for short-term efficacy outcomes of a novel intervention with evident short-term advantages and theoretical, but unverified, long-term benefits on other dimensions.","output":"Design Features and Rationale of the BEAR-MOON (Bridge-Enhanced ACL Restoration Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network) Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we apply the definition of one of the fractional derivatives definitions of increasing values of the variable, which is the fractional derivative of Riemann-Liouville, and the numerical-integral methods to find numerical solutions of the fractional Schr?dinger equation with the time-independent form for Van Der Walls potential type We use the dimensionless formalism of the fractional Schr?dinger equation in the space-dependent form in case of London dispersion potential in the stationary state The solutions are found for multiple values of the space-dependent fractional Schr?dinger equation parameter with a certain value of the energy We find that the numerical solutions are physically acceptable for some values of the space dependent fractional parameter of the fractional Schr?dinger equation but are not physically acceptable for others for a specific case The numerical solutions can be applied for the systems that obey London dispersion potential type, which is resulted from the polarization of the instantaneous multi-poles of two moieties, such as soft materials systems and fluids of the inert gases","output":"Numerical simulation of the space dependent fractional Schr?dinger equation for London dispersion potential type"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of international concern.

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of individuals with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19, collecting clinical data, pulmonary function tests, and plasma samples used for multiplex profiling of inflammatory, metabolic, angiogenic, and fibrotic factors. RESULTS: Sixty-one participants were enrolled across 2 academic medical centers at a median of 9 weeks (interquartile range, 6C10 weeks) after COVID-19 illness: n = 13 participants (21%) had mild COVID-19 and were not hospitalized, n = 30 participants (49%) were hospitalized but were considered noncritical, and n = 18 participants (30%) were hospitalized and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Fifty-three participants (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P < 0.05) but these values did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered participants by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), MMP-7, and HGF identified by our analysis were significantly higher in the ICU group (P < 0.05), inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P < 0.05), and were confirmed in a separate validation cohort (n = 53).

OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown in Israel between March 15, 2020, and April 30, 2020, on the incidence of home epinephrine-treated reactions. METHODS: All patients who were in the up-dosing phase of OIT for greater than or equal to 1 month during the lockdown, or a respective period in years 2015 to 2019, were studied. The incidence of home-epinephrine treated reactions during the 2020 lockdown was compared with that in the respective period in 2015 to 2019 and to periods before and after the lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 1163 OIT treatments were analyzed. Two epinephrine injections occurred during 2020 (0.7%) compared with 29 injections (3.28%) during 2015 to 2019 (P = .03). Patients treated in 2020 were older (8.1 vs 7 years, P < .01) and had a significantly lower single highest tolerated dose (12 vs 20 mg protein, P < .01). The rate of milk-OIT was lower (P = .01), but the total number of milk treatments was higher (99 vs 71 to 82) in 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019. On multivariate analysis, treatments during the 2020 lockdown were performed in older patients (P = .001), primarily for nonmilk (P = .03), began with a lower single highest tolerated dose (P = .006), and were associated with significantly less home epinephrine-treated reactions (P = .05) compared with those in 2015 to 2019. Patients treated in 2020 experienced more epinephrine-treated reactions in adjacent periods before (n = 8) and after (n = 6) the lockdown. CONCLUSION: The lower rate of home epinephrine-treated reactions during the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown in Israel suggests that potentially avoidable triggers contribute significantly to the rate of adverse reactions during OIT.","output":"Home epinephrine-treated reactions in food allergy oral immunotherapy: Lessons from the coronavirus disease 2019 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research in resilience has evolved slowly over time.

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0  106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0  106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-?3 by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-?3 production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).","output":"Clinical and immunological features of severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Autoradiographic methods can be used as an alternative to indirect immunofluorescence to detect viral antigen expression or the presence of IgG in tissue sections.

We sought to investigate whether visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is a potential predictor of ISR in diabetic patients after stent implantation. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled type 2 diabetic patients who underwent successful elective percutaneous coronary intervention and performed follow-up coronary angiography after around 12 months. The incidence of ISR and its relationship with visit-to-visit HbA1c variability, expressed as coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD) and variability independent of the mean (VIM), were studied. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to analyze the predictive value of HbA1c variability for ISR. RESULTS: From September 2014 to July 2018 in Ruijin Hospital, a total of 420 diabetic patients (688 lesions) after stent implantation were included in the final analysis. During a mean follow-up of 12.8  1.3 months, the incidence of ISR was 8.6%, which was significantly increased in patients with higher CV of HbA1c (P = 0.001). The mean diameter stenosis (DS), net luminal loss and net luminal gain were 22.9  16.8%, 0.42  0.88 mm and 1.66  0.83 mm, respectively. Greater DS was observed in subjects with higher tertiles of CV of HbA1c (P < 0.001), and this trend was more prominent in patients with optimal glycemic control (HbA1c &#8804; 7%) in the baseline. In multivariate analysis, HbA1c variability was independently associated with incidence of ISR after adjustment for traditional risk factors and mean HbA1c (HR: 3.00 [95% CI 1.14-7.92] for highest vs. lowest tertile). Inclusion of CV of HbA1c led to a better risk stratification accuracy. Assessing HbA1c variability by SD or VIM yielded similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that visit-to-visit HbA1c variability is an independent predictor of incidence of ISR in patients with type 2 diabetes after stent implantation.

Data on the disease burden of Omicron in immunocompromised patients are lacking. We investigated the clinical characteristics and outcome of a cohort of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 caused by Omicron. MethodsSolid organ transplant recipients, patients on anti-CD20 therapy, and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients on immunosuppressive therapy infected with the Omicron variant, were included. Patients were contacted regularly until symptom resolution. Clinical characteristics of consenting patients were collected through their electronic patient files. To identify possible risk factors for hospitalization, a univariate logistic analysis was performed. ResultsA total of 114 consecutive immunocompromised patients were enrolled. Eighty-nine percent had previously received three mRNA vaccinations. While only one patient died, 23 (20%) required hospital admission for a median of 11 days. A low SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody response (<300 BAU/mL) at diagnosis, higher age, being a lung transplant recipient, more comorbidities and a higher frailty were associated with hospital admission (all p<0.01). At the end of follow-up, 25% had still not fully recovered. Of the 23 hospitalized patients, 70% had a negative and 92% a low IgG (<300 BAU/mL) antibody response at admission. Sotrovimab was administered to 17 of them, of which one died. ConclusionsWhile the mortality in immunocompromised patients infected with Omicron was low, hospital admission was frequent and the duration of symptoms often prolonged. Besides vaccination, other interventions are needed to limit the morbidity from COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients. SummaryCOVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients is unknown for the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. This prospective registry, demonstrated low COVID-19-associated mortality in these vulnerable patients. However, morbidity remained substantial.

It is unclear whether better access to coronavirus testing and more consistent use of testing could substantially reduce transmission. Objective: To describe coronavirus testing in persons with new onset of febrile illness and analyze whether there are changes over time and differences by race and ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, launched in March 2020, which recruited participants via press release, word-of-mouth, and partner organizations. Participants completed daily surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and weekly surveys about coronavirus testing. All adults (aged at least 18 years) with a smartphone were eligible to join. For this analysis, US participants with new onset of febrile illness from April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Data analysis was performed from November 2020 to March 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of a coronavirus test result within 7 days of febrile illness onset. Results: Of the 2679 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (13.4) years, 1983 were female (74%), 2017 were college educated (75%), and a total of 3865 distinct new febrile illness episodes were reported (300 episodes [7.8%] from Hispanic participants, 71 episodes [1.8%] from Black participants, and 3494 episodes [90.4%] from not Black, not Hispanic participants) between April 2 and October 23, 2020. In weekly surveys delivered during the 14 days after fever onset, 12% overall (753 participants) indicated receipt of a test result. Using serial survey responses and parametric time-to-event modeling, it was estimated that by 7 days after onset of febrile illness, a total of 20.5% (95% CI, 19.1%-22.0%) had received a test result. This proportion increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.0%) early in the epidemic to 24.1% (95% CI, 21.5%-26.7%) at the end of July, but testing rates did not substantially improve since then, increasing to 25.9% (95% CI; 21.6%-30.3%) in late October at the start of the winter surge. Black participants reported receiving a test result about half as often as others (7% [7 of 103] of survey responses vs 12% [53 of 461] for Hispanic vs 13% [693 of 5516] for not Black, not Hispanic; P = .03). This association was not statistically significant in adjusted time-to-event models (hazard ratio = 0.59 vs not Black, not Hispanic participants; 95% CI, 0.26-1.34).

These articles are roughly divided into the following five subcategories: (1) epidemiology, (2) pathology and anatomy, (3) clinical presentation, (4) surgical significance, and (5) radiographic examination. CONCLUSION: The PP is non-negligible with a high prevalence. The PP compresses the V3 segment of the artery, the suboccipital nerve, and the venous plexus, consequently contributing to the incidence of neurological pathologies.

DVTISS simulates the network structure, security measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region's computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support. Based on the example emergencies, the paper also discusses key areas of vulnerability during emergency situations and their financial, data and system outage impacts. ? 2020 IEEE.","output":"Determining the impact of cybersecurity failures during and attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to explore the intrinsic laws of the spread of COVID-19 across the globe, this paper applies partial differential equation and related theories to model and carry out theoretical analysis and numerical analysis. Firstly, by adding the free diffusion term to the traditional ordinary differential SEIRS epidemic model, the corresponding partial differential epidemic model is established. Secondly, the basic reproduction number R0 is calculated by using operator theory and spectral method, and it is testified that R0 is monotonically decreasing with respect to the diffusion coefficients of the exposed and infected individuals. Furthermore, we examine the asymptotic property of the endemic equilibrium with respect to the diffusion coefficient. Finally, we take the Canadian epidemic data as an example to carry out numerical simulation and parameter sensitivity analysis by applying difference method and BP neural network, the results show that strengthening the isolation of susceptible and exposed individuals, reducing the infection rate of infected individuals will help to better control the large-scale outbreak of the epidemic. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Mathematical model establishment and simulation analysis of the spread of COVID-19 epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the results of F-FDG PET/CT in an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 infection.

It is critical to balance the benefits of alterations to current practice to reduce the chances of COVID-19 infection, with the potential long-term impact on patients. Early experiences of the pandemic from orthopaedic surgeons in China, Singapore, and Italy have provided the opportunity to take proactive and preventive measures to protect all involved in pediatric orthopaedic care. These guidelines, based on expert opinion and best available evidence, provide a framework for the management of pediatric orthopaedic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. General principles include limiting procedures to urgent cases such as traumatic injuries and deferring outpatient visits during the acute phase of the pandemic. Nonsurgical methods should be considered where possible. For patients with developmental or chronic orthopaedic conditions, it may be possible to delay treatment for 2 to 4 months without substantial detrimental long-term impact.","output":"Recommendations for the Care of Pediatric Orthopaedic Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, single cell gene expression analysis was performed to help understand the complexity of cell populations.

Woods et al (Branlat, 2010), have pointed out that it is difficult to find a satisfactory current methodology. They suggested that perhaps the Functional Resonance Analysis Methodology developed by Hollnagel (Hollnagel, 2012) could be an appropriate approach to try. In Part 1 this approach was employed to build an overall model of the UKs COVID 19 response management system, which was constructed as a framework against which, a series of more detailed analyses of specific health care responses could be examined. This meant being conscious of the bigger picture of simultaneous activities and the dynamic emergence of unexpected developments. At that stage, it was of necessity a model of work as imagined from careful official and speculative media sources. Although, a full rigorous application will require a more authenticated, official (peer reviewed?), set of data, reports and evidence statements, which doubtless will be available eventually from the inevitable Public Inquiry, it seems a pity to delay gaining and applying any insights and adaptations from work as (actually) done, that have been observed to date. The recent select committee evidence from people at the heart of the system, (Committee, 2021), which may, or may not be corroborated later, nevertheless now provides a provisional database, which can be utilised to test whether the FRAM model can produce such insights from the actual performance of this highly complex system. This paper has thus attempted a trial run and has found that it can produce a plausible set of insights, which can explain how the system behaved in practice. With such a serious challenge to Government systems worldwide, in all their advisory, operation and decision-making functions, such insights although provisional, could usefully be incorporated and formalised in the current systems rather than waiting for inquiry endorsed recommendations to be formally considered perhaps some years into the future. The paper thus sets out a set of conclusions and recommendations, caveated by emphasising the lack of fully authenticated public domain data on which it is based. The main conclusion however is that the current system appears not to have included any of the functions which could have provided the adaptability and resilience required by fast moving emergencies, such as pandemics. The exception noted was the establishment of a parallel, independent vaccine development and delivery function and it is hoped that at least this lesson from the work as done could be recognised as providing the type of adaptability required and incorporated without delay.","output":"A systems analysis of the UK COVID 19 pandemic response: Part 2 - work as imagined vs work as done"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genomic surveillance has been applied since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to track the spread of the virus, leading to the characterization of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including variants of concern (VOC). Although sequencing is the standard method, a rapid molecular test for screening and surveillance of VOC is considered for detection. Furthermore, using alternative saliva as specimen collection facilitates the implementation of a less invasive, self-collected sample. In this study, we applied a combinatory strategy of saliva collection and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 VOC detection. Saliva samples from patients attending a tertiary hospital with suspected COVID-19 were collected and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR reagent kit (PerkinElmer). Positive saliva samples were screened for SARS-CoV-2 VOC with previously described RT-PCR for Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants. Saliva samples were positive in 171 (53%) of 324 tested. A total of 108 (74%) from positive samples were also positive for VOC by RT-PCR screening. Those samples were found between January and August 2021.

The results have methodological limitations but show a tendency for countries with a lower human development index score to tweet more about cures, although they were a minor topic for all countries. Vaccines were discussed about as much as treatments until July 2020, when they generated more interest because of developments in Russia. The November 2020 Pfizer-BioNTech preliminary Phase 3 trials results generated an immediate and sustained sharp increase, however, followed by a continuing roughly linear increase in interest for vaccines until at least April 2021.

However, some serology studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in the United States prior to that, as early as December 2019. The extent of domestic COVID-19 detection prior to 2020 has not been well-characterized. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among healthcare users in the greater Seattle, Washington area from October 2019 through early April 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We tested residual samples from 766 Seattle-area adults for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies utilizing an ELISA against prefusion-stabilized Spike (S) protein. RESULTS: No antibody-positive samples were found between October 2, 2019 and March 13, 2020. Prevalence rose to 1.2% in late March and early April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples in October 2019 through mid-March, 2020, provides evidence against widespread circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare users in the Seattle area during that time.

Recent systematic estimates of the worldwide burden of GBS suggested that there are 319,000 cases of infant iGBS disease each year, and an estimated 147,000 stillbirths and young-infant deaths, with the highest burden occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. The following priority data gaps were highlighted: (1) long-term outcome data after infant iGBS, including mild disability, to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and (2) economic burden for iGBS survivors and their families. Geographic data gaps were also noted with few studies from low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), where the GBS burden is estimated to be the highest. In this paper we present the protocol for a multi-country matched cohort study designed to estimate the risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), socioemotional behaviors, and economic outcomes for children who survive invasive GBS disease in Argentina, India, Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. Children will be identified from health demographic surveillance systems, hospital records, and among participants of previous epidemiological studies. The children will be aged between 18 months to 17 years. A tablet-based custom-designed application will be used to capture data from direct assessment of the child and interviews with the main caregiver. In addition, a parallel sub-study will prospectively measure the acute costs of hospitalization due to neonatal sepsis or meningitis, irrespective of underlying etiology. In summary, these data are necessary to characterize the consequences of iGBS disease and enable the advancement of effective strategies for survivors to reach their developmental and economic potential. In particular, our study will inform the development of a full public health value proposition on maternal GBS immunization that is being coordinated by the World Health Organization.","output":"Quantifying long-term health and economic outcomes for survivors of group B Streptococcus invasive disease in infancy: protocol of a multi-country study in Argentina, India, Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After publication of our Lancet Article,1 several concerns were raised with respect to the veracity of the data and analyses conducted by Surgisphere Corporation and its founder and our co-author, Sapan Desai, in our publication We launched an independent third-party peer review of Surgisphere with the consent of Sapan Desai to evaluate the origination of the database elements, to confirm the completeness of the database, and to replicate the analyses presented in the paper Our independent peer reviewers informed us that Surgisphere would not transfer the full dataset, client contracts, and the full ISO audit report to their servers for analysis as such transfer would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements As such, our reviewers were not able to conduct an independent and private peer review and therefore notified us of their withdrawal from the peer-review process We always aspire to perform our research in accordance with the highest ethical and professional guidelines We can never forget the responsibility we have as researchers to scrupulously ensure that we rely on data sources that adhere to our high standards Based on this development, we can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources Due to this unfortunate development, the authors request that the paper be retracted We all entered this collaboration to contribute in good faith and at a time of great need during the COVID-19 pandemic We deeply apologise to you, the editors, and the journal readership for any embarrassment or inconvenience that this may have caused MRM reports personal fees from Abbott, Medtronic, Janssen, Roivant, Triple Gene, Mesoblast, Baim Institute for Clinical Research, Portola, Bayer, NupulseCV, FineHeart, and Leviticus FR has been paid for time spent as a committee member for clinical trials, advisory boards, other forms of consulting, and lectures or presentations;these payments were made directly to the University of Zurich and no personal payments were received in relation to these trials or other activities since 2018 Before 2018 FR reports grants and personal fees from SJM/Abbott, grants and personal fees from Servier, personal fees from Zoll, personal fees from Astra Zeneca, personal fees from Sanofi, grants and personal fees from Novartis, personal fees from Amgen, personal fees from BMS, personal fees from Pfizer, personal fees from Fresenius, personal fees from Vifor, personal fees from Roche, grants and personal fees from Bayer, personal fees from Cardiorentis, personal fees from Boehringer Ingelheim, other from Heartware, and grants from Mars ANP declares no competing interests Copyright ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Retraction-\\"Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis\\" (The Lancet, (S0140673620311806), (10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31180-6))"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To investigate the lens biometric parameters in congenital lens deformities, using a novel technique of swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-ASOCT).

For this cohort, 360-degree high-resolution lens images were obtained using the latest SS-ASOCT (CASIA2, Tomey Corp, Nagoya, Japan). The lens biometric parameters were calculated by the CASIA2 built-in software for anterior lens radius (ALR), posterior lens radius (PLR), anteroposterior distance (APD), anterior chamber depth (ACD), equatorial diameter (Eq Dia), rear projection length (RPL), and maximum diameter of the lesion (MDL). Results: This study included two eyes each with MSP and CL and one eye with PL. The lens of MSP was spherical and posteriorly dislocated, with decreased ALR and PLR, Eq Dia, but increased APD. In patients with CL, the coloboma was isolated, bilateral, inferior, and located toward the maldeveloped ciliary body. High astigmatism was mainly lenticular, and this was calculated by the ALR and PLR.

So far, there is no effective treatment for DR. Eriocauli Flos, a traditional Chinese herb, has been used in treating the ophthalmic diseases including DR. However, the active ingredients and molecular mechanisms of Eriocauli Flos to treat diabetic retinopathy remain elusive. METHODS Here, the systems pharmacology model was developed via constructing network approach. 8 active components which were screened by oral bioavailability (OB  30%) and drug-likeness (DL  0.18) and 154 targets were selected from Eriocauli Flos through TCMSP database. Another 3593 targets related to DR were obtained from Genecards, OMIM, TTD, and Drugbank databases. The 103 intersecting targets of DR and Eriocauli Flos were obtained by Draw Venn Diagram. In addition, protein-protein interaction network was established from STRING database and the compound-target network was constructed by Cytoscape which screened top 12 core targets with cytoNCA module. Then the overlapping targets were analyzed by GO and KEGG enrichment. Moreover, two core targets were selected to perform molecular docking simulation. Subsequently, CCK8 assay, RT-PCR and Western blotting were applied to further reveal the mechanism of new candidate active component from Eriocauli Flos in high glucose-induced HRECs. RESULTS The results showed that the overlapping targets by GO analysis were enriched in cellular response to chemical stress, response to oxidative stress, response to reactive oxygen species, reactive oxygen species metabolic process and so on. Besides, the overlapping targets principally regulated pathways such as AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, lipid atherosclerosis, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Molecular docking exhibited that VEGFA and TNF-, had good bindings to the great majority of compounds, especially the compound hispidulin. In vitro, hispidulin ameliorated high-glucose induced proliferation by down-regulating the expression of p-ERK, p-Akt, and VEGFA; meanwhile inhibited the mRNA levels of TNF-.

The tuberculosis vaccine Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) may provide heterologous protection against non-tuberculous infections, and has been proposed as a potential preventive strategy against Covid-19. METHODS: In this multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned elderly individuals (60 years or older, n=2014) to intracutaneous vaccination with BCG (n=1008) or placebo (n=1006). The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of respiratory tract infections that required medical intervention, during 12 months of follow-up. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of Covid-19, and the effect of BCG vaccination on the cellular and humoral immune responses. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of respiratory tract infection requiring medical intervention was 0.029 in the BCG-vaccinated group and 0.024 in the control group (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.26; 98.2% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 2.44). 51 and 48 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in the BCG and placebo group, respectively (SHR, 1.053; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.56). No difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events. BCG vaccination was associated with enhanced cytokines responses after influenza, and partially also after SARS-CoV-2 stimulation. In patients diagnosed with Covid-19, antibody responses after infection were significantly stronger if the volunteers had previously received BCG. CONCLUSIONS: BCG-vaccination had no effect on the incidence of respiratory tract infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, in elderly volunteers.

Since the main route of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is probably via contact with virus-containing droplets of the exhaled air, any method of securing the airway is of extremely high risk for the health care professionals involved. We evaluated the aerosol exposure to the interventional team during a tracheotomy in a semi-quantitative fashion. In addition, we present novel protective measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To visualize the air movements occurring during a tracheotomy, we used a breathing simulator filled with artificial fog. Normal breathing and coughing were simulated under surgery. The speed of aerosol propagation and particle density in the direct visual field of the surgeon were evaluated. RESULTS: Laminar air flow (LAF) in the OR reduced significantly the aerosol exposure during tracheostomy. Only 4.8aa3.4% of the aerosol was in contact with the surgeon. Without LAF, however, the aerosol density in the inspiratory area of the surgeon is ten times higher (47.9aa10.8%, pa<a0.01). Coughing through the opened trachea exposed the surgeon within 400ms with 76.0aa8.0% of the aerosol - independent of the function of the LAF. Only when a blocked tube was inserted into the airway, no aerosol leakage could be detected. DISCUSSION: Coughing and expiration during a surgical tracheotomy expose the surgical team considerably to airway aerosols. This is potentially associated with an increased risk for employees being infected by airborne transmitted pathogens. Laminar airflow in an operating room leads to a significant reduction in the aerosol exposure of the surgeon and is therefore preferable to a bedside tracheotomy in terms of infection prevention.

However, it provides limited insight into the protective nature of this immune response. Neutralizing antibodies recognizing the viral Spike are far more revealing, yet their measurement traditionally requires virus- and cell-based systems that are costly, time-consuming, poorly flexible and potentially biohazardous. Here we present a cell-free quantitative neutralization assay based on the competitive inhibition of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) viral receptor. This high-throughput method matches the performance of the gold standard live virus infectious assay, as verified with a panel of 206 seropositive donors with varying degrees of infection severity and virus-specific IgG titers, achieving 96.7% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Furthermore, it allows for the parallel assessment of neutralizing activities against multiple SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants of concern (VOC), which is otherwise unpredictable even in individuals displaying robust neutralizing antibody responses. Profiling serum samples from 59 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we found that although most had high activity against the 2019-nCoV Spike and to a lesser extent the B.1.1.7 variant, only 58% could efficiently neutralize a Spike derivative containing mutations present in the B.1.351 variant. In conclusion, we have developed an assay that has proven its clinical relevance in the large-scale evaluation of effective neutralizing antibody responses to VOC after natural infection and that can be applied to the characterization of vaccine-induced antibody responses and of the potency of human monoclonal antibodies.","output":"A multiplexed high-throughput neutralization assay reveals a lack of activity against multiple variants after SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is the most widely used evidence-based community mental health intervention for people with severe mental illness (SMI).

COVID-19 infections can cause a temperature increase typically around 0.5 C over a slow, moderate, nonlinear multi-day course averaging 5 days. To enable detection of this increase, filtering techniques are applied to simultaneously establish a base temperature and to detect a COVID-typical deviation from that base temperature. Numerical simulations are developed to assess the effectiveness of the application in detecting the presence of an infection in individuals and in groups. The measure of effectiveness is the number of new-infections incurred before the initial infection is detected. It is observed that group testing and group analysis becomes increasingly effective as the infection rate is increased, e.g. R0  3. If the infection rate is low, e.g. R0  1.1, group analysis becomes ineffective because, at any given time, too few people are infected simultaneously to be detectable in the group average. The effectiveness of individual testing and the individual analysis is unaffected by the infection rate. This result is significant since it has to be expected that widespread vaccination as well as social distancing efforts significantly reduce the infection rate making outbreaks challenging to spot. ? 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Unfortunately, the number of effective and accessible medicines for the prevention and treatment of these infections is limited. Therefore, in recent years, efforts have been intensified to develop new antiviral medicines or vaccines. In this review article, the structure and activity of the most promising antiviral cyanobacterial products are presented. The antiviral cyanometabolites are mainly active against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other enveloped viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Ebola or the influenza viruses. The majority of the metabolites are classified as lectins, monomeric or dimeric proteins with unique amino acid sequences. They all show activity at the nanomolar range but differ in carbohydrate specificity and recognize a different epitope on high mannose oligosaccharides. The cyanobacterial lectins include cyanovirin-N (CV-N), scytovirin (SVN), microvirin (MVN), Microcystis viridis lectin (MVL), and Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA). Cyanobacterial polysaccharides, peptides, and other metabolites also have potential to be used as antiviral drugs. The sulfated polysaccharide, calcium spirulan (CA-SP), inhibited infection by enveloped viruses, stimulated the immune systems response, and showed antitumor activity.

After the example of China, all the affected countries are taking hard-confinement measures to control the infection and to gain some time to reduce the significant amount of cases that arrive at the hospital. Although the measures in China reduced the percentages of new cases, this is not seen in other countries that have taken similar measures, such as Italy and Spain. After the first weeks, the worry was whether or not the healthcare system would collapse rather than its response to the patient's needs who are infected and require hospitalization. Using China as a mirror of what could happen in our countries and with the data available, we calculated a model that forecasts the peak of the curve of infection, hospitalization, and ICU bed numbers. We aimed to review the patterns of spread of the virus in the two countries and their regions, looking for similarities that reflect the existence of a typical path in this expansive virulence and the effects of the intervention of the authorities with drastic isolation measures, to contain the outbreak. A model based on Autorregressive and moving average models (ARMA) methodology and including Chinese disease pattern as a proxy, predicts the contagious pattern robustly. Based on the prediction, the hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) requirements were also calculated. Results suggest a reduction in the speed of contagion during April in both countries, earlier in Spain than in Italy. The forecast advanced a significant increase in the ICU needs for Spain surpassing 8,000 units by the end of April, but for Italy, ICU needs would decrease in the same period, according to the model. We present the following predictions to inform political leaders because they have the responsibility to maintain the national health systems away from collapsing.

A function assay that evaluates platelet reactivity and inhibition by drug therapy is beneficial for such patients. Platelet Mapping assay (PM) using the TEG analyzer was tested in surgical patients. After IRB approval, 60 patients on combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy were consented and enrolled. The TEG maximal amplitude (MA) and the percentage (%) platelet inhibition were recorded and analyzed. Fifty-seven patients (mean age 65.7  10.9 years) had preoperative data only. Distribution of preoperative ADP (43.6  24.4%) and AA inhibition (52.8  30.2%) was determined, as well as for the preoperative MA ADP (43.1  15.9 mm) and MA AA (37.2  19.6 mm), showing an offset of the effect of both medications starting from day 3. Patients with complete pre- and postoperative data were stratified depending on duration off antiplatelet therapy (3 days, 3-7 days and >7 days): n = 27, ADP % preop inhibition (43.2  21.6%), ADP % postop inhibition (32.3  18.3%), p = 0.048. Distribution of immediate pre- and post- ADP and AA % inhibitions, showing a possible reduction in  of inhibition for clopidogrel at 3 days, were also assessed. CONCLUSION According to the findings, the TEG PM assay might be a feasible approach to objectively evaluate the effects of aspirin and clopidogrel during the perioperative period and potentially guide drug management.","output":"Perioperative assessment of platelet function by Thromboelastograph Platelet Mapping in cardiovascular patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African tick bite fever, an acute febrile illness, is caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Rickettsia africae.

Students demonstrated increased comprehension of exoenzyme function and secretion, as well as how cells uptake the products of exoenzyme hydrolysis. However, students had challenges in placing the transported exoenzyme products within metabolic processes. Our results show increased perceived learning from the students as well as an understanding of the societal implications of these microbiological concepts.

METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) for iliofemoral DVT from May 2007 to March 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were categorized in two groups, depending on the status of IVC filtration during the lysis procedures: patients with an IVC filter protection (group A) and patients without an IVC filter protection (group B). The primary outcome was perioperative clinically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) or intraprocedural IVC filter clot capture. RESULTS Eighty patients (mean age, 50  16 years; 39 women) with symptoms averaging 12  10 days were treated. A perioperative IVC filter was placed in 32 patients, and nine patients had an indwelling patent filter (group A, n = 41). Twenty patients received no filter, and 19 patients had an indwelling thrombosed filter (group B, n = 39). There were no clinically significant PE in either group. In group A, nine patients (22%) had documented embolic clot within the filter nest. The clot volume was deemed clinically significant in only two patients (5%). Factors related to embolization included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 5.833; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.038-32.797; P = .032) and preoperative clinical PE (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.043-30.081; P = .054). A trend for increased embolization was seen with a higher average number of DVT risk factors (1.44 vs 1; P = .065) and when PMT was used as a single treatment (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 0.851-21.929; P = .087). CONCLUSIONS IVC filters during thrombolysis should be used selectively in patients with preoperative clinical PE, in women and potentially in patients with multiple risk factors for DVT, or when stand-alone PMT is planned.","output":"Inferior vena cava filter placement during thrombolysis for acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory droplets are the primary transmission route for SARS-CoV-2, a principle which drives social distancing guidelines. Evidence suggests that virus transmission can be reduced by face coverings, but robust evidence for how mask usage might affect safe distancing parameters is lacking. Accordingly, we set out to quantify the effects of face coverings on respiratory tract droplet deposition. We tested an anatomically realistic manikin head which ejected fluorescent droplets of water and human volunteers, in speaking and coughing conditions without a face covering, or with a surgical mask or a single-layer cotton face covering. We quantified the number of droplets in flight using laser sheet illumination and UV-light for those that had landed at table height at up to 2 m. For human volunteers, expiratory droplets were caught on a microscope slide 5 cm from the mouth. Whether manikin or human, wearing a face covering decreased the number of projected droplets by less than 1000-fold. We estimated that a person standing 2 m from someone coughing without a mask is exposed to over 10 000 times more respiratory droplets than from someone standing 0.5 m away wearing a basic single-layer mask. Our results indicate that face coverings show consistent efficacy at blocking respiratory droplets and thus provide an opportunity to moderate social distancing policies. However, the methodologies we employed mostly detect larger (non-aerosol) sized droplets. If the aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings.","output":"Face coverings and respiratory tract droplet dispersion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Early warning of disease outbreaks is paramount for health jurisdictions. The objective of this study was to develop syndromic surveillance monitoring plans from routinely collected Emergency Department data with application to detecting disease outbreaks. METHODS The study involved Secondary Data Analysis of ED presentations to major public hospitals in Queensland and South Australia spanning 2017 to 2020. Monitoring plans were developed for all major Queensland and South Australian public hospitals using an adaptation of Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages - a process control method used in detecting anomalies in industrial production processes. The methods rely on setting a threshold (control limit) relating to the time between an event of interest (e.g. flu outbreak) using ED presentations as a signal to monitor. An outbreak is flagged as this time gets significantly smaller, and each event offers a decision point on whether an outbreak has occurred. The models incorporate differing levels of temporal memory to cover outbreaks of different sizes. RESULTS The novel approach to real time outbreak detection indicates outbreaks for individual hospitals coinciding with the first-wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Queensland and South Australia as well as the large 2017 and 2019 influenza seasons. CONCLUSION Outbreak detection models demonstrate the ability to quickly flag an outbreak based on clinician-assigned ED diagnoses.

Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting. As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type. The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children. All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6. The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2.

This paper reviews the technology-oriented individual attitude based on four dimensions of the technology readiness 2.0 index factors, which affect medical students perspectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors provided a self-administered questionnaire to medical students to investigate their e-library adoption attitude during the COVID-19 crisis. The authors distributed 542 questionnaires, received 361 complete responses and analyzed the data through path modeling/partial least squares structural equations modeling technique (PLS-SEM) with the smart PLS software version 3.3.3. The structural equation-modelling tool permits the estimation of results. RESULTS: The main finding revealed that medical students have a positive and explicit approach to use the services available at the e-library. Technology use and online services helped students continue their educational needs in the advent of the current pandemic COVID-19. Attitude and subjective norms have significant influence and are strong predictors of intention.

Inadequate staff training and other implementation challenges have been identified as barriers for delivery of evidence-based tobacco treatment. Providing training in tobacco treatment tailored to the unique needs of tobacco-dependent patients with cancer is one strategy to improve adoption of best practices to promote smoking cessation in cancer care. METHODS A tobacco treatment training program for oncology care providers (tobacco treatment training-oncology [TTT-O]) consisting of a 2-day didactic and experiential workshop followed by 6 monthly, collaboratory videoconference calls supporting participants in their efforts to implement National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in their oncology settings was developed and implemented. This article presents preliminary results on program evaluation, changes in participants' self-efficacy, and progress in implementing tobacco treatment. RESULTS Data have been obtained from the first 5 cohorts of TTT-O participants (n = 110) who completed training, course evaluations, baseline and follow-up surveys. Participants rated the training as highly favorable and reported significant gains in self-efficacy in their ability to assess and treat tobacco dependence. Participants also demonstrated significant improvements in tobacco treatment skills and implementation of several indicators of improved adoption of best practices for tobacco treatment in their cancer care settings. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of tobacco treatment training for cancer care providers is feasible, acceptable, and can have a significant positive impact on participants' tobacco treatment skills, self-efficacy, and greater adoption of tobacco treatment delivery in cancer care.","output":"Training oncology care providers in the assessment and treatment of tobacco use and dependence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the changes that occurred in the surgical services of children during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of a low/middle-income country. DESIGN: A caseCcontrol study was conducted at a large referral centre in Bangladesh among patients aged 12 years. Comparisons were made between cases admitted during a period of April to September 2020 (Pandemic period) and controls during a similar period in 2019 (Reference period). The number of admissions and outpatient department (OPD) attendances, age and sex distribution, diagnosis, number and types of surgeries performed (elective vs emergency), variations in treatment of acute appendicitis, types of anaesthesia and mortality were compared. RESULTS: Admissions were only 41% of previous year (635 vs 1549), and OPD attendances were only 28% of previous year (603 vs 2152). Admission of children reduced by 65.8%, but neonatal admission reduced only by 7.6%. The median age of the admitted patients was significantly lower during the pandemic period (3 vs 4 years, p<0.01). Acute appendicitis (151, 9.8%) and trauma (61, 9.6%), respectively, were the the most common causes of admission during the reference and the pandemic period. Elective surgeries were only 17% and emergency surgeries were 64% of previous year (p<0.01). Appendectomy (88, 9.1%) and laparotomy (77, 17.6%), respectively, were the most common surgeries performed during the reference and the pandemic period. Conservative treatment of acute appendicitis was more during the pandemic period (47.5% vs 28.5%, p=0.01), but patients who underwent appendectomies had more complicated appendicitis (63.3% vs 42.1%, p=0.01). In all, 90.4% of surgeries were performed by resident doctors. There were no COVID-19- related deaths. CONCLUSION: Trauma became the most common cause of admission during the pandemic, and neonatal surgical conditions remained almost unchanged with high mortality rates. Elective procedures and laparoscopy remained low and resident doctors played a major role in providing surgical services.","output":"Changes in childrens surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic at a tertiary-level government hospital in a lower middle-income country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shocked the world, overwhelming the health systems of even high-income countries. Predictably, the situation has elicited social and medical responses from the public and governments, respectively. Nigeria recorded an imported case from Italy on February 27, 2020. Hence, this paper assesses the early socio-medical response to COVID-19 in Nigeria in the first 100 days after the index case. The paper employs analytical methods and collates data from various media reports and official sources. FINDINGS: The incidence of COVID-19 grew steadily in Nigeria, moving from an imported case and elitist pattern to community transmission. The case fatality stood at 2.8%. The country recorded an upsurge (52% of total cases) in the transmission of COVID-19 during the short period the lockdown was relaxed. This paper presents a concise response framework to highlight some specific multisectoral responses to the pandemic. A combination of social and medical responses to a large extent helped Nigeria curtail the spread of the virus.

Furthermore, the most appropriate corticosteroid and dose in the treatment of COVID-19 have remained uncertain. We conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of methylprednisolone treatment versus dexamethasone for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this prospective triple-blinded randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 86 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from August to November 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day; intervention group) or dexamethasone (6 mg/kg/day; control group). Data were assessed based on a 9-point WHO ordinal scale extending from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 8). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups on admission. However, the intervention group demonstrated significantly better clinical status compared to the control group at day 5 (4.02 vs. 5.21, p = 0.002) and day 10 (2.90 vs. 4.71, p = 0.001) of admission. There was also a significant difference in the overall mean score between the intervention group and the control group, (3.909 vs. 4.873 respectively, p = 0.004). The mean length of hospital stay was 7.43  3.64 and 10.52  5.47 days in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p = 0.015). The need for a ventilator was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (18.2% vs 38.1% p = 0.040).

We hypothesized that age-related strength reductions might relate to differential changes in corticospinal and reticulospinal connectivity. Methods: We divided 83 participants (age 20-84) into age groups <50 (n = 29) and 50 (n = 54) years; five of which had probable sarcopenia. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the left cortex, inducing motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the biceps muscles bilaterally. Contralateral (right, cMEPs) and ipsilateral (left, iMEPs) MEPs are carried by mainly corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways respectively; the iMEP/cMEP amplitude ratio (ICAR) therefore measured the relative importance of the two descending tracts. Grip strength was measured with a dynamometer and normalized for age and sex. Results: We found valid iMEPs in 74 individuals (n = 44 aged 50, n = 29 < 50). Younger adults had a significant negative correlation between normalized grip strength and ICAR (r = -0.37, p = 0.045); surprisingly, in older adults, the correlation was also significant, but positive (r = 0.43, p = 0.0037). Discussion: Older individuals who maintain or strengthen their RST are stronger than their peers. We speculate that reduced RST connectivity could predict those at risk of age-related muscle weakness; interventions that reinforce the RST could be a candidate for treatment or prevention of sarcopenia.","output":"Ipsilateral Motor Evoked Potentials as a Measure of the Reticulospinal Tract in Age-Related Strength Changes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract: The incidence of the COVID-19 virus in the rights derived from the legal guarantee, in Chilean Consumer Law At first, it is postulated that this pandemic can indeed be considered as a force majeure, but it does not extinguish the guarantee However, there are two effects: the suspension of the legal term for its exercise and the emergence of certain duties of conduct This approach is obtained from the need to safeguard the safety of consumers, as well as from the principles and rules of the statute of limitations, with special reference to Consumer Law","output":"The incidence of the Covid-19 in the legal guarantee La incidencia del Covid-19 en el ejercicio de la garanta legal/ The incidence of the Covid-19 in the legal guarantee"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human serum albumin (HSA) is the predominant product of hepatic protein synthesis and one of the more abundant plasma proteins.

By looking at these watershed moments, this paper explores, for the first time, the impact of the adoption and the removal of restrictive measures on changes in individual mobility in Italy. By using a spatial discontinuity approach, we show that these measures were effective in that they lowered individual mobility by about 7 percentage points relative to what is accounted for by the characteristics of the local population and the disease. The analysis shows, however, that local features played an important role after the travelling bans were lifted: the catching up with pre-COVID-19 patterns has been stronger in those areas where the labour force is relatively less exposed to the risk of contagion and less likely to work from home.","output":"From the Lockdown to the New Normal: An Analysis of the Limitations to Individual Mobility in Italy Following the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medically underserved patients in rural areas are more vulnerable to poor health outcomes, including the risks associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Probably one of the most ambitious examples is Brazil, with its National Health Survey (PNS-2019). We evaluated PNS-2019, presenting in an unprecedented way, one of its innovations, which refer to Starfield and Shis adult Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT). METHODS: Based on a cross-sectional study, we evaluated Module H of the PNS-2019, which interviewed a probabilistic sample of about 10,000 adults in 2019 in all 27 Brazilian states. According to the PCAT methodology, an average score equal to or above 6.6 indicates a greater orientation and quality of the evaluated primary care services. RESULTS: Brazilian overall PCAT score [5, 9] reveals the need to improve primary health care services across the country. There were no statistically significant differences in the scores by sex (men and women, 5.9), and race (whites 5.9 [5.7; 6.0] and brown / black 5.9 [5.8; 6.0]). On the other hand, there was a difference in terms of age. The elderly evaluated the services in a more positive way (score = 6.1 [6.0; 6.2]), when compared to those aged 40C59 years (5.9 [5.7; 6.0]) and 18 to 39 years (5.6 [5.5; 5.8]). First results of PNS-2019 show that the population that most needs primary care services in SUS is the one with the best perception and the most positive evaluation of the actions and procedures offered in health facilities. DISCUSSION: During 2019, Brazil undertook important structural reforms in PHC based on a new financing model with the aim of inducing an improvement in efficiency and strengthening its attributes. It is essential that countries with universal health coverage (UHC) guarantee access to their population and, especially, the most vulnerable, seek better efficiency of these services and regularly assess PHC based on the populations perception, through an independent methodology that monitor the quality of services and the strength of PHC, generating value for public resources applied to health services.","output":"Innovations in the national household random sampling in Brazilian National Health Survey: results from Starfield and Shis adult primary care assessment tool (PCAT)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) papain-like protease (PLPro) reportedly inhibits the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) pathways. The study investigated the inhibitory effect and its antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro on TLR7-mediated cytokine production. TLR7 agonist (imiquimod (IMQ)) concentration-dependently induced activation of ISRE-, NF-B- and AP-1-luciferase reporters, as well as the production of IFN-, IFN-, TNF-, IL-6 and IL-8 in human promonocyte cells.

Western blot analysis with anti-Lys48 and anti-Lys63 ubiquitin antibodies indicated the SARS-CoV PLPro removed Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6, but not Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains in un-treated and treated cells. The decrease in the activated state of TRAF3 and TRAF6 correlated with the inactivation of TBK1 in response to IMQ by PLPro.

This dramatic situation has forced the public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Currently, almost 80% of the population are vaccinated with the required number of doses in Spain. Thus, in this paper, COVID-19 incidence and lethality rates are analyzed through a segmented spatio-temporal regression model that allows studying if there is an association between a certain vaccination level and a change (in mean) in either the incidence or the lethality rates. Spatial dependency is included by considering the BesagCYorkCMolli model, whereas natural cubic splines are used for capturing the temporal structure of the data. Lagged effects between the exposure and the outcome are also taken into account. The results suggest that COVID-19 vaccination has not allowed yet (as of September 2021) to observe a consistent reduction in incidence levels at a regional scale in Spain.

Given an initial policy (i.e. statistical model) trained off-line, our method uses this policy to guide its search and gradually improves it by leveraging feedback obtained from a deductive reasoning engine. Specifically, we formulate program synthesis as a reinforcement learning problem and propose a new variant of the policy gradient algorithm that can incorporate feedback from a deduction engine into the underlying statistical model. The benefit of this approach is two-fold: First, it combines the power of deductive and statistical reasoning in a unified framework. Second, it leverages deduction not only to prune the search space but also to guide search. We have implemented the proposed approach in a tool called Concord and experimentally evaluate it on synthesis tasks studied in prior work. Our comparison against several baselines and two existing synthesis tools shows the advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, Concord solves 15% more benchmarks compared to Neo, a state-of-the-art synthesis tool, while improving synthesis time by 8.71[Formula: see text] on benchmarks that can be solved by both tools.","output":"Program Synthesis Using Deduction-Guided Reinforcement Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has imposed several restrictions on people of all groups including children Lockdown has forced the children to stay in the house with limited physical activities, minimal exposure to sunlight and nutritional challenges This unusual lifestyle may result in the increased incidence of some illnesses in children We report a case of excessive yawning in a child during the period of lock-down due to COVID-19 which responded to vitamin D supplement, multi-vitamin and mineral supplement and yoga therapy An 8 5-year-old male child presented with a chief complaint of excessive yawning which started gradually and increased significantly over 15 days We noted that after nutritional supplementation and yoga therapy, the child showed significant improvement in overall health ?

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28C49 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71C2.51). INTERPRETATION: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates.

The specific aim was to quantify SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies in a patient plasma during the course of therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Besides the standard of care treatment and monitoring, neutralizing antibody titers in patient's serum samples, calibrated according to the First WHO International Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human), were quantified in a time-dependent manner. During the immunotherapy period peripheral blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping was conducted to characterize lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS: The waves of clinical improvements and worsening coincided with transfused neutralizing antibodies rises and drops in the patient's systemic circulation, proving their contribution in controlling the disease progress. Besides the patient's lack of own humoral immune system, immunophenotyping analysis revealed also the reduced level of helper T-lymphocytes and immune exhaustion of monocytes.

To analyze this relationship, we used secondary data from public organizations on the SDG panorama by city and conducted a moderated regression analysis. The sample was composed of 649 cities with a population exceeding 50 thousand inhabitants. The results show that the higher were the indicators used to measure SDGs, the lower was the number of cases and deaths from the disease. We have also proved that cities population density and their distance from the pandemic epicenter moderate this relationship, since a higher level of these moderation variables increases the impact of a lower level of SDGs 3 and 6 coverage in society on the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19. Thus, the efficient and effective investment to reach SDGs 3 and 6 is directly associated with cities ability to successfully deal with infectious diseases and the resulting number of deaths.

To make the transition to a circular city, we must integrate the findings and develop a general definition and measurement framework. This article aims at outlining a framework for circular cities indicators based on their key characteristics, as well providing directions for fostering circularity at the city level. To accomplish this goal, we conducted a systematic review and analyzed key papers published in the field of circular economy to determine how circular cities are measured. Choosing the right indicators to use for developing, monitoring, and evaluating circular cities is a difficult task for urban policymakers, managers, and planners.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the use of two types of PPE on quality of vision during gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational pilot study in gastroenterologists who undergo an ophthalmological examination of visual acuity and quality of vision when using two types of PPE. Type #1: 3M N95 1860 green respirator + 3M mono safety glasses + protective screen. Type #2: 3M 6800 full facepiece + 3M NIOSH 7093C HF/P100 filters. RESULTS: Visual acuity and quality of vison parameters while using the PPE that is routinely used when performing gastrointestinal endoscopy during the pandemic were evaluated. It was found that Modality #1 was associated with decreases of up to 37% in visual acuity, 25% in colour visualisation and 75% in contrast sensitivity among digestive endoscopists within minutes of placement. These figures worsened over the course of the procedure, rising to 75%, 60% and 100%, respectively. Modality #2 was not associated with any deterioration in quality of vision.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively extracted and analyzed data from the TB Information System on drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed in Shenzhen during the 2012C2020 period. We analyzed trends in RR- and MDR-TB rates in new cases during 2012C2018 and 2018C2020 periods, and among previously-treated cases during 2012C2017 and 2017C2020 periods, using Cochran-Armitage tests. We generated multivariate logistic regression models to analyze demographic predictors of MDR/RR-TB rates. RESULTS: We found 21,367 positive mycobacterial cultures in Shenzhen during the 2012C2020 period, and 19,951 (93.4%) were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and had DST results (92.0% of those were mDST-based). Of these patients with DST results, 1630 (8.2%) were RR-TB, and 1142 (5.7%) were MDR-TB. Of the RR-TB, 70% were MDR-TB. The MDR/RR-TB rate in new TB cases increased significantly during the 2012C2018 period (P(trend) < 0.05), but it decreased in the 2018C2020 period (P(trend) > 0.05, with a significant trend for MDR-TB). Among previously treated cases, the temporal MDR/RR-TB rate trends did not differ significantly (P(trend) > 0.05). Our multivariate analysis showed that age younger than 30 years, housework service/unemployment, local residency, and previous TB treatment were all predictors of MDR/RR-TB. The percentage of patients with MDR-TB on treatment increased from 49.4% in 2012 to 70.5% in 2020. The treatment success rate of patients with MDR-TB during the 2012C2018 period was 71%. CONCLUSION: During the study period in Shenzhen, the cases of MDR/RR-TB were detected, and the treatment enrollment increased and the MDR-TB rates decreased gradually after 2017. Decreasing trends may reflect the efficacy of improved strategies; however, their long-term impact on the MDR-TB burden remains to be investigated.

Systemic hypertension, diabetes type 2 and previous myocardial infarction were referred in 33%, 17%, and 7%, respectively. Mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was 23466 and 11 patients presented a bilateral chest X-ray involvement. Mean shunt was 216%. Mainly in patients with a more severe respiratory failure, we found a progressive decrease of PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio with higher FiO(2).

UNICEF and partner organisations developed the Immunisation Caregiver Journey Framework as a novel way to understand caregiver experiences in accessing and receiving immunisation services for children. This framework aims to help immunisation programmes identify vaccination barriers and opportunities to improve vaccination uptake by enhancing the overall caregiver journey in a systems-focused manner, using human-centred design principles. In this paper, we adapt the framework into a flexible qualitative inquiry approach with theoretical guidance from interpretative phenomenology. We draw from the implementation experiences in Sierra Leone to inform methodological guidance on how to design and implement the Immunisation Caregiver Journey Interviews (ICJI) to understand the lived experiences of caregivers as they navigate immunisation services for their children. Practical guidance is provided on sampling techniques, conducting interviews, data management, data analysis and the use of data to inform programmatic actions. When properly implemented, the ICJI approach generates a rich qualitative understanding of how caregivers navigate household and community dynamics, as well as primary healthcare delivery systems. We argue that understanding and improving the caregiver journey will enhance essential immunisation outcomes, such as the completion of the recommended vaccination schedule, timeliness of vaccination visits and reduction in dropouts between vaccine doses.","output":"Using immunisation caregiver journey interviews to understand and optimise vaccination uptake: lessons from Sierra Leone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical presentations for viral respiratory tract infections are often nonspecific, and a rapid, high-throughput laboratory technique that can detect a panel of common viral pathogens is clinically desirable. We evaluated two multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) products coupled with microarray-based systems for simultaneous detection of common respiratory tract viral pathogens. The NGEN respiratory virus analyte-specific assay (Nanogen, San Diego, CA) detects influenza A virus (Flu-A) and Flu-B, parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV-1), PIV-2, and PIV-3, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while the ResPlex II assay (Genaco Biomedical Products, Inc., Huntsville, AL) detects Flu-A, Flu-B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, RSV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses (RhVs), enteroviruses (EnVs), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV). A total of 360 frozen respiratory specimens collected for a full year were tested, and results were compared to those obtained with a combined reference standard of cell culture and monoplex real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assays. NGEN and ResPlex II gave comparable sensitivities for Flu-A (82.8 to 86.2%), Flu-B (90.0 to 100.0%), PIV-1 (87.5 to 93.8%), PIV-3 (66.7 to 72.2%), and RSV (63.3 to 73.3%); both assays achieved excellent specificities (99.1 to 100.0%) for these five common viruses. The ResPlex II assay detected hMPV in 13 (3.6%) specimens, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 99.7%. The ResPlex II assay also differentiated RSV-A and RSV-B and gave positive results for RhV and EnV in 31 (8.6%) and 19 (5.3%) specimens, respectively. PIV-2, PIV-4, and SARS CoV were not detected in the specimens tested. The two systems can process 80 (NGEN) and 96 (ResPlex II) tests per run, with a hands-on time of approximately 60 min and test turnaround times of 6 h (ResPlex II) and 9 h (NGEN). Multiple-panel testing detected an additional unsuspected 9 (3.4%) PIV-1 and 10 (3.7%) PIV-3 infections. While test sensitivities for RSV and PIV-3 need improvement, both the NGEN and ResPlex II assays provide user-friendly and high-throughput tools for simultaneous detection and identification of a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens in a single test format. The multiplex approach enhances diagnosis through detection of respiratory viral etiologic agents in cases in which the presence of the agent was not suspected and a test was not ordered by the clinicians.","output":"Simultaneous detection and high-throughput identification of a panel of RNA viruses causing respiratory tract infections."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brachypodium distachyon is a useful model organism for studying interaction of cereals with phytopathogenic fungi.

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study, which was conducted in seven training and research hospitals in Istanbul, involved young adults who aged 18 and <50 years and hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: Among 1,120 patients, confusion at admission (p<0.001) and oxygen saturation (p<0.001) were significantly predictive factors of mortality. Blood type O was significantly associated with mortality compared to those discharged from the hospital (p<0.001). Among co-morbidities, the most reliable predictive factors were cerebral vascular disease (p<0.001) and chronic renal failure (p=0.010). Among laboratory parameters, high C-reactive protein (p<0.001) and low albumin (p<0.001) levels were predictors of mortality in young adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: SpO2 at admission was the best predictor of mortality in young adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

When lockdown restrictions were imposed, the concentrations of some air pollutants were reduced, as reported in some other cities in the world. This was often considered a positive by-product of the pandemic. However, often literature reporting the connection of air quality (AQ) and lockdown, suffers of limited and incomplete data analysis, not considering, for example, some confounding factors. This work presents a methodology, and the results of its application, to assess the impact of pandemic restrictions on AQ (in particular nitrogen oxides, NO(2) and particulate matter, PM(10)) in spring 2020 in Brescia, located in one of the most affected areas in terms of virus diffusion and in one of the most polluted areas in Europe (Po Valley, Italy). In particular, the proposed methodology integrates data and AQ modelling simulations to distinguish between the changes in the PM(10) and NO(2) pollutants concentration that occurred due to the restriction measures and due to other factors, like spatial-temporal characteristics (for example the seasonality), meteorological factors, and governmental actions that were introduced in the past to improve the air quality. Results show that NO(2) is strongly dependent to traffic emission. On the contrary, although the expected decrease in PM(10) concentrations, the results highlight that the reduction of transport emission would not help to avoid severe air pollution, due to the other pollution sources that contribute to its origin. The results presented for the first time in this work are of particular interest because they may be used as a basis to investigate in more details the sources that can impact on the air quality in Brescia, with the aim to propose effective measures able to reduce it.","output":"Analysis of the lockdown effects due to the COVID-19 on air pollution in Brescia (Lombardy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the industrial revolution, work and leisure have largely been considered opposing domains.

We found several proteins that could interact with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). -2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG), which is required for macrophage deactivation by endogenous cations, is associated with inflammatory regulation. Cytochrome P450 Family 3A (CYP4F3A) is an -oxidase that inactivates Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) in human neutrophils and the liver. We investigated the association between the polymorphisms of these two inflammation-associated genes and SARS development. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) maps of these two genes were built with Haploview using data on CHB+JPT (version 2) from the HapMap. A total of ten tag SNPs were selected and genotyped. In the Guangzhou cohort study, after adjusting for age and sex, two AHSG SNPs and one CYP4F3 SNP were found to be associated with SARS susceptibility: rs2248690 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-4.51); rs4917 (AOR 1.84; 95% CI 1.02-3.34); and rs3794987 (AOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.10C3.68). To further validate the association, the ten tag SNPs were genotyped in the Beijing cohort. After adjusting for age and sex, only rs2248690 (AOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30C2.04) was found to be associated with SARS susceptibility. The combined analysis of the two studies confirmed tag SNP rs2248690 in AHSG as a susceptibility variant (AOR 1.70; 95% CI 1.37C2.09). The statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype data among the patients and healthy controls in the HCW cohort, who were all similarly exposed to the SARS virus, also supported the findings. Further, the SNP rs2248690 affected the transcriptional activity of the AHSG promoter and thus regulated the AHSG serum level. Therefore, our study has demonstrated that the AA genotype of rs2268690, which leads to a higher AHSG serum concentration, was significantly associated with protection against SARS development.","output":"Genetic Variation of the Human -2-Heremans-Schmid Glycoprotein (AHSG) Gene Associated with the Risk of SARS-CoV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has caused a certain proportion of patients to be hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) and may cause musculoskeletal and neurological deficits following intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The aim of this study was to develop a tomography perfusion source imaging-based assessment of collateral vessel status. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial reperfusion therapy after CTP were retrospectively analyzed. In those with middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusion, CT perfusion source imaging was used to identify the relative filling time delay between the normal MCA Sylvian branches and those in the affected hemisphere. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the association of the relative filling time delay with the 24-hour Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score based on noncontrast CT and the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score. RESULTS There were 217 patients treated in 2009-2011 who had CTP data, of whom 60 had MCA or ICA occlusion and 55 had 90-day mRS data. The intraclass correlation coefficient for relative filling time delay was 0.95. Relative filling time delay was correlated with 24-hour ASPECTS (Spearman =-0.674; P<.001) and 90-day mRS score (=0.516, P<.01). Increased relative filling time delay was associated with poor radiologic outcome (ASPECTS, 0-7) (area under the curve=0.79, P<.001) and poor functional outcome (mRS score, 3-6) (area under the curve=0.77, P=.001).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shifted their recommendations recently, allowing for the co-administration of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines. This is based on the experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines, where the immunogenicity and adverse event profiles were generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously or alone.

It has been suggested that minipuberty contributes to the development of reproductive organs, somatic growth, cognitive/behavioral, and sex-specific brain development. Given the well-known trade-off between the reproductive/endocrine and immune systems in adults, the immunological approach to minipuberty, which is characterized by transient activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis seems to be ignored. This study focused on the relationship of the lymphocyte subsets with gonadotrophin and sex hormones during the minipuberty. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 121 newborns (58 male) were included in this cross-sectional study. The hormone and lymphocyte subsets studied were as follow:follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) estradiol (E), testosterone (T), CD19, CD16/56, CD3, CD3/CD4, CD3/CD8, and HLA-DR as lymphocyte activation marker. RESULTS The mean FSH levels were higher in females (15.1510.12mIU/mL vs, 2.611.74mIU/mL) and LH in males (5.802.51mIU/mL vs. 1.9112.89mIU/mL) (p<0.001 for each). The mean percentages of the CD3/CD4 levels were higher in females (54.616.70% vs. 51.176.77%) and CD3/CD8 in males (21.494.82% vs. 17.313.66%) (p <0.001 for each). In the females, the mean FSH levels negatively correlated with CD3/CD4 (rFSH-CD3/CD4 =-0.423, p=0.001) and positively correlated with CD3/CD8 (rFSH-CD3/CD8 =0.311, p=0.013).

CONCLUSION This study showed that the mean CD3/CD4 levels were higher in female and CD3/CD8 in male newborns, indicating that there was a sexual dimorphism in favor of immunostimulant in females and immunosuppressor components of immune response in males during the minipuberty.

We need to establish a practical method to improve the efficiency of treatment and optimize the allocation of medical resources. Due to the influx of a large number of patients into the hospital and the running of medical resources, blood routine test became the only possible check while COVID-19 patients first go to a fever clinic in a community hospital. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify key indicators from initial blood routine test results for COVID-19 severity prediction. We determined that age is a key indicator for severity predicting of COVID-19, with an accuracy of 0.77 and an AUC of 0.92. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, we proposed a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm, which combines the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Na?ve Bayes (NB) classifier, to further select effective indicators from patients initial blood test results. The MCDM algorithm selected 3 dominant feature subsets: {Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT} with a selection rate of 44%, {Age, NEUT, LYMC} with a selection rate of 38%, and {Age, WBC, LYMC} with a selection rate of 9%. Using these feature subsets, the optimized prediction model could achieve an accuracy of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.93. These results indicated that Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT were the key factors for COVID-19 severity prediction. Using age and the indicators selected by the MCDM algorithm from initial blood routine test results can effectively predict the severity of COVID-19.

The very rapid global spread has raised the issue whether there are further multi-dimensional consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human behavior, the key of its transmission. During the coronavirus crisis, odd, abnormal, and irresponsible behavior has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) individuals, particularly in super-spreaders, that is, persons with a high viral load, thus constituting also super-emitters. Indeed, cases of infected persons ignoring self-confinement orders, intentionally disregarding physical distancing and multiplying social interactions, or even deliberately sneezing, spitting or coughing were reported. While it is known that some other viruses, such as rabies and even influenza do change human behavior, this remains unclear for SARS-CoV-2. In this perspective, we highlight the possibility that COVID-19 is facilitated by altered human social behavior that benefits SARS-CoV-2 transmission, through showcasing similar virus-induced changed behavior by other pathogens and relating this to reports from the gray literature.","output":"Behavioral manipulation-key to the successful global spread of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is a crucial to find target compounds in natural product research.

This study aimed to investigate whether the associations of living arrangements with loneliness differ in community-dwelling older adults according to different living preferences. Methods: In the 2008/2009 (baseline) and 2011/2012 (follow-up) waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, living arrangements [living with children mainly (LWC), living with spouse only (LWS), and living alone (LA)], living preferences [preferring living with children (PreLWC) and preferring living alone/only with spouse (PreLA)], and feelings of loneliness were assessed. The effect modifications of living preferences in the associations of living arrangements with loneliness were estimated using logistic regression models, and corresponding odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Results: Living preferences significantly modified the associations of living arrangements with loneliness at baseline (p for interaction = 0.009 for LWS and = 0.015 for LA). Compared with LWC, LWS was protective for loneliness only in the PreLA older adults at baseline (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.45-0.64, p < 0.001), and LA was significantly associated with loneliness especially in the PreLWC older adults, compared with their PreLA counterparts (at baseline, ORs = 2.89 vs. 2.15; at follow-up, ORs = 1.68 vs. 1.51). Conclusion: Living preference modifies the associations of living arrangements with loneliness, and those who prefer living with children but live alone are more likely to feel lonely.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled adult patients who presented with a fever and cough in outpatient clinics between December 2016 and August 2018. After taking a history and performing physical examinations, physicians predicted the possibility of respiratory infections because of atypical pathogens. Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: 50%, intermediate: 20%  and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. RESULTS: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4\\\\53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3\\\\39.2) were associated with the detections.

METHODS A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature from inception through January 31, 2020, was performed. Original articles with > 10 patients evaluating the accuracy of DECT for detecting BME in the appendicular skeleton with a reference standard of MRI and/or clinical follow-up were included. Study details were independently extracted by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model with multivariable meta-regression. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated with QUADAS-2. RESULTS Twenty studies evaluating 790 patients for BME in the appendicular skeleton were included in analysis. The summary sensitivity, specificity, and AUC values for BME in the appendicular skeleton were 86% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82-89%), 93% (95% CI 90-95%), and 0.95, respectively. Quantitative analysis had a higher sensitivity than qualitative analysis on meta-regression (p = 0.01), but no difference in specificity (p = 0.28). No other covariates contributed to variability in accuracy (etiology (trauma vs non-trauma); location (upper vs lower extremity); and RoB). Studies demonstrated generally low or unclear RoB and applicability. Eight studies included index tests with high RoB when quantitative assessments used a retrospective cut-off value. CONCLUSIONS DECT demonstrates a higher specificity than sensitivity and AUC > 0.9. In scenarios where MRI availability is limited or contraindicated, DECT could be an alternative to MRI for detecting BME in the appendicular skeleton. However, limitations in sources of variability and RoB warrant continued study. KEY POINTS ?

METHODS: From January 2016 to May 2021, 41,140 women were tested for HPV infection. HPV genotyping included 15 high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and 6 low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) genotypes. Total prevalence, annual trend, and specific age group prevalence and genotype distribution were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall HPV infection rate was 18.10% among Guangxi women self-referred to clinic for gynecologic problems in southern China. During 2016C2018, the prevalence of HPV infection showed an upward trend, from 18.21% in 2016 to 21.99% in 2018, and later it showed a downward trend, from 18.35% in 2019 to 12.26% in May 2021. Pure HR-HPV genotypes (14.36%) were found in more infections than pure LR-HPV genotypes (2.77%) and mixed genotypes (0.97%). Two peaks of HPV infection were found in the  25 years (22.94%) and 56C65 years (21.25%) groups. The six most prevalent HR-HPV genotypes were HPV 52 (4.06%), 16 (2.70%), 58 (2.24%), 51 (1.87%), 39 (1.52%), and 53 (1.52%). The three most prevalent LR-HPV genotypes were HPV 6 (1.31%), CP8304 (1.01%), and 11 (0.82%). Infection with a single HR-HPV genotype was the most common type of infection, with an overall infection rate of 12.30%. Infection with two HPV genotypes was the most common multiple HR-HPV infection type, with an infection rate of 2.35%.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) was included in the diagnostic pathway for its high sensitivity, low costs, non-invasiveness and safety. We aimed to test the sensitivity of LUS to rule out COVID-19 pneumonia (COVIDp) in a population of patients with suggestive symptoms. METHODS: Multicentre prospective observational study in three EDs in Northeastern Italy during the first COVID-19 outbreak. A convenience sample of 235 patients admitted to the ED for symptoms suggestive COVIDp (fever, cough or shortness of breath) from 17 March 2020 to 26 April 2020 was enrolled. All patients underwent a sequential assessment involving: clinical examination, LUS, CXR and arterial blood gas. The index test under investigation was a standardised protocol of LUS compared with a pragmatic composite reference standard constituted by: clinical gestalt, real-time PCR test, radiological and blood gas results. Of the 235 enrolled patients, 90 were diagnosed with COVIDp according to the reference standard. RESULTS: Among the patients with suspected COVIDp, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 38.3%. The sensitivity of LUS for diagnosing COVIDp was 85.6% (95% CI 76.6% to 92.1%); the specificity was 91.7% (95% CI 86.0% to 95.7%). The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were 86.5% (95%CI 78.8% to 91.7%) and 91.1% (95% CI 86.1% to 94.4%) respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of LUS for COVIDp was 89.4% (95% CI 84.7% to 93.0%). The positive likelihood ratio was 10.3 (95% CI 6.0 to 17.9), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.16 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.3). CONCLUSION: In a population with high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, LUS has a high sensitivity (and negative predictive value) enough to rule out COVIDp in patients with suggestive symptoms. The role of LUS in diagnosing patients with COVIDp is perhaps even more promising. Nevertheless, further research with adequately powered studies is needed.

CCPS can adapt iteratively and in real time to emergent vicissitudes and challenges faced by clinicians. We describe the first implementation of CCPS in psychiatry. Methods: We co-developed clinical scripts together with child and adolescent psychiatry senior fellows and professional actors with experience performing as simulated patients (SPs). We conducted the simulation sessions with interviewers blind to the content of case scenarios enacted by the SPs. Each hour-long simulation was followed by an hour-long debriefing session with all participants. We recorded and transcribed case preparation, simulation interactions, and debriefing sessions, and analyzed anonymized transcripts through qualitative analysis within a constructivist framework, aided by NVivo software. Results: Each of six CCPS sessions was attended by a median of 13 participants (range, 11C14). The first three sessions were conducted in person; the last three, which took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, via synchronized videoconferencing. Each of the sessions centered on clinically challenging and affectively charged situations informed by trainees' prior experiences. Through iterative thematic analysis we derived an alliterating 9R model centered on three types of Reflection: (a) in action/while doing (Regulate, Relate, and Reason); (b) on action/having done (Realities, Restraints, and Relationships); and (c) for action/will be doing (with opportunities for Repair and Reaffirmation).

The present article summarizes the latest studies on RNA-guided gene regulation in human antiviral protection, and its importance. Additionally, the role of both neutralizing antibodies and the interferon system in viral invasion is considered. The interferon system is an additional mechanism for suppressing viral infections in humans, which shifts cells into an 'alarm' mode to attempt to prevent further contagion. The primary task of the human central immune system is to maintain integrity and to protect against foreign organisms. In this review, a novel concept is proposed: Antiviral protection in all organisms can be achieved through an intracellular RNA-guided mechanism. A simple and effective defence against viruses is incorporation of a part of a virus's DNA (spacer) into the hosts chromosomes. Following reinfection, RNA transcripts of this spacer are created to direct nuclease enzymes to destroy the viral genome. This is an example of real-time adaptive immunity potentially possessed by every cell with a full complement of chromosomes, and an indicator that antiviral immunity is not only mediated by the presence of neutralizing antibodies and memory B- and T-cells, but also by the presence of specific spacers in the DNA of individuals who have recovered from a viral infection.","output":"A novel concept of human antiviral protection: It's all about RNA (Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Relatively limited data are available regarding paediatric COVID-19.

Sidestepping the non-convexity in mixture likelihood, the NPMLE estimates the mixing distribution by maximizing the total likelihood over the space of probability measures, which can be viewed as an extreme form of overparameterization. In this paper we discover a surprising property of the NPMLE solution. Consider, for example, a Gaussian mixture model on the real line with a subgaussian mixing distribution. Leveraging complex-analytic techniques, we show that with high probability the NPMLE based on a sample of size $n$ has $O(\\\\log n)$ atoms (mass points), significantly improving the deterministic upper bound of $n$ due to Lindsay \\\\cite{lindsay1983geometry1}. Notably, any such Gaussian mixture is statistically indistinguishable from a finite one with $O(\\\\log n)$ components (and this is tight for certain mixtures). Thus, absent any explicit form of model selection, NPMLE automatically chooses the right model complexity, a property we term \\\\emph{self-regularization}. Extensions to other exponential families are given. As a statistical application, we show that this structural property can be harnessed to bootstrap existing Hellinger risk bound of the (parametric) MLE for finite Gaussian mixtures to the NPMLE for general Gaussian mixtures, recovering a result of Zhang \\\\cite{zhang2009generalized}.","output":"Self-regularizing Property of Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator in Mixture Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die Linke ist mit mehreren Herausforderungen konfrontiert: In Ostdeutschland als ihrer klassischen Hochburg verliert die Partei sowohl Mitglieder als auch W?hlerstimmen, w?hrend im Westen Gewinne zu verbuchen sind, sodass sich (langfristig) die innerparteilichen Kr?fteverh?ltnisse verschieben.

Although Indigenous young people in Canada are at a higher risk of mental health outcomes and faced with limited access to appropriate care and resources, they have unique strengths and resilience that promote mental health and wellness. Furthermore, resilience has been described as a 'healing journey' by Indigenous peoples, and interventions that account for the culture of these groups show promise in promoting mental health and wellness. As such, there is a need for innovative mental health interventions for Indigenous youth that transcend the Western biomedical model, use a strengths-based approach, and account for the cultural practices and belief systems of Indigenous peoples. This scoping review aims to explore the resilience and protective factors that promote mental health and wellness for Indigenous youth in present-day Canada with the aim of compiling and summarising the available literature on this topic to date.

Since the identification of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, no drugs have been developed to specifically target SARS-CoV-2. To develop effective and safe treatment options, a better understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection is required. To fill this knowledge gap, researchers require reliable experimental systems that express the host proteins necessary for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. These proteins include the viral receptor, ACE2 and the proteases TMPRSS2 and furin. A number of studies have reported cell-type specific expression of the genes encoding these molecules. However, less is known about the protein expression of these molecules. METHODS: We assessed the suitability of primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells maintained in air-liquid interface (ALI) as an experimental system for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. During cellular differentiation, we measured the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin over progressive ALI days by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We also explored the effect of the fibrotic cytokine TGF-b on the expression of these proteins in well-differentiated HBE cells. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Like ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin proteins are localized in differentiated ciliated cells as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. These data suggest that well-differentiated HBE cells maintained in air-liquid interface is a reliable in vitro system for investigating cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further identified that profibrotic mediators, TGF-?1 and TGF-?2, increase the expression of furin, which is a protease required for the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"In well-differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells, TGF-?1 and TGF-?2 induce expression of furin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Development of an effective antiviral drug for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health priority. Although several candidate drugs have been identified through in vitro and in vivo models, consistent and compelling evidence from clinical studies is limited. The lack of evidence from clinical trials may stem in part from the imperfect design of the trials. We investigated how clinical trials for antivirals need to be designed, especially focusing on the sample size in randomized controlled trials. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A modeling study was conducted to help understand the reasons behind inconsistent clinical trial findings and to design better clinical trials. We first analyzed longitudinal viral load data for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) without antiviral treatment by use of a within-host virus dynamics model. The fitted viral load was categorized into 3 different groups by a clustering approach. Comparison of the estimated parameters showed that the 3 distinct groups were characterized by different virus decay rates (p-value < 0.001). The mean decay rates were 1.17 d(?1) (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.27 d(?1)), 0.777 d(?1) (0.716 to 0.838 d(?1)), and 0.450 d(?1) (0.378 to 0.522 d(?1)) for the 3 groups, respectively. Such heterogeneity in virus dynamics could be a confounding variable if it is associated with treatment allocation in compassionate use programs (i.e., observational studies). Subsequently, we mimicked randomized controlled trials of antivirals by simulation. An antiviral effect causing a 95% to 99% reduction in viral replication was added to the model. To be realistic, we assumed that randomization and treatment are initiated with some time lag after symptom onset. Using the duration of virus shedding as an outcome, the sample size to detect a statistically significant mean difference between the treatment and placebo groups (1:1 allocation) was 13,603 and 11,670 (when the antiviral effect was 95% and 99%, respectively) per group if all patients are enrolled regardless of timing of randomization. The sample size was reduced to 584 and 458 (when the antiviral effect was 95% and 99%, respectively) if only patients who are treated within 1 day of symptom onset are enrolled. We confirmed the sample size was similarly reduced when using cumulative viral load in log scale as an outcome. We used a conventional virus dynamics model, which may not fully reflect the detailed mechanisms of viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. The model needs to be calibrated in terms of both parameter settings and model structure, which would yield more reliable sample size calculation. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that estimated association in observational studies can be biased due to large heterogeneity in viral dynamics among infected individuals, and statistically significant effect in randomized controlled trials may be difficult to be detected due to small sample size. The sample size can be dramatically reduced by recruiting patients immediately after developing symptoms. We believe this is the first study investigated the study design of clinical trials for antiviral treatment using the viral dynamics model.","output":"Detection of significant antiviral drug effects on COVID-19 with reasonable sample sizes in randomized controlled trials: A modeling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 \\"infodemic\\"has resulted in the widespread dissemination of counterfeit medical advice, hoaxes, fake products, and phoney information about the virus and responses. As a result, computational methods for determining any information's authenticity to improve trust in public health awareness and policy decisions are profoundly discussed in the scientific community. Even before the pandemic, mis- and disinformation, including fake news, have been observed in the online world in significant numbers for numerous business, political and personal reasons. Moreover, many of these fake news was published from sources believed to be reliable. In contrast, some other fake news was fabricated in a way that would be easily trusted and shared by the general people in social media. COVID-19 related fake news has enormous effects on both the offline and online community, and thus, it challenges government initiatives for proper health intervention. Therefore, interest in research in this area has risen to understand the problem both socially and technically. In this paper, we attempt to understand how we can help student Internet users of colleges from the lower-middle-income country, Bangladesh, in Southeast Asia, to distinguish COVID-19 misinformation. Our study reveals that providing related news as supplementary information to any online news helps students make better decision about news authenticity. Statistical analyses on the survey data show that male students were found to be more accurate than female students to detect mis- and disinformation;students from the urban areas could detect misleading news better than students from villages;and that students from Science background demonstrated overall best performance, while students from Madrasah background, who are all male, could not produce a significant improvement. We conclude that the female students in general and male students of Madrasah, who spend the least amount of time online among all the student Internet users, are the most vulnerable groups to fake news. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Fighting against Fake News during Pandemic Era: Does Providing Related News Help Student Internet Users to Detect COVID-19 Misinformation?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: At the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine (HMSOM) in New Jersey, clinical activities for students were suspended on March 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical teams at Hackensack Meridian Health (HMH) needed resources for identifying and assimilating the medical literature regarding COVID-19, which was expanding and evolving daily. HMH leaders reached out to HMSOM leaders for assistance. The HMSOM leadership and faculty quickly organized a literature review elective. APPROACH: Eight second-year medical students participated in a literature review elective course to research and synthesize the COVID-19 clinical literature to provide synopses of best practices for various clinical teams. By March 23, students were searching the literature and writing reports independently, mentored by a senior dean (an infectious diseases specialist) and supported by the associate dean of libraries and library team. The library team updated and categorized student reports daily on a website dedicated to the elective. OUTCOMES: During the 6-week elective, 8 students produced 70 reports synthesizing the emerging COVID-19 literature to help answer practitioners' clinical questions in real time. One student report was posted on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website. All 70 were published online in Elsevier's health education faculty hub. On course evaluations, students expressed regret about not being directly involved in patient care, but articulated their gratitude to be able to contribute to the clinical teams. NEXT STEPS: In June 2020, the students returned to their clinical clerkships as COVID-19 clinical volumes declined and PPE became more available. Students continued to be available to the clinical teams to assist with COVID-19 questions.

All patients had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and required invasive mechanical ventilation. Baseline characteristics, pathophysiological respiratory data, clinical outcomes, viral shredding, and chest CT scan were collected. Results: A total of 150 patients were included (median age, 68 years (interquartile range, (IQR), 58-72;81% male). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (77, 51%) and obesity (42, 28%). At ICU admission, the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 138 (IQR,112-178). During hospitalization, the rate of ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) was 61% and 51 (34%) patients had acute kidney injury (AKI) with a Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) score > 1.

However, meager recent data exist on this technique, which tends to be replaced by stent-assisted reconstructive techniques. In our department since 2004, we have assessed the safety, efficacy, and complication risk factors of parent artery occlusion by using coils for trapping these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We determined retrospectively the complication rate, factors associated with the occurrence of an ischemic event, changes in symptoms of mass effect, evolution of the aneurysmal size, and the growth of an additional aneurysm after treatment. RESULTS Fifty-six consecutive patients were included, with a median age of 54 years (range, 25-85 years; 92% women), 48% with giant aneurysms and 75% with infraclinoid aneurysms. There was a permanent morbidity rate of 5% exclusively due to ischemia, a zero mortality rate, an aneurysmal retraction rate of 91%, and an improvement rate for pain of 98% and for cranial nerve palsy of 72%, with a median follow-up of >3 years. Para-/supraclinoid topography of the aneurysm (P = .043) and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (P = .024) were associated with an excessive risk of an ischemic event, whereas the presence of a mural thrombus had a protective role (P = .033). CONCLUSIONS In this study, parent artery occlusion by using coils to treat large/giant or fusiform aneurysms of the carotid siphon was safe and effective, especially for giant infraclinoid aneurysms.

Treatment with lithium can give rise to various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including thyroid dysfunction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypercalcaemia. Lithium may induce hypercalcaemia through both acute and chronic effects. The initial acute effects are potentially reversible and occur as a result of lithium's action on the calcium-sensing receptor pathway and glycogen synthase kinase 3, giving rise to a biochemical picture similar to that seen in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. In the long term, chronic lithium therapy leads to permanent changes within the parathyroid glands by either unmasking hyperparathyroidism in patients with a subclinical parathyroid adenoma or possibly by initiating multiglandular hyperparathyroidism. The latter biochemical picture is identical to that of primary hyperparathyroidism.

We designed and evaluated a system whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient. Methods: The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero, thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and oxygenation during shared ventilation. Results: Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation.

To pursue this question, we used a unique viral-challenge design in which we assessed behavioral, social, and psychological factors in healthy adults. We subsequently exposed these adults to a cold or influenza virus and then monitored them in quarantine for 5 to 6 days for onset of respiratory illness. Factors we found to be associated with greater risk of respiratory illnesses after virus exposure included smoking, ingesting an inadequate level of vitamin C, and chronic psychological stress. Those associated with decreased risk included social integration, social support, physical activity, adequate and efficient sleep, and moderate alcohol intake. We cautiously suggest that our findings could have implications for identifying who becomes ill when exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This argument is based on evidence that the associations we report are replicable across multiple respiratory viruses and that the pathways found to link psychosocial factors to colds and influenza may play similar roles in COVID-19.","output":"Psychosocial Vulnerabilities to Upper Respiratory Infectious Illness: Implications for Susceptibility to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue microcirculation measured by vascular occlusion test is impaired during septic shock. However, it has not been investigated extensively during anesthesia induction. The aim of the study is to evaluate tissue microcirculation during anesthesia induction.

We conducted a prospective observational study of 50 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. During anesthesia induction, we measured and analyzed tissue oxygen saturation, vascular occlusion test, cerebral oximetry, forearm-minus-fingertip skin temperature gradients and hemodynamic data in order to evaluate microcirculation as related to alterations in peripheral vasodilation as reflected by increased Tforearm-finger thermal gradients. During anesthesia induction, recovery slope during vascular occlusion test and cerebral oxygen saturation increased from 4.0 (1.5) to 4.7 (1.3) % s(-1) (p = 0.02) and 64.0 (10.2) to 74.2 (9.2) % (p < 0.001), respectively.

The first nontravel-related U.S. case was confirmed on February 26 in a California resident who had become ill on February 13 (3). Two days later, on February 28, a second nontravel-related case was confirmed in the state of Washington (4,5). Examination of four lines of evidence provides insight into the timing of introduction and early transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into the United States before the detection of these two cases. First, syndromic surveillance based on emergency department records from counties affected early by the pandemic did not show an increase in visits for COVID-19-like illness before February 28. Second, retrospective SARS-CoV-2 testing of approximately 11,000 respiratory specimens from several U.S. locations beginning January 1 identified no positive results before February 20. Third, analysis of viral RNA sequences from early cases suggested that a single lineage of virus imported directly or indirectly from China began circulating in the United States between January 18 and February 9, followed by several SARS-CoV-2 importations from Europe. Finally, the occurrence of three cases, one in a California resident who died on February 6, a second in another resident of the same county who died February 17, and a third in an unidentified passenger or crew member aboard a Pacific cruise ship that left San Francisco on February 11, confirms cryptic circulation of the virus by early February. These data indicate that sustained, community transmission had begun before detection of the first two nontravel-related U.S. cases, likely resulting from the importation of a single lineage of virus from China in late January or early February, followed by several importations from Europe.

This study describes the epidemiology and the outcome of major trauma patients admitted to centers in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers contributing to the TraumaBase? registry during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. This COVID-19 trauma cohort was compared to historical cohorts (2017C2019). RESULTS: Over a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017C2019, 4448 patients). Trauma patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic especially during the lockdown period, with an observed reduction in both the absolute numbers and proportion exposed to road traffic accidents and subsequently admitted to traumacenters (348 annually 2017C2019 [55.4% of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8%] in 2020 p < 0.005).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre observational study in five European EDs (the TRIAGE study), including consecutive children aged <16 years who were discharged following their initial ED visit (index visit), in 2012C2015. Standardised data on patient characteristics, Manchester Triage System urgency classification, vital signs, clinical interventions and procedures were collected. The outcome measure was serious illness defined as hospital admission or PICU admission or death in ED after an unplanned revisit within 7 days of the index visit. Prediction models were developed using multivariable logistic regression using characteristics of the index visit to predict the likelihood of a revisit with a serious illness. The clinical model included day and time of presentation, season, age, gender, presenting problem, triage urgency, and vital signs. An extended model added laboratory investigations, imaging, and intravenous medications. Cross validation between the five sites was performed, and discrimination and calibration were assessed using random effects models. A digital calculator was constructed for clinical implementation. 7,891 children out of 98,561 children had a revisit to the ED (8.0%), of whom 1,026 children (1.0%) returned to the ED with a serious illness. Rates of revisits with serious illness varied between the hospitals (range 0.7C2.2%). The clinical model had a summary Area under the operating curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65C0.74) and summary calibration slope of 0.83 (95% CI 0.67C0.99). 4,433 children (5%) had a risk of > = 3%, which was useful for ruling in a revisit with serious illness, with positive likelihood ratio 4.41 (95% CI 3.87C5.01) and specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.95C0.96). 37,546 (39%) had a risk <0.5%, which was useful for ruling out a revisit with serious illness (negative likelihood ratio 0.30 (95% CI 0.25C0.35), sensitivity 0.88 (95% CI 0.86C0.90)). The extended model had an improved summary AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.68C0.75) and summary calibration slope of 0.84 (95% CI 0.71C0.97). As study limitations, variables on ethnicity and social deprivation could not be included, and only return visits to the original hospital and not to those of surrounding hospitals were recorded.

The Italian government adopted urgent measures to slow its spread. Enforcing compliance with such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-19 preventive process is urgent today both in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens' compliance with health emergency containment measures. METHOD: An online survey was administered between February 28 and March 4, 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of health engagement (Patient Health Engagement Scale), a 5-item Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7, resulting in 4 positions that describe the psychological readiness to be active in one's own health management, and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure citizens' perceived susceptibility and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, trust in institutional bodies, health habits and food consumption. To investigate the relationship between health engagement and these variables, ANOVA analysis, logistic regression and contingency tables with Pearson's chi-squared analysis have been carried out. RESULTS: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and severity of the disease; they are less trustful of scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health-both in normal conditions and under stress-and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of health engagement also are associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The Patient Health Engagement model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives intended to promote preventive behaviors.","output":"Measuring Italian citizens' engagement in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of COVID-19 infection is surging day by day.

A graft-versus-host-like (GVHL) syndrome, characterized by widespread necrotizing leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the bowel, skin, and other tissues, has also been observed after mercury treatment of BN rats. These findings have suggested that the autoimmunity caused by the administration of mercury to BN rats may result as a xenobiotic-induced GVHL effect under the control of OX22+ T lymphocytes. However, previous studies of mercury-induced autoimmunity have never reported any evidence of GVHL lesions. Therefore, we have carefully examined various tissues from a large group of BN rats injected with HgCl(2) to identify possible areas of inflammatory reactions that may have been unnoticed in previous investigations. In addition, we have determined by flow cytometry whether exposure to mercury results in percentage and numerical alterations of OX22+ or other lymphocyte subpopulations in lymphoid organs of HgCl(2)-treated BN rats. The present article confirms that mercury induces autoimmune responses to laminin 1 but does not corroborate the hypothesis of a GVHL syndrome regulated by OX22+ lymphocytes. First, changes in OX22+ cells during treatment with HgCl(2) were infrequent and had no significant correlation with the kinetics of autoimmune responses to laminin 1.

A multilevel Poisson regression model adjusted for the community incidence in the corresponding basic health area (BHA) and the type of school (primary or secondary), with random effects at the sanitary region and BHA levels, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 2184 public schools opened on September 14th with 778,715 students. Multivariate analysis showed a significant association between the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases in a centre in weeks 1-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 school incidence among students in weeks 4-5 (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.074, 95% CI 1.044-1.105, p-value <0.001).

Differences in plasma levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were observed according to the genotype of TNFRSF1B rs1061622, TNF rs1800629, and rs361525. According to the studied genetic variants, there were no differences in the soluble TNF- levels. Higher soluble TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were detected in patients with COVID-19 requiring IMV. CONCLUSION: Genetic variants in TNF and TNFRSFB1 influence the plasma levels of soluble TNFR1 and TNFR2, implicated in the COVID-19 severity.","output":"TNFRSF1B and TNF variants are associated with differences in soluble TNF receptors' levels in patients with severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxidative damage to biomolecules occurs by the accumulation of molecular damage due to free radicals and/or a diminution of antioxidant protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protection of organic and conventional purple grape juices in brain, liver, and plasma from adult Wistar rats (7 months old) against the oxidative damage provoked by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). Adult rats were divided into three groups (control, conventional purple grape juice, and organic purple grape juice). Half of the rats received CCl(4), and the other half received the vehicle (vegetable oil). The chemical analytical determination showed that the highest levels of total phenolic, resveratrol, and catechins were seen in organic purple grape juices. Considering the treatment groups, it was observed that in all tissues (brain structures and liver) and plasma, CCl(4) treatment increased the lipid peroxidation (LP) levels. Both grape juices were capable to reduce LP levels in cerebral cortex and hippocampus; however, in the striatum and substantia nigra only the organic grape juice reduced LP level. CCl(4) caused an increase in catalase activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra and in superoxide dismutase activity in substantia nigra. This increase was reduced by both juices in substantia nigra and hippocampus structures (P < .05). In the alkaline version of the comet assay performed on whole blood, it was observed that CCl(4) was capable of inducing mainly DNA damage class 4 and 3 frequencies, which was significantly reduced in groups that received both purple grape juices. This implies that both grape juices have an important antigenotoxic activity.","output":"Antioxidant and antigenotoxic activities of purple grape juice--organic and conventional--in adult rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, consuming media was critical to identify precautionary behaviors to reduce the spread of the virus, particularly for older adults.

Participants (n=1,168, 73.2 years, 56.8% women, 94.9% White), were asked to estimate their amount of time spent consuming pandemic-related media each day, and to report on anxiety and depressive symptoms both before and after the pandemic onset. We characterized change in anxiety and depression by subtracting scores on current anxiety and depressive symptoms from their recalled symptoms prior to the pandemic. Respondents with high pandemic-related media consumption (>3hrs) were more likely to have increased anxiety, compared to those with low (<1hr) media consumption (OR:1.57, 95%CI:1.09-2.23). Similarly, respondents with increased social media consumption during the pandemic were 64% more likely to have depression, compared to those who did not use social media. This association was bi-directional those who reduced their social media use were 45% less likely to have depression and 26% less likely to have anxiety, compared to those who never used social media. Older adults consuming more pandemic-related media had increased anxiety. Increased social media consumption was associated with elevated depression symptoms.

METHODS: The study was conducted at Canakkale University Hospital in Turkey. Included in the study were 82 non-metastatic breast cancer patients whose clinical outcomes were followed-up after primary treatment, but suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. FCR, SWB and psychological resilience were assessed using the fear of cancer recurrence inventory-short form (FCRI-SF), SWB scale and the brief resilience scale (BRS), respectively. RESULTS: The mean scores of breast cancer survivors concerning FCR, SWB, and psychological resilience were 17.775.38, 36.206.21 and 20.014.51, respectively. A significant negative correlation was noted between the scores of FCR and SWB and psychological resilience (r=-0.329, p<0.001 and r=-0.316, p=0.004, respectively). Additionally, a significantly positive correlation was identified between psychological resilience and SWB (r=0.501, p=0.003). A hierarchical linear regression analysis with FCRI-SF as the dependent variable, and SWB and BRS as explanatory variables, indicated that SWB affects FCRI-SF scores and is a potential predictor of FCR. A mediation analysis revealed that SWB partially mediated the relationship between psychological resilience and FCR. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer survivors with high SWB and psychological resilience scores experience less FCR, despite their failure to maintain the medical follow-up due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Efforts should be made to increase the psychological resilience and spiritual well-being of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

Such data are in short supply, both internationally and in South Africa. The South African blood services (the South African National Blood Service, SANBS and the Western Cape Blood Service, WCBS) are coordinating a nationally representative survey of blood donors, which it is hoped can become a cost-effective surveillance method with validity for community-level seroprevalence estimation. Methods: Leveraging existing arrangements, SANBS human research ethics committee permission was obtained to test blood donations collected on predefined days (7th, 10th ,12th ,15th ,20th ,23th and 25th January) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay on the cobas e411 platform currently available in the blood services donation testing laboratories. Using standard methods, prevalence analysis was done by province, age and race, allowing age to be regarded as either a continuous or categorical variable. Testing was performed in the Eastern Cape (EC), Free State (FS), KwaZulu Natal (ZN) and Northern Cape (NC) provinces. Results: We report on data from 4858 donors - 1457 in EC; 463 in NC; 831 in FS and 2107 in ZN. Prevalence varied substantially across race groups and between provinces, with seroprevalence among Black donors consistently several times higher than among White donors, and the other main population groups (Coloured and Asian) not consistently represented in all provinces. There is no clear evidence that seroprevalence among donors varies by age. Weighted net estimates of prevalence (in the core age range 15-69) by province (compared with official clinically-confirmed COVID-19 case rates in mid-January 2021) are: EC-63%(2.8%), NC-32%(2.2%), FS-46%(2.4%), and ZN-52%(2.4%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates substantial differences in dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection between different race groups, most likely explained by historically based differences in socio-economic status and housing conditions. As has been seen in other areas, even such high seroprevalence does not guarantee population-level immunity against new outbreaks C probably due to viral evolution and waning of antibody neutralization. Despite its limitations, notably a healthy donor effect, it seems plausible that these estimates are reasonably generalisable to actual population level anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, but should be further verified.","output":"Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among blood donors in Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and Free State provinces of South Africa in January 2021."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The NHS Five Year Forward View focuses on expansion and development of community services and out-of-hospital care.

Domestic cats in COVID-19-positive households could therefore be a part of a human to animal to human transmission pathway. Here, we report the results of a qualitative risk assessment focusing on the potential of cat to human transmission in such settings. The assessment was based on evidence available by October 2021. After the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to a household by a human, cats may become infected and infected cats may pose an additional infection risk for other members of the household. In order to assess this additional risk qualitatively, expert opinion was elicited within the framework of a modified Delphi procedure. The conclusion was that the additional risk of infection of an additional person in a household associated with keeping a domestic cat is very low to negligible, depending on the intensity of cat-to-human interactions.

We found that xenogenized tumor cells were readily recognized and engulfed by dendritic cells; thereby, tumor antigens were efficiently presented to T lymphocytes. Moreover, exosome-VSV-G itself acts as a TLR4 agonist and stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, leading to CD8+ T cell cross-priming. The administration of these exosomes in multiple tumor mouse models xenogenized tumor cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The combinatorial treatment with anti-PD-L1 exhibited complete tumor regression (30%) and better long-term overall survival.

Current literature reports many cases of acquired facial palsy that do not recover spontaneously, and more information is needed regarding the efficacy of physical therapies used in this population. Methods: A systematic search of eight electronic databases was performed from database inception to December 2018. Gray literature searches were then performed to identify additional articles. Studies were included if they addressed physical rehabilitation interventions for adults with acquired facial palsy. Reasons for exclusion were documented. Independent data extraction, quality assessment, and risk of bias assessment followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Following abstract screening, a total of 13 full-text articles were identified for independent screening by two reviewers. This included four randomized control trials, two non-randomized control trials, one cohort study, and six prospective case series studies. Twelve out of the 13 included studies reported on facial palsy as a sequela of stroke. A total of 539 participants received intervention for facial palsy across the 13 included studies. Therapy design, length and frequency of intervention varied across the studies, and a wide range of outcome measures were used. Improvement on various outcome measures was reported across all 13 studies. The quality of the evidence was low overall, and most studies were found to have high risk of bias. Conclusions: All the studies in this review report improvement of facial movement or function following application of various methods of physical rehabilitation for facial palsy.

We analyse global COVID-19 data using Causal Inference, constructing two contrasting directed acyclic graph (DAG) models, one causal and one acausal, and set out clearly multiple predictions made by each model. We show that observed data strongly match predictions made by the causal model but largely contradict those of the acausal model. We explore historic evidence further supporting the causal model.

Among many imaging technologies, Computed Tomography (CT) analyses with deep learning frameworks offer better efficiency than the other imaging modalities. To segment the infected COVID-19 Region-Of-Interests (ROIs), an Enriched 2.5D U-Net (E2.5D U-Net)-based deep learner has been used. In contrast, it requires categorization of infection severity to identify the patients in the prior stage. Hence, in this article, feature extraction with a classification framework is proposed to learn deep features related to the infection disease severity. In this framework, each segment from the E2.5D U-Net is fed to a deep learner such as DenseNet201 to extract the deep features. These features are learned independently by different machine learning classifiers to categorize the infection severity levels. It aids physicians in diagnosing COVID-19 patients in advance. But it needs other infection-related features to enhance the efficiency. Therefore, a multi-modeling classification framework is proposed. This framework extracts the handcrafted features from CT scans and concatenates them with the deep features to get the unified feature vector. Moreover, these feature vectors are trained by using the multi-modeling classifier for predicting the infection severity levels with higher accuracy. At last, the testing outcomes exhibit that the multi-modal classifier establishes a higher efficiency than the standard classifier frameworks. ? 2022 Lavoisier.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the capacity of synthetic compounds to inhibit the Candida glabrata enzyme denominated 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (CgHMGR), and thus affect ergosterol synthesis and yeast viability. One series of synthetic antifungal compounds were analogues to fibrates, a second series had substituted 1,2-dihydroquinolines and the third series included substituted pyrroles. -asarone-related compounds 1c and 5b with a pyrrolic core were selected as the best antifungal candidates. Both inhibited the growth of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata 43 and fluconazole-susceptible C. glabrata CBS 138. A yeast growth rescue experiment based on the addition of exogenous ergosterol showed that the compounds act by inhibiting the mevalonate synthesis pathway. A greater recovery of yeast growth occurred for the C. glabrata 43 strain and after the 1c (versus 5b) treatment. Given that the compounds decreased the ergosterol concentration in the yeast strains, they probably target the ergosterol synthesis. According to the docking analysis, the inhibitory effect of the 1c and 5b could possibly be mediated by their interaction with the amino acid residues of the catalytic site of CgHMGR. Since 1c displayed higher binding energy than -asarone and 5b, it is a good candidate for further research, which should include structural modifications to increase its specificity and potency as well as in vivo studies on its effectiveness at a therapeutic dose. HIGHLIGHTS Fibrate-based and pyrrole-containing compounds were tested as C. glabrata inhibitors. The best inhibitor from fibrate was 1c and from pyrroles was 5b. These agents inhibited C. glabrata growth better than the reference antifungals. They also inhibited ergosterol synthesis by the two C. glabrata strains tested.

There has not been much work to develop a framework that incorporates these important and clinically relevant risk factors into a comprehensive model for CVD research. Moreover, the data labeling required to do so, such as annotating gene functions, is an extremely challenging, tedious, and time-consuming process. In this work, our goal was to develop and validate a risk factor embedding model, which incorporates genotype, phenotype without pre-labeled information to identify various risk factors of CVD. We hypothesize that (1) the knowledge background that does not require data labeling could be gathered from published abstract data, (2) the phenotype, genotype risk factors could be represented in an embedding vector space. We collected 1,363,682 published abstracts from PubMed using the keyword \\"heart\\" and 19,264 human gene names, then trained our model using the collected abstracts.

To understand possible ramifications of these delays, we examined the association between time to surgery (TTS), pathological staging and overall survival (OS). STUDY DESIGN: Patients with DCIS or ER+ cT1-2N0 breast cancer treated 2010-2016 were identified in the National Cancer Database. TTS was recorded. Factors associated with pathological upstaging were examined using logistic regression analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze OS. Analyses were stratified by disease stage and initial treatment strategy. RESULTS: 378,839 patients were identified. Among those undergoing primary surgery, TTS was within 120 days in >98% in all groups. Among cT1-2N0 patients selected for NET, surgery was performed within 120 days in 59.6% of cT1N0 and 30.9% of cT2N0 patients. Increased TTS was associated with increased odds of pathological upstaging in DCIS patients (ER+: 60-120 days: OR:1.15, 95% CI:1.08-1.22; >120 days: OR:1.44, 95% CI:1.24-1.68; ER-: 60-120 days: NS; >120 days: OR:1.36, 95% CI:1.01-1.82; <60 days: reference), but not in patients with invasive cancer irrespective of initial treatment strategy. No difference in OS was seen by TTS in DCIS or NET patients. CONCLUSION: Increased TTS was associated with a small increase in pathological upstaging in DCIS patients, but did not impact OS. In patients with cT1-2N0 disease, NET use did not impact stage or OS, supporting the safety of delay strategies in ER+ breast cancer patients during the pandemic.","output":"Association between Time to Operation and Pathological Stage in Ductal Carcinoma in Situ and Early-Stage Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treatment failures with artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) threaten global efforts to eradicate malaria.

Mutations in PfATP6 resulted in fitness costs that were ameliorated in the presence of artemisinin derivatives when studied in the yeast model. As previously hypothesized, PfATP6 is a target of artemisinins. Mammalian SERCA1a can be mutated to become more susceptible to artemisinins. The inexpensive, low-technology yeast screening platform has identified unrelated classes of druggable PfATP6 inhibitors.

TcdA and TcdB bind to target cells and are internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Translocation of the toxins enzyme subunits from early endosomes into the cytosol depends on acidification of endosomal vesicles, which is a prerequisite for the formation of transmembrane channels. The enzyme subunits of the toxins translocate into the cytosol via these channels where they are released after auto-proteolytic cleavage. Once in the cytosol, both toxins target small GTPases of the Rho/Ras-family and inactivate them by mono-glucosylation. This in turn interferes with actin-dependent processes and ultimately leads to the breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier and inflammation. So far, therapeutic approaches to treat CDAD are insufficient, since conventional antibiotic therapy does not target the bacterial protein toxins, which are the causative agents for the clinical symptoms. Thus, directly targeting the exotoxins represents a promising approach for the treatment of CDAD. Lately, it was shown that ambroxol (Ax) prevents acidification of intracellular organelles. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Ax on the cytotoxic activities of TcdA and TcdB. Ax significantly reduced toxin-induced morphological changes as well as the glucosylation of Rac1 upon intoxication with TcdA and TcdB. Most surprisingly, Ax, independent of its effects on endosomal acidification, decreased the toxins intracellular enzyme activity, which is mediated by a catalytic glucosyltransferase domain. Considering its undoubted safety profile, Ax might be taken into account as therapeutic option in the context of CDAD.","output":"Inhibition of Clostridioides difficile Toxins TcdA and TcdB by Ambroxol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Podophyllum sinense (P. sinense) has been used as a traditional herbal medicine for ages due to its extensive pharmaceutical activities, including antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, insecticidal effects, etc. Nevertheless, the specific bioactive constituents responsible for its antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities remain elusive, owing to its complicated and diversified chemical components. In order to explore these specific bioactive components and their potential interaction targets, affinity ultrafiltration with multiple drug targets coupled with high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UFCHPLC/MS) strategy was developed to rapidly screen out and identify bioactive compounds against four well-known drug targets that are correlated to the application of P. sinense as a traditional medicine, namely, Topo I, Topo II, COX-2, and ACE2. As a result, 7, 10, 6, and 7 phytochemicals were screened out as the potential Topo I, Topo II, COX-2, and ACE2 ligands, respectively. Further confirmation of these potential bioactive components with antiproliferative and COX-2 inhibitory assays in vitro was also implemented. Herein, diphyllin and podophyllotoxin with higher EF values demonstrated higher inhibitory rates against A549 and HT-29 cells as compared with those of 5-FU and etoposide. The IC(50) values of diphyllin were calculated at 6.46  1.79 and 30.73  0.56 M on A549 and HT-29 cells, respectively.

This study explored health care workers' experience of prolonged PPE use in clinical practice settings and their concerns regarding PPE supply, effectiveness and training needs. DESIGN: A descriptive cross\\\\sectional design was adopted in this study. METHODS: Health care workers (N = 592) from an acute care hospital completed an online survey from July to September 2020 assessing: (i) usage frequencies, side effects and interference with patient care; and (ii) perceptions of access to PPE, likelihood of exposure to infection and adequacy of PPE training. RESULTS: PPE\\\\related side effects were reported by 319 (53.8%) participants, the majority being nurses (88.4%) and those working in high\\\\risk areas such as the emergency department (39.5%), respiratory wards (acute 22.3% and non\\\\acute 23.8%) and COVID\\\\19 isolation ward (13.8%). The average time wearing PPE per shift was 6.8 h (SD 0.39). The most commonly reported symptoms were from donning N95 masks and included: pressure injuries (45.5%), mask\\\\induced acne (40.4%) and burning/pain (24.5%). Some 31.3% expressed that PPE\\\\related side effects had negatively affected their work. The odds of having PPE\\\\associated side effects was higher in women (OR 2.10, 95% CI [1.29C03.42], p = .003) and those working in high\\\\risk wards (OR 3.12, 95% CI [2.17C4.60], p < .001]. Most (90.1%) agreed that PPE supplies were readily available, sufficient for all (86.1%) and there was sufficient training in correct PPE use (93.6%). Only 13.7% of participants reported being highly confident of overall PPE protection. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention and management of PPE\\\\related adverse effects is vital to: preserve the integrity of PPE, improve adherence and minimize viral transmission. IMPACT: The high incidence of PPE\\\\associated pressure injuries and perception that PPE use can interfere with clinical care should inform future development of PPE products, and strategies to better equip health care workers to prevent and manage PPE\\\\related side effects.","output":"Health care workers' experience of personal protective equipment use and associated adverse effects during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic response in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, self-isolation at home was adopted to control the spread of COVID-19 in China for 3 months from 29 January 2020. The psychological status of cancer survivors is affected by their social environment. In this study, we investigated the psychological status and psychological symptoms of Chinese cancer survivors. METHODS: A longitudinal study design was adopted, and an online sample of cancer survivors was successfully recruited via the Internet communities of cancer support groups. From 14 February to 25 May, 111 cancer survivor families completed the symptom checklist 90 (SCL-90) online three times (T1:14 to 24 February; T2: 1 to 10 April; T3: 15 to 25 May). RESULTS: For survivors and their family members, the mean total score of the SCL-90 was 172.05 (13.30) and 142.76 (26.80) at T1, 155.91 (12.18) and 133.42 (15.93) at T2, and 142.75 (11.56) and 130.14 (14.16) at T3, respectively. The SCL-90 scores of cancer survivors were significantly higher than those of family members and Chinese norms at T1, T2, and T3. Nine psychological symptoms of the SCL-90 in cancer survivors significantly declined from T1 to T2 and T3.

They are the guarantee of the basic structures and functions in organisms, and they store information related to biological factors and processes such as blood type, gestation, growth, and apoptosis. The environment and genetics jointly affect important physiological processes such as reproduction, cell division, and protein synthesis. Genes are related to a wide range of phenomena including growth, decline, illness, aging, and death. During the evolution of organisms, there is a class of genes that exist in a conserved form in multiple species. These genes are often located on the dominant strand of DNA and tend to have higher expression levels. The protein encoded by it usually either performs very important functions or is responsible for maintaining and repairing these essential functions. Such genes are called persistent genes. Among them, the irreplaceable part of the bodys life activities is the essential gene. For example, when starch is the only source of energy, the genes related to starch digestion are essential genes. Without them, the organism will die because it cannot obtain enough energy to maintain basic functions. The function of the proteins encoded by these genes is thought to be fundamental to life. Nowadays, DNA can be extracted from blood, saliva, or tissue cells for genetic testing, and detailed genetic information can be obtained using the most advanced scientific instruments and technologies. The information gained from genetic testing is useful to assess the potential risks of disease, and to help determine the prognosis and development of diseases. Such information is also useful for developing personalized medication and providing targeted health guidance to improve the quality of life. Therefore, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to identify important and essential genes. In this paper, the research status of essential genes and the essential genome database of bacteria are reviewed, the computational prediction method of essential genes based on communication coding theory is expounded, and the significance and practical application value of essential genes are discussed.","output":"Research on the Computational Prediction of Essential Genes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To evaluate pregnancy outcomes in a real-world setting of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using the ultra-long-acting insulin analog degludec compared to other long-acting insulin analogs throughout pregnancy. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. The prospective cohort included consecutive, singleton pregnant women with type 1 diabetes receiving long-acting insulin analogs both before and during pregnancy: 67 women using degludec compared to 95 women using other long-acting insulin analogs in a routine care setting. RESULTS: Women using degludec had similar clinical characteristics as women using other long-acting insulin analogs including HbA1c at 9 gestational weeks [6.5 (6.2C6.9) % (48 (44C52) mmol/mol) versus 6.5 (6.0C7.0) % (47 (42C53) mmol/mol), p = 0.52] and at 35 gestational weeks [6.0 (5.6C6.5) % (42 (38C47) mmol/mol) versus 6.1 (5.6C6.5) % (43 (38C48) mmol/mol), p = 0.68]. Pregnancy outcomes were similar regarding preeclampsia [10% (7/67) versus 8% (8/95), p = 0.66] and preterm delivery before 37 gestational weeks [16% (11/67) versus 23% (22/95), p = 0.29]. There were no perinatal deaths, and neonatal outcomes as large for gestational age infants [37% (25/67) versus 39% (37/95), p = 0.83], small for gestational age infants [4% (3/67) versus 5% (5/95), p = 1.0] and neonatal hypoglycemia [32% (21/65) versus 41% (34/83), p = 0.28] were similar between women using degludec and other long-acting insulin analogs.

However, the health burden has been largely felt in communities involving racial and ethnic minorities. Thus, in order to provide a clearer picture of what is happening in Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities, we examined the racial/ethnic differences of monthly COVID-19 deaths in Connecticut. METHODS: This is an epidemiological study analyzing mortality data from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, obtained from the Connecticut State Department of Public Health. The data include cause of death (COVID-19 death identified by ICD-10 code U071), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White (White), non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Hispanic), sex, and age. Both crude and age-adjusted rates were reported by racial/ethnic groups. To compare age-adjusted rates between racial groups, with estimated age-adjusted death counts as outcomes, between-racial group rate ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p values significant at < 0.05 were derived from the Poisson regression model. RESULTS: From March 2020 to May 2020 (wave 1) of COVID-19 cases, the COVID-19-related mortality rates were the highest for all three race groups (Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics) with statistical group differences (p < 0.05). Blacks had the highest rates of deaths followed by Hispanics and then Whites. Further, more Whites died in a nursing home when compared to Blacks and Hispanics. From June 2010 to October 2020 (wave 2), COVID-19 mortality declined significantly for all three race groups with no statistical differences between groups. COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes declined for all three racial/ethnic groups. From November 2020 to February 2021 (wave 3), COVID-19 mortality rates were significantly higher compared to wave 2 but lower than wave 1 for all three race groups. The mortality rates for Blacks and Hispanics were higher than Whites. Hispanics had the highest rates of deaths, followed by Blacks, and then Whites (p < 0.05). Whites showed the lowest mortality rates among all three racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, COVID-19 health disparities among Black and Hispanic populations were evident in this study. Blacks and Hispanics had significantly higher mortality rates when compared to Whites. Blacks had the highest mortality rates during wave 1, and in wave 3, Hispanics has the highest mortality rates. Our data are important because they show monthly COVID-19 deaths data by race.

A key parameter in these ABMs is the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19. Many published COVID-19 ABMs use either single point or age-specific estimates of the probability of hospitalization for agents with COVID-19, omitting key factors: comorbidities and testing status (i.e., received vs. did not receive COVID-19 test). These omissions can inhibit interpretability, particularly by stakeholders seeking to use an ABM for transparent decision-making. We introduce a straightforward yet novel application of Bayes theorem with inputs from aggregated hospital data to better incorporate these factors in an ABM. We update input parameters for a North Carolina COVID-19 ABM using this approach, demonstrate sensitivity to input data selections, and highlight the enhanced interpretability and accuracy of the method and the predictions. We propose that even in tumultuous scenarios with limited information like the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, straightforward approaches like this one with discrete, attainable inputs can improve ABMs to better support stakeholders.","output":"Enhancing the prediction of hospitalization from a COVID-19 agent-based model: A Bayesian method for model parameter estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper proposed a quarantine-susceptible-exposed-infectious-resistant (QSEIR) model which considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measures in almost the whole of China to resist the epidemic. We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.","output":"Modeling the situation of COVID-19 and effects of different containment strategies in China with dynamic differential equations and parameters estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work reports the actual ground conditions prevalent at a fish landing centre in Northern Odisha, namely, Talsari in the aftermath of the cyclone Yaas, which made a landfall on May 26th, 2021.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who had a positive test for COVID-19 performed at a single quaternary care center from 1/20/2020 through 5/8/2020. In a subset of patients undergoing abdominal CT as part of the initial evaluation, the demographics, suspected COVID-19 status at the time of scan, presenting complaints, and abdominal CT findings were recorded. Cardiothoracic radiologists reviewed and scored the visualized lung bases for the likelihood of COVID-19. RESULTS: Only 43 (4.1%) of 1057 COVID-19 patients presented with abdominal complaints sufficient to warrant an abdominal CT. Of these 43 patients, the vast majority (39, 91%) were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of the scan. Most (27/43, 63%) scans showed no acute abdominal abnormality, and those that were positive did not share a discernable pattern of abnormalities. Lung base abnormalities were common, and there was moderate inter-reviewer reliability. CONCLUSION: A minority of COVID-19 patients present with abdominal complaints sufficient to warrant a dedicated CT of the abdomen, and most of these studies will be negative or have abdominal findings not associated with COVID-19. Appropriate lung base findings are a more consistent indication of COVID-19 infection than abdominal findings.","output":"Abdominal CT in COVID-19 patients: incidence, indications, and findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) and identify the risk factors associated with symptomatic or severe disease defined as hospital admission, intensive care admission or death. METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (March 2020CMarch 2021). All pediatric patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinics of six tertiary referral hospitals in Madrid, Spain, with a diagnosis of RMD and COVID-19 were included. Main outcomes were symptomatic disease and hospital admission. The covariates were sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and treatment regimens. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess associated factors for outcomes. RESULTS: The study population included 77 pediatric patients. Mean age was 11.88 (4.04) years Of these, 30 patients (38.96%) were asymptomatic, 41 (53.25%) had a mild-moderate COVID-19 and 6 patients (7.79%) required hospital admission. The median length of hospital admission was 5 (2C20) days, one patient required intensive care and there were no deaths. Previous comorbidities increased the risk for symptomatic disease and hospital admission. Compared with outpatients, the factor independently associated with hospital admission was previous use of glucocorticoids (OR 3.51; p = 0.00). No statistically significant risk factors for symptomatic COVID-19 were found in the final model.

The pandemic has already infected more than one hundred and three million people, killing about two and a quarter million of them. Recently, several vaccines to inoculate people against the ongoing pandemic have been approved. People in most of the countries are being injected with these vaccines. While the world awaits for the outcome of the ongoing vaccinations, a more aggressive strain of coronavirus is killing many people in several countries, including the UK, the USA, Netherland, South Africa, and Australia. The ongoing pandemic has severely affected almost all aspects of our lives; education being one of them.

METHODS: A prospective observational study involving 180 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 group) or suspected and ruled out COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19 group). Clinical evaluation and flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) were performed between the first 24-48 hours of hospitalization. Patients were followed until death or discharge. RESULTS: We evaluated 98 patients (COVID-19 group) and 82 (Non-COVID-19 group), COVID-19 group remained hospitalized longer and more deaths occurred compared to the Non-COVID-19 group (p = 0.01; and p<0.01). Patients in COVID-19 group also had a significantly greater reduction in both FMDmm and FMD% (p<0.01 in both).

One of the key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction is the effective handling of customer complaints, which is defined as the customers expressing their dissatisfaction with unmet expectations and unsatisfied needs verbally or in writing. The concept of a complaint as a response of customers dissatisfaction with the products and services they experience is an invaluable feedback mechanism for businesses to resolve issues relating to their products and services. Aim C The aim of this chapter is to emphasise the importance of the concept of complaint as an important part of customer relations management and an effective marketing tool for the tourism sector. As a service sub-sector, the simultaneous production and consumption of services in the tourism sector ensures customer satisfaction more than concrete products, due to their inseparable nature. For this reason, handling, evaluating and finalising customer complaints has an important function and value in providing the necessary information for tourism enterprises to become aware of their deficiencies and mistakes. Complaint management has started to play an even more critical role for the tourism industry in preventing customer losses due to dissatisfaction, especially considering the shrinkage in demand in the sector due to the COVID19 pandemic. Method C Firstly the concept of complaint and the importance of complaints for businesses were explained, customer complaint behaviour and the factors affecting this behaviour were examined in detail, the concept of online complaint was mentioned and the subject was evaluated in terms of tourism businesses. Results C While the effective management and resolution of complaints should be seen as a goal by every tourism business, it is vital that they understand customer complaint behaviours, the factors affecting this behaviour and how complaints should be managed in a way that will result in favour of the business. Conclusion C A complaint management process that enables customers to easily report their complaints to businesses and produces solutions as soon as possible will positively affect customer satisfaction. In this context, in order to reduce the negative effects on tourism enterprises, especially through the pandemic, business need to have clear and easy-to-access procedures, provide a quick response, show reliability and consistency in providing a solution, keeping the complainant informed of progress, have employees who can communicate with empathy and courtesy, have enough employees to deal with the situation, and adopt proactive approaches to prevent complaints rather than reducing the volume of complaints. Originality/Value C This research contributes to the literature in terms of complaining behaviour, examining the factors affecting this behaviour and emphasising the importance of the concept of complaints in the tourism sector. In addition, the research is important in terms of examining the contributions of an effective complaint management system in reducing the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector, which is one of the sectors mostly affected on a global scale. ? 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Consumer complaints and complaint management in the tourism sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Reducing harmful oral hygiene practices can minimize the negative impacts of periodontal diseases Transgenders are among the most vulnerable groups Knowledge of their oral hygiene awareness, attitude and behaviour shall help in improving their oral health and also in planning oral health strategies specific to this group Aim: To explore the oral hygiene-related knowledge, attitude and practices of transgenders residing in the Bhubaneswar during COVID-19 Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the transgenders residing in Bhubaneswar using a self-structured questionnaire containing questions on knowledge, attitude and practices related to oral hygiene Mann-Whitney U test was applied to find any significant differences between different variables in groups","output":"Knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards oral hygiene of transgenders in Bhubaneswar during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was to investigate the CT quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia and its impacts on the assessment of disease severity and the prediction of clinical outcomes in the management of COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS METHODS: Ninety-nine COVID-19 patients who were confirmed by positive nucleic acid test (NAT) of RT-PCR and hospitalized from January 19, 2020 to February 19, 2020 were collected for this retrospective study. All patients underwent arterial blood gas test, routine blood test, chest CT examination, and physical examination on admission. In addition, follow-up clinical data including the disease severity, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes were collected for each patient. Lung volume, lesion volume, nonlesion lung volume (NLLV) (lung volume - lesion volume), and fraction of nonlesion lung volume (%NLLV) (nonlesion lung volume / lung volume) were quantified in CT images by using two U-Net models trained for segmentation of lung and COVID-19 lesions in CT images. Furthermore, we calculated 20 histogram textures for lesions volume and NLLV, respectively. To investigate the validity of CT quantification in the management of COVID-19, we built random forest (RF) models for the purpose of classification and regression to assess the disease severity (Moderate, Severe, and Critical) and to predict the need and length of ICU stay, the duration of oxygen inhalation, hospitalization, sputum NAT-positive, and patient prognosis. The performance of RF classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and that of RF regressors using the root-mean-square error. RESULTS: Patients were classified into three groups of disease severity: moderate (na?=a?25), severe (na?=a?47) and critical (na?=a?27), according to the clinical staging. Of which, a total of 32 patients, 1 (1/25) moderate, 6 (6/47) severe, and 25 critical (25/27), respectively, were admitted to ICU. The median values of ICU stay were 0, 0, and 12 days, the duration of oxygen inhalation 10, 15, and 28 days, the hospitalization 12, 16, and 28 days, and the sputum NAT-positive 8, 9, and 13 days, in three severity groups, respectively. The clinical outcomes were complete recovery (na?=a?3), partial recovery with residual pulmonary damage (na?=a?80), prolonged recovery (na?=a?15), and death (na?=a?1). The %NLLV in three severity groups were 92.18  9.89%, 82.94  16.49%, and 66.19  24.15% with p value <0.05 among each two groups. The AUCs of RF classifiers using hybrid models were 0.927 and 0.929 in classification of moderate vs (severea?+a?critical), and severe vs critical, respectively, which were significantly higher than either radiomics models or clinical models (p < 0.05). The root-mean-square errors of RF regressors were 0.88 weeks for prediction of duration of hospitalization (mean: 2.60  1.01 weeks), 0.92 weeks for duration of oxygen inhalation (mean: 2.44  1.08 weeks), 0.90 weeks for duration of sputum NAT-positive (mean: 1.59  0.98 weeks), and 0.69 weeks for stay of ICU (mean: 1.32  0.67 weeks), respectively. The AUCs for prediction of ICU treatment and prognosis (partial recovery vs prolonged recovery) were 0.945 and 0.960, respectively.

Two cohorts (with ISA51 or SWE01 as adjuvants) of 26 female MRL/lpr were divided in parallel groups, controls (not treated, PBS and Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin [KLH] groups) or IFN-K and followed up for 122 days. Eight-week-old mice received intra-muscular injections (days 0, 7, 28, 56 and 84) of PBS, KLH or IFN-K, emulsified in the appropriate adjuvant, and blood samples were serially collected. At sacrifice, surviving mice were euthanized and their organs were harvested for histopathological analysis (focus score in salivary/lacrimal glands) and IFN signature evaluation. SjS-like features were monitored. IFN-K induced a disease-modifying polyclonal anti-IFN antibody response in all treated mice with high IFN neutralization capacities, type 1 IFN signatures reduction and disease features (ocular and oral sicca syndrome, neuropathy, focus score, glandular production of BAFF) improvement, as reflected by the decrease in Murine Sj?grens Syndrome Disease Activity Index (MuSSDAI) modelled on EULAR Sj?grens Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI).

The ligand often binds in the RNA pocket to trigger structural changes or functions. Thus, it is essential to explore and visualize the RNA pocket to elucidate the structural and recognition mechanism for the RNA-ligand complex formation. RESULTS: In this work, we developed one user-friendly bioinformatics tool, RPocket. This database provides geometrical size, centroid, shape, secondary structure element for RNA pocket, RNA-ligand interaction information, and functional sites. We extracted 240 RNA pockets from 94 non-redundant RNA-ligand complex structures. We developed RPDescriptor to calculate the pocket geometrical property quantitatively. The geometrical information was then subjected to RNA-ligand binding analysis by incorporating the sequence, secondary structure, and geometrical combinations. This new approach takes advantage of both the atom-level precision of the structure and the nucleotide-level tertiary interactions. The results show that the higher-level topological pattern indeed improves the tertiary structure prediction. We also proposed a potential mechanism for RNA-ligand complex formation. The electrostatic interactions are responsible for long-range recognition, while the Van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts for short-range binding and optimization. These interaction pairs can be considered as distance constraints to guide complex structural modeling and drug design. CONCLUSION: RPocket database would facilitate RNA-ligand engineering to regulate the complex formation for biological or medical applications.

Although, its syndrome is quite similar to the ordinary flu. The critical step involved in Covid-19 is the initial screening or testing of the infected patients. As there are no special detection tools, the demand for such diagnostic tools has been increasing continuously. So, it is eminently admissible to find out positive cases of this disease at the earliest so that the spreading of this dangerous virus can be controlled. Although, some methods for the detection of Covid-19 patients are available, which are performed upon respiratory based samples and among them, a critical approach for treatment is radiologic imaging or X-ray imaging. The latest conclusions obtained from X-ray digital imaging based algorithms and techniques recommend that such type of digital images may consist of significant facts regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The utilization of Deep Neural Networks based methodologies clubbed with digital radiological imaging has been proved useful for accurately identifying this disease. This could also be adjuvant in conquering the problem of dearth of competent physicians in far-flung areas. In this paper, a CheXImageNet model has been introduced for detecting Covid-19 disease by using digital images of Chest X-ray with the help of an openly accessible dataset. Experiments for both binary class and multi-class have been performed in this work for benchmarking the effectiveness of the proposed work.

Simulation of clinical trials allows in silico exploration of the uncertainties of clinical trial design and can rapidly inform their protocols. We previously published a preliminary model of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further our understanding of COVID-19 and treatment we significantly updated the model by matching a curated dataset spanning viral load and immune responses in plasma and lung. We identified a population of parameter sets to generate heterogeneity in pathophysiology and treatment and tested this model against published reports from interventional SARS-CoV-2 targeting Ab and anti-viral trials. Upon generation and selection of a virtual population, we match both the placebo and treated responses in viral load in these trials. We extended the model to predict the rate of hospitalization or death within a population. Via comparison of the in silico predictions with clinical data, we hypothesize that the immune response to virus is log-linear over a wide range of viral load. To validate this approach, we show the model matches a published subgroup analysis, sorted by baseline viral load, of patients treated with neutralizing Abs. By simulating intervention at different timepoints post infection, the model predicts efficacy is not sensitive to interventions within five days of symptom onset, but efficacy is dramatically reduced if more than five days pass post-symptom onset prior to treatment.","output":"A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Model of the Pathophysiology and Treatment of COVID-19 Predicts Optimal Timing of Pharmacological Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans use rapid gaze shifts, known as saccades, to explore visual scenes. These movements yield abrupt luminance changes on the retina, which elicit robust neural discharges at fixation onsets. Yet little is known about the spatial content of saccade transients. Here, we show that saccades redistribute spatial information within the temporal range of retinal sensitivity following two distinct regimes: saccade modulations counterbalance (whiten) the spectral density of natural scenes at low spatial frequencies and follow the external power distribution at higher frequencies. This redistribution is a consequence of saccade dynamics, particularly the speed/amplitude/duration relation known as the main sequence. It resembles the redistribution resulting from inter-saccadic eye drifts, revealing a continuum in the modulations given by different eye movements, with oculomotor transitions primarily acting by regulating the bandwidth of whitening. Our findings suggest important computational roles for saccade transients in the establishment of spatial representations and lead to testable predictions about their consequences for visual functions and encoding mechanisms.","output":"Spatiotemporal Content of Saccade Transients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND There are very few available data on the novel SharkCore? needles for EUS-FNB.

This necessitates a remote examination of such patients without sacrificing information quality. RESEARCH QUESTION: The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system in examining patients with COVID-19 and to establish an examination protocol for telerobotic ultrasound scanning. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients with COVID-19 were included and divided into two groups. Twelve were nonsevere cases, and 11 were severe cases. All patients underwent a 5G-based robot-assisted remote ultrasound system examination of the lungs and heart following an established protocol. Distribution characteristics and morphology of the lung and surrounding tissue lesions, left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular area ratio, pericardial effusion, and examination-related complications were recorded. Bilateral lung lesions were evaluated by using a lung ultrasound score. RESULTS: The remote ultrasound system successfully and safely performed cardiopulmonary examinations of all patients. Peripheral lung lesions were clearly evaluated. Severe cases of COVID-19 had significantly more diseased regions (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 1.0 [0.0-2.8]) and higher lung ultrasound scores (12.0 [4.0-24.0] vs 2.0 [0.0-4.0]) than nonsevere cases of COVID-19 (both, P < .05). One nonsevere case (8.3%; 95% CI, 1.5-35.4) and three severe cases (27.3%; 95% CI, 9.7-56.6) were complicated by pleural effusions. Four severe cases (36.4%; 95% CI, 15.2-64.6) were complicated by pericardial effusions (vs 0% of nonsevere cases, P < .05). No patients had significant examination-related complications.

The use of prophylactic hydrocolloid dressings is one of the strategies that may improve comfort and reduce DRPI. In this study, we investigated the impact of these dressings on N95 respirator fit. METHODS: We performed a repeat quantitative fit testing through the Respiratory Protection Program on 134 healthcare workers (HCWs), who applied hydrocolloid dressings on the bridge of their nose under the N95 FFRs that they passed the initial fit test with, but reported discomfort with the FFR. RESULTS: With the hydrocolloid dressings in place, the fit-test pass rate for the semirigid cup style (3M 1860) was 94% (108 of 115); for the the vertical flat-fold style (BYD), the pass rate was 85% (44 of 52); for the duckbill style (BSN medical ProShield and Halyard Fluidshield), the pass rate was 81% (87 of 108); and for the 3-panel flat-fold style (3M Aura) N95 FFRs, the pass rate was 100% (3 of 3). There was a statistically significant reduction in the overall fit factors for both the vertical flat-fold and duckbill type N95 respirators after the application of hydrocolloid dressings.

Design - Prospective household community cohort study of COVID-19 infection (Virus Watch). Setting - Online survey of Virus Watch study participants in the community across England and Wales. Participants - Individuals could enrol in Virus Watch if all household members agreed to participate and at least one household member had access to the internet, an email address, and could read English. All Virus Watch participants aged 16 years and over who responded to questions relating to COVID-19 vaccine intention in questionnaires between December 2020 and February 2021 were included in this analysis.

Mycobacteria spp., however, are well known for their numerous immune evasion mechanisms that limit the true potential of their therapeutic use. One such major mechanism is the induction of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which mitigates adaptive immune responses. Here, we sought to unravel the molecular pathways behind PD-L1 up-regulation on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by BCG. We found that infection of APCs with BCG induced PD-L1 up-regulation, but that this did not depend on direct infection, suggesting a soluble mediator for this effect. BCG induced potent quantities of IL-6 and IL-10, and the downstream transcription factor STAT3 was hyper-phosphorylated. Intracellular analyses revealed that levels of PD-L1 molecules were associated with the STAT3 phosphorylation state, suggesting a causal link. Neutralisation of the IL-6 or IL-10 cytokine receptors dampened STAT3 phosphorylation and BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1 on APCs. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 achieved the same effect, confirming an autocrine-paracrine cytokine loop as a mechanism for BCG-mediated up-regulation of PD-L1. Finally, an in vivo immunisation model showed that BCG vaccination under PD-L1 blockade could enhance antigen-specific memory CD4 T-cell responses. These novel findings could lead to refinement of BCG as both a vaccine for infectious disease and as a cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Bacillus Calmette-Gurin Induces PD-L1 Expression on Antigen-Presenting Cells via Autocrine and Paracrine Interleukin-STAT3 Circuits"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an outbreak of diarrhea among 82 artificially reared red deer calves, 56 developed the disease and 20 subsequently died.

The loss of control in trafficking these cells contributes to inflammatory diseases. Leukocyte recruitment is a well-orchestrated process that includes several protein families including the large cytokine subfamily of chemotactic cytokines, the chemokines. Chemokines and their receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from clinical events including major surgery, trauma, multiple transfusions, severe burns, pancreatitis, and sepsis. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome involves activation of alveolar macrophages and sequestered neutrophils in the lung. The clinical hallmarks of ARDS are severe hypoxemia, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and normal intracardiac filling pressures. The magnitude and duration of the inflammatory process may ultimately determine the outcome in patients with ARDS. Recent evidence shows that activated leukocytes and chemokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS.

Videos are especially challenging for this kind of methods, since real-time decompression requires highly efficient algorithms. Dedicated inpainting-based video codecs have so far focused on efficient frame-by-frame reconstruction without exploiting redundancies in time. As a remedy, we propose a modular framework that combines a classical prediction and correction approach with suitable structures for fully inpainting-based methods. The core idea of these techniques is to store values only at a small number of positions, and reconstruct missing regions via inpainting. Our generic framework supports any algorithm that generates such sparse representations. As a concrete demonstrator, we provide a prototypical implementation of our framework by supplementing all modules with methods based on partial differential equations (PDEs): Dense variational optic flow fields yield accurate motion-compensated predictions, while homogeneous diffusion inpainting and pseudodifferential equations are applied as intra prediction and residual compression techniques. With these components, we are able to outperform other inpainting-based video codecs in terms of quality and speed.

Here, we report on an in-house optimization of a modified version of the ARTIC Network V4 protocol that improves SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery in instances where the original V4 pooling strategy was characterized by amplicon drop-offs. METHODS: We utilized a matched set of 43 clinical samples and serially diluted positive controls that were amplified by ARTIC V3, V4 and optimized V4 primers and sequenced using GridION from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies'. RESULTS: We observed a 0.5% to 46% increase in genome recovery in 67% of the samples when using the original V4 pooling strategy compared to the V3 primers. Amplicon drop-offs at primer positions 23 and 90 were observed for all variants and positive controls. When using the optimized protocol, we observed a 60% improvement in genome recovery across all samples and an increase in the average depth in amplicon 23 and 90. Consequently, 95% of the genome was recovered in 72% (n = 31) of the samples. However, only 60C70% of the genomes could be recovered in samples that had <28% genome coverage with the ARTIC V3 primers. There was no statistically significant (p > 0.05) correlation between Ct value and genome recovery.

Participants1,035,163 people aged 18-100 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the national surveillance programme, and had an infection identified as either Omicron- or Delta compatible. Main outcome measuresDeath involving COVID-19 as identified from death certification records. The exposure of interest was the SARS-CoV-2 variant identified from NHS Test and Trace PCR positive tests taken in the community (pillar 2) and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Cause-specific Cox proportional hazard regression models were adjusted for sex, age, vaccination status, previous infection, calendar time, ethnicity, Index of Multiple Deprivation rank, household deprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, main language, region, disability, and comorbidities. Additionally, we tested for interactions between variant and sex, age, vaccination status and comorbidities. ResultsThe risk of death involving COVID-19 was 67% lower for Omicron compared to Delta and the reduction in the risk of death involving COVID-19 for Omicron compared to Delta was more pronounced in males than in females and in people under 70 years old than in people aged 70 years or over. Regardless of age, reduction of the risk of death from Omicron relative to Delta more was more pronounced in people who had received a booster than in those having received only two doses. ConclusionsOur results support early work showing the relative reduction in severity of Omicron compared to Delta in terms of hospitalisation and extends this research to assess COVID-19 mortality. Our work also highlights the importance of the vaccination booster campaign, where the reduction in risk of death involving COVID-19 is most pronounced in individuals who had received a booster. What is already known on this topicThe Omicron variant, which refers to the whole lineage (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3) had already been shown to be more transmissible than the Delta variant, but there is emerging evidence suggests that the risk of hospitalisation and risk of death within 28 days after a SARS-COV-2 test is lower. However, with a highly transmissible infection and high levels of population testing, definition of death within 28 days is more likely to be susceptible to misclassification bias due to asymptomatic or co-incidental infection. There is no study so far comparing the risk of COVID-19 death as identified from death certification records, with the cause of death assessed by the physician who attended the patient in the last illness. What this study addsUsing data from a large cohort of COVID-19 infections that occurred in December 2021, we examined the difference in the risk COVID-19 death, as identified from death certification records, between the Delta and Omicron BA.1 variant. Our study shows that risk of death involving COVID-19 was reduced by 67% following infection with the Omicron BA.1 variant relative to the Delta variant after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including vaccination status and comorbidities. Importantly, we found that the relative risk of COVID-19 mortality following Omicron versus Delta infection varied by age and sex, with lower relative risk in younger individuals and for males than females.

SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in esophageal cells and enterocytes, leading to direct damage to the intestinal epithelium. The infection decreases the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, thereby altering the composition of the gut microbiota.

This study frames the COVID-19 pandemic as an exacerbating threat to pulmonary health, and tests how e-cigarette users' risk perceptions of COVID-19 are related to different motives for vaping and ultimately the intensity of e-cigarette use. METHODS an online survey of e-cigarette users in the U.S. (n=562) was conducted during April 2020 when much of the U.S. was under \\"lockdown\\" conditions. We distinguished three types of vaping motives (health, socialization, and dependence) and established the classification with confirmatory factor analysis. Structural equation modeling was conducted for path analyses and mediation tests. RESULTS all three vaping motives were significantly associated with greater use intensity. A heightened risk perception of e-cigarette users' vulnerability to COVID-19 was inversely associated with use intensity (-.18, p<.01) and health motives for vaping (-.27, p<.001), but not associated with socialization and dependence motivations. Health motives for vaping mediated 35% of the association between COVID-19 risk perceptions and use intensity. CONCLUSIONS our findings indicate that risk perceptions of exacerbated threats may reduce e-cigarette use directly, and also indirectly through shifting certain types of motivations for vaping. Beyond elucidating the relational dynamics between vaping psychology and health risks, these results also indicate health professionals may leverage the pandemic to promote nicotine cessation or reduced use. IMPLICATION Little is known about how vaping motives shift after unanticipated events such as pandemics. This study contributes to knowledge of how the use of e-cigarettes is motivated by different dimensions of rationales and exogenous risks. Exploiting the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found risk perceptions are associated with the intensity of e-cigarette use indirectly specifically through health motivations. Risk perceptions are not associated with socialization and dependence motives for vaping.","output":"Vaping in a Time of Pandemics: Risk Perception and Motivations for Electronic Cigarette Use."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus, significantly impacting Germany among other countries since its emergence. Because of heterogeneous symptoms and a subset of patients even being asymptomatic at presentation, fast identification of infected patients remains challenging. Objective: The goal of this study is the evaluation of different patient groups with a focus on symptoms and pre-existing illness at admission, as this is important for initial assessment and adequate emergency care. Methods: COVID-19 positive patients at the University Hospital Heidelberg were retrospectively analyzed for disease history and symptoms at the initial presentation as well as mortality. The authors obtained institutional review board (IRB) approval by the Ethics Committee (Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University) prior to commencing the study. Results: Dyspnea was more common in patients admitted to intermediate care/intensive care units (48 vs 13%, P<0.001) and showed a significantly higher percentage in the deceased (91 vs 48%, P=0.004). The symptoms of all presenting patients were highly variable, and many manifestations commonly associated with COVID-19 like cough, fever, and sore throat were only detected in a subset of patients, 60%, 43%, and 33%, respectively. Conclusion: Dyspnea was present significantly more often in patients dying of COVID-19 compared to all patients admitted to the IMC/ICU, necessitating adequate observation and monitoring. In all presenting patients, initial symptoms showed large variation; therefore, COVID should be considered as a main differential diagnosis at every patient presentation, and patients with high pre-test probability should, if possible, be isolated until testing results are known.","output":"Analysis of Symptoms of COVID-19 Positive Patients and Potential Effects on Initial Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Winery and olive mill industries generate large amounts of wastes causing important environmental problems.

Type I interferon response to ZIKV infection in host cells suppresses viral replication by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). METHODS: The study aims to demonstrate the anti-ZIKV mechanism of PARP11. PARP11 knock out and overexpressing A549 cell lines were constructed to evaluate the anti-ZIKV function of PARP11. PARP11(?/?), PARP12(?/?) and PARP11(?/?)PARP12(?/?) HEK293T cell lines were constructed to explain the synergistic effect of PARP11 and PARP12 on NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. Western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation assay were performed to illustrate the interaction between PARP11 and PARP12. RESULTS: Both mRNA and protein levels of PARP11 were induced in WT but not IFNAR1(?/?) cells in response to IFN or IFN stimulation and ZIKV infection. ZIKV replication was suppressed in cells expressed PARP11 but was enhanced in PARP11(?/?) cells. PARP11 suppressed ZIKV independently on itself PARP enzyme activity. PARP11 interacted with PARP12 and promoted PARP12-mediated ZIKV NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. CONCLUSION: We identified ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP11 as an anti-ZIKV ISG and found that it cooperated with PARP12 to enhance ZIKV NS1 and NS3 protein degradation. Our findings have broadened the understanding of the anti-viral function of ADP-ribosyltransferase family members, and provided potential therapeutic targets against viral ZIKV infection.

ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the oral cavity, so this may be a potential high-risk route for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the virus can be detected in saliva, even before COVID-19 symptoms appear, with the consequent high risk of virus transmission in asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. Reducing oral viral load could lead to a lower risk of transmission via salivary droplets or aerosols and therefore contribute to the control of the pandemic. Our aim was to evaluate the available evidence testing the in-vitro and in-vivo effects of oral antiseptics to inactivate or eradicate coronaviruses. The criteria used were those described in the PRISMA declaration for performing systematic reviews. An electronic search was conducted in Medline (via PubMed) and in Web of Sciences, using the MeSH terms: 'mouthwash' OR 'oral rinse' OR 'mouth rinse' OR 'povidone iodine' OR 'hydrogen peroxide' OR 'cetylpyridinium chloride' AND 'COVID-19' OR 'SARS-CoV-2' OR 'coronavirus' OR 'SARS' OR 'MERS'. The initial search strategy identified 619 articles on two electronic databases. Seventeen articles were included assessing the virucidal efficacy of oral antiseptics against coronaviruses. In conclusion, there is sufficient in-vitro evidence to support the use of antiseptics to potentially reduce the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

Reflective practice provides an opportunity for individuals to learn through their experience as well as gaining insight into themselves and their practice. If completed effectively, it has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental well-being. Our aim therefore was to provide regular group reflective practice sessions with the aim of supporting junior doctor's mental wellbeing during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Junior doctors within a critical care setting were offered two-weekly group reflective practice sessions focusing on difficult or challenging cases and encounters. The sessions were offered to all junior and middle grade doctors within a critical care department in a small district general hospital. Consultants were also able to attend. The groups were facilitated by a consultant liaison psychiatrist and an accredited balint group leader. Critical care doctors were provided a feedback questionnaire assessing the impact of the sessions and the levels of stress and burnout. The themes emerging from the sessions were also explored. Result A total of six reflective practice sessions were offered during a three-month period. A total of four reflective practice sessions were completed;two sessions were cancelled due to high workload on the department. Each session lasted approximately 50mins. On average a total of 3-4 junior doctors attended each session. The sessions were conducted face to face in a socially distanced manner and with all participants wearing face masks. The sessions were predominately attended by foundation doctors and SHOs. There was occasional attendance by middle grades and a consultant. The predominant themes that emerged included: guilt, prolonged suffering, desensitisation, support and exhaustion. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and lockdown, many of the doctors also acknowledged the benefit of being at work during both waves of the pandemic. There was a sense of collectiveness and group belonging. The group found it beneficial to be able to share their experiences and challenges faced;this was most striking amongst the very junior members of the team. Questionnaires were also provided to gain additional insight into the wellbeing of the critical care doctors. Worryingly the results highlighted a significant proportion of doctors were experiencing signs of burnout including fatigue (77%), lack of energy (54%), cynicism (31%), frustration and irritability (45%) and detachment (38%). Many of the issues highlighted were in response to the demand created by the pandemic and a lack of medical staffing wth 69% of doctors requesting regular feedback on staffing issues. Conclusion Burnout and low morale were already highlighted in a significant number of junior doctors prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 has identified a clear need for NHS employers and medical leaders to provide emotional and psychological support to staff. It is vital that we create an open environment where individuals can express their feelings openly without fear that they will be judged. Group reflective practice provides an avenue to build on collectiveness created during both waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot has demonstrated that if introduced as part of a wellbeing support package, junior doctors within a critical care setting are able to utilise the sessions in an effective and productive manner.","output":"The introduction of regular group reflective practice sessions for junior doctors in a critical care setting during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic C a Pilot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photocatalysis for air treatment or photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is a relatively new technology which requires titanium dioxide (TiO2) and a source of light (Visible or near-UV) to degrade pollutants contained in air streams Present approaches for the photodegradation of indoor pollutants in air streams aim to eliminate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and viruses, which are both toxic and harmful to human health Photocatalysis for air treatment is an inexpensive and innovative green process Additionally, it is a technology with a reduced environmental footprint when compared to other conventional air treatments which demand significant energy, require the disposal of used materials, and release CO2 and other greenhouse gases to the environment This review discusses the most current and relevant information on photocatalysis for air treatment This article also provides a critical review of (1) the most commonly used TiO2-based semiconductors, (2) the experimental syntheses and the various photocatalytic organic species degradation conversions, (3) the developed kinetics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and (4) the proposed Quantum Yields (QYs) and Photocatalytic Thermodynamic Efficiency Factors (PTEFs) Furthermore, this article contains important information on significant factors affecting the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, such as reactor designs and type of photoreactor irradiation Overall, this review describes state-of-the-art photocatalysis for air treatment to eliminate harmful indoor organic molecules, reviewing as well the potential applications for the inactivation of SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) viruses","output":"Photocatalysis for Air Treatment Processes: Current Technologies and Future Applications for the Removal of Organic Pollutants and Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this research, we investigated the protection motivators and precautionary behaviors against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associations between them.

To face this global health emergency, health institutions have had to readjust their functioning while ensuring the continuity of care and protecting medical staff and patients. Our aim in this study was to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on family medicine and its practice in Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted during the period from June 30, 2020, to July 20, 2020, by posting an online survey on social media platforms (WhatsApp and Twitter) and emailing physicians individually to collect data on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family medicine and primary care practices during the period of lockdown in Saudi Arabia. Results A total of 382 primary healthcare (PHC) providers participated in the study (males: 213 (55.8%); females: 169 (44.2%)). The mean age and standard deviation of the population were 38.277.46. Most participants were from governmental health sectors. Participants revealed that they have a good level of knowledge regarding COVID-19. However, they indicated confusion regarding the knowledge due to changing recommendations or multiple-source information. Only 57.3% of respondents received relevant training on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The most frequently used PPE were surgical masks (100%) and gloves (98.4%). The highly protective N95 masks were used by only 55.7%. Many health care workers indicated a high rate of stress and anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic. Data obtained are suggestive that there was a reduction in outpatient visits and a reduction in consultation time. Canceled physical examinations of the patients during the consultation were encountered most of the time. There was no shortage of medications, nasopharyngeal swabs, or sanitizers. However, an occasional lack of PPEs occurred. 64.4% of the respondents used online consultations with their patients. A shortage of health care workers during the pandemic in family medicine clinics was encountered by 63.3% of the participants. Conclusion Family medicine practices are adversely affected by pandemics and lockdowns following them. It has been reported that COVID-19 interferes with preventive, chronic, and acute care visits and increases mental health visits. Outpatient visits have also decreased as well as the amount of time spent in consultations. In addition, the transition from in-person clinics to telemedicine has happened. Perhaps these changes will delay the diagnosis and prescription refills.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Medicine Practices in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background DNA mismatches can affect the efficiency of PCR techniques if the intended target has mismatches in primers or probes regions. The accepted rule is that mismatches are detrimental as they reduce the hybridization temperatures, yet a more quantitative assessment is rarely performed. Methods We calculate the hybridization temperatures of primer/probe sets after aligning to SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-1 and non-SARS genomes, considering all possible combinations of single, double and triple consecutive mismatches. We consider the mismatched hybridization temperature within a range of 5 C to the fully matched reference temperature. Results We obtained the alignments of 19 PCR primers sets that were recently reported for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and to 21665 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as 323 genomes of other viruses of the coronavirus family of which 10 are SARS-CoV-1. We find that many incompletely aligned primers become fully aligned to most of the SARS-CoV-2 when mismatches are considered. However, we also found that many cross-align to SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS genomes. Conclusions Some primer/probe sets only align substantially to most SARS-CoV-2 genomes if mismatches are taken into account. Unfortunately, by the same mechanism, almost 75% of these sets also align to some SARS-CoV-1 and non-SARS viruses. It is therefore recommended to consider mismatch hybridization for the design of primers whenever possible, especially to avoid undesired cross-reactivity.","output":"Thermodynamic evaluation of the impact of DNA mismatches in PCR-type SARS-CoV-2 primers and probes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The purpose of this study was to analyze the sequence of azurin gene in relation to its expression in Pseudomanas aeruginosa strains isolated from different clinical specimens of burn patients. Moreover, in silico sequence analysis of azurin gene using globally reported sequences was intended. Materials and Methods: Fifty-nine multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were selected from different clinical specimens of patients suffering from burn wound infections in two university hospitals and subjected to antibacterial susceptibility testing. The frequency and genetic diversity of the azurin gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. The azurin gene sequences were compared with the sequence data from other countries. The expression level of azurin gene in P. aeruginosa isolates with different azurin sequences from different clinical specimens was evaluated by real-time PCR. Results and Conclusion: About 98%-100% of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and imipenem, while 100% and 23.9% of the isolates were susceptible to colistin and ceftazidime, respectively. Only eight point mutations were detected with amino acid substitutions in only two positions (81 and 102). In global analysis, 93% of strains showed missense mutation at positions 81 (alanine to threonine). The majority (81%) of Iranian strains were allocated to two major clusters distinct from the rest of world, which may suggest that strains from Iran have made a distinct genetic stockpile through point mutations which has established them separate from the other counties. However, 19% were distributed in different clusters together with the strains from different countries of North and South America, Europe, South and East Asia. The expression level of the azurin gene was statistically higher in the isolates collected from the blood of burns patients with systemic infection compared to the isolates collected from other specimens (wound, catheter and tissue), which shows a positive correlation between azurin gene expression and increased pathogenicity and capability for dissemination. This study may open new insight about azurin genetic variation and significance in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.","output":"Global Sequence Analysis and Expression of Azurin Gene in Different Clinical Specimens of Burn Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A number of viruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), West Nile Virus (WNV), La Crosse Virus (LACV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), have the ability to gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) and cause severe neurological disease or death. Although encephalitis cases caused by these viruses are generally rare, there are relatively few treatment options available for patients with viral encephalitis other than palliative care. Many of these viruses directly infect neurons and can cause neuronal death. Thus, there is the need for the identification of useful therapeutic compounds that can inhibit virus replication in neurons or inhibit virus-induced neuronal cell death. In this paper, we describe the methodology to test compounds for their ability to inhibit virus-induced neuronal cell death. These protocols include the isolation and culturing of primary neurons; the culturing of neuroblastoma and neuronal stem cell lines; infection of these cells with viruses; treatment of these cells with selected drugs; measuring virus-induced cell death using MTT or XTT reagents; analysis of virus production from these cells; as well as the basic understanding in mode of action. We further show direct evidence of the effectiveness of these protocols by utilizing them to test the effectiveness of the polyphenol drug, Rottlerin, at inhibiting Zika virus infection and death of neuronal cell lines.","output":"Drug-Screening Strategies for Inhibition of Virus-Induced Neuronal Cell Death"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Currently nanomedicines are the focus of attention from researchers and clinicians because of the successes of lipid-nanoparticles-based COVID-19 vaccines. Nanoparticles improve existing treatments by providing a number of advantages including protection of cargo molecules from external stresses, delivery of drugs to target tissues, and sustained drug release. To prevent premature release-related side effects, stable drug loading in nanoformulations is required, but the increased stability of the formulation could also lead to a poor drug-release profile at the target sites. Thus, researchers have exploited differences in a range of properties (e.g., enzyme levels, pH, levels of reduced glutathione, and reactive oxygen species) between non-target and target sites for site-specific release of drugs. Among these environmental stimuli, pH gradients have been widely used to design novel, responsive nanoparticles. Area covered In this review, we assess drug delivery based on pH-responsive nanoparticles at the levels of tissues (tumor microenvironment, pH ~ 6.5) and of intracellular compartments (endosome and lysosome, pH 4.5C6.5). Upon exposure to these pH stimuli, pH-responsive nanoparticles respond with physicochemical changes to their material structure and surface characteristics. These changes include swelling, dissociation, or surface charge switching, in a manner that favors drug release at the target site (the tumor microenvironment region and the cytosol followed by endosomal escape) rather than the surrounding tissues.

However, due to the great volatility and uncertainty of natural wind, wind power also fluctuates, seriously affecting the reliability of wind power system and bringing challenges to large-scale grid connection of wind power. Wind speed prediction is very important to ensure the safety and stability of wind power generation system. In this paper, a new wind speed prediction scheme is proposed. First, improved hybrid mode decomposition is used to decompose the wind speed data into the trend part and the fluctuation part, and the noise is decomposed twice. Then wavelet analysis is used to decompose the trend part and the fluctuation part for the third time. The decomposed data are classified. The long- and short-term memory neural network optimized by the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to train the nonlinear sequence and noise sequence, and the autoregressive moving average model is used to train the linear sequence. Finally, the final prediction results were reconstructed. This paper uses this system to predict the wind speed data of China's Changma wind farm and Spain's Sotavento wind farm. By experimenting with the real data from two different wind farms and comparing with other predictive models, we found that (1) by improving the mode number selection in the variational mode decomposition, the characteristics of wind speed data can be better extracted. (2) According to the different characteristics of component data, the combination method is selected to predict modal components, which makes full use of the advantages of different algorithms and has good prediction effect. (3) The optimization algorithm is used to optimize the neural network, which solves the problem of parameter setting when establishing the prediction model. (4) The combination forecasting model proposed in this paper has clear structure and accurate prediction results. The research work in this paper will help to promote the development of wind energy prediction field, help wind farms formulate wind power regulation strategies, and further promote the construction of green energy structure.","output":"Optimization scheme of wind energy prediction based on artificial intelligence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that China had accumulated pneumonia of unclear etiology in Wuhan.

Samples were explanted 24 hours after surgery. Centered defects were created, and samples (either ten or eleven per fixation type) were loaded in a pressure chamber. For each sample, the pressure, the mesh displacement through the defect, and the measurements of the contact area were recorded. RESULTS At all pressures tested, the ProGrip? laparoscopic self-fixating mesh both exhibited a significantly lower displacement through the defect and retained a significantly higher percentage of its initial contact area than either the Bard? Soft Mesh with Tisseel? system or the Bard? Soft Mesh with SorbaFix? absorbable fixation system. Dislocations occurred with the Bard? Soft Mesh with Tisseel? system and with the Bard?

METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study conducted at the Spedali Civili General Hospital, in Brescia, Northern Italy during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic in the first semester of 2020. Serum samples from HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. An online survey was used to collect demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data. RESULTS: Of the 1893 HCWs included, 433 (22.9%) were found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (antibodies production or past positive RT-PCR on nasal/throat swab) was 25.1% (475/1893). Fifty-six out of 433 (13%) seropositive participants declared to have been asymptomatic during the study period. The development of COVID-19 signs or symptoms is the main determinant of seropositivity (OR: 11.3, p < 0.0001) along with their duration and severity. 40/290 (14.5%) HCWs with documented positive RT-PCR during the study period did not show any detectable antibody response. IgG levels positively correlate with age, COVID-19-compatible signs and symptoms experienced and their duration.

The Covid-19 crisis seems to mark the next stage in the evolution of the Semester. It connects the Semester with the wider Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and links its country-specific recommendations to conditional financial support. Thus, the next stage of the Semester suggests a stronger and more deliberate interlinkage of different EU tools that jointly guide national socioeconomic policies. It should support both national public investment and reforms while focusing on meeting the EU priority of moving towards a climate-neutral, digitalized, and resilient Europe (De la Porte & Dagnis Jensen, 2021).

METHODS A CNN model, previously published, was trained to predict atherosclerotic disease from ambulatory frontal CXRs. The model was then validated on two cohorts of patients with COVID-19: 814 ambulatory patients from a suburban location (presenting from March 14, 2020, to October 24, 2020, the internal ambulatory cohort) and 485 hospitalized patients from an inner-city location (hospitalized from March 14, 2020, to August 12, 2020, the external hospitalized cohort). The CNN model predictions were validated against electronic health record administrative codes in both cohorts and assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CXRs from the ambulatory cohort were also reviewed by two board-certified radiologists and compared with the CNN-predicted values for the same cohort to produce a receiver operating characteristic curve and the AUC. The atherosclerosis diagnosis discrepancy, vasc, referring to the difference between the predicted value and presence or absence of the vascular disease HCC categorical code, was calculated. Linear regression was performed to determine the association of vasc with the covariates of age, sex, race/ethnicity, language preference, and social deprivation index. Logistic regression was used to look for an association between the presence of any hierarchical condition category codes with vasc and other covariates. RESULTS The CNN prediction for vascular disease from frontal CXRs in the ambulatory cohort had an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.89) and in the hospitalized cohort had an AUC of 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.75) against the electronic health record data. In the ambulatory cohort, the consensus radiologists' reading had an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.92) relative to the CNN. Multivariate linear regression of vasc in the ambulatory cohort demonstrated significant negative associations with non-English-language preference ( = -0.083, P < .05) and Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity ( = -0.048, P < .05) and positive associations with age ( = 0.005, P < .001) and sex ( = 0.044, P < .05). For the hospitalized cohort, age was also significant ( = 0.003, P < .01), as was social deprivation index ( = 0.002, P < .05). The vasc variable (odds ratio [OR], 0.34), Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (OR, 1.58), non-English-language preference (OR, 1.74), and site (OR, 0.22) were independent predictors of having one or more hierarchical condition category codes (P < .01 for all) in the combined patient cohort. CONCLUSIONS A CNN model was predictive of aortic atherosclerosis in two cohorts (one ambulatory and one hospitalized) with COVID-19. The discrepancy between the CNN model and the administrative code, vasc, was associated with language preference in the ambulatory cohort; in the hospitalized cohort, this discrepancy was associated with social deprivation index. The absence of administrative code(s) was associated with vasc in the combined cohorts, suggesting that vasc is an independent predictor of health disparities. This may suggest that biomarkers extracted from routine imaging studies and compared with electronic health record data could play a role in enhancing value-based health care for traditionally underserved or disadvantaged patients for whom barriers to care exist.","output":"Detecting Racial/Ethnic Health Disparities Using Deep Learning From Frontal Chest Radiography."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Toshiyuki Sawai and Yoshinori Hirai of Oh-Ebashi LPC & Partners describe how Japans revised corporate governance code will assist businesses develop their ESG and sustainability commitments","output":"Corporate governance code revisions set to drive Japans ESG and sustainability push"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The recent impact of SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shown major differences in infrastructure and approach across healthcare systems worldwide One thing we can already be certain of is that governments and policy makers worldwide will place a greater focus on pandemic preparedness in the future However, as well as ensuring that robust pipelines for rapid test, highly effective treatment or vaccine, and personal protective equipment (PPE) production are in place, we must address underlying resilience and susceptibility of our populations to infectious disease Although the true spread and case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 may not be known for several months or even years, what is becoming increasingly clear is the significant degree to which underlying conditions associated with suboptimal metabolic health appear to be associated with poor outcomes in those with COVID-19 Considering the nature of these underlying conditions, such as obesity and hypertension, lifestyle-based approaches are likely to be one of our best tools in order to address ongoing and future disease burden during pandemics","output":"Metabolic health and lifestyle medicine should be a cornerstone of future pandemic preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses the involvement of the Hidayah Center Foundation (HCF) and the contribution of Covid-19 assistance to the new Muslim converts in Sabah, particularly in the interior division of Sabah.

In this paper, an improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization with Differential and Poisson Distribution strategies (PDBFO) is proposed to promote the insufficiency of BFO. In PDBFO, the step size of bacteria is segmented and adjusted in accordance with fitness value to accelerate convergence and enhance the search capability. Moreover, the differential operator and the Poisson Distribution strategy are incorporated to enrich individual diversity, which prevents algorithm from being trapped in the local optimum. Experimental simulations on eleven benchmark functions demonstrate that the proposed PDBFO has better convergence behavior in comparison to other six algorithms. Additionally, to verify the effectiveness of the method in solving the real-world complex problems, the PDBFO is also applied to the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP). Results indicate that the proposed PDBFO is more effective in obtaining the optimal solutions by comparing with other algorithms.","output":"An Improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization with Differential and Poisson Distribution Strategy and its Application to Nurse Scheduling Problem"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Need for a geriatrician in the peri operative care of older surgical patients is evident by the NCEPOD reports in 2010 and 2011. Funding for Consultant Geriatrician led surgical liaison service for RBH was approved in 2014.We present a comparative review of the service during 2019/2020. Methods A retrospective audit of elective and emergency surgical patients over 65 years of age from January to March 2019 and June to September 2020 was done. Geriatrician input was provided on weekdays by Less than full time (80%) equivalent Consultant, 1 full time equivalent physician associate and a Gerontology Registrar on pro rota basis. Results We reviewed 76 patients in 2019 (Emergency 74/76 = 95% Vs Elective 2/76 = 3%) and 161patients in 2020 (Emergency134/161 = 83% Vs Elecetive27/161 = 17%). Majority of emergency presentations were small bowel obstruction, acute cholecystitis, and pancreatitis while laparoscopic right hemi colectomy was the commonest elective surgical admission. The average age of patients was 72 years (2019) and 79 years (2020). Length of stay up to 5 days reduced from 75% (51/76) in 2019 to 43% (70/161) in 2020. The overall length of stay reduced from 12 days to 8.5 days in 2019 and 2020, respectively 30 days readmission rate increased from 21% (16/76) in 2019 to 25.5% (41/161) in 2020. 75% (2019) and 96% (2020) of patients were discharged back to their usual residence and death rates reduced from 14% to 1% between the 2 audits. Conclusion There is an increase in patient number, age, and complexity. Number of elective surgical admissions after the 1st Covid wave has risen. Even with less than full time Consultant Geriatrician cover the service has helped to reduce the overall length of hospital, mortality rate and added to cost saving. There is need for senior cover for service to work efficiently and to meet its ever-increasing demand.","output":"Proactive Input from Geriatrician Led Surgical Liaison Service for Older Surgical Patients at Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the first half of 2021, we observed high vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV2-infection. The replacement of the alpha-variant of concern (VOC) by the delta-VOC and uncertainty about the time course of immunity called for a re-assessment. METHODS: We estimated VE against transmission of infection (VET) from Belgian contact tracing data for high-risk exposure contacts between 26/01/2021 and 14/12/2021 by susceptibility (VEs) and infectiousness of breakthrough cases (VEi) for a complete schedule of Ad26.COV2.S, ChAdOx1, BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 as well as infection-acquired and hybrid immunity. We used a multilevel Bayesian model and adjusted for personal characteristics (age, sex, household), background exposure, calendar week, VOC and time since immunity conferring-event. Findings VET-estimates were higher for mRNA-vaccines, over 90%, compared to viral vector vaccines: 66% and 80% for Ad26COV2.S and ChAdOx1 respectively (Alpha, 0-50 days after vaccination). Delta was associated with a 40% increase in odds of transmission and a decrease of VEs (72% to 64%) and especially of VEi (71% to 46% for BNT162b2). Infection-acquired and hybrid immunity were less affected by Delta. Waning further reduced VET-estimates: from 81% to 63% for BNT162b2 (Delta, 150-200 days after vaccination). We observed lower initial VEi in the age group 65 to 84 years (32% vs 46% in the age group 45-64 years for BNT162b2) and faster waning. Hybrid immunity waned slower than vaccine-induced immunity. Interpretation VEi and VEs-estimates, while remaining significant, were reduced by Delta and waned over time. We observed faster waning in the oldest age group. We should seek to improve vaccine-induced protection in older persons and those vaccinated with viral-vector vaccines.","output":"VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST ONWARD TRANSMISSION OF SARS-COV2-INFECTION BY VARIANT OF CONCERN AND TIME SINCE VACCINATION, BELGIAN CONTACT TRACING, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a general shutdown of police and civilian self-defense training While means of distance learning such as online teaching appear to be feasible for theory dominant subjects addressing cognitive resources of the learner, combat-related practices like self-defense trainings dont seem to fit into the realm of virtual learning due to their bodily foundation This is made clear by the collective perplexity of police and civilian coaches, gyms and organizations, on how to proceed with training during the lockdown in general, while approaches of distance learning (e g , online learning) have rarely been considered In the following article, we tackle the situation of police and civilian self-defense coaches in times of Corona In a first step, contextual changes and challenges of coaching self-defense are identified through the lenses of a professional coaching model In line with basic assumptions of ecological dynamics, adaptability seems to be the decisive resource for the coaching and training of self-defense in times of Corona As an example for such an adaptation in training practice, a conceptual framework for distance-based self-defense training in the civilian and police domain is presented This framework is adjusted to the respective requirements of physical distancing and adopted to novel security matters within the public sphere caused by the current regulations In sum, the article attempts to provide ideas and orientation for police and civilian self-defense coaches as well as for their own development possibilities ? 2020, The Author(s)","output":"Coaching self-defense under COVID-19: challenges and solutions in the police and civilian domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, politicians and commentators have often adopted a war-like rhetoric, invoking a language more often associated to terrorist violence, rather than epidemics Although COVID-19 represents primarily a public health emergency, not inflicted by human agency, there are similarities in the type and scope of regulations governments have introduced to tackle the virus and to respond to terrorist attacks In this article, we first ask what we can learn from the extant studies on the attitudinal and emotional consequences of terrorism, relating it to recent research on public opinions in the wake of COVID-19, in order to better understand and predict how the pandemic will influence public sentiments We then analyze how attitudes can shift when a critical event not only threatens the population of a country as a whole, but directly affects its political leader Leveraging recently released survey data, we show how the announcement of Angela Merkel's quarantine significantly dampened the trust in and the credibility of her government, although this effect was short-lived","output":"COVID-19, Security Threats and Public Opinions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with adverse outcomes, including need for invasive mechanical ventilation and death in people with risk factors.

In this study, we calculated the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score for a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and assessed its association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, inflammatory cytokine levels, and clinical outcome. A total of 202 hospitalized participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal sampling were included in this analysis. FIB-4 was calculated for each participant using the alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, age, and platelet count. We evaluated the association between FIB-4 and mortality using both multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model. Correlations between FIB-4 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cytokine levels were evaluated using the Spearman test. Among the 202 participants, 22 died. The median FIB-4 in participants who survived and died were 1.91 and 3.98 (P < 0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test), respectively. Each one-unit increment in FIB-4 was associated with an increased odds of death (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.36, 2.35; P < 0.001) after adjusting for baseline characteristics including sex, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and history of liver diseases.

Spain is one of the most severely impacted countries, both clinically and economically. In an effort to support policy decision-making, we aimed to assess the impacts of different NPI on COVID-19 epidemiology, healthcare costs and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed epidemiological model was created to simulate the pandemic evolution. Its output was used to populate an economic model to quantify healthcare costs and GDP variation through a regression model which correlates NPI and GDP change from 42 countries. Thirteen scenarios combining different NPI were consecutively simulated in the epidemiological and economic models. Both increased testing and stringency could reduce cases, hospitalizations and deaths. While policies based on increased testing rates lead to higher healthcare costs, increased stringency is correlated with greater GDP declines, with differences of up to 4.4% points. Increased test sensitivity may lead to a reduction of cases, hospitalizations and deaths and to the implementation of pooling techniques that can increase throughput testing capacity. Alternative strategies to control COVID-19 spread entail differing economic outcomes.

Analysis of the situation is particularly needed in Nigeria, the country with by far the largest share of the burden, where approximately a quarter of all cases in the world are estimated to occur. Methods We analysed data from three nationwide surveys (Malaria Indicator Surveys in 2010 and 2015, and a National Demographic and Health Survey in 2018), with malaria parasite prevalence in children under five years of age determined by sampling from all 36 states of Nigeria, and blood slide microscopy performed in the same accredited laboratory for all samples. Changes over time were evaluated by calculating prevalence ratio (PR) values with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each state, together with Mantel-Haenszel adjusted prevalence ratios (PRadj) for each of the six major geopolitical zones of the country. Results Between 2010 and 2018 there were significant reductions in parasite prevalence in 25 states, but not in the remaining 11 states. Prevalence decreased most in southern zones of the country (South West PRadj = 0.53; South East PRadj = 0.59; South South PRadj = 0.51) and the North Central zone (PRadj = 0.36). Changes in the north were less marked, but were significant and indicated overall reductions by more than 20% (North West PRadj = 0.74; North East PRadj = 0.76). Changes in the south occurred mostly between 2010 and 2015, whereas those in the north were more gradual and most continued after 2015. Recent changes were not correlated with survey-reported variation in use of preventive measures.

Method An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale C 21 Items. Professional quality of life was measured by the Professional Quality of Life measure. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief-COPE, resilience by the Brief Resilience Scale, and optimism by the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R). Result Of the 640 medical residents contacted, 127 (20%) responded. A considerable proportion of residents reported symptoms of depression (42.5%), anxiety (41.7%) and stress (30.7%). Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of seniority in residency, with junior residents having poorer outcomes. In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction effect with moderate effect sizes between gender and working on the front line, as well as gender, working on the front line and seniority, on mental health outcomes. The most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The least reported coping strategies were substance use and denial. Avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (p = .032) and non-COVID-19 frontliners (p = .039). Optimism LOT-R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (p < .001). Another important finding is that optimism and resilience were associated with better mental health outcomes. In addition, we find that avoidant coping style is highly associated with depression.

The invasive ventilation rate for the patients that tested positive was 46.15%, 4.22% for untested, and 8.85% for patients who tested negative. The mortality rate in the positive group was 7.69%, 1.10% in the untested group, and 1.56% in the positive group. Conclusion Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had worse clinical outcomes than patients who tested negative and untested. We recommend creating criteria for testing based on patient characteristics and surgical procedure rather than testing all patients awaiting surgery; this would allow us to conserve resources moving forward.","output":"Unscreened: Urgent and Emergent Surgical Outcomes in the Early COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Total sleep deprivation (TSD) combined with bright light therapy (BLT) has been suggested as a valuable add-on to standard treatment for rapid relief of depression. However, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials in real-life clinical settings. The aim of this pragmatic randomized clinical trial was to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and feasibility of TSD combined with BLT as add-on to standard treatment for depression in a real-life clinical setting. Methods: Thirty-three inpatients were randomly assigned to either: a) an intervention group receiving a single-night TSD followed by 6 days BLT (10.000 lux, 30 min/day) as add-on to standard treatment; or b) a control group receiving a short sleep-hygiene consultation in addition to standard treatment. The follow-up period was 1 week. Results: No statistical differences were found in response rates, reduction of depressive and insomnia symptoms, length of stay, readmission rate, and clinical improvement. Both groups reported positive experiences toward the received treatment with low drop-out rates. Conclusions: One-night TSD followed by BLT was not effective as a rapid relief for depression at 1-week follow-up; however, the treatment was feasible and well-tolerated.","output":"Total Sleep Deprivation Followed by Bright Light Therapy as Rapid Relief for Depression: A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 2.13.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis--vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinsons disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.","output":"Microglial Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19: Lessons From Viral RNA Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinsons Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been a call to use innovative digital tools for the purpose of protecting public health.

Supply-side challenges related to human resources for health (HRH) worsen shortages and can negatively affect health worker performance and quality of care. This review scoped country-focused sources to identify and map evidence on HRH-related challenges to quality facility-based newborn care provision by nurses and midwives. METHODS: Evidence for this review was collected iteratively, beginning with pertinent World Health Organization documents and extending to articles identified via database and manual reference searches and country reports. Evidence from country-focused sources from 2000 onward was extracted using a data extraction tool that was designed iteratively; thematic analysis was used to map the 10 categories of HRH challenges. FINDINGS: A total of 332 peer-reviewed articles were screened, of which 22 met inclusion criteria. Fourteen additional sources were added from manual reference search and gray literature sources. Evidence has been mapped into 10 categories of HRH-related challenges: (1) lack of health worker data and monitoring; (2) poor health worker preservice education; (3) lack of HW access to evidence-based practice guidelines, continuing education, and continuing professional development; (4) insufficient and inequitable distribution of health workers and heavy workload; (5) poor retention, absenteeism, and rotation of experienced staff; (6) poor work environment, including low salary; (7) limited and poor supervision; (8) low morale, motivation, and attitude, and job dissatisfaction; (9) weaknesses of policy, regulations, management, leadership, governance, and funding; and (10) structural and contextual barriers.

The number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 is increasing on a daily basis and the current third wave of the pandemic appears to be worse than the one that swept several countries over the summer.

We described characteristics of novel coronavirus infection cases and analyzed risk factors for severe outcomes. METHODS: Cases were persons with laboratory-confirmed novel coronavirus infection reported under national surveillance between January and March 2020. Clinical characteristics were described, and risk factors of (1) intensive care unit [ICU] admission and (2) invasive ventilation/death were analyzed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the 516 cases analyzed, median age was 60 years (range: 1C97 years) and 285 (55%) were male. Common symptoms/signs were fever (375/475, 79%), cough (353/465, 76%), and pneumonia (245/387, 63%). Ten (2%) cases died. Of the 348 cases with data, 50 (14%) required invasive ventilation. Adjusted for each other, male gender and 1-year increase in age were associated with ICU admission (risk ratio [RR] 4.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69C10.32 and RR 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03C1.08, respectively) and invasive ventilation/death (RR 2.79; 95% CI, 1.49C5.21 and RR 1.06; 95% CI, 1.04C1.08, respectively). Diabetes, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lung diseases were also associated with severe outcomes. Of the 80 cases asymptomatic at hospitalization, 40 developed symptoms and five of them >70 years of age required invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: The early stage of the novel coronavirus epidemic in Japan disproportionately affected the elderly. Older age, male gender, and underlying conditions were associated with severe outcomes. Notably, some elderly case-patients who were asymptomatic at diagnosis and promptly hospitalized still went on to develop severe disease, indicating the importance of careful monitoring of certain populations.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Risk Factors for Severe Outcomes of Novel Coronavirus Infection, JanuaryCMarch 2020, Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Since being first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 8, 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, has spread globally. Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19. Methods Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. Results The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3C89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1C71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2C52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3C27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1C9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6C18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1C6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5C1.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6C13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7C10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6C3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9C8.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively.

Innovations in printing technologies are required to promote the broad application of high-performance PSEs at a low cost. However, current printing techniques are still facing long-lasting challenges in addressing the conflict between printing speed and performance. To overcome this challenge, we developed a new corona-enabled electrostatic printing (CEP) technique for ultra-fast (milliseconds) roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing of binder-free multifunctional e-skins. The printing capability and controllability of CEP were investigated through parametric studies and microstructure observation. The electric field generation, material transfer, and particle amount and size selecting mechanisms were numerically and experimentally studied. CEP-printed graphene e-skins were demonstrated to possess an outstanding strain sensing performance. The binder-free feature of the CEP-assembled networks enables them to provide pressure sensitivity as low as 2.5 Pa and capability to detect acoustic signals of hundreds of hertz in frequency. Furthermore, the CEP technique was utilized to pattern different types of functional materials (e.g., graphene and thermochromic polymers) onto different substrates (e.g., tape and textile).

Higher viral burden was positively associated with inflammatory responses, as assessed by IL-6, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients plasma collected on the same day, primarily in the younger cohort (59 years old) and in mild cases of all ages, whereas these were barely detectable in elderly patients (60 years old) with critical disease. In addition, viral load dynamics in elderly patients were not significantly different between mild and critical cases, even though more enhanced inflammation was consistently observed in the elderly group when compared to the younger group during the acute phase of infection.

METHODS: We used multicenter retrospective data, obtained from medical records, focusing on the diagnostic performance for definite PTB. We categorized patients into four groups, by radiographic activity: definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive. RESULTS: Of the 650 patients included, 316 had culture-confirmed PTB; 190 (29.2%), 323 (49.7%), 70 (10.8%), and 67 (10.3%) were classified into the definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive groups, respectively. The corresponding observed culture rates for CT radiographic activity were 61.6%, 60.7%, 4.3% and 0%, respectively. When not only culture rates but TB-PCR and histological results were taken into consideration as definite PTB, it showed 66.6%, 67.2%, 14.3%, and 0% of each CT radiographic activity, respectively. Regarding the diagnostic performance for definite PTB, radiographic activity displayed high sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 94.6C98.5) and negative predictive values (92.7%, 95% CI, 86.6C96.2), considered definitely and probably active PTB.

There is no reliable diagnostic test for LPR as there is for GERD. We hypothesized that detection of pepsin (a molecule only made in the stomach) in laryngeal epithelium or sputum should provide evidence for reflux of gastric contents to the larynx, and be diagnostic of LPR. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective study in patients with LPR symptoms undergoing antireflux surgery (ARS). METHODS Nine patients undergoing ARS for LPR symptoms were studied pre- and postoperatively using a clinical symptom questionnaire, laryngoscopy, 24-h pH monitoring, biopsy of posterior laryngeal mucosa, and sputum collection for pepsin Western blot assay. RESULTS The primary presenting LPR symptom was hoarseness in six, cough in two, and globus sensation in one patient. Pepsin was detected in the laryngeal mucosa in eight of nine patients preoperatively. There was correlation between biopsy and sputum (+/+ or -/-) in four of five patients, both analyzed preoperatively. Postoperatively, pH monitoring improved in all but one patient and normalized in five of eight patients. Eight of nine patients reported improvement in their primary LPR symptom (six good, two mild). Only one patient (who had negative preoperative pepsin) reported no response to treatment of the primary LPR symptom. Postoperatively, pepsin was detected in only one patient.

Nine Dutch police officers collected daily nocturnal HRV data using an Oura ring during 15C55 weeks. Participants filled in the Four-Dimensional Symptoms Questionnaire every 5 weeks. A sample of 47 five-week observations was collected and analysed using multiple regression. After controlling for trends in total sleep time, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and alcohol use, an increasing trend in the seven-day rolling standard deviation of the HRV (HRVsd) was associated with increases in stress and somatisation over 5 weeks. Furthermore, an increasing HRV trend buffered against the association between HRVsd trend and somatisation change, undoing this association when it was combined with increasing HRV. Depression and anxiety could not be related to trends in HRV or HRVsd, which was related to observed floor effects.

We aimed to assess the effects of a favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine combination on treating moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial at nine hospitals. Eligible patients were adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 defined as oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) of  94% while breathing ambient air or significant clinical symptoms with chest x-ray changes requiring hospital admission. Randomization was in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was time to clinical improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital within 14 days. Analyses were done in an intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: From May 2020 to Jan 2021, 254 patients were enrolled; 129 were assigned to standard of care and 125 to the treatment. The mean age was 52 ( 13) years, and 103 (41%) were women. At randomization, six patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 229 (90.15%) were requiring supplemental oxygen only (with or without non-invasive ventilation), and 19 (7.48%) were receiving neither. The time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between the groups: median of 9 days in the treatment group and 7 days in the control group (HR: 0.845; 95% CI 0.617C1.157; p-value = 0.29). The 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups (7.63% treatment) vs. (10.32% control); p-value = 0.45. The most prevalent adverse events were headache, elevation in ALT, and the prolonged QTc interval in the treatment group.

As atrocious acts of anti-Black violence and harassment by law enforcement officers and white civilians are captured on recording devices, the gap between the human and civil rights to which Black people are entitled and their living conditions has become readily apparent. Less visible human rights abuses, too, camouflaged as private commercial matters, and thus out of the reach of the state, are also increasingly exposed as social and financial inequalities have become ever starker. These abuses are not effectively reached by anti-discrimination law, leaving Black and Indigenous people with rights, but no remedies, as they are forced to navigate a degraded existence suspended somewhere citizen and foreigner, and more importantly, between life and death. In analyzing the persistence, resilience, and agility of white supremacy in the United States, the Article proposes a departure from reliance upon the extant antidiscrimination legal frameworks in the United States. The Article offers up a theory as whiteness as contract, providing scholars, activists, and movement lawyers with a new prism of analysis for the structural and physical violence that those raced as Black endure at the express direction of the state. Despite federal law establishing formal racial equality with respect to citizenship, and with citizenship, the rights to contract and to property, an invisible common law sets forth that Black people are not in privity with the State and lack contractual capacity with the white body politic or its individual members. Under the terms of this contract for whiteness for which those raced as white have bargained, Black people lack the capacity to negotiate, occupy, or exercise a reliable authority over property. Moreover, whenever Black people are found to be in trespass on white property, they have no expectation of physical integrity, liberty, or lifeor of remedies for breaches thereof. An end to anti-Black state violence requires the revocation of the terms of whiteness and the institution of a new social contract in which Black people are accorded full political personhood, and full citizenship, complete with full contracting capacity and authority and full protection of their contracts and proprietorship. Scholars and advocates committed to ending structural and physical anti-Black brutality may use the new analytical prism proposed in this Article to explore new advocacy strategies and to consider meaningful racial justice remedies.","output":"Whiteness as Contract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Examining the genome sequences of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) strains is critical to properly understand this disease and its functionalities.

Second, the similarity/dissimilarity between COVID-19 genome sequences are measured with different AF methods. This allows to compare sequences and evaluate the performance of various distance measures employed in AF methods. Lastly, the phylogeny for the COVID-19 genome sequences are constructed with various AF methods as well as the consensus tree that shows the level of support (agreement) among phylogenetic trees built by various AF methods.

Short-term elevations in GC levels are necessary for survival, whereas longer-term changes can lead to reduced reproductive output and immunosuppression. Persistent environmental contaminants (ECs) are widespread globally. Experimental exposure of individuals to ECs is associated with varying GC responses, within, and across, species and contaminants. Individuals exposed to ECs over long durations are expected to have prolonged GC elevations, which likely affect their health. We conducted a meta-analysis to test for a relationship between fish GC levels and experimental exposure to ECs, and to explore potential moderators, including duration of exposure, that could help explain the variation in effect sizes within and between studies. We report almost exclusively on cortisol responses of teleost fish to ECs. Although there was much variation in effect sizes, captive-bred fish exposed to ECs had baseline GC levels 1.5 higher than unexposed fish, and fish exposed to pharmaceuticals (estradiols and stimulants being mainly considered) had baseline GC levels approximately 2.5 higher than unexposed fish. We found that captive-bred and wild-caught fish did not differ in GC levels after exposure to the same classes of ECs - studies on captive bred fish may thus enable inferences about GC responses to ECs for wild species. Furthermore, effect sizes did not differ between baseline and challenge-induced GC measures. In different analyses, duration of exposure was negatively correlated to effect size, suggesting that the GC response may acclimate after chronic exposure to some ECs which could potentially alter the GC response of EC-exposed fish to novel stressors. Future studies should explore the effect of multiple stressors on the fish GC response and perform tests on a broader array of contaminant types and vertebrate classes.","output":"Meta-analysis shows environmental contaminants elevate cortisol levels in teleost fish - Effect sizes depend on contaminant class and duration of experimental exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the prognosis of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), and share the experience in managing them during pandemics. METHOD: This is a retrospective study of nAMD and PCV patients treated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 31 December 2019 to 1 August 2020. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) features, duration of delayed treatment and number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 130 nAMD patients (155 eyes) and 76 PCV patients (89 eyes) were identified. Compared to the conditions before COVID-19, the BCVA of delayed cases decreased significantly, and the proportion of patients presenting with sub-macular scar was significantly greater in the delayed treatment group (p < 0.05). The BCVA of non-delayed cases remained stable, with the percentage of patients with disease activity sub-retinal fluid and hemorrhage at the fovea decreasing significantly (p < 0.05). The stable cases who did not require anti-VEGF treatment had significantly worse baseline and final BCVA, these patients were likely to be chronic and burnt out cases with significantly worse anatomical structures (p < 0.05).

This decline is part of the evolution of an immune response leading to B cell differentiation into short-lived antibody-secreting cells or resting memory B cells. At the same time, the ongoing class switch and antibody maturation processes occurring in germinal centers lead to the selection of B cell clones secreting antibodies with higher affinity for their cognate antigen, thereby improving their functional activity. To determine whether the decline in SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is paralleled with an increase in avidity of the anti-viral antibodies produced, we developed a simple assay to measure the avidity of anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We longitudinally followed a cohort of 29 convalescent donors with blood samples collected between 6- and 32-weeks post-symptoms onset. We observed that, while the level of antibodies declines over time, the anti-RBD avidity progressively increases and correlates with the B cell class switch. Additionally, we observed that anti-RBD avidity increased similarly after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that anti-RBD IgG avidity determination could be a surrogate assay for antibody affinity maturation and, thus, suitable for studying humoral responses elicited by natural infection and/or vaccination.","output":"Evolution of Anti-RBD IgG Avidity following SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reactivity assays previously suggested that two quinol-containing MRI contrast agent sensors for H(2)O(2), [Mn(H2qp1)(MeCN)](2+) and [Mn(H4qp2)Br(2)], could also catalytically degrade superoxide. Subsequently, [Zn(H2qp1)(OTf)](+) was found to use the redox activity of the H2qp1 ligand to catalyze the conversion of O(2)B(?) to O(2) and H(2)O(2), raising the possibility that the organic ligand, rather than the metal, could serve as the redox partner for O(2)B(?) in the manganese chemistry. Here, we use stopped-flow kinetics and cryospray-ionization mass spectrometry (CSI-MS) analysis of the direct reactions between the manganese-containing contrast agents and O(2)B(?) to confirm the activity and elucidate the catalytic mechanism. The obtained data are consistent with the operation of multiple parallel catalytic cycles, with both the quinol groups and manganese cycling through different oxidation states during the reactions with superoxide. The choice of ligand impacts the overall charges of the intermediates and allows us to visualize complementary sets of intermediates within the catalytic cycles using CSI-MS. With the diquinolic H4qp2, we detect Mn(iii)-superoxo intermediates with both reduced and oxidized forms of the ligand, a Mn(iii)-hydroperoxo compound, and what is formally a Mn(iv)-oxo species with the monoquinolate/mono-para-quinone form of H4qp2. With the monoquinolic H2qp1, we observe a Mn(ii)-superoxo ? Mn(iii)-peroxo intermediate with the oxidized para-quinone form of the ligand. The observation of these species suggests inner-sphere mechanisms for O(2)B(?) oxidation and reduction that include both the ligand and manganese as redox partners. The higher positive charges of the complexes with the reduced and oxidized forms of H2qp1 compared to those with related forms of H4qp2 result in higher catalytic activity (k(cat)  10(8) M(?1) s(?1) at pH 7.4) that rivals those of the most active superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics.

It is found that a solitary pair of NIBTs, feasible either at a G(*)GC/T(*)AT or T(*)AT/G(*)GC triplex junction, does not impinge significantly on triplex stability. But two overlapping pairs of NIBTs resulting from either a T(*)AT or a G(*)GC interruption disrupt Hoogsteen pair to a noncanonical mismatch destabilizing the triplex by ~10 to 14 kcal/mol, implying that their frequent incidence in multiples, especially, in short sequences could even hinder triplex formation. The results provide (i) an unambiguous and generalised mechanistic rationale for the discriminatory trait of parallel triplexes, including those studied experimentally (ii) clarity for the prevalence of antiparallel triplexes and (iii) comprehensive perspectives on the sequence dependent influence of nonisosteric base triplets useful in the rational design of TFOs against potential triplex target sites.","output":"Selective Preference of Parallel DNA Triplexes Is Due to the Disruption of Hoogsteen Hydrogen Bonds Caused by the Severe Nonisostericity between the G*GC and T*AT Triplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: People with progressive multiple sclerosis (PwPMS) report that they recognise the benefits of activity on their physical and psychological health but need support to achieve their physical activity goals. We aimed to systematically develop a theoretically informed intervention that would enable PwPMS to more readily engage in regular physical activity. DESIGN: We used an intervention mapping approach to inform intervention development. SETTING: We conducted semistructured interviews with PwPMS and their families/carers and physiotherapists recruited from secondary care settings. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen PwPMS with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of between 6 and 8 and 7 of their families/carers and 13 physiotherapists and 1 physiotherapy technician participated. RESULTS: Interview data suggested that the development of supportive coaching relationships with physiotherapists could promote the ability of PwPMS to achieve a desirable and achievable physical activity plan. These interview data informed the prototype Lifestyle Exercise and Activity Package for Multiple Sclerosis (LEAP-MS) consisting of a secure multiuser web-based platform (with an education and activity suite, interactive components enabling selection of exercises, goal setting and activity logging), up to six flexible face-to-face or web-based physiotherapy coaching sessions and remote support via an embedded web-based messaging function that all together draw on specific theory-based methods to achieve physical activity behaviour change, namely active learning, reinforcement, modelling, feedback, facilitation, goal setting and guided practice. Implementation is within a multiuser platform accessible to participants, trained physiotherapists and researchers. CONCLUSIONS: We have followed an inclusive, systematic and transparent process to develop the LEAP-MS intervention that enables detailed description of components, context and guiding principles to inform ongoing evaluation. Importantly, PwPMS expressed the need for autonomy in developing physical activity plans. This has been achieved through the embedding of self-management principles in the design and delivery of the LEAP-MS intervention.","output":"Web-based physical activity intervention for people with progressive multiple sclerosis: application of consensus-based intervention development guidance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: An inefficient immune response accompanied by an overwhelming inflammatory reaction is involved in severe courses of COVID-19. Kynurenine (KYN) has important immune-modulatory functions and may contribute to a failure in controlling SARS-CoV-2. The present study aims to explore biomarkers that hint at a fatal outcome of COVID-19 early on. (2) Methods: We established a cohort of 148 hospitalized COVID-19 patients for this study. Thirty-one patients died due to a severe COVID-19 course, and 117 recovered within 90 days. We built a biobank by collecting left-over material from these patients whenever blood arrived at the central laboratory of our University hospital for analysis of routine markers. The scientific laboratory analysis comprised KYN, Tryptophan (TRP), KYN/TRP ratio, ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, N-terminal pro-natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), troponin T (TnT), fibrinogen, D-Dimer, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), antithrombin (AT), protein C, protein S, factor XIII, lupus aPTT, angiotensin-2, vitamin D metabolites, and telomeres in all COVID-19 patients. Basic clinical characteristics and anteceding diseases including cardiovascular, oncologic, renal, hypertension, pulmonary, metabolic (diabetes, obesity) were recorded in a database together with the laboratory data. (3) Results: At the time of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection those patients who deceased within 90 days afterwards due to COVID-19, had a significantly higher age, higher KYN, KYN/TRP ratio, ferritin, creatinine, and NTproBNP values than SARS-CoV-2 patients who survived COVID-19 along the same time span. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis the variables age, KYN, ferritin, D-Dimer, TnT, NTproBNP, and creatinine showed a significant influence on survival time. Gender, however, showed no influence. In a combined Cox regression analysis KYN had the highest hazard ratio (1.188, 95% CI: 1.071C1.319) followed by age (1.041, 95% CI: 1.011C1.073). In a ROC analysis, KYN values above the cut off limit of 4.82 nmol/l (as specified by Youden index) had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI: 66C95%) and a specificity of 72% (95% CI: 65C82%) to predict COVID-19 related death within 90 days observation time.

Telehealth is broadly defined as a method to have virtual, bidirectional communication between patients and providers. Telehealth can include methods such as audio-only, video-consultation, and tele-monitoring, which can occur in a synchronous, asynchronous, or blended format. The purpose of this review is to present common foundational principles for providing clinical cancer care via telehealth, followed by an overview of three distinct examples of comprehensive telehealth programs that have been developed to meet the needs of patients and families across the cancer trajectory, including survivorship, rehabilitation, and palliative care phases. The programs described are exemplars that were developed and implemented prior to the coronavirus pandemic, so they reflect many years of planning and evidence. Lessons learned include the need for ongoing patient support, clinician training, and cancer health system/practice programmatic considerations such as billing, scheduling, reimbursement, software, and hardware/platform security. Although the COVID-19 pandemic produced an explosive shift in regulations and implementation, sustainability of these changes may not be long-term.

Clinical characteristics of the latter are heterogeneous and not yet fully elucidated, while the pathogenesis appears related to neuroinflammation in a subset of patients. Case: A middle-aged man presented with acute language disturbance at the emergency department. Examination revealed expressive aphasia, mild ideomotor slowing, and severe hypocapnic hypoxemia. Multimodal CT assessment and electroencephalogram (EEG) did not reveal any abnormalities. COVID-19 was diagnosed based on chest CT findings and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab. The following day, neurological symptoms progressed to agitated delirium and respiratory status worsened, requiring admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation. Brain MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were unremarkable. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on CSF was negative. He received supportive treatment and intravenous low-dose steroids. His neurological and respiratory status resolved completely within 2 weeks. Conclusions: We report a patient with reversible COVID-19-related encephalopathy presenting as acute aphasia, mimicking stroke or status epilepticus, eventually evolving into delirium. Although large-vessel stroke is frequently encountered in COVID-19, our case suggests that focal neurological deficits may occur as the earliest feature of encephalopathy.

Proprioceptive training programs in the form of kinesthesia, balance and agility (KBA) exercises have been reported to be beneficial for individuals with knee OA. However, the most optimal training dosage of KBA exercises is still unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of different frequencies of KBA training (i.e., twice-weekly or thrice-weekly) in adults with knee OA. METHODS: A single (assessor) blind, three-arm parallel, multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted. One hundred twenty adults with knee OA will be recruited from four tertiary hospitals in Northwestern Nigeria and randomly assigned into one of three intervention groups; twice-weekly KBA (n = 40), thrice-weekly KBA (n = 40), and conventional physiotherapy (n = 40) in the ratio of 1:1:1. Participants in the conventional physiotherapy group will receive two sessions of brief patient education, and sixteen sessions of ultrasound therapy, and stretching and strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. Participants in the two different KBA groups will receive KBA training according to the designed sessions for 8 weeks in addition to the conventional physiotherapy program. All groups will be assessed pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and at 3 months, 4 months, and 6 months post-randomization. The primary outcome will be physical function (Ibadan Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis Outcome Measure) whereas the secondary outcomes will be pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale for pain), knee stability (Knee Outcome Survey-Activities of Daily Living Scale), proprioception (electronic goniometer), and quality of life (Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life Questionnaire). DISCUSSION: The findings of this study may provide evidence on the effectiveness of KBA exercise training and the ideal number of sessions needed to achieve the highest effectiveness in adults with knee OA.

A major problem faced in the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the inefficiency and scarcity of medical tests. The use of computed tomography (CT) has shown promise for the evaluation of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. CT exam analysis is complex and requires specialist effort, which can lead to diagnostic errors. The use of CAD systems can minimize the problems generated by the analysis of CTs by specialists. This paper presents a methodology for diagnosing COVID-19 using convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction in CT exams and its classification using XGBoost. The methodology consists of using a CNN to extract features from 708 CTs, 312 with COVID-19, and 396 Non-COVID-19. After the extracted data, we used XGBoost for classification. The results show an accuracy of 95.07, recall of 95.09, precision of 94.99, F-score of 95, AUC of 95, and a kappa index of 90.

Of particular importance for this inhomogeneous end user group is the time factor and thus in general also space, distance, and velocity. Authorities focus on people, goods, and infrastructure in the field of prevention, protection, and rescue. For purposive tactical, strategic, and operational planning, geodata and information about past and ongoing operations dispatched and archived at control centers can be used. For that reason, a rule-based process for the geovisual evaluation of massive spatio-temporal data is developed using geoinformation methods, techniques, and technologies by the example of operational emergency data of fire brigade and rescue services. This contribution to the extension of the KDE for hotspot analysis has the goal to put the professional and managerial personnel in a position to create well-founded geoprofiles based on the spatial-temporal location, distribution, and typology of emergency mission hotspots. In doing so, significant data is generated for the neighborhood of the operations in abstract spatial segments, and is used to calculate distance measures for the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) process.

Our goal is to enhance the accuracy of smartphone-based exposure notification and contact tracing systems. We present a set of binary machine learning classifiers that take as input pairs of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprints. We empirically verify that a single classifier cannot generalize well to a range of different environments with vastly different numbers of detectable Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). However, specialized classifiers, tailored to situations where the number of detectable APs falls within a certain range, are able to detect immediate physical proximity significantly more accurately. As such, we design three classifiers for situations with low, medium, and high numbers of detectable APs. These classifiers distinguish between pairs of RSSI fingerprints recorded 2 or fewer meters apart and pairs recorded further apart but still in Bluetooth range.

CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, first attributed to an asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Edoxaban was started, which was discontinued by the patient. Four weeks later, he presented with subacute vertigo and balance disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a multi-territory stroke. A transoesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a small vegetation on the aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency. Blood cultures remained negative. Malignancy screening showed a markedly elevated prostate-specific antigen. Prostate adenocarcinoma was confirmed on biopsy. A positron emission tomography revealed metastatic disease. A diagnosis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and paraneoplastic pulmonary embolism secondary to prostate cancer was made. Edoxaban was restarted and the patient was referred for treatment of the prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up after 5 months showed no evidence of aortic valve vegetations. DISCUSSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 in ambulatory patients may be insufficient as a predisposing factor for venous thrombo-embolism and these patients, especially the elderly, should undergo a screening for malignancy.

However, the reproducibility of face-to-face (F2F) versus remote videoconference-based cognitive testing remains to be established. We assessed the reliability and agreement between F2F and remote administrations of the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), modified version of the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (mCMMSE), and Chinese Frontal Assessment Battery (CFAB) in older adults attending a memory clinic. METHODS: The participants underwent F2F followed by remote videoconference-based assessment by the same assessor within 3 weeks. Reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; two-way mixed, absolute agreement), the mean difference between remote and F2F-based assessments using paired-sample t-tests, and agreement using Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: Fifty-six subjects (mean age, 765.4 years; 74% mild; 19% moderate dementia) completed the AMT and mCMMSE, of which 30 completed the CFAB. Good reliability was noted based on the ICC valuesAMT: ICC=0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68C0.88; mCMMSE: ICC=0.80, 95% CI 0.63C0.88; CFAB: ICC=0.82, 95% CI 0.66C0.91. However, remote AMT and mCMMSE scores were higher compared to F2Fmean difference (i.e., remote minus F2F): AMT 0.31.1, p=0.03; mCMMSE 1.32.9, p=0.001. Significant differences were observed in the orientation and recall items of the mCMMSE and the similarities and conflicting instructions of CFAB. BlandCAltman plots indicated wide 95% limits of agreement (AMT -1.9 to 2.6; mCMMSE -4.3 to 6.9; CFAB -3.0 to 3.8), exceeding the a priori-defined levels of error. CONCLUSION: While the remote and F2F cognitive assessments demonstrated good overall reliability, the test scores were higher when performed remotely compared to F2F. The discrepancies in agreement warrant attention to patient selection and environment optimization for the successful adaptation of telemedicine for cognitive assessment.","output":"Cognitive Assessment by Telemedicine: Reliability and Agreement between Face-to-Face and Remote Videoconference-Based Cognitive Tests in Older Adults Attending a Memory Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Analyze how the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and its social restriction measures affect sleep quality and the immunological system.

However, the chemical basis of its antimicrobial activity has still not been elucidated. To examine the active chemicals, its stem was extracted to perform bioassay-guided purification against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. In this study, two types of columns (normal and reverse-phase) were used for speedy bioassay-guided isolation from Kumu, and the active peaks were collected and identified via an UHPLC-Orbitrap-Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer, combined with MS Fragmenter and ChromGenius. For identification, the COCONUT Database (largest database of natural products) and a manually built PQ database were used, in combination with prediction and calculation of mass fragmentation and retention time to better infer their structures, especially for isomers. Moreover, three standards were analyzed under different conditions for developing and validating the MS method. A total of 25 active compounds were identified, including 24 alkaloids and 1 triterpenoid against S. aureus, whereas only -carboline-1-carboxylic acid and picrasidine S were active against E. coli. Here, the good antimicrobial activity of 18 chemicals was reported for the first time. Furthermore, the spectrum of three abundant -carbolines was assessed via their IC(50) and MBC against various human pathogens. All of them exhibited strong antimicrobial activities with good potential to be developed as antibiotics.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways.

Pairwise proximities can be computed from a trained random forest which measure the similarity between data points relative to the supervised task. Random forest proximities have been used in many applications including the identification of variable importance, data imputation, outlier detection, and data visualization. However, existing definitions of random forest proximities do not accurately reflect the data geometry learned by the random forest. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest-Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving proximities (RF-GAP). We prove that the proximity-weighted sum (regression) or majority vote (classification) using RF-GAP exactly match the out-of-bag random forest prediction, thus capturing the data geometry learned by the random forest. We empirically show that this improved geometric representation outperforms traditional random forest proximities in tasks such as data imputation and provides outlier detection and visualization results consistent with the learned data geometry.","output":"Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving Random Forest Proximities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The study investigated sex differences in cognitive outcomes at 90 days after first-ever stroke using data from a population-based sample. Methods and Results The study sample consisted of 1227 participants from the 2009-2016 Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project (south Texas, United States) who had first-ever ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage and survived 90 days after stroke. Poststroke cognitive function was assessed by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) (range: 0-100; dementia: <78). The associations of sex with dichotomized and continuous outcomes were examined using logistic regression and tobit regression, respectively. Inverse probability weighting and multiple imputation were used to deal with missing data. The study sample was evenly distributed by sex, and primarily composed of Mexican Americans (59.1%) and non-Hispanic whites (34.1%). Women scored 2.96 points worse on the 3MSE than men at 90 days poststroke (95% CI, -3.99 to -1.93). The prevalence of dementia was 27.6% for men (95% CI, 23.5%-31.6%) and 35.6% for women (95% CI, 31.5%-39.7%), and the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of dementia comparing women with men was 1.45 (95% CI, 1.24-1.69). The association was attenuated after adjustment for sociodemographic, stroke, and prestroke characteristics (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61-1.09). Conclusions Women had worse cognitive outcomes than men at 90 days poststroke. The differences were attributable to sociodemographic and prestroke characteristics, especially widowhood status.

Here we tested this hypothesis directly by performing 4C sequencing at the DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD patient-derived cells. Surprisingly, chromatin contacts remain unchanged upon repeat expansion at both loci. This was true for loci with different DNA methylation levels and CTCF binding. Repeat sizes ranging from 15 to 1,700 displayed strikingly similar chromatin interaction profiles.

The morphology of a neuronal circuit is a fundamental component in neuron modeling. Recently, single-neuron morphologies of the whole brain have been used in many studies. The correctness and completeness of semimanually traced neuronal morphology are credible. However, there are some inaccuracies in semimanual tracing results. The distance between consecutive nodes marked by humans is very long, spanning multiple voxels. On the other hand, the nodes are marked around the centerline of the neuronal fiber, not on the centerline. Although these inaccuracies do not seriously affect the projection patterns that these studies focus on, they reduce the accuracy of the traced neuronal skeletons. These small inaccuracies will introduce deviations into subsequent studies that are based on neuronal morphology files. RESULTS We propose a neuronal digital skeleton optimization method to evaluate and make fine adjustments to a digital skeleton after neuron tracing. Provided that the neuronal fiber shape is smooth and continuous, we describe its physical properties according to two shape restrictions. One restriction is designed based on the grayscale image, and the other is designed based on geometry. These two restrictions are designed to finely adjust the digital skeleton points to the neuronal fiber centerline. With this method, we design the three-dimensional shape restriction workflow of neuronal skeleton adjustment computation. The performance of the proposed method has been quantitatively evaluated using synthetic and real neuronal image data. The results show that our method can reduce the difference between the traced neuronal skeleton and the centerline of the neuronal fiber. Furthermore, morphology metrics such as the neuronal fiber length and radius become more precise.

Therefore, it is important to forecast future cumulative confirmed cases to plan and implement control measures effectively. METHODS: This study proposed a hybrid autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Prophet model to predict daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases. The built-in auto.arima function was first used to select the optimal hyperparameter values of the ARIMA model. Then, the modified ARIMA model was used to find the best fit between the test and forecast data to find the best model parameter combinations. Articles, blog posts, and news stories from virologists, scientists, and health experts related to the third wave of COVID-19 were gathered using the Python web scraping package Beautiful Soup. Their opinions (sentiments) toward the potential third wave were analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) libraries. RESULTS: A spike in daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases was predicted in India in the next 180 days based on past time series data. The results were validated using various analytical tools and evaluation metrics, producing a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.06. The NLP processing results revealed negative sentiments in most articles and blogs, with few exceptions. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that there will be more active cases in the upcoming days. The proposed models can forecast future daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases. This study will help the country and states plan appropriate public health measures for the upcoming waves of COVID-19.","output":"Predicting the impact of the third wave of COVID-19 in India using hybrid statistical machine learning models: A time series forecasting and sentiment analysis approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unexpected outbreak of COVID-19 has placed the tourism sector in an unfavourable position. It has altered the reality of destinations worldwide, changing the paradigm of tourism and showing an unusual scenario within the tourism sector, the undertourism. This paper confirms how this global pandemic has put the Spanish tourism sector at a halt, making it essential to establish publicCprivate response strategies that reactivate it and, in turn, avoid overtourism in the post-COVID-19 scenario. This is done to emphasise the necessity of embracing an adapted systematic approach that entails a realistic set of factors to quantitatively measure the impact of overtourism on the local community. In this sense, a fuzzy modified hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed, combining the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model, the multi-attribute idealCreal comparative analysis (MAIRCA) model, and the sensitivity analysis. The modified F-AHP model is used to identify the criteria importance. For the final ranking of the considered alternative municipalities, the modified F-MAIRCA is applied. To validate the applicability of the proposed approach, we designated the province of Malaga (Costa del Sol) as an empirical study. The findings show that the municipality of Nerja was the most affected by overtourism in the pre-pandemic scenario, and today it is found in undertourism. This calls for transformative decisions of fully engaged tourism policymakers and practitioners to thrive in the post-COVID-19 tourism scenarios in terms of sustainability. ? 2021 by the authors.

Tremendous efforts are dedicated to advance reliable and effective detection of coronaviruses. Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis mainly relies on the detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic materials by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. However, simpler and more rapid and reliable alternatives are needed to meet high demand during the pandemic. Biosensor-based diagnosis approaches become alternatives for selectively and rapidly detecting virus particles because of their biorecognition elements consisting of biomaterials that are specific to virus biomarkers. Here, we summarize biorecognition materials, including antibodies and antibody-like molecules, that are designed to recognize SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers and the advances of recently developed biosensors for COVID-19 diagnosis. The design of biorecognition materials or layers is crucial to maximize biosensing performances, such as high selectivity and sensitivity of virus detection. Additionally, the recent representative achievements in developing bioelectronics for sensing coronavirus are included. This review includes scholarly articles, mainly published in 2020 and early 2021. In addition to capturing the fast development in the fields of applied materials and biodiagnosis, the outlook of this rapidly evolving technology is summarized.

This study estimated willingness to receive HZV to characterize factors that may influence vaccination willingness. METHODS We conducted a face-to-face questionnaire survey in adults aged 50-69 years in 13 communities in Shanghai in late 2020. We explored the relationship between vaccination willingness and independent factors including demographic factors, medical history, knowledge of herpes zoster and HZV, and vaccine hesitancy. Outcomes included participants' willingness to vaccinate themselves, their partners, and their parents, under both the current payment scenario (self-payment) and a hypothetical scenario (payment by basic medical insurance). RESULTS A total of 1672 respondents aged 50-69 years were included in this study. The proportion of respondents willing to get vaccinated was 16.57% for themselves, 13.88% for their partners, and 8.49% for their parents. If the vaccine was covered under insurance, these numbers increased to 72.25%, 62.50%, and 29.96%, respectively. Younger age, female gender, higher income, higher educational level, local residents, and lower vaccine hesitancy were associated with increased willingness to vaccinate. Knowledge of herpes zoster and HZV positively influenced the willingness in the hypothetical payment scenario. CONCLUSION We determined a very low willingness to vaccinate HZV in adults aged 50-69 years in a Chinese metropolis. Decreasing costs is important to increase coverage.

To facilitate studies of viral and host functions in FHV replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeast DNA plasmids were constructed to inducibly express wild-type FHV RNA1 in vivo. Subsequent translation of FHV replicase protein A initiated robust RNA1 replication, amplifying RNA1 to levels approaching those of rRNA, as in FHV-infected animal cells. The RNA1-derived subgenomic mRNA, RNA3, accumulated to even higher levels of >100,000 copies per yeast cell, compared to 10 copies or less per cell for 95% of yeast mRNAs. The time course of RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis in induced yeast paralleled that in yeast transfected with natural FHV virion RNA. As in animal cells, RNA1 replication and RNA3 synthesis depended on FHV RNA replicase protein A and 3'-terminal RNA1 sequences but not viral protein B2. Additional plasmids were engineered to inducibly express RNA1 derivatives with insertions of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in subgenomic RNA3. These RNA1 derivatives were replicated, synthesized RNA3, and expressed GFP when provided FHV polymerase in either cis or trans, providing the first demonstration of reporter gene expression from FHV subgenomic RNA. Unexpectedly, fusing GFP to the protein A C terminus selectively inhibited production of positive- and negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 but not genomic RNA1 replication. Moreover, changing the first nucleotide of the subgenomic mRNA from G to T selectively inhibited production of positive-strand but not negative-strand RNA3, suggesting that synthesis of negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 may precede synthesis of positive-strand RNA3.","output":"DNA-Directed expression of functional flock house virus RNA1 derivatives in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heterologous gene expression, and selective effects on subgenomic mRNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) is currently the most used measure in clinical practice to monitor cerebral ischaemia in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Although end-tidal carbon dioxide (PET CO2 ) is known as a factor that influences rSO2 , the relationship between PET CO2 and rSO2 has not been quantitatively evaluated in patients with severe arteriosclerosis. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of PET CO2 on rSO2 in patients undergoing CEA under general anaesthesia. METHODS The intervention to change PET CO2 was conducted between skin incision and clamping of the carotid artery. The rSO2 values were observed by changing PET CO2 in the range of 25-45 mmHg. The PET CO2 -rSO2 relationship was characterized by population analysis using a turnover model. RESULTS In total, 1651 rSO2 data points from 30 patients were used to determine the pharmacodynamic characteristics. Hypertension (HTN) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were significant covariates on the slope factor in the stimulatory effect of PET CO2 on rSO2 and fractional turnover rate constant (kout ), respectively. The estimates of the parameters were kout (min-1 ): 3.59 for SBP <90 mmHg and 0.491 for SBP 90 mmHg, slope: 0.00321 for patients with HTN and 0.00664 for patients without HTN. CONCLUSION The presence of HTNattenuates the response of rSO2 after a change in PET CO2 . When cerebral blood flow is in a state of decline caused by a decrease in SBP to <90 mmHg, the response of rSO2 to PET CO2 is increased.

It is a very challenging disease, representing an important cause of morbidity, hospitalization and death in the elderly population. It is widely recognized that AS is the result of a very complex active process, driven by inflammation and involving multifactorial pathological mechanisms promoting valvular calcification and valvular bone deposition. Several evidence suggest that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), the visceral fat depot of the heart, represents a direct source of cytokines and could mediate the deleterious effects of systemic inflammation on the myocardium. Importantly, obesity and metabolic disorders are associated with chronic systemic inflammation leading to a significant increase of EAT amount and to a pro-inflammatory phenotypic shift of this fat depot. It has been hypothesized that the EAT inflammatory state can influence the structure and function of the heart, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of several cardiac diseases, including calcific AS.

However, they require modifications to authoring and editorial processes and pose technical and publishing challenges. Several teams within Cochrane and the international Living Evidence Network have been piloting living systematic reviews. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation with participants involved in six LSRs (three Cochrane and three non-Cochrane). Up to three semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 participants involved with one or more of the pilot LSRs. Interviews explored participants' experiences contributing to the LSR, barriers and facilitators to their conduct and opportunities for future development. Pilot team members also completed monthly surveys capturing time for key tasks and the number of citations screened for each review. RESULTS Across the pilot LSRs, search frequency was monthly to three-monthly, with some using tools such as machine learning and Cochrane Crowd to screen searches. Varied approaches were used to communicate updates to readers. The number of citations screened varied widely between the reviews, from three to 300 citations per month. The amount of time spent per month by the author team on each review also varied from 5 min to 32 h. Participants were enthusiastic to be involved in the LSR pilot. They highlighted the importance of a motivated and well-organised team; the value of technology enablers to improve workflow efficiencies; the need to establish reliable and efficient processes to sustain living reviews; and the potential for saving time and effort in the long run. Participants highlighted challenges with the current publication processes, managing ongoing workload and the lack of resources to support LSRs in the long term.

We examined the potential impact of post-lockdown measures, including physical distancing, mask-wearing and shielding individuals who are the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, on cumulative disease incidence and mortality, and on intensive care unit (ICU)-bed occupancy. While lockdown is effective in containing the viral spread, once lifted, regardless of duration, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound. Both physical distancing and mask-wearing, although effective in slowing the epidemic and in reducing mortality, would also be ineffective in ultimately preventing ICUs from becoming overwhelmed and a subsequent second lockdown. However, these measures coupled with the shielding of vulnerable people would be associated with better outcomes, including lower mortality and maintaining an adequate ICU capacity to prevent a second lockdown.

While corticosteroids and remdesivir are currently recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in the United States, particularly in patients receiving supplemental oxygen, identifying patients likely to respond positively to these treatments is necessary to effectively allocate limited resources and decrease risk of adverse events. This study evaluates the potential of machine learning algorithms to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients most likely to experience a survival benefit from treatment with either corticosteroids or remdesivir. Methods: Two machine learning models were trained separately to identify patients likely to derive a survival benefit from corticosteroid or remdesivir treatment. Models were trained and using XGBoost in Python, using data collected from 10 geographically diverse US hospitals treating COVID-19 patients between January 1 and October 18, 2020. Models were tested on a hold-out test set. Fine-Gray models for the subdistribution hazard were built to assess survival of treated as compared to untreated patients on the whole test set, on those patients being treated with supplemental oxygen, and on patients recommended for treatment by the machine learning algorithm. Inverse probability of treatment weights were used to control for confounding. Results: In the full COVID-19 population, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir were significantly associated with increased survival;the same was true for patients being treated with supplemental oxygen (Table 1). In contrast, corticosteroids and remdesivir were both significantly associated with increased survival time in the algorithm identified sub-populations, with hazard ratios of 0.56 (p = 0.04) and 0.40 (p = 0.04), respectively. Conclusions: Machine learning methods are able to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients for whom corticosteroids or remdesivir are associated with increased survival. These groups benefited more than patients receiving supplemental oxygen, a group for whom these treatments are currently recommended per NIH and IDSA guidelines.

Kinin B1 receptor (B1R) activation has been shown to have a role in the development of hypertension, one of the major etiologies for chronic kidney disease. However, the role of B1R in hypertension induced renal injury and remodeling remains unexplored. Using a DOCA-salt-induced hypertensive mouse model, we investigated whether B1R deficiency reduces hypertensive renal injury and fibrosis. To further recognize the translational role of B1R, we examined the expression of B1R and its correlation with collagen deposition in renal biopsies from control and hypertensive kidney disease patients. Our data indicates that renal B1R expression was upregulated in the kidneys of DOCA-salt hypertensive mice. Genetic ablation of B1R protected the mice from DOCA-salt-induced renal injury and fibrosis by preventing inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidney. Cultured human proximal tubular epithelial cells expressed B1R and stimulation of B1R with an agonist resulted in increased oxidative stress. In human kidney biopsy samples, we found that the B1R immunoreactivity was not only significantly increased in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive patients, but also there is a positive correlation between B1R expression and renal fibrosis levels. Taken together, our results identify a critical role of B1R in the development of inflammation and fibrosis of the kidney in hypertension.","output":"Kinin B1 Receptor Mediates Renal Injury and Remodeling in Hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The financial system in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a history of relative soundness, particularly in banking, due to comparatively strict and enforced domestic supervision, and supported by what has been for the most part a reasonably robust economy. However, the sector is facing challenges of a sluggish economy, need for reform and negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper strives to assess how well the government thus far has responded to the challenges in the financial sector. The working hypothesis is that the insurance industry has improved its position, resulting in higher efficiency and profitability and lower risk. This is an industry historically plagued by too many players, financial issues and less than adequate controls. The analysis undertaken bears out the hypothesis, as revealed by the enhanced contribution made by the industry since the pandemic. Analysis suggests that strides have been made in that industry in terms of helping to diversify the economy with the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, evidence is provided that the sensitivity to changes in oil volumes (rather than to changes in oil prices) is a key risk factor for the financial sector in the KSA. These findings have implications for policy makers in terms of leveraging the pandemic conditions as an opportunity to drive further reform and diversify the economy with lower risk. ? 2021 by the authors.

The value of this approach has never been more evident than during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to (1) establish and implement the infrastructure for longitudinal, virtual follow-up of clinical trial participants, (2) compare changes in smartphone-based assessments, online patient-reported outcomes, and remote expert assessments, and (3) explore novel digital markers of Parkinson's disease disability and progression. METHODS: Participants from two recently completed phase III clinical trials of inosine and isradipine enrolled in Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of Parkinson's Disease trials (AT-HOME PD), a two-year virtual cohort study. After providing electronic informed consent, individuals complete annual video visits with a movement disorder specialist, smartphone-based assessments of motor function and socialization, and patient-reported outcomes online. RESULTS: From the two clinical trials, 226 individuals from 42 states in the United States and Canada enrolled. Of these, 181 (80%) have successfully downloaded the study's smartphone application and 161 (71%) have completed patient-reported outcomes on the online platform. INTERPRETATION: It is feasible to conduct a large-scale, international virtual observational study following the completion of participation in brick-and-mortar clinical trials in Parkinson's disease.

A significant problem with this virus is its high transmission power. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. This aim of this review is to examine orthodontic emergency situations and the necessary strategies and measures for emergency and non-emergency during the coronavirus pandemic. Methods The following databases were comprehensively searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Up-to-date data released by major health organizations such as WHO and major orthodontic associations involved in the pandemic were also evaluated. Results Few studies are conducted on how to manage orthodontic offices or clinics during the pandemic and mostly are not of high quality. Appropriate communication is the most important issue in managing orthodontic patients, particularly virtual counseling. Many cases of orthodontic emergencies can be managed in this way by patients themselves. Most studies recommend using the FFP2 masks, equivalent to N95 masks for non-COVID-19 cases undergoing aerosol-generating procedures and all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases in orthodontic visits. Conclusions At this time, there are no definitive clinical protocols supported by robust evidence for orthodontic practice during COVID-19 pandemic. Orthodontists should not rush to return to routine orthodontic work and should follow state guidelines. Non-emergency orthodontic visits should be suspended during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in high-risk areas.

These data are of particular importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruptions in healthcare processes and may continue to impact cancer care for the foreseeable future. The aim of our study was to characterize the prevalence and clinical significance of diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with HCC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2008 and July 2017 at 2 US health systems. Diagnostic and treatment delays were defined as >90 days between presentation and HCC diagnosis and between diagnosis and treatment, respectively. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with diagnostic and treatment delays and Cox proportional hazard models to identify correlates of overall survival. RESULTS: Of 925 patients with HCC, 39.0% were diagnosed via screening, 33.1% incidentally, and 27.9% symptomatically. Median time from presentation to diagnosis was 37 days (interquartile range, 18-94 days), with 120 patients (13.0%) experiencing diagnostic delays. Median time from HCC diagnosis to treatment was 46 days (interquartile range, 29-74 days), with 17.2% of patients experiencing treatment delays. Most (72.5%) diagnostic delays were related to provider-level factors (eg, monitoring indeterminate nodules), whereas nearly half (46.2%) of treatment delays were related to patient-related factors (eg, missed appointments). In multivariable analyses, treatment delays were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60-1.35); these results were consistent across subgroup analyses by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and treatment modality.

Introduction: FTA is the notation used when patients do not attend their designated outpatient appointment. FTA events waste appointment resources that could have been allocated to another patient and increase clinic waiting lists. Therefore, predicting FTA or identifying mechanisms to improve FTA rates could have both economic and patient benefits. Materials and Methods: Using activity data and patient demographic information from the immunology outpatient services at a large metropolitan hospital in Australia, descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used to investigate whether the telehealth modality or other patient or clinic characteristics had the potential to influence FTA rates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted using a panel set to group individual patient events together to explore the ability of patient characteristics or appointment characteristics to predict FTA events. Ethics approval was received from the Metro South Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/18/QMS/45889). Results: From April 2016 to September 2018, 6,131 appointments occurred, with an overall FTA rate of 16%. Telehealth accounted for 254 or 4.1% of all appointments. When in-person and telehealth modalities were examined separately, the FTA rates were 16.3% and 8.7%, respectively. The greatest predictor of FTA was found to be the modality by which the clinic was delivered, in person or telehealth. Patient-specific characteristics such as Indigenous status, previous FTA behavior, and whether the person was privately funded were also important factors. Discussion and Conclusions: These results indicate that offering appropriate patients the option of telehealth has the potential to reduce FTA. Given the impact of FTA on clinic viability, caseload burden, and waiting lists, telehealth should be explored further and, where possible, should be offered as a routine alternative to in-person appointments.","output":"Does the Choice Between a Telehealth and an In-Person Appointment Change Patient Attendance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Principals play a critical role in improving schools, but high rates of principal turnover threaten improvement gains.

Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country. Hence, this article has two fold objectives: (i) conduct an in-depth statistical analysis of COVID-19 affected patients in India, (ii) propose a mathematical model for the prediction of spread of COVID-19 cases in India. MATERIALS AND METHOD: There has been limited research in modeling and predicting the spread of COVID-19 in India, owing both to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and limited availability of data. Currently famous SIR and non-SIR based Gauss-error-function and Monte Carlo simulation models do not perform well in the context of COVID-19 spread in India. We propose a change-factor or rate-of-change based mathematical model to predict the spread of the pandemic in India, with data drawn from hundreds of sources. RESULTS: Average age of affected patients was found to be 38.54 years, with 66.76% males, and 33.24% females. Most patients were in the age range of 18 to 40 years. Optimal parameter values of the prediction model are identified ( = 1.35, N = 3 and T = 10) by extensive experiments. Over the entire course of time since the outbreak started in India, the model has been 90.36% accurate in predicting the total number of cases the next day, correctly predicting the range in 150 out of the 166 days looked at. CONCLUSION: The proposed system showed an accuracy of 90.36% for prediction since the first COVID-19 case in India, and 96.67% accuracy over the month of April. Predicted number of cases for the next day is found to be a function of the numbers over the last 3 days, but with an increase factor influenced by the last 10 days. It is noticed that males are affected more than females. It is also noticed that in India, the number of people in each age bucket is steadily decreasing, with the largest number of adults infected being the youngest onesa departure from the world trend. The model is self-correcting as it improves its predictions every day, by incorporating the previous day's data into the trend-line for the following days. This model can thus be used dynamically not only to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India, but also to check the effect of various government measures in a short span of time after they are implemented.","output":"Predictive Model with Analysis of the Initial Spread of COVID-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Comorbidities associated with obesity are widely recognized risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes;however, obesity as an independent risk facto","output":"Outcomes of COVID-19 in Patients with Obesity in United States: A Large Research Network Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic gastric clip (GC), a novel pure restrictive procedure, is a safe and effective treatment for morbid obesity.

However, thus far, no analysis of how such barriers affect elderly people with disabilities (PwD) has been conducted. Thus, the study investigates the predictors of eHealth usage among elderly PwD. METHODS: Using data from a 2018 nationwide disability survey comprising 14,798 respondents in Australia, multivariate logistic regression models are used to predict the relationship between eHealth usage and the various characteristics of respondents, including access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), socioeconomic status, and level of education. RESULTS: Although most participants (approximately 88%) have access to ICTs, few (only around 9%) have used eHealth services. The results show a number of factors are associated with an increased likelihood of using eHealth services, including higher educational attainment (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.38, 4.24), employment (OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.94), higher household income (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96), and ICT access (OR = 15.92, 95% CI: 10.51, 27.01). The probability of eHealth use is lower for the oldest-old (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.45). In addition, the estimates from interaction effects suggest the effect of ICT penetration on use of eHealth falls by a negligible amount because of resistive attitudinal barriers (OR = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.06). CONCLUSION: Given the challenges of ageing populations and pandemics, such as COVID-19, eHealth services are a vital part of an effective, inclusive, and robust health care system. This study demonstrates the presence of a significant digital divide among elderly PwD and suggests that public and private efforts should be made to increase the availability of ICT infrastructure.

This paper presents the pandemic management concept, evaluation and adaptation of LMU University Hospital. METHODS: Between July and September 2020 the disaster management team of LMU University Hospital conducted a mixed-method evaluation of the hospitals pandemic management. A workshop series based on the After Action Review working group format was organized to examine the management structure, decision-making processes, documentation, and crisis preparedness response for a second COVID-19 wave. Further, the satisfaction of employees with the hospitals COVID-19 management was examined through an anonymous survey. RESULTS: The workshop series highlighted a need for structural and operational adaptation of the COVID-19 management at LMU University Hospital. The results of the employee survey (N = 2182) provided positive feedback for the measures taken during the first pandemic wave. Specific actions were derived concerning the availability of personal protective equipment and emergency childcare services. A key outcome of both evaluation activities was the identified need for further improvement in communication between stakeholders.

Evidence indicates that symptoms may be reduced by interventions in the workplace. This paper is the first to systematically review psychosocial interventions for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation and behaviours in small-to medium-size enterprises (SMEs). METHODS A systematic search following PRISMA guidelines, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020156275), was conducted for psychosocial interventions targeting depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation/behaviour in SMEs. The PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and two specific occupational health databases were searched, as well as four databases for grey literature, without time limit until 2nd December 2019. RESULTS In total, 1283 records were identified, 70 were retained for full-text screening, and seven met the inclusion criteria: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), three before and after designs and one non-randomised trial, comprising 5111 participants. Study quality was low to moderate according to the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Five studies showed a reduction in depression and anxiety symptoms using techniques based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), two reported no significant change. LIMITATIONS Low number and high heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, high attrition and lack of rigorous RCTs. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence indicates CBT-based interventions can be effective in targeting symptoms of depression and anxiety in SME employees. There may be unique challenges to implementing programmes in SMEs. Further research is needed in this important area.","output":"Workplace interventions to reduce depression and anxiety in small and medium-sized enterprises: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"African trypanosomes are extracellular flagellated unicellular protozoan parasites transmitted by tsetse flies and causing Sleeping Sickness disease in humans and Nagana disease in cattle and other livestock. These diseases are usually characterized by the development of a fatal chronic inflammatory disease if left untreated. During African trypanosome infection and many other infectious diseases, the immune response is mediating a see-saw balance between effective/protective immunity and excessive infection-induced inflammation that can cause collateral tissue damage. African trypanosomes are known to trigger a strong type I pro-inflammatory response, which contributes to peak parasitaemia control, but this can culminate into the development of immunopathologies, such as anaemia and liver injury, if not tightly controlled. In this context, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and the interleukin-10 (IL-10) cytokines may operate as a molecular Yin-Yang in the modulation of the host immune microenvironment during African trypanosome infection, and possibly other infectious diseases. MIF is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine and critical upstream mediator of immune and inflammatory responses, associated with exaggerated inflammation and immunopathology. For example, it plays a crucial role in the pro-inflammatory response against African trypanosomes and other pathogens, thereby promoting the development of immunopathologies. On the other hand, IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, acting as a master regulator of inflammation during both African trypanosomiasis and other diseases. IL-10 is crucial to counteract the strong MIF-induced pro-inflammatory response, leading to pathology control. Hence, novel strategies capable of blocking MIF and/or promoting IL-10 receptor signaling pathways, could potentially be used as therapy to counteract immunopathology development during African trypanosome infection, as well as during other infectious conditions. Together, this review aims at summarizing the current knowledge on the opposite immunopathological molecular Yin-Yang switch roles of MIF and IL-10 in the modulation of the host immune microenvironment during infection, and more particularly during African trypanosomiasis as a paradigm.","output":"The Role of MIF and IL-10 as Molecular Yin-Yang in the Modulation of the Host Immune Microenvironment During Infections: African Trypanosome Infections as a Paradigm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental health challenges are highly prevalent in the post-secondary educational setting. Screening instruments have been shown to improve early detection and intervention. However, these tools often focus on specific diagnosable conditions, are not always designed with students in mind, and lack resource navigational support. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the adaptation of existing psychosocial assessment (HEARTSMAP) tools into a version that is fit-for-purpose for post-secondary students, called HEARTSMAP-U. METHODS: We underwent a three-phase, multi-method tool adaptation process. First, a diverse study team proposed a preliminary version of HEARTSMAP-U and its conceptual framework. Second, we conducted a cross-sectional expert review study with Canadian mental health professionals (N = 28), to evaluate the clinical validity of tool content. Third, we conducted an iterative series of six focus groups with diverse post-secondary students (N = 54), to refine tool content and language, and ensure comprehensibility and relevance to end-users. RESULTS: The adaptation process resulted in the HEARTSMAP-U self-assessment and resource navigational support tool, which evaluates psychosocial challenges across 10 sections. In Phase two, clinician experts expressed that HEARTSMAP-U's content aligned with their own professional experiences working with students. In Phase three, students identified multiple opportunities to improve the tool's end-user relevance by calling for more common language, such as including examples, definitions, and avoiding technical jargon. CONCLUSIONS: The HEARTSMAP-U tool is well-positioned for further studies of its quantitative psychometric properties and clinical utility in the post-secondary educational setting.","output":"HEARTSMAP-U: Adapting a Psychosocial Self-Screening and Resource Navigation Support Tool for Use by Post-secondary Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is going through the scourge of the COVID-19 pandemic since January 2020. However, the pandemic appears to be less severe in highly dengue endemic countries. In this connection, several studies reported that sero-diagnostic tests for DV yielded considerable false-positive results for SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa in dengue endemic regions, thereby indicating towards potential cross-reactivity between these two viruses. We anticipated that SARS-CoV-2 and DV might share antigenic similarity and performed computational docking studies to test this hypothesis. Our results predicted with high confidence that human DV antibodies can indeed, bind to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Some of these interactions can also potentially intercept human ACE2 receptor binding to RBM. Dengue serum samples predating the COVID-19, had been found to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and this provides direct experimental validation of our predictions. Our analysis also showed that m396 and 80R antibodies (against SARS-CoV-1) did not dock with RBM of SARS-CoV-2, a fact already proven experimentally. This confirmed reliability and robustness of our approach. So, it is highly probable that immunological memory/antibodies to DV in endemic countries may reduce the severity and spread of COVID-19. It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will hinder DV infections by binding to DV particles and reduce dengue incidences in the future or, augment DV infection and severity by deploying antibody-dependent enhancement.","output":"Computational modelling supports that Dengue virus envelope antibodies can bind to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding sites: Is pre-exposure to dengue virus protective against COVID-19 severity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has raised the demand for non-contact interactions in most areas of human activities One of the core technologies for non-contact interactions is telepresence that can provide truly immersive interactions between remote participants Many telepresence approaches rely on avatar technology to provide realistic and immersive telepresence experience and hence a lot of research has been conducted on the topic of avatar creation However, it is difficult to host avatar technology on user devices because of extremely large data and computation requirements Cloud-based services can provide sufficient resources to manage avatars but the physical distance between the user and the cloud server introduces latencies that adversely affect service quality In this paper, we propose a telepresence system design suitable for the multi-access edge computing (MEC) environment that can provide large processing power for avatar management with low latency so as to offer immersive telepresence experiences with high quality avatars ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Highly Immersive Telepresence with Computation Offloading to Multi-Access Edge Computing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ureteral stent exchange is usually performed under both fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance.

Still, the goals are consistent: to improve patient experience, lower costs, reduce risk, and provide insights into a wide range of care and management issues. Most health systems face similar challenges, such as margin enhancement, quality improvement, increased access, and fending off disruptive competition. Systemness is a way to address these challenges while improving the overall interdependence of the organization. Although embraced by and advantageous to healthcare organizations, systemness efforts often fail. The obstacles are surmountable when organizations thoroughly analyze the achievable scale of systemness, community resources, and current mindset regarding the good of the whole. Leaders must play a vital role in promoting systemness by providing education and a routine review of day-to-day organizational activities. Sometimes, systemness requires a change in leadership or an updating of leadership skills.Organizations must recognize and assess their culture as it relates to principles of independence versus interdependence, and refocus clinical standardization through best-practice protocols and policies as COVID-19 affects the already-fractured healthcare sector.

While nighttime curfews to control COVID-19 case growth have been implemented in certain regions and cities, few studies have examined their impacts on mobility or COVID-19 incidence. In the second wave of COVID-19, Canada's two largest and adjacent provinces implemented lockdown restrictions with (Quebec) and without (Ontario) a nighttime curfew, providing a natural experiment to study the association between curfews and mobility. Methods: This study spanned from December 1, 2020 to January 23, 2021 and included the populations of Ontario (including Toronto) and Quebec (including Montreal). The intervention of interest was a nighttime curfew implemented across Quebec on January 9, 2021. Unadjusted and adjusted difference-in-differences models (DID) were used to measure the incremental impact of the curfew on nighttime mobility in Quebec as compared to Ontario. Results: The implementation of the curfew was associated with an immediate reduction in nighttime mobility. The adjusted DID analysis indicated that Quebec experienced a 31% relative reduction in nighttime mobility (95%CI: -36% to -25%) compared to Ontario, and that Montreal experienced a 39% relative reduction compared to Toronto (95%CI: -43, -34).

Currently, facility engineers and designers of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems have few analytical tools to estimate a room's leakage area and establish an appropriate flow differential (DeltaQ) in hospitals, shelters, and other facilities where communicable diseases are present. An accurate estimate of leakage area and selection of DeltaQ is essential for ensuring that there is negative pressure (i.e., pressure differential [DeltaP]) between an AIIR and adjoining areas. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated the relationship between DeltaQ and DeltaP in 67 AIIRs across the United States and in simulated AIIR. Data gathered in the simulated AIIR was used to develop an empirical model describing the relationship between DeltaQ, DeltaP, and leakage area. Data collected in health care facilities showed that the model accurately predicted the leakage area 44 of 48 times. Statistical analysis of the model and experimental validation showed that the model effectively estimated the actual leakage area from -39% to +22% with 90% confidence.

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients seen at three radiation oncology departments within the \\"XXXX\\" Health system in \\"XXXX\\" during the initial COVID-19 surge. Primary end points were to define and quantify COVID-related, radiation-specific care changes, and to identify predictive factors of experiencing COVID-related care changes. Results: 545 cancer patients were seen during the study period, 99 of whom (18.1%) experienced >1 COVID-related care change. Radiation treatment (RT) delays were most common, accounting for 51.5% of all care changes. Physician-directed delays accounted for 41.2% of RT delays, while patient fears, COVID testing, and access barriers were responsible for 27.5%, 17.6%, and 13.7%, respectively. Patient age (p=0.040), intent of treatment (p=0.047), and cancer type (p<0.001) were significantly associated with experiencing a COVID-related care change, as we found that older, curative intent, and rectal cancer patients were more likely to experience care changes. On multivariate analysis, patient age remained significant when controlling for treatment intent and cancer type. Conclusion: Our study provides a perspective on how care was adapted to protect cancer patients during a pandemic while maximizing disease control. The positive correlation between age and likelihood of care changes may reflect extra precaution taken with older patients given their vulnerability to severe COVID illness; while the lower observed likelihood of COVID-related care changes among patients undergoing palliative RT may reflect either the more urgent needs addressed by palliative RT or may simply be logistical, as palliative radiation is often delivered in short courses with less exposure risk.

However, although the parentally administered vaccines are very effective at reducing severe disease, they do not induce sterilizing immunity. As the virus continues to circulate around the globe, it is still not clear how long protection will last, nor whether variants will emerge that escape vaccine immunity. Animal models can be useful to complement studies of antigenicity of novel variants and inform decision making about the need for vaccine updates. The Syrian golden hamster is the preferred small animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since virus is efficiently transmitted between hamsters, we developed a transmission challenge model that presents a more natural dose and route of infection than the intranasal challenge usually employed. Our studies demonstrate that an saRNA vaccine based on the earliest Wuhan-like virus spike sequence induced neutralizing antibodies in sera of immunized hamsters at similar titres to those in human convalescent sera or vaccine recipients. The saRNA vaccine was equally effective at abrogating clinical signs in animals who acquired through exposure to cagemates infected either with a virus isolated in summer 2020 or with a representative Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant isolated in December 2020. The vaccine also reduced shedding of infectious virus from the nose, further reinforcing its likely effectiveness at reducing onwards transmission. This model can be extended to test the effectiveness of vaccination in blocking infections with and transmission of novel variants as they emerge.

It has been reported that a water extract of H. cordata exhibits activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), although the mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Previous studies have demonstrated absolute requirement of NF-B activation for efficient replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and inhibition of NF-B activation has been shown to suppress HSV infection. Here we show that a hot water extract of H. cordata (HCWE) inhibits HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-B activation. The IC(50) was estimated at 50 g/ml of lyophilized HCWE powder. At 150 and 450 g/ml, HCWE blocked infectious HSV-2 production by more than 3 and 4 logs, respectively. The inhibitory activity was concomitant with an inhibition of NF-B activation by HSV-2 infection. Although activation of NF-B and Erk MAPK has been implicated for HSV replication and growth, HCWE showed no effect on HSV-2-induced Erk activation. Furthermore, we show that treatment with quercetin, quercitrin or isoquercitrin, major water extractable flavonoids from H. cordata, significantly blocked HSV-2 infection. These results together demonstrated that H. cordata blocks HSV-2 infection through inhibition of NF-B activation.","output":"Houttuynia cordata blocks HSV infection through inhibition of NF-B activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The purpose of this study is to understand Indias demography, level of income, and consumption profile in contemporary times.

Here we have investigated the molecular signature of MetS in urine. METHODS: We used NMR-based metabolomics to investigate a European cohort including urine samples from 11,754 individuals (18C75 years old, 41% females), designed to populate all the intermediate conditions in MetS, from subjects without any risk factor up to individuals with developed MetS (4C5%, depending on the definition). A set of quantified metabolites were integrated from the urine spectra to obtain metabolic models (one for each definition), to discriminate between individuals with MetS. RESULTS: MetS progression produces a continuous and monotonic variation of the urine metabolome, characterized by up- or down-regulation of the pertinent metabolites (17 in total, including glucose, lipids, aromatic amino acids, salicyluric acid, maltitol, trimethylamine N-oxide, and p-cresol sulfate) with some of the metabolites associated to MetS for the first time. This metabolic signature, based solely on information extracted from the urine spectrum, adds a molecular dimension to MetS definition and it was used to generate models that can identify subjects with MetS (AUROC values between 0.83 and 0.87). This signature is particularly suitable to add meaning to the conditions that are in the interface between healthy subjects and MetS patients. Aging and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are also risk factors that may enhance MetS probability, but they do not directly interfere with the metabolic discrimination of the syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Urine metabolomics, studied by NMR spectroscopy, unravelled a set of metabolites that concomitantly evolve with MetS progression, that were used to derive and validate a molecular definition of MetS and to discriminate the conditions that are in the interface between healthy individuals and the metabolic syndrome.

Of 72 patients included, 30 (41.6%) ultimately required MV. Serum ACE2 concentrations >7.8 ng/mL at admission were significantly associated with the need for MV (p = 0.036), inotropic support, and renal replacement therapy. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, elevated ACE2 at admission was associated with the need for MV (OR = 7.49; p = 0.014). To conclude, elevated serum ACE2 concentration early in COVID-19 illness correlates with respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation.

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of two strategies on transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers (HCW) on labor and delivery (L&D). Study Design We developed a decision analytic model comparing universal COVID-19 screening and universal PPE on L&D. Probabilities and costs were derived from the literature. We used individual models to evaluate different scenarios including spontaneous labor, induced labor, and planned cesarean delivery (CD). The primary outcome was the cost to prevent COVID-19 infection in one HCW. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $25,000 to prevent a single infection in an HCW. Results In the base case using a COVID-19 prevalence of 0.36% (the rate in the United States at the time), universal screening is the preferred strategy because while universal PPE is more effective at preventing COVID-19 transmission, it is also more costly, costing $4,175,229 and $3,413,251 to prevent one infection in the setting of spontaneous and induced labor, respectively. For planned CD, universal PPE is cost saving. The model is sensitive to variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 and the cost of PPE. Universal PPE becomes cost-effective at a COVID-19 prevalence of 34.3 and 29.5% and at a PPE cost of $512.62 and $463.20 for spontaneous and induced labor, respectively. At a higher cost-effectiveness threshold, the prevalence of COVID-19 can be lower for universal PPE to become cost-effective. Conclusion Universal COVID-19 screening is generally the preferred option. However, in locations with high COVID-19 prevalence or where the local societal cost of one HCW being unavailable is the highest such as in rural areas, universal PPE may be cost-effective and preferred. This model may help to provide guidance regarding allocation of resources on L&D during these current and future pandemics. Key Points: Universal screening is the preferred strategy for labor. With high prevalence, universal PPE is cost-effective. For planned cesarean, universal PPE is cost saving.","output":"Preventing COVID-19 Transmission on Labor and Delivery: A Decision Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are an excellent eco-friendly fluorescence material, ideal for various ecological testing systems.

The kidneys play a critical part in this process through the maintenance of fluid volume and composition homeostasis, which enables other organs to fulfil their tasks. The renal endothelium exhibits phenotypic and molecular traits that distinguish it from endothelia of other organs. Moreover, the adult kidney vasculature comprises diverse populations of mostly quiescent, but not metabolically inactive, endothelial cells (ECs) that reside within the kidney glomeruli, cortex and medulla. Each of these populations supports specific functions, for example, in the filtration of blood plasma, the reabsorption and secretion of water and solutes, and the concentration of urine. Transcriptional profiling of these diverse EC populations suggests they have adapted to local microenvironmental conditions (hypoxia, shear stress, hyperosmolarity), enabling them to support kidney functions. Exposure of ECs to microenvironment-derived angiogenic factors affects their metabolism, and sustains kidney development and homeostasis, whereas EC-derived angiocrine factors preserve distinct microenvironment niches. In the context of kidney disease, renal ECs show alteration in their metabolism and phenotype in response to pathological changes in the local microenvironment, further promoting kidney dysfunction. Understanding the diversity and specialization of kidney ECs could provide new avenues for the treatment of kidney diseases and kidney regeneration.","output":"Phenotypic diversity and metabolic specialization of renal endothelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high comorbidity between cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (CVMD) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the consequent high mortality and the potential risk of cardiovascular damage have brought great challenges to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the condition. The latest studies found that advanced age, immune function defects, inflammatory factor storms and oxidative stress damage all potentially contribute to the high comorbidity of the two. Direct virus invasion, myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance and vascular endothelial and coagulation dysfunction may be important mechanisms for cardiovascular injury in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the expression level of ACE2 (the cell membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in various organs and the peripheral blood not only mediates the direct invasion and damage of the organs, but also participates in regulation of the balance of systematic inflammation and oxidative stress, thus affecting the susceptibility and outcomes of the patients.

Our previous study demonstrated that the interaction between the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), an enveloped virus with great medical impact, can form IBs. In this study, we found that small IBs can fuse with each other to form large IBs that enhance viral replication. Furthermore, we found that acetylated -tubulin interacts with the N-P complex and colocalizes with IBs of HPIV3 but does not interact with the N-P complex of human respiratory syncytial virus or vesicular stomatitis virus and does not colocalize with IBs of human respiratory syncytial virus. Most importantly, enhancement of -tubulin acetylation using the pharmacological inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of the deacetylase enzymes histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), or expression of -tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (-TAT1) resulted in the fusion of small IBs into large IBs and effective viral replication. In contrast, suppression of acetylation of -tubulin by overexpressing HDAC6 and SIRT2 profoundly inhibited the fusion of small IBs and viral replication. Our findings offer previously unidentified mechanistic insights into the regulation of viral IB fusion by acetylated -tubulin, which is critical for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Inclusion bodies (IBs) are unique structures generated by viral proteins and some cellular proteins as a platform for efficient viral replication. Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is a nonsegmented single-stranded RNA virus that mainly causes lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. However, no vaccines or antiviral drugs for HPIV3 are available. Therefore, understanding virus-host interactions and developing new antiviral strategies are increasingly important. Acetylation on lysine (K) 40 of -tubulin is an evolutionarily conserved modification and plays an important role in many cellular processes, but its role in viral IB dynamics has not been fully explored. To our knowledge, our findings are the first to show that acetylated -tubulin enhances viral replication by regulating HPIV3 IB fusion.","output":"Inclusion Body Fusion of Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 Regulated by Acetylated -Tubulin Enhances Viral Replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efficacy of vaccination to prevent a huge widespread SARS-CoV2 infection is quite undoubtedly assessed by recent data and reports, yet the co-existence of naturally immunized (serum positive, SP) non-vaccinated people, SP vaccinated people and na?ve (serum negative) people, should thoroughly revise our epidemiological overview and data interpretation about social contacts and even restriction measures.

Furthermore, Ang II treatment enhanced mice myocardial I/R injury, which was reversed by caveolin-1 (CAV-1)-shRNA or strengthened by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-shRNA.

However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients. Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs.

These guidelines subsume holistic evidence based on recommendations to diagnose, treat, prevent and manage acute exacerbation with COPD. Despite the existing comprehensive recommendations, readmission rates and hospitalisations have increased in the last decade. Evidence to date has reported suboptimal clinical guidelines concordance. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is a common hospital presentation due to varied causes such as infective exacerbations, worsening disease condition, medication non-adherence, lack of education and incomprehensive discharge planning. AECOPD directly and indirectly causes economic burden, disrupts health-related quality of life (HRQol), hasten lung function decline and increases overall morbidity and mortality. COPD being a multimodal chronic disease, consistent interdisciplinary interventions from the time of admission to discharge may reduce readmissions and enhance HRQol among these patients and their families. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol adheres to the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for mixed methods systematic reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines.

Expert contributors to this volume address interconnections between the COVID-19 crisis and human rights to equality and non-discrimination, including historical responses to pandemics, populism and authoritarianism, and the rights to health, information, water and the environment. Highlighting the dangerous potential for derogations from human rights, authors further scrutinize the human rights compliance of new legislation and policies in relation to issues such as privacy, protection of persons with disabilities, freedom of expression, and access to medicines. Acknowledging the pandemic as a defining moment for human rights, the volume proposes a post-crisis human rights agenda to engage civil society and government at all levels in concrete measures to roll back increasing inequality.

The inability of these therapies to mitigate the devastating effects of this condition indicates that the initial hypotheses for sepsis pathophysiology may have been misconstrued or inadequately addressed. Two major explanations have been proposed: 1) Septic patients have mainly been treated as a group despite the extreme heterogeneity characterizing this population [1]; 2) The postulate that death after sepsis is solely due to an overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune response may actually be inaccurate [1, 3]. Indeed, several lines of evidence have now established that death from septic shock is probably due to the effect of distinct mechanisms over time [1C3]. Early in the course of the disease, a massive release of inflammatory mediators (normally designed to trigger an immune response against pathogens) is occurring that may be responsible for organ dysfunction and hypoperfusion [1, 3]. Concomitantly, the body develops compensatory mechanisms to prevent overwhelming inflammation and dampen an overzealous anti-infectious response [1C3]. These negative feedback mechanisms, although having protective effects during the first initial hours, may paradoxically become deleterious as they persist over time leading to immune paralysis (Fig. 1) [1, 3].

The aim of this work is to evaluate the relative exposure to SARS-CoV 2 in a set of virtual scenarios representing enclosed and semi-enclosed terraces under different outdoor meteorological conditions. For this purpose, indoor CO2 concentration is used as a proxy for the risk assessment. Airflow and people exhaled CO2 in different scenarios are simulated through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling with Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach. Both spatial average concentrations and local concentrations are analyzed. In general, spatial average concentrations decrease as ventilation increases, however, depending on the people arrangement inside the terrace, spatial average concentrations and local concentrations can be very different. Therefore, for assessing the relative exposure to SARS-CoV 2 it is necessary to consider the indoor flow patterns between infectors and susceptibles. This research provides detailed information about CO2 dispersion in enclosed/semi-enclosed scenarios, which can be very useful for reducing the transmission risk through better natural ventilation designs and improving the classic risk models since it allows to check their hypotheses in real-world scenarios.

This perturbation causes the dispersion of a Gaussian wave packet, which is reflected in the coordinate-space and the momentum-space Shannon entropies, the latter being a measure for the amount of information available on a system. Regarding the sum of the two quantities, one arrives at an entropy that is related to the coordinate-momentum uncertainty. Whereas in the harmonic case, this entropy is strictly periodic and can be evaluated analytically, this behavior is lost if disorder is added. There, at selected times, the quantum mechanical probability density resembles that of a classical oscillator distribution function, and the entropy assumes larger values.

It is well established that lipid-overloaded adipose tissue produces a large range of secreted molecules that contribute a pro-inflammatory microenvironment which subsequently disseminates towards multi-organ metabolic homeostasis disruption. Besides physiopathological contribution of adipose-derived molecules, a new paradigm is emerging following the discovery that adipocytes have a propensity to extrude damaged mitochondria in the extracellular space, to be conveyed through the blood and taken up by cell acceptors, in a process called intercellular mitochondria transfer.

Methods: Our study included all children from 28 days to 15 years old with respiratory tract infections who were admitted to the Department of Respiration, in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University, between January 2018 and December 2020. Human rhinovirus (HRV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and human bocavirus (HBoV) were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR); In parallel, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and bacteria were detected by culture in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage specimen, and pleural fluid. Results: Compared to 2018 and 2019, the pathogen detection rate was significantly lower in 2020. With regard to infections caused by single pathogens, in 2020, the detection rates of MP were the lowest and those of HRV were the highest when compared to those in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, the positive rates of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hMPV reported in 2020 were less than those recorded in 2018 but similar to those recorded in 2019. Also, the 2020 rate of adenovirus (ADV) was lower than that recorded in 2019, but similar to that recorded in 2018. There were no statistical differences in the positive rates of HBoV and PIV III over the 3 years surveyed. Infections in infants were significantly less common in 2020, but no significant difference was found among children aged 1 to 3 years. The detection rate of pathogens in children old than 5 years in 2020 was significantly lower than those recorded in the previous 2 years. Notably, the pathogen detection rates in the first and second quarters of 2020 were similar to those recorded in the previous 2 years; however, the rates were reduced in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. As for co-infections, the positive rate was at its lowest in 2020. In the previous 2 years, viralCMP was the most common type of mixed infection. By contrast, in 2020, viralCviral infections were the most common combination. Conclusion: The pathogen detection rate was significantly reduced in Suzhou City during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed discharge outcomes (reported in our 'Get With the Guidelines-Stroke' database) in patients with an admission NIHSS score of 0-7 due to proximal intracranial large vessel occlusion (based on CT angiography results) who were excluded from receiving intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular intra-arterial (IA) stroke interventions. RESULTS Among the 204 patients included in our analysis, younger age and lower admission NIHSS score (0-4 range) were strong predictors of good outcome (defined as ability to ambulate independently) at discharge whereas female sex was a predictor of poor outcome. There was no significant difference between cerebrovascular risk factors, specific sites of occlusion, or presenting symptoms and outcomes at discharge. There was great variability in functional outcomes at discharge and discharge disposition (home versus acute or subacute facility or nursing home versus death/hospice) with a trend toward worse outcomes in patients with higher (5-7 range) NIHSS scores on admission. CONCLUSIONS Patients with acute stroke due to large vessel occlusion and low admission NIHSS scores (0-7 range) may have poor functional outcomes at discharge.

We aim to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on ED visits for acute otolaryngologic complaints in New York City, one of the first epicenters of the pandemic in the US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients who presented to the ED with a primary diagnosis of an acute otolaryngologic complaint between March 1 and May 31 in 2019 and 2020. This was a multicenter study, including two tertiary care hospital systems encompassing Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Long Island. RESULTS: A total of 10,162 patients were identified. Significantly fewer patients presented to the ED for acute otolaryngologic complaints in 2020 (7332 vs 2830, p < 0.001). The rate of total otolaryngology-related ED visits was decreased by a factor of 0.635 (95% CI 0.6079 to 0.6634). In a subgroup analysis of each individual diagnosis, there was a significant decrease in rate of ED visits for 13 out of 18 diagnoses, including for life-threatening conditions, such as anaphylaxis. There was no significant difference based on which borough in New York City. Pediatric patients (age 0C17) were more significantly impacted by the pandemic compared to other age groups. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction in the utilization of ED for acute otolaryngologic complaints, including those requiring emergent management, and an even more significant reduction in the pediatric population.

Here, we follow the population dynamics of Vibrio cholerae in a mouse model by labeling individual bacteria with one of >500 unique, fitness-neutral genomic tags. Using the changes in tag frequencies and CFU numbers, we inform a mathematical model that describes the within-host spatiotemporal bacterial dynamics. This allows us to disentangle growth, death, forward, and retrograde migration rates continuously during infection. Our model has robust predictive power across various experimental setups. The population dynamics of V. cholerae shows substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in replication, death, and migration. Importantly, we find that the niche available to V. cholerae in the host increases with inoculum size, suggesting cooperative effects during infection. Therefore, it is not enough to consider just the likelihood of exposure (50% infectious dose) but rather the magnitude of exposure to predict outbreaks. IMPORTANCE Determining the rates of bacterial migration, replication, and death during infection is important for understanding how infections progress. Separately measuring these rates is often difficult in systems where multiple processes happen simultaneously. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to measure V. cholerae migration, replication, death, and niche size along the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We show that the small intestine of the mouse is a heterogeneous environment, and the population dynamic characteristics change substantially between adjacent gut sections. Our approach also allows us to characterize the effect of inoculum size on these processes. We find that the niche size in mice increases with the infectious dose, hinting at cooperative effects in larger inocula. The dose-response relationship between inoculum size and final pathogen burden is important for the infected individual and is thought to influence the progression of V. cholerae epidemics.","output":"The Infectious Dose Shapes Vibrio cholerae Within-Host Dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify and characterize aetiologic agent(s) associated with an outbreak of a severe diarrhoea in piglets in Jiangxi, China, in March 2015, a nested reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT\\\\PCR) for the detection of porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was developed.

Therefore, we aimed to systematically review literature investigating the illness perceptions, perceived stigmatisation, and negative emotional reactions toward IBD within patient and community samples. We also aimed to review how these factors impact those living with IBD (i.e. adjustment, psychological health). Design: A range of databases (e.g. Psych INFO, PubMed) were searched over two years. One reviewer individually screened titles and abstracts using the specified inclusion criteria, and this process was repeated by a second reviewer. Subsequently, the full text articles were screened and data were extracted for the 82 articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Following data extraction, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: The review of 82 studies suggested that negative illness perceptions are linked to poorer psychosocial outcomes, that patient samples frequently anticipate stigmatisation, fear relating to bowel accidents was the most common emotion reported, and that the general public direct little enacted stigma towards IBD. Conclusion: For people living with IBD: (i) poorer psychological adjustment was reported by those who held more negative perceptions and reactions toward their illness; and (ii) their concerns regarding public perceptions of IBD warrants further empirical attention.

Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are prototypically antiviral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-1 and Card9- and type I and III interferon signaling-dependent manner, respectively. During aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells were not detected, pDCs regulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and conidial killing. Thus, pDCs act as positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity against inhaled mold conidia.","output":"During Aspergillus Infection, Monocyte-Derived DCs, Neutrophils, and Plasmacytoid DCs Enhance Innate Immune Defense through CXCR3-Dependent Crosstalk"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic.In this study, we aimed to evaluate the risk factors of death from severe and critical COVID-19 patients.

There has been significant progress in reducing the risk of brucellosis, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Rabies, West Nile fever, Q fever, and cystic hydatid disease have been confined to wildlife or livestock. Results: There is an increasing threat of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses in Oman due to globalization of travel and trade, development activities, and impact of climate change and vector bionomics. Prevention, control, and subsequent elimination of zoonoses on a sustainable basis shall not be possible without intersectoral collaboration between the human and animal health sectors. There are challenges for establishing such strong collaboration and coordination mechanisms in Oman. Institutional and cultural barriers, data and resource sharing, and national capability for rapid and effective investigation of zoonotic infections and emerging zoonoses in humans and animal reservoirs are among others. Conclusions: In the light of achievements made on the prevention and control of zoonoses in Oman during the past decades, priority zoonoses should be identified for elimination, and continuous efforts should be made to further strengthen a holistic multidisciplinary and multisectorial approach for controlling zoonoses at source.

Results The total number of dentists increased from 3739 in 1986 to 14,717 in 2018. The total number of hospital dentists increased from 809 in 1986 to 2121 in 2018. However, the proportion of hospital dentists in the total number of dentists decreased from 21.64% in 1986 to 14.41% in 2018. On the contrary, the total number of dental clinic dentists increased from 2930 in 1986 to 12,596 in 2018. The proportion of dental clinic dentists in the total number of dentists increased from 78.36% in 1986 to 85.59% in 2018.

The CPA, by targeting the public and health professionals, amongst others, could also promote the consumption of industrial foods, including ultra-processed ones, which is known to lead to ill-health. The purpose of the present study was to map the actors, history and the CPA of the baby food industry in France. Methods The study consisted of an analysis of publicly available information for data published between May 2019 and April 2021. Interviews with key informants from academia, civil society and the government served to triangulate that information. For both parts of the study, a qualitative thematic analysis was conducted, using an existing classification of the CPA. Results During the study period, Danone and Nestl used action-based instrumental strategies'. The most prominent strategy was information strategy', used to fund, produce, and disseminate industry-preferred information. Danone and Nestl were further found to establish relationships with key opinion leaders and health organisations', such as pediatric societies, seek involvement in community', especially during the Covid-19 crisis and used voluntary commitments, a practice that may help avoid the mandatory regulation of their harmful products and practices. The companies also employed argument-based discursive strategies' to frame the debate on diet- and public health-related issues. Conclusions These findings can be used to recognize, anticipate, and address CPA practices that may negatively influence infant, child and maternal health, by ensuring that the commercial interests of the industry do not prevail over public health goals. Key messages The baby food industry uses a range of political practices in France, which may negatively influence infant, child and maternal health. This study seeks to uncover and describe these practices. This research will serve us both for the political environment, an advocacy work, but also to broaden scientific knowledge on the subject, in France and internationally.","output":"Corporate political activity of the baby food industry in France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Betel cultivation is very popular in West Bengal.

In rural India, such decisions are usually made by young physicians who are less experienced and often miss relevant data points required for appropriate decision making. In our setting, before the quality improvement (QI) initiative, this information was recorded on loose blank sheets (first information sheets (FIS)) where an initial clinical history, physical examination and investigations were recorded. The mean FIS completeness, at baseline, was 73.95% (1C5 January 2020) with none of the FIS being fully complete. Our objective was to increase the FIS completeness to >90% and to increase the number of FIS that were fully complete over a 9-month period. METHODS: With the help of a prioritisation matrix, the QI team decided to tackle the problem of incomplete FIS. The team then used fishbone analysis and identified that the main causes of incomplete FIS were that the interns did not know what to document and would often forget some data points. Change ideas to improve FIS completeness were implemented using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, and ultimately, a checklist (referred to as antenatal care (ANC) checklist) was implemented. The study was divided into six phases, and after every phase, a few FIS were conveniently sampled for completeness. RESULTS: FIS completeness improved to 86.34% (p<0.001) in the post implementation phase (1 Feb to 31 August 2020), and in this phase, 69.72% of the FIS were documented using the ANC checklist. The data points that saw the maximum improvement were relating to the physical examination. CONCLUSION: The use of ANC checklist increased FIS completeness. Interns with no prior clinical and QI experience can effectively lead and participate in QI initiatives.

Possible pancreatic involvement has recently been observed in these patients; however, its significance is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of significantly elevated lipase with disease outcomes. METHODS: Data about demographics, symptoms, laboratory values, and clinical outcomes were collected for 1,003 consecutive patients testing positive for COVID-19. Elevated lipase was defined as greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (>3  ULN). Baseline characteristics among patients with or without elevated lipase were compared using Fisher exact test or Student t-test for categorical or numerical variables, respectively. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of lipase levels with primary clinical outcomes (intensive care unit admission and intubation) adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, history of diabetes, and hypertension. RESULTS: Of 1,003 patients with COVID-19, 83 had available lipase levels and were all admitted to the hospital. Of 83, 14 (16.8%) had elevated lipase (>3  ULN), which was associated with higher rates of leukocytosis (P < 0.001) and abnormal liver enzymes (P < 0.01). Compared with lower lipase levels (<3  ULN), patients with elevated lipase had higher rates of ICU admission (92.9% vs 32.8%; P < 0.001) and intubation (78.6% vs 23.5%; P 0.002). In a multivariable-adjusted model, higher lipase levels were significantly associated with admission to the ICU and rate of intubation.

However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested.

A significant portion of COVID-19 patients develop pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating ventilator support. Some health systems do not have the capacity to accommodate this surge in ventilator demand, leading to shortages and inevitable mortality. Some clinicians have, of necessity, jerry-rigged ventilators to support multiple patients, but these devices lack protected air streams or individualized controls for each patient. Moreover, some have not been tested under conditions of ARDS. We have developed the Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE), a rapidly deployable platform to more safely use a single ventilator to simultaneously support multiple critically-ill patients. The iSAVE enables patient-specific volume and pressure control and incorporates safety features to mitigate cross-contamination between patients and flow changes due to patient interdependencies within the respiratory circuit. Here we demonstrate through simulated and in vivo pig evaluation the capacity of the iSAVE to support a range of respiratory clinical states. By leveraging off-the-shelf components that are readily available to intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, the iSAVE could potentially be translated for human application to expand the ventilation capacity of hospitals using existing ventilators, minimizing the need to procure additional ventilators.","output":"Individualized System for Augmenting Ventilator Efficacy (iSAVE): A Rapidly deployable system to expand ventilator capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) studies have examined glutamatergic abnormalities in schizophrenia, mostly in single voxels. Though the critical brain nodes remain unknown, schizophrenia involves networks with broad abnormalities.

Three dimensional (1)H-MRS was acquired in young schizophrenia subjects (N = 36, 19 antipsychotic-na?ve and 17 antipsychotic-treated) and healthy controls (HC, N = 29). Glx (as well as N-acetylaspartate, choline, myo-inositol and creatine) group contrasts from all individual voxels that met spectral quality, were analyzed in common brain space, followed by cluster-corrected level alpha-value (CCLAV  0.05). Schizophrenia subjects had lower Glx in the left superior (STG) and middle temporal gyri (16 voxels, CCLAV = 0.04) and increased creatine in two clusters involving left temporal, parietal and occipital regions (32, and 18 voxels, CCLAV = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively). Antipsychotic-treated and na?ve patients (vs HC) had similar Glx reductions (8/16 vs 10/16 voxels respectively, but CCLAVs > 0.05). However, creatine was higher in antipsychotic-treated vs HCs in a larger left hemisphere cluster (100 voxels, CCLAV = 0.01).

We grouped mild and moderate cases together as non-severe cases and categorized severe and critical cases together as severe cases. We compared characteristics of severe cases and non-severe cases of COVID-19 and explored risk factors for severity. RESULTS: The total number of cases were 12 647 with age from less than 1 year old to 99 years old. The severe cases were 1662 (13.1%), the median age of severe cases was 57 years [Inter-quartile range(IQR): 46C68] and the median age of non-severe cases was 43 years (IQR: 32C54). The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were being male [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2C1.5]; fever (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 2.0C2.7), cough (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2C1.6), fatigue (aOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.2C1.5), and chronic kidney disease (aOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4C4.6), hypertension (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2C1.8) and diabetes (aOR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.6C2.4). With the increase of age, risk for the severity was gradually higher [20C39 years (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.8C8.4), 40C59 years (aOR = 7.6, 95% CI: 3.6C16.3),  60 years (aOR = 20.4, 95% CI: 9.5C43.7)], and longer time from symtem onset to diagnosis [3C5 days (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2C1.7), 6C8 days (aOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.5C2.1),  9 days(aOR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.6C2.3)]. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed the risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 with large sample size, which included being male, older age, fever, cough, fatigue, delayed diagnosis, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney diasease, early case identification and prompt medical care. Based on these factors, the severity of COVID-19 cases can be predicted. So cases with these risk factors should be paid more attention to prevent severity.

We developed an Online Smart Communicative Education System and aimed to explore the factors that affect the perceptions of both teachers and students for teaching and learning. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-year cross-sectional cohort study was undertaken. The program includes three parts. Part I Pre-OSCE: an online flipped class in preparation for task-related knowledge and skills. Part II OSCE-day: 10 tasks in one track formative OSCE. Part III Post-OSCE: extended online feedback for participants with further questions after the exam and raters with more feedback after reviewing their performance online. Principal component analysis with varimax rotation was performed to analyze the perceptions of students and teachers to the Online System by means of questionnaires. RESULTS: Seventy-six pharmacy students (male 32.9%) took the exam and 24 raters (male, 25%) participated in the scoring during the OSCEs. The mean G coefficient was 0.88. Seventy-six questionnaires from the students were obtained for the analysis. Results explained the cumulative variance of 73.9% for component (1) Effects of extended online feedback: 40% and (2) Facilitation of learning: 33.9%. Thirty-nine questionnaires from the raters who experienced the Online System were obtained for the analysis (male 23.1%). Results explained a cumulative variance of 77.3% for component (1) Effects of extended online feedback: 36.6%, (2) Facilitation of scoring and feedback: 24.5%, and (3) Feasibility of online platform: 16.2%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated good reliability for digitizing the scoring system with educational support to facilitate teaching. Effects of extended online feedback was the major aspect in explaining the variance from the perceptions of students and raters by factor analysis. In comparison with traditional formative OSCEs, extended online feedback is a novel approach, which extends the process of learning and teaching among the learners and raters and overcomes the barriers of time limitation and distance.","output":"Digitizing Scoring Systems With Extended Online Feedback: A Novel Approach to Interactive Teaching and Learning in Formative OSCE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid personal protective equipment shortage, clinicians, nurses, and other frontline workers across the world have faced threatening and/or firing for self-protection during this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Alternative models are being explored to better meet the needs of patients and providers. OB Nest is a telemedicine-enhanced program with a reduced frequency of in-person prenatal visits. The cost implications of connected care services added to prenatal care packages are unclear. METHODS: Using data from the OB Nest randomized, controlled trial we analyzed the provider and staff time associated with prenatal care in the traditional and OB Nest models. Fewer visits were required for OB Nest, but given the compensatory increase in connected care activity and supplies, the actual cost difference is not known. Nursing and provider staff time was prospectively recorded for all patients enrolled in the OB Nest clinical trial. Published 2015 national wages for healthcare workers were used to calculate the actual labor cost of providing either traditional or OB Nest prenatal care in 2015 US dollars. Overhead expenses and opportunity costs were not considered. RESULTS: Total provider cost was decreased caring for the OB Nest participants, but nursing cost was increased. OB Nest care required an average of 160.8 (+/? 45.0) minutes provider time and 237 (+/? 25.1) minutes nursing time, compared to 215.0 (+/? 71.6) and 99.6 (+/? 29.7) minutes for traditional prenatal care (P < 0.01). This translated into decreased provider cost and increased nursing cost (P < 0.01). Supply costs increased, travel costs declined, and overhead costs declined in the OB Nest model. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, labor cost for OB Nest prenatal care was 34% higher than for traditional prenatal care. The increased cost is largely attributable to additional nursing connected care time, and in some practice settings may be offset by decreased overhead costs and increased provider billing opportunities. Future efforts will be focused on development of digital solutions for some routine nursing tasks to decrease the overall cost of the model.

Many of these studies focused on reporting initial results of algorithms that were assembled from commonly used components. The choice of these components was often pragmatic rather than systematic. For instance, several studies used 2D CNNs even though these might not be optimal for handling 3D CT volumes. This paper identifies a variety of components that increase the performance of CNN-based algorithms for COVID-19 grading from CT images. We investigated the effectiveness of using a 3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN, of using transfer learning to initialize the network, of providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network input, and of predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D CNN with these components achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934 on our test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.923 on a publicly available set of 742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously published 2D CNN. An ablation study demonstrated that in addition to using a 3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN transfer learning contributed the most and continuous output contributed the least to improving the model performance.","output":"Improving Automated COVID-19 Grading with Convolutional Neural Networks in Computed Tomography Scans: An Ablation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"38 Figure 1HFVC referral sources and patient frailty, medication and co-morbidity status[Figure omitted.

Specifically, the paper assesses the attitudes and intentions of students in second-cycle institutions to accept e-learning after the pandemic, using constructs derived from the health belief model and technology acceptance model. Also, we test if there is any significant difference in the attitudes and intentions of students in public and private institutions. Using data collected from 370 students in upper and lower levels of a second-cycle institutions in Ghana, we found that student attitude is significantly influenced by perceived usefulness and moderately affected by perceived severity, whereas, students intention is moderately affected by the perceived severity but substantially influenced by the students attitude towards usage. Also, the results revealed that students attitudes and intentions to use e-learning are moderately affected by the severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, there were no significant differences in the attitudes and intentions of the sampled students in public and private second-cycle institutions in Ghana, regarding their acceptance and usage of e-learning after the COVID-19 emergency. Given the studys findings, the paper concludes that students attitudes and intention to use e-learning are the main determinants that will influence the students acceptance of the e-learning system of education in second-cycle institutions in Ghana after the COVID-19 emergency.

Consistent with the Lucas paradox, the present work establishes that financial integration can reduce the speed of capital accumulation and increase savings in a developing country still in the process of convergence toward the steady state and with domestic capital market distortions. The level of capital accumulation at the time of integration crucially affects agents welfare. The closer the economy is to its steady state, the lower are agents welfare gains in the financially less advanced economy, while they are always negative in the more developed country. Two forces drive these results: precautionary saving and the propensity to move resources from risky capital to safe assets until the risk-adjusted return on capital equalizes the risk-free interest rate.

Complement activation generates membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC causes channel formation to the cell membrane of pathogen, leading to death of microorganisms. In the host, MAC also may induce channel formation to innocent bystander endothelial cells (ECs) and ECs cannot be protected. This provokes endotheliopathy, which activates two independent molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. Activated inflammatory pathway promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines and triggers inflammation. Activated microthrombotic pathway mediates platelet activation and exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) from ECs and initiates microthrombogenesis. Excessively released ULVWF become anchored to ECs as long elongated strings and recruit activated platelets to assemble platelet-ULVWF complexes and form microthrombi. These microthrombi strings trigger disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology of endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD). Sepsis-induced endotheliopathy promotes inflammation and DIT. Inflammation produces inflammatory response and DIT orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a combined phenotype of inflammation and endotheliopathy-associated (EA)-VMTD.

Methods: : 72 patients confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV from multiple medical centers in western China were retrospectively analyzed, including epidemiologic characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and HRCT chest features. Results: : All patients had lung parenchymal abnormalities on HRCT scans, which were mostly multifocal in both lungs and asymmetric in all patients, and were mostly in the peripheral or subpleural lung regions in 52 patients (72.22%), in the central lung regions in sixteen (22.22%), and in both lungs, with \\"white lung \\"manifestations in four (5.56%). Subpleural multifocal consolidation was predominant abnormality in 38 patients (52.78%). Ground-glass opacity was seen in 34 patients (47.22%). Interlobular septal thickening was found in 18patients, of which eight had only generally mild thickening with no zonal predominance. Reticulation was seen in 8 patients (11.11%), in all of whom it was mild and randomly distributed. In addition, both lungs of 28 patients had two or three CT imaging features. Out of these 72 patients, 36 were diagnosed as early stage, 32 patients as progressive stage and 4 patient as severe stage pneumonia.

The Contour device is designed to target the neck of an aneurysm and cause flow disruption within the aneurysm hence promoting thrombosis and neo-endothelialization at the neck. This article presents initial experiences with the Contour. METHODS The prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients treated with the Contour device. Demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, clinical result, and clinical and radiological follow-up information were recorded. RESULTS The review identified 3 patients (2 female), with 3 unruptured aneurysms, of average age 67  8.7 years (range 62-77 years). The aneurysms were all located in the anterior circulation including one pericallosal, one at the A1-2 junction and one on the ICA bifurcation.

The relationship between the VHI and vaccine coverage in people aged 12+years (as of 24/06/2021) was determined using Spearman correlation. The indices were split into quintiles, and MSOAs in with the highest vulnerability and vaccine hesitancy quintiles were mapped.Findings: The SEVI showed a strong relationship with case rates in the validation dataset across the whole study period, and for every intervening period studied except early in the pandemic when testing was highly selective. The SEVI was more strongly correlated with case rates than any of its domains and outperformed an existing MSOA-level vulnerability index. The VHI was significantly negatively correlated with vaccine coverage in the validation data at the time of writing (r -043 95% CI -046 to -041). London had the largest number and proportion of MSOAs in quintile 5 of SEVI and VHI concurrently.Interpretation: The indices presented offer an efficacious way of identifying geographical disparities in COVID-19 risk, thus helping focus resources according to need.Funding Information: Grant from Integrated Covid Hub North East.Declaration of Interests: DS and CW are part-funded by a Department of Health and Social Care grant to the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for the Integrated COVID Hub North East for the purposes of local pandemic response, paid via the University of Newcastle (the primary employer of all authors).

Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.

In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective investigation of hospitalized older patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1, 2020, to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 203 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 54 years (interquartile range, 41-68; range, 20-91 years). Men accounted for 108 (53.2%) of the cases, and 55 patients (27.1%) were >65 years of age. Among patients who were 65 years and older, the mortality rate was 34.5% (19/55), which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at 4.7% (7/148). Common symptoms of older patients with COVID-19 included fever (94.5%; n=52), dry cough (69.1%; n=38), and chest distress (63.6%; n=35). Compared with young patients, older patients had more laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities. Through a multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that males, comorbidities, time from disease onset to hospitalization, abnormal kidney function, and elevated procalcitonin levels were all significantly associated with death.

Studies have found that common vaccine exposures may be missing from structured data elements of electronic health records (EHRs), instead being captured in clinical notes. This impacts monitoring of adverse events following immunizations (AEFIs). For example, COVID-19 vaccines have been regularly administered outside of traditional medical settings. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to mine unstructured clinical notes for vaccinations not captured in structured EHR data. Methods: A random sample of 1,000 influenza vaccine administrations, representing 995 unique patients, was extracted from a large U.S. EHR database. NLP techniques were used to detect administrations from the clinical notes in the training dataset [80% (N = 797) of patients]. The algorithm was applied to the validation dataset [20% (N = 198) of patients] to assess performance. Full medical charts for 28 randomly selected administration events in the validation dataset were reviewed by clinicians. The NLP algorithm was then applied across the entire dataset (N = 995) to quantify the number of additional events identified. Results: A total of 3,199 administrations were identified in the structured data and clinical notes combined. Of these, 2,740 (85.7%) were identified in the structured data, while the NLP algorithm identified 1,183 (37.0%) administrations in clinical notes; 459 were not also captured in the structured data. This represents a 16.8% increase in the identification of vaccine administrations compared to using structured data alone. The validation of 28 vaccine administrations confirmed 27 (96.4%) as definite vaccine administrations; 18 (64.3%) had evidence of a vaccination event in the structured data, while 10 (35.7%) were found solely in the unstructured notes. Discussion: We demonstrated the utility of an NLP algorithm to identify vaccine administrations not captured in structured EHR data. NLP techniques have the potential to improve detection of vaccine administrations not otherwise reported without increasing the analysis burden on physicians or practitioners. Future applications could include refining estimates of vaccine coverage and detecting other exposures, population characteristics, and outcomes not reliably captured in structured EHR data.","output":"The Food and Drug Administration Biologics Effectiveness and Safety Initiative Facilitates Detection of Vaccine Administrations From Unstructured Data in Medical Records Through Natural Language Processing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory infections in humans are caused by a diverse community of co-circulating viral species including viruses that cause influenza and the common cold.

This finding would have important implications for the predicted impact of seasonal vaccines but currently lacks statistical support. The aim of this paper is to develop a statistical framework to identify non-independent viral dynamics. As Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models naturally encompass a between-disease covariance matrix, we extended this framework to model multivariate time series data accounting for within- and between-year dependencies. By inferring non-zero off-diagonal entries of the between-disease covariance matrix, we present a novel technique that successfully identifies significant viral interactions.

We previously developed and tested DRIVE (Developing Relationships that Include Values of Eating and Exercise), a home-based parent training program to maintain body weight among children at risk for obesity, with the intent to eventually disseminate it nationally alongside SafeCare, a parent support program that focuses on parent-child interactions. Currently the DRIVE program has only been tested independently of SafeCare. This study created the mHealth DRIVE program by further adapting DRIVE to incorporate digital and mobile health tools, including remotely delivered sessions, a wireless scale that enabled a child-tailored weight graph, and a pedometer. Telehealth delivery via mHealth platforms and other digital tools can improve program cost-effectiveness, deliver long-term care, and directly support both families and care providers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine preliminary acceptability and effectiveness of the mHealth DRIVE program among children and parents who received it and among SafeCare providers who potentially could deliver it. METHODS: Study 1 was a 13-week pilot study of a remotely delivered mHealth family-based weight management program. Satisfaction surveys were administered, and height and weight were measured pre- and post-study. Study 2 was a feasibility/acceptability survey administered to SafeCare providers.

The occurrence of pandemics is modeled as Poissonian leaps in economic variables. The planner can intervene in the economic and epidemiological dynamics in two ways: first (prevention), by deciding to preserve a greater quantity of biodiversity, thus decreasing the probability of a pandemic occurring, and second (mitigation), by reducing the death toll through a confinement policy. The class of social welfare functional considered has, as polar cases, a total utilitarian and an average utilitarian specifications. It implicitly considers, at the same time, the effects of policies on mortality and on the productive capacity of the country. Thanks to the Epstein-Zin specification of preferences, we disantangle risk aversion and fluctuation aversion. The model is explicitly solved and the optimal policy completely described. The qualitative dependence of the optimal policy on natural, productivity and preference parameters is discussed. In particular the optimal lockdown is shown to be more severe in societies valuing more human life, and the optimal biodiversity conservation is shown to be more relevant for more forward looking societies, with a small discount rate and a high degree of altruism towards individuals of future generations. We also show that societies accepting a large welfare loss to mitigate the pandemics are also societies doing a lot of prevention. After calibrating the model with COVID-19 pandemic data we compare the mitigation efforts predicted by the model with those of the recent literature and we study the optimal prevention-mitigation policy mix.","output":"Prevention and Mitigation of Epidemics: Biodiversity Conservation and Confinement Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundAlthough COVID-19 severity in cancer patients is high, the safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients undergoing chemotherapy for solid cancers in Japan have not been reported.

Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 - 0.49]). Conclusion and RelevanceWhile we found both mRNA vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2, continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in real time.

In this study, we have conducted laboratory chamber experiments to investigate the effects of BC aging on its morphology, hygroscopicity and optical properties by exposing monodisperse fresh BC particles to ambient ubiquitous species of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3) in absence of UV light. We show a rapid aging from highly fractal to compacted aggregates for the monodisperse BC particles with an initial diameter of 150 nm, with decline in the dynamic shape factor () from about 1.8 to nearly 1. The effective density of the monodisperse BC particles increases from a0.54 to 1.50 g cm-3 accordingly. The aging process leads to that the light scattering, absorption, and single scattering albedo of the monodisperse BC particles are strongly enhanced by factors of 7.0, 1.8 and 3.0 respectively. By comparing with the BC aging from other mechanisms, we reveal a critical role of the composition of the coating materials on BC in determining its light absorption enhancement. Moreover, due to strong water uptake capacity of the aged BC particles, the light absorption enhancement (Eabs) could be 40-60% higher at humid atmosphere compared with dry conditions. This BC aging process from NO2 oxidation of SO2 may occur commonly in polluted regions and thus considerably alter its effects on regional air quality and climate.","output":"The effect of black carbon aging from NO2 oxidation of SO2 on its morphology, optical and hygroscopic properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is a global pandemic.

The Thai National Disease Control program at the Ministry of Public Health has identified suitable measure for mass screening. A SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based assay is a surveillance option for active cases. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and test performance of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test during our field activities in 1,100 asymptomatic individuals in Samut Sakhon, Thailand, during the second wave COVID-19 outbreak (December 26C30, 2020). The results showed that the rapid antigen test had a sensitivity of 47.97% (95% CI: 36.10C59.96%) and a specificity of 99.71% (95% CI: 99.15C99.94%) versus standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The rapid test performed better in cases with higher viral loads determined by the cycle threshold value.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; &#945; = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether CCP will reduce intubation or death non-intubated adults with COVID-19.

This work aimed to assess whether adding face-mask noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) was associated with a reduced need for endotracheal intubation. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 2020 to January 2021 in two tertiary care intensive care units (ICUs) in Paris, France. Patients admitted for laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring HFNO with or without NIV were included. The primary outcome was the rate of endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included day-28 mortality, day-28 respiratory support and IMV free days, ICU and hospital length-of-stay. Sensitivity analyses with both propensity score matching and overlap weighting were used. RESULTS: 128 patients were included, 88 (69%) received HFNO alone and 40 (31%) received additional NIV. Additional NIV was associated with a reduced rate of endotracheal intubation in multivariate analysis (53 (60%) vs 15 (38%), HR=0.46 (95%CI, 0.23-0.95), p=0.04). Sensitivity analyses by propensity score matching (HR=0.45 (95%IC, 0.24-0.84), p=0.01) and overlap weighting (HR=0.52 (95% CI, 0.28-0.94), p=0.03) were consistent.

Namely, we developed an algorithm for tools and hands localization as well as identifying the interactions between them based on simple webcam video data, calculating motion metrics for assessment of surgical skill. Twenty-five participants performed multiple suturing tasks using our simulator. The YOLO network has been modified to a multi-task network, for the purpose of tool localization and tool-hand interaction detection. This was accomplished by splitting the YOLO detection heads so that they supported both tasks with minimal addition to computer run-time. Furthermore, based on the outcome of the system, motion metrics were calculated. These metrics included traditional metrics such as time and path length as well as new metrics assessing the technique participants use for holding the tools. The dual-task network performance was similar to that of two networks, while computational load was only slightly bigger than one network. In addition, the motion metrics showed significant differences between experts and novices. While video capture is an essential part of minimally invasive surgery, it is not an integral component of open surgery. Thus, new algorithms, focusing on the unique challenges open surgery videos present, are required. In this study, a dual-task network was developed to solve both a localization task and a hand-tool interaction task.

The entire population was swab tested in two sequential surveys. Here we report the analysis of the viral genomes, which revealed that the unique ancestor haplotype introduced in Vo belongs to lineage B and, more specifically, to the subtype found at the end of January 2020 in two Chinese tourists visiting Rome and other Italian cities, carrying mutations G11083T and G26144T. The sequences, obtained for 87 samples, allowed us to investigate viral evolution while being transmitted within and across households and the effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in Vo. We report, for the first time, evidence that novel viral haplotypes can naturally arise intra-host within an interval as short as two weeks, in approximately 30% of the infected individuals, regardless of symptoms severity or immune system deficiencies. Moreover, both phylogenetic and minimum spanning network analyses converge on the hypothesis that the viral sequences evolved from a unique common ancestor haplotype, carried by an index case. The lockdown extinguished both viral spread and the emergence of new variants, confirming the efficiency of this containment strategy. The information gathered from household was used to reconstructs possible transmission events. AUTHOR SUMMARY It is of great interest and importance to understand SARS-CoV-2 ability to mutate generating new viral strains, and to assess the impact of containment strategies on viral transmission. In this study we highlight the rapid intra-host haplotype evolution regardless of symptom severity and immune deficiencies that we observed during the first wave of the pandemic in the municipality of Vo in Italy. The confirmation that all the haplotypes found in this small community derive from a common ancestor haplotype, has allowed us to track the rapid emergence of new variants but lockdown and mass testing efficiently prevented their spread elsewhere.","output":"Rapid longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 intra-host emergence of novel haplotypes regardless of immune deficiencies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of epidemics such as COVID-19, therapeutic candidates are unlikely to be able to complete the usual multiyear clinical trial and regulatory approval process within the course of an outbreak.

While the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease has yet to be fully elucidated, an overexuberant and harmful immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be a pivotal aspect of critical illness in this patient population. The inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, has been found to be consistently elevated in severely ill COVID-19 patients, prompting speculation that IL-6 is an important driver of the pathologic process. The inappropriately elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients is similar to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) observed in cell therapy patients. We sought to describe outcomes in a series of severely ill patients with COVID-19 CRS following treatment with anti-IL-6/IL-6-Receptor (anti-IL-6/IL-6-R) therapy, including tocilizumab or siltuximab. At our academic community medical center, we formed a multi-disciplinary committee for selecting severely ill COVID-19 patients for therapy with anti-IL-6 or IL-6-R agents. Key selection criteria included evidence of hyperinflammation, most notably elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, and an increasing oxygen requirement.

(commonly called coltsfoot), known as a vital folk medicine, have long been used to treat various respiratory disorders and consumed as a vegetable in many parts of the world since ancient times. AIM OF THE REVIEW: This review aims to provide a critical evaluation of the current knowledge on the ethnobotanical value, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and quality control of coltsfoot, thus provide a basis for further investigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A detailed literature search was obtained using various online search engines (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, Baidu Scholar, PubMed and CNKI). Additional information was sourced from ethnobotanical literature focusing on Chinese and European flora. The plant synonyms were validated by the database The Plant List (www.theplantlist.org). RESULTS: Coltsfoot has diverse uses in local and traditional medicine, but similarities have been noticed, specifically for relieving inflammatory conditions, respiratory and infectious diseases in humans. Regarding its pharmacological activities, many traditional uses of coltsfoot are supported by modern in vitro or in vivo pharmacological studies such as anti-inflammatory activities, neuro-protective activity, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant activity. Quantitative analysis (e.g. GC-MS, UHPLC-MRM(HR)) indicated the presence of a rich (>150) pool of chemicals, including sesquiterpenes, phenolic acids, flavonoids, chromones, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and others from its leaves and buds. In addition, adverse events have resulted from a collection of the wrong plant which contains PAs that became the subject of public concern attributed to their highly toxic. CONCLUSIONS: So far, remarkable progress has been witnessed in phytochemistry and pharmacology of coltsfoot. Thus, some traditional uses have been well supported and clarified by modern pharmacological studies. Discovery of therapeutic natural products and novel structures in plants for future clinical and experimental studies are still a growing interest. Furthermore, well-designed studies in vitro particularly in vivo are required to establish links between the traditional uses and bioactivities, as well as ensure safety before clinical use. In addition, the good botanical identification of coltsfoot and content of morphologically close species is a precondition for quality supervision and control.

This study aimed to examine the effect of resection distance from pylorus on % excess weight loss (EWL) during postoperative period, in patients who underwent LSG for morbid obesity. METHODS A total of 390 patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity were included in this retrospective study. Patients were allocated into one of the two groups based on the distance between antrum resection margin and pylorus: group A,  3 cm and group B, > 3 cm. Follow-up data for %EWS and nausea/vomiting as well as demographical and perioperative data were retrospectively reviewed and logistic regression analysis was done. RESULTS Follow-up data up to 12 months were available for all patients, whereas 199 patients had follow-up data at 24 months. Shorter distance from pylorus was associated with higher %EWL throughout the treatment period (p < 0.001), evident from the first postoperative month (p = 0.013 for the first month, p < 0.001 for all other time points). The benefit extended up to 24 months in  3 cm group. However, nausea/vomiting was more frequent in the  3 cm group only at 1-month visit (15% vs. 4%, p < 0.001). In multivariate evaluations, while %EWL variable was taken as a dependent variable, time variable with DP  time interaction was statistically significant in the model. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that a short distance between resection margin and pylorus is associated with better and sustained %EWL in LSG. However, these patients seem to be more prone to nausea and vomiting in the early postoperative period.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to assess dentistry students' opinions about the online activity, together with a self-evaluation of their mental and physical health, during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey. Three hundred and three students, enrolled across all six years of study, were included in the research. Socio-demographic and academic data were collected, along with a self-evaluation of physical and mental status. Some items investigated students' opinions about distance learning and the impact of that online activity on their achievement. The answers were rated using a five-item Likert-like scale. Data were analyzed using SPSS (v.24). RESULTS: statistical analyses showed that more than 20% of the students strongly agreed with the statement that they felt more anxious and depressed during the first months of the pandemic, and more than 30% were totally satisfied with their relationships with their family members. One-fifth of the respondents declared that they were totally dissatisfied with the relationships with their colleagues and friends. Overall, 50.60% of the students attended the courses/labs in their entirety when they were connected online. Two-thirds of the respondents considered that their practical training was affected due to the online activity, and that not all of the subjects could be taught online. More than half of the respondents agreed that the most objective evaluation method is that of the multiple-choice exams administered at school, and considered that exclusively utilizing online assessments of students encourages unethical behaviors. Age, involvement in online activity, and active participation using video cameras were strongly correlated with satisfaction with academic results. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that online activity was a good alternative for dentistry students during the pandemic restrictions. The positive aspects, together with the negative consequences, of distance learning should also be taken into consideration by university teachers and academic institutions to improve teaching experiences and to ensure a solid professional formation for dentistry students.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Academic Activity and Health Status among Romanian Medical Dentistry Students; A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PBMT using 630 + 660 nm wavelengths transcutaneously at 7 cm above chest area irradiating lungs and heart regions of patients with acute, infectious respiratory syndrome alleviated their respiratory symptoms, mitigated pulmonary inflammation and hypoxia PBMT could prevent more severe respiratory distress requiring emergency care and reduce the strain on healthcare This case report's clinical experience can be the basis of future research evaluating oxygen saturation levels pre- and post-PBMT ? 2021 The Authors Clinical Case Reports published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","output":"Early cases of acute infectious respiratory syndrome treated with photobiomodulation, diagnosis and intervention: Two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of respiratory tissue damage and repair is critical to understand not only the consequences of respiratory tissue exposure to infectious agents, irritants and toxic chemicals, but also to comprehend the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory lung diseases.

Time course analysis showed that cryoinjury of the gills triggered an inflammatory response, extensive cell death and collagen deposition at the site of injury. However, the inflammation was rapidly resolved, collagen accumulation dissipated and by 3 weeks after injury the affected gill tissue had begun to regenerate. RNA seq analysis of cryoinjured gills, combined with a comparison of zebrafish heart cryoinjury and caudal fin resection datasets, highlighted the differences and similarities of the transcriptional programmes deployed in response to injury in these three zebrafish models. Comparative RNA seq analysis of cryoinjured zebrafish gills with mouse pulmonary fibrosis datasets also identified target genes, including the understudied FIBIN, as differentially expressed in the two species. Further mining, including of human datasets, suggests that FIBIN may contribute to the successful resolution of tissue damage without fibrosis.","output":"Dynamics of repair and regeneration of adult zebrafish respiratory gill tissue after cryoinjury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1 is certainly cause for concern.

In addition to being employed as a diagnostic tool in the classical sense of the term, recent studies have shown that the number and type of artifacts are associated with lung aeration. Based on this theory, over the last few years, LUS has also been used as a semi-quantitative method or as a functional tool.

We aimed to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis on the reliability and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and deep throat sputum (DTS) compared to nasopharyngeal, combined naso/oropharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The inclusion criteria were studies that specifically assessed a sample of saliva or deep throat sputum (DTS) with at least one other respiratory specimen in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on RT-PCR tests. The DerSimonian-Laird bivariate random-effects model analysis performed using STATA software with the \\"metaprop\\" package. RESULTS: From 1598 studies, we retrieved 33 records, of which 26 studies were included for quantitative analysis. We found an overall sensitivity of 97%(95%CI,86-100) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 92%(95%CI,80-99) for double naso/oropharyngeal swabs, 87%(95%CI,77-95) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 83% (95% CI 77-89) for saliva, 82% (95%CI,76-88) for DTS, and 44% (95%CI,35-52) for oropharyngeal swabs among symptomatic patients, respectively. Regardless of the type of specimens, the viral load and sensitivity in the severe patients were higher than mild and in the symptomatic patients higher than asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: The present review provides evidence for the diagnostic value of different respiratory specimens and supports saliva and DTS as promising diagnostic tools for first-line screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, sampling, storing, and laboratory assay needs to be optimized and validated before introducing a definite diagnosis tool. Saliva, DTS, nasopharyngeal, and even double naso/oropharyngeal swabs showed approximately similar results, and sensitivity was directly related to the disease severity. This review revealed a relationship between viral load, disease severity, and test sensitivity. None of the specimens showed appropriate diagnostic sensitivity for asymptomatic patients.","output":"Are saliva and deep throat sputum as reliable as common respiratory specimens for SARS-CoV-2 detection?

Indeed, the cerebellum is no longer considered merely as the locus of motor coordination and its learning. Here, we introduce the mechanisms underlying the induction of multiple types of plasticity in cerebellar circuit and give an overview focusing on the plasticity of non-synaptic intrinsic excitability. The discovery of long-term potentiation of synaptic responsiveness in hippocampal neurons led investigations into changes of their intrinsic excitability. This activity-dependent potentiation of neuronal excitability is distinct from that of synaptic efficacy. Systematic examination of excitability plasticity has indicated that the modulation of various types of Ca2+ - and voltage-dependent K+ -channels underlies the phenomenon, which is also triggered by immune activity. Intrinsic plasticity is expressed specifically on dendrites and modifies the integrative processing and filtering effect. In Purkinje cells, modulation of the discordance of synaptic current on soma and dendrite suggested a novel type of cellular learning mechanism. This property enables a plausible synergy between synaptic efficacy and intrinsic excitability, by amplifying electrical conductivity and influencing the polarity of bidirectional synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the induction of intrinsic plasticity in the cerebellum correlates with motor performance and cognitive processes, through functional connections from the cerebellar nuclei to neocortex and associated regions: e.g., thalamus and midbrain. Taken together, recent advances in neuroscience have begun to shed light on the complex functioning of non-synaptic excitability and the synergy.","output":"Synergistic excitability plasticity in cerebellar functioning."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although patients with scrub typhus develop a maculopapular rash all over the body, patients with COVID\\\\19 may also show a similar rash.

We assessed the implications of this management on future orthopaedic practice. We also surveyed patient satisfaction of our virtual fracture follow-up clinics. METHOD: We prospectively analysed 154 patients during two weeks of 'lockdown' assessing their management. We surveyed 100 virtual fracture clinic follow-up patients for satisfaction, time off work and travel. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of patients had decisions affected by COVID. Twelve percent of patients were discharged at diagnosis having potentially unstable fractures. These were all upper limb fractures which may go onto mal-union. Twenty-nine percent of patients were discharged who would have normally had clinal or radiological follow-up. No patients had any long-term union follow-up. Virtual telemedicine clinics have been incredibly successful. The average satisfaction was 4.8/5. In only 6% of cases, the clinician felt a further face-to-face evaluation was required. Eighty-nine percent of patients would have chosen virtual follow-up under normal conditions. CONCLUSION: Lessons for the future include potentially large numbers of upper limb mal-unions which may be symptomatic. The non-union rate is likely to be the same, but these patients are unknown due to lack of late imaging.

Established-SNP models considered 65 SNPs that had been previously associated with prostate cancer. Discovery-SNP models used stepwise selection to identify new SNPs. The performance of each PHS model was calculated for random sizes of the training set. The performance of a representative Established-SNP model was estimated for random sizes of the testing set.

Indications include refractory Cushing's disease (CD) following failed pituitary surgery, and occult or unresectable ectopic ACTH-producing neoplasms (EA). METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective review (1995-2017) of patients undergoing BA for CD or EA. Demographics, laboratory findings, and intraoperative and postoperative variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 137 patients, 83 (61%) had CD and 54 (39%) had EA; 87% of CD patients were female versus 46% of EA patients (p < 0.0001). Mean age at diagnosis was 40  15 years for CD and 49  18 years for EA (p = 0.004). Preoperative serum cortisol concentrations were higher in the EA cohort (63  40 g/dL) versus the CD cohort (33  19 g/dL) [p < 0.001], with no significant differences in serum ACTH. Time from diagnosis until adrenalectomy was 54  69 months for CD versus 4  13 for EA (p = 0.002). Most patients underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS; 86% CD vs. 75% EA; p = 0.19). There was no difference between the rates of conversion to an open approach, intraoperative blood loss, or operative time between groups, and no difference between complications in CD versus EA (p = 1.0). Five-year survival was significantly shorter among the EA cohort (30% for EA vs. 80% for CD; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with EA presented with higher serum cortisol levels compared with patients with CD.

Many researchers are trying to improve COVID-19 detection using artificial intelligence. Our motivation is to develop an automatic method that can cope with scenarios in which preparing labeled data is time consuming or expensive. In this article, we propose a Semi-supervised Classification using Limited Labeled Data (SCLLD) relying on Sobel edge detection and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to automate the COVID-19 diagnosis. The GAN discriminator output is a probabilistic value which is used for classification in this work.

A numerical approach has been presented in this paper to answer two vital questions; which variables are more important and how many variables are needed to capture the dynamics of the spread. Using the theory of least squares regression, two types of problems have been set up and solved using multilinear regression (MLR) and nonlinear powered function known as NLR in this study. Numerical techniques were applied to pre- and post-process the data and the vast number of outputs. Total 43 socio-economic and meteorological variables from 31 counties in California in the United States resulted about 37.4 millions of combinations for the analysis. Results show that variables related to total population, household income, occupation, and transportation are more important than the others. The frequency of having higher correlation for a variable increases as more variables are combined with it. Similarly, correlation increases as the number of variables in a combination increases. Some 5- variable combinations can capture the dynamics of the spread with higher accuracy having correlation coefficient as high as 0.985.","output":"An analysis to identify the important variables for the spread of COVID-19 using numerical techniques and data science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ocular complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) do not essentially cause serious visual loss.

One leading hypothesis is that clinicians may unknowingly display racial bias when considering ECT for patients of color. Studies have consistently shown that patients of color face numerous racially driven, provider-level interpersonal and perceptual biases that contribute to clinicians incorrectly overdiagnosing them as having a psychotic-spectrum illness rather than correctly diagnosing a severe affective disorder. A patient's diagnosis marks the entry to evidence-based service delivery, and ECT is best indicated for severe affective disorders rather than for psychotic disorders. As a consequence of racially influenced clinician misdiagnosis, patients from racial-ethnic minority groups are underrepresented among those given severe affective diagnoses, which are most indicated for ECT referral. Evidence also suggests that clinicians may use racially biased treatment rationales when considering ECT after they have given a diagnosis of a severe affective or psychotic disorder, thereby producing secondary inequities in ECT referral. Increasing the use of gold-standard treatment algorithms when considering ECT for patients of color is contingent on clinicians transcending the limitations posed by aversive racism to develop culturally unbiased, clinically indicated diagnostic and treatment rationales.","output":"Clinicians' Racial Bias Contributing to Disparities in Electroconvulsive Therapy for Patients From Racial-Ethnic Minority Groups."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the rapid immunochromatographic test for severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen detection using 16 saliva specimens collected from 6 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and detected N-antigen in 4 of 7 RT-PCR positive specimens.

As operating room (OR) capacities are reduced everywhere to ensure availability of intensive care capacities, especially low-complex surgical procedures are often postponed. These include totally implantable central-venous access ports which are important for the oncologic treatment of cancer patients. METHODS: In our study, we investigated the potential of an outpatient surgical centre (OSC) in terms of workflow effectiveness compared to the central operating room complex (COR) of a university hospital using low-complex surgical procedures as an example. Data of 524 consecutive patients who received a Port-a-cath procedure (422 implantations (80.5%) and 102 explantations (19.5%)) in our department between February 2019 and February 2020 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 277 patients were operated in outpatient surgical centre (OSC), and 247 patients received the procedure in the central OR (COR) complex. Grade II and III complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 5.2% (OSC) and 7.3% (COR) of patients.

The result shows that the complexes in which Na+ or H2O is bonded simultaneously to the -NH and -OH groups connected to the C3 atom of DMGA are the most stable. The cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects occur in DMGAH2ODMGA and DMGANa+H2O, while only the cooperativities are confirmed in DMGANa+DMGA. The cooperativity occurs in the DMGANa+H2O complexes without the hydration, while the anti-cooperativity occurs in those with the hydration. Furthermore, the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity in DMGANa+H2O are far stronger than those in DMGANa+DMGA or DMGAH2ODMGA. Therefore, a deduction is given that the cooperativity and anti-cooperativity effects play an important role in the hydration of chitin or chitosan in the presence of Na+. When only Na+ is linked with -OH and -NH groups of chitosan or chitin, due to the cooperativity effect, the hydration does not occur. When both Na+ and H2O are linked with -OH and -NH groups, the anti-cooperativities are dominant in controlling of the aggregation process of Na+, H2O, chitosan, and chitin, leading to the possible hydration.

We characterized the structure and properties of the [emim][PF6]/WPU composite membranes by ATR-FTIR, DSC, UV, SEM, EDX, swelling tests, and pervaporation testing. Characterization of the change in the morphology of the membranes in response to the IL loading indicated that a preferential interaction between the IL and soft segments of WPU was induced by hydrogen bonding. This interaction inhibited a potential interaction with benzene (Bz), which initially lowered the permeability. However, at high IL loading, the IL incorporation became ineffective owing to macrophase separation, which caused an increase in the permeability, as indicated by the SEM results. Swelling testing of the [emim][PF6]/WPU composite membranes showed that the membranes exhibited preferential adsorption of Bz, and the swelling degree of the composite membranes in Bz solvent increased from 58% to 98% and remained almost constant in cyclohexane solvent as the IL content was increased. The [emim][PF6]/WPU composite membranes enhanced the separation selectivity of Bz/Cy for an IL loading < 10 wt%.

Despite the potential benefits, nasopharyngeal sample collection is frequently perceived as uncomfortable by patients and requires trained healthcare personnel with protective equipment. Therefore, anterior nasal self-sampling is increasingly recognized as a valuable alternative. Methods We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of an Ag-RDT using a polypropylene absorbent collector for standardized self-collected anterior nasal swabs. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from combined oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs served as a comparator. Primary endpoint was sensitivity of the standardized Ag-RDT in symptomatic patients with medium or high viral concentration ([] 1 million RNA copies on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2). Results Between February 12 and March 22, 2021, 388 participants were enrolled. After exclusion of 9 patients for which no PCR result could be obtained, the novel Ag-RDT was evaluated based on 379 participants, of which 273 were symptomatic and 106 asymptomatic. In 61 samples from symptomatic patients with medium or high viral load ([] 1 million RNA copies), the sensitivity of the standardized Ag-RDT was 96.7% (59/61; 95%CI: 88.7-99.6%) for the primary endpoint. In total, 62 positive Ag-RDT results were detected out of 70 RT-PCR positive individuals, yielding an overall sensitivity of 88.6% (95%CI: 78.7-94.9%).

This qualitative study explored cancer survivors experiences in an 8-week group-based walking program with behavioural support that was delivered within the community to highlight factors central to successful adoption and sustainability of such programs. METHODS: Eleven cancer survivors who took part in the program before (n = 7) or during (n = 4) the COVID-19 pandemic were interviewed and asked to discuss their PA behaviour, motivation to join and complete the program, and experienced benefits and barriers, as well as offer feedback that could be incorporated into future programs. Interview transcripts were thematically analysed using a hybrid deductive-inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants experiences were summarised into six themes: (1) PA behaviour and motivation were enhanced, (2) seeking accountability to take steps for better health, (3) mutual support encourages in-group bonding, (4) placing value on building PA confidence, (5) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and (6) recommendations for future programs. By receiving social and behavioural support, and thus experiencing increased PA confidence, participants felt the program supported their PA behaviour.

The incidence of PE is reported to be around 2.6C8.9% of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and up to one-third of those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation. This may be explained by direct and indirect pathologic consequences of COVID-19, complement activation, cytokine release, endothelial dysfunction, and interactions between different types of blood cells. CONCLUSION: Thromboprophylaxis should be started in all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the hospital. The use of an intermediate therapeutic dose of low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin can be considered on an individual basis in patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism, including critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Decisions about extending prophylaxis with LMWH after hospital discharge should be made after balancing the reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with the risk of increased bleeding events and should be continued for 7C14 days after hospital discharge or in the pre-hospital phase in case of pre-existing or persisting VTE risk factors.

The lack of standardization in CTmax assays has, however, introduced methodological problems in its measurement, which can lead to questionable estimates of species' upper thermal limits. Focusing on ants, which are model organisms for research on thermal ecology, we aim to obtain a reliable ramping rate that will yield the most rigorous measures of CTmax for the most species. After identifying three commonly used ramping rates (i.e., 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0C min-1) in the literature, we experimentally determine their effects on the CTmax values of 27 species measured using dynamic assays. Next, we use static assays to evaluate the accuracy of these values in function of the time of exposure. Finally, we use field observations of species' foraging activities across a wide range of ground temperatures to identify the most biologically relevant CTmax values and to develop a standardized method. Our results demonstrate that the use of a 1C min-1 ramping rate in dynamic assays yields the most reliable CTmax values for comparing ant species' upper thermal limits, which are further validated in static assays and field observations. We further illustrate how methodological biases in physiological trait measurements can affect subsequent analyses and conclusions on community comparisons between strata and habitats, and the detection of phylogenetic signal (Pagel's  and Bloomberg's K). Overall, our study presents a methodological framework for identifying a reliable and standardized ramping rate to measure CTmax in ants, which can be applied to other ectotherms.

Currently, there is a variety of regimes for the performance of DISE, which renders comparison and assessment across results difficult. It remains unclear how the different regimes influence the findings of the examination and the resulting conclusions and treatment recommendations. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between increasing levels of sedation (i.e., light, medium, and deep) induced by propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump, with the obstruction patterns at the levels of the velum, oropharynx, tongue base, and epiglottis (i.e., VOTE classification). A second goal was the establishment of a sufficient sedation level to enable a reliable decision regarding treatment recommendations. MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-three patients with OSA underwent a DISE procedure using propofol TCI. Three levels of sedation were defined, depending on entropy levels and assessment of sedation: light sedation, medium sedation, and deep sedation. The evaluation of the upper airway at each level, with increasing sedation, was documented using the VOTE classification. The elapsed time at which each assessment was performed was recorded. RESULTS Upper airway changes occurred and were measured throughout the DISE procedure. Clinically useful determinations of airway closure occurred at medium sedation; this level of sedation was most probably achieved with a blood propofol concentration of 3.2 g/ml. In all 43 patients, definite treatment decisions could be made at medium sedation level. Increasing sedation did not result in changes in the treatment decision. CONCLUSIONS Changes in upper airway collapse during DISE with propofol TCI occur at levels of medium sedation. Decisions regarding surgical treatment could be made at this level of sedation.

Methods Maternal and cord blood sera were collected following term delivery after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination, with the first vaccine dose administered during 27-36 weeks gestation. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific, IgG levels and neutralizing potency were evaluated in maternal and cord blood samples. Results The study cohort consisted of 171 parturients (median age, 31 years; median gestational age, 39.7 weeks): 83 (48.5%) immunized at early 3rd trimester (1st dose at 27-31 weeks), and 88 (51.5%) immunized at late 3rd trimester (1st dose at 32-36 weeks). All mother-infant paired sera were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-RBD-specific IgG concentrations in neonatal sera were higher following early versus late 3rd trimester vaccination and were positively correlated with increasing time since vaccination (r= 0.26; P=0.001). The median placental transfer ratios of anti-S and anti-RBD specific IgG were increased following early versus late 3rd trimester immunization (anti-S ratio:1.3 vs. 0.9, anti-RBD-specific ratio:2.3 vs. 0.7, P<0.001). Neutralizing antibodies placental transfer ratio was greater following early versus late 3rd trimester immunization (1.9 vs. 0.8, P<0.001), and was positively associated with longer duration from vaccination (r= 0.77; P<0.001). Conclusions Early- as compared to late third trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 immunization enhanced transplacental antibody transfer and increased neonatal neutralizing antibody levels. Our findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women early in the third trimester may optimize neonatal seroprotection.","output":"Early versus late third trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA immunization maximizes transplacental antibody transfer and neonatal neutralizing antibody levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What are some ways that people from the Buddhist, Muslim and Christian faith traditions can reflect upon the coronavirus pandemic using a theological lens?

Unlike other recent studies that focused on airborne transmission routes, this work addresses aerosol transport and deposition in a human respiratory tract. The contribution therefore conducts a computational study of aerosol deposition in digital replicas of human airways, which include the oral cavity, larynx and tracheobronchial airways down to the 12th generation of branching. Breathing through the oral cavity allows the air with aerosols to directly impact the larynx and tracheobronchial airways and can be viewed as one of the worst cases in terms of inhalation rate and aerosol load. The implemented computational model is based on Lagrangian particle tracking in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes resolved turbulent flow. Within this framework, the effects of different flow rates, particle diameters and lung sizes are investigated to enable new insights into local particle deposition behavior and therefore virus loads among selected age groups. We identify a signicant increase of aerosol deposition in the upper airways and thus a strong reduction of virus load in the lower airways for younger individuals. Based on our findings, we propose a possible relation between the younger age related fluid mechanical protection of the lower lung regions due to the airway size and a reduced risk of developing a severe respiratory illness originating from COVID-19 airborne transmission.","output":"Can CFD establish a connection to a milder COVID-19 disease in younger people?

It is has resulted in and continues in over a million deaths worldwide and halted medical systems and particularly elective surgeries worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the initial COVID-19 pandemic months on orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia. METHODS: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. RESULTS: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of > 15% (range 0C100%). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS After obtaining IRB approval from Nationwide Children's Hospital, a total of 524 patients evaluated for rAOM were retrospectively reviewed after being divided into two cohorts: those seen via a telehealth visit from April to June of 2020 (n = 140), and those seen via an in-person visit from April to June of 2019 (n = 384). Recommendation for BTI was captured for each patient following their visit. Clinical characteristics documented at the time of the visit, such as history of intramuscular (IM) antibiotic use and hearing or speech concerns were also captured to determine whether both telehealth and in-person cohorts were similar in clinical presentation. For BTI patients, the presence or absence of MEE in either ear at the time of BTI was recorded. Patients with cleft palate or prior BTI were excluded. RESULTS 51.43% (72/140) of patients in the telehealth cohort were recommended for BTI. Of those recommended, 87.50% (63/72) underwent BTI. Of these, 31.75% (20/63) had a MEE at the time of BTI. In the in-office cohort, 69.01% (265/384) of patients were recommended for BTI. Of those recommended, 92.83% (246/265) underwent BTI. Of these, 69.92% (172/246) had a MEE at the time of BTI. CONCLUSION There were significantly less middle ear effusions in the telehealth cohort compared to the in-office cohort (p < 0.0001).

Objective: To evaluate the impact of different COVID-19 vaccines on specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG levels in human milk. Design, Settings and Participants: In this prospective observational study in Spain, 75 lactating women from priority groups receiving vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were included (January to April 2021). Human milk samples were collected at seven-time points. A group with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=19) and a group of women from prepandemic time (n=13) were included. Exposure: mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Presence of IgA and IgG against RBD SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk. Results: Seventy-five vaccinated lactating women [mean age, 34.9{+/-}3.7 years] of whom 96% were Caucasic and 92% were health care workers. A total of 417 milk samples were included and vaccine distribution was BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2, n=30), Moderna (mRNA-1273, n=21), and AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, n=24). For each vaccine, 7 time points were collected from baseline up to 25 days after the 1st dose and same points were collected for mRNA vaccines 30 days after 2nd dose. A strong reactivity was observed for IgG and IgA after vaccination mainly after the 2nd dose. Presence and the persistence of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk were dependent on the vaccine-type and, on previous virus exposure. High inter-variability was observed, being relevant for IgA antibodies. IgG levels were significantly higher than those observed in milk from COVID-19 women while IgA levels were lower. Women with previous COVID-19 increased the IgG levels after the 1st dose to a similar level observed in vaccinated women after the 2nd dose.

In 2017, researchers had documented the anti-coronavirus potential of remdesivir in animal models. At the same time, trials performed during two Ebola outbreaks in Africa showed that the drug was safe. Although vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have emerged at an enormously high speed, equivalent results from efforts towards the development of anti-viral drugs, which could have played a truly life-saving role in the current stage of the pandemic, have been stagnating. In this review, we will focus on the current treatment options for COVID-19 which mainly consist of repurposed agents or treatments conferring passive immunity (convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies). Additionally, potential specific anti-viral therapies under development will be reviewed, such as the decoy miniprotein CTC-445.2d, protease inhibitors, mainly against the Main protein Mpro, nucleoside analogs, such as molnupiravir and compounds blocking the replication transcription complex proteins, such as zotatifin and plitidepsin.

AIM: To assess healthcare worker (HCW) perspectives on pre-warning rapid response calls (RRC) with 'Code-95' in announcements when attending to deteriorating or aggressive patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Design: prospective cross-sectional single-centre survey of HCW over a 3-week period. SETTING: tertiary public hospital. PARTICIPANTS: HCW caring for deteriorating or aggressive patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the primary outcome was to assess HCW perspectives in attending Code-95 calls. Secondary outcomes were to identify any differences related to craft group, age, experience or presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 297 responses was analysed; 86.7% of HCW (n = 257) attending Code-95 calls reported anxiety. Medical staff reported greater anxiety in comparison to nursing staff (93.8% vs 78.5%; P = 0.002). Efferent team reported higher anxiety in contrast to afferent team (92.6% vs 58.8%; P = 0.021).

Digital contact tracing apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as further waves of COVID-19 tear through much of the northern hemisphere, these apps are playing a less important role in interrupting chains of infection than anticipated. We argue that one of the reasons for this is that most countries have opted for decentralised apps, which cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. Centralised apps, in contrast, have the potential to do this. But policy making was influenced by public debates about the right app configuration, which have tended to focus heavily on privacy, and are driven by the assumption that decentralised apps are \\"privacy preserving by design\\". We show that both types of apps are in fact vulnerable to privacy breaches, and, drawing on principles from safety engineering and risk analysis, compare the risks of centralised and decentralised systems along two dimensions, namely the probability of possible breaches and their severity. We conclude that a centralised app may in fact minimise overall ethical risk, and contend that we must reassess our approach to digital contact tracing, and should, more generally, be cautious about a myopic focus on privacy when conducting ethical assessments of data technologies.","output":"Privacy versus Public Health?

The expression of two other vascular function-related proteins, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) and tubulin alpha-4 A (TUBA4A), was upregulated, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (MS).

COVID-19 infection could be causally linked to new-onset of DM. We report 13 cases of new type of COVID-19 induced DM. While working in noncovid endocrine clinic we could notice 5 patients presented with fever and URI or osmotic symptoms or post URI cramps in legs. All 5 cases was having hyperglycemia with ketonuria and HbA1c more than 11% with fasting or premeal C peptide levels more than 10 ng/ml. All five patients have new onset DM and they are neither obese nor having family history of DM. Presentation includes fever with cough and/OR osmotic symptoms with hyperglycemia, weight loss in weeks. Out of five, in four patients either RT PCR OR Rapid Antigen Test was positive. One patient presented with cramps in legs with past history of URI without fever. In her COVID 19 IgG antibody was positive. All patients initially treated with insulin but on follow up they are controlled with metformin plus gliptin. All patients have HbA1c less than 6.7 on follow up at 3 months.

This study is aimed at assessing the impact of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphisms, on the susceptibility and clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 immunoinflammatory syndrome. Patients and Methods. A total of 112 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 1 and 15 May 2020 were enrolled in the study. ACE gene allele frequencies were compared to the previously reported Turkish population comprised of 300 people. RESULTS: The most common genotype in the patients and control group was DI with 53% and II with 42%, respectively. The difference in the presence of the D allele between the patient and control groups was statistically significant (67% vs. 42%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Severe pneumonia was observed more in patients with DI allele (31%) than  (8%) and II (0%) (p = 0.021). The mortality rate, time to defervescence, and the hospitalization duration were not different between the genotype groups.

METHODS: We prospectively included all patients with hMPV-associated LRTI after allogeneic HSCT during a period of 1 year. hMPV was diagnosed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). RESULTS: Eight patients with hMPV-associated LRTI were identified from 93 BAL samples. Three of the eight patients had co-infections with other pathogens. The median age of the patients was 45 years [interquartile range (IQR) 36.8C53.5], the median time posttransplant was 473 days (IQR 251C1,165), 5/8 patients had chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD), and 6/8 patients received immunosuppression.

The antibodies in VITT have been described as directed at the platelet-specific chemokine PF4 (CXCL4). While the clinical course and target chemokine in VITT has much in common with the better-known thrombocytopenic/prothrombotic disorder, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which involves antibodies directed against PF4 bound to the polyanion heparin, the specific loci where VITT and PF4/polyanion HIT antibodies bind appear to differ in studies using alanine-scanning mutations of PF4 (Nature, 2021. DOI: 10.1038/s41586-021-03744-4). The VITT antigenic site localizes to a heparin-binding domain. Unlike the dominant HIT locus, the VITT locus is conserved not only between human and mouse PF4, but also between PF4 and the related platelet-specific chemokine NAP2 (CXCL7). NAP2 is also expressed and stored in platelet alpha-granules and is present in equimolar concentrations to PF4. Unlike PF4, NAP2 avidly binds the chemokine receptor CXCR2 and strongly activates neutrophils. We now show that antibodies from patients who developed VITT after both AstraZeneca (AZ) or Johnson and Johnson (JJ) adenoviral vaccines, unlike HIT antibodies, recognize mouse PF4 (Figure 1A). More importantly, both AZ and JJ VITT antibodies bound NAP2, while none of the HIT antibodies tested bound PF4 or NAP2 in the absence of heparin (Figure 1A). These results are consistent with the alanine-scanning studies that distinguish the HIT and VITT binding sites. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that NAP2 and PF4 bind to the adenoviral vectors, including Ad5 and the AZ vector ChAdOx5, which leads to expression of SARS_CoV2 spike protein. ChAdOx2 vaccine and CsCl 2-purified ChAdOx2 bound to both proteins, but form larger complexes with NAP2 than with PF4 even at lower concentrations of this chemokine (Figure 1C). Removal of anti-PF4 antibodies by hPF4-Sepharose abrogated PF4-dependent binding, but did not significantly reduce binding to NAP2 (not shown), indicating that VITT plasma contains discrete pools of anti-PF4 and anti-NAP2 antibodies that may have distinct functional properties. Sandwich ELISA (not shown) and Western blot analysis of purified VITT IgG demonstrates the presence of hPF4-IgG and NAP2-IgG immune complexes in purified patient's IgG (Figure 2A). Functional studies show that both PF4 and NAP2 can activate platelets in the presence of VITT antibodies. Anti-PF4-depleted VITT IgG fraction retains the ability to activate platelets in the presence of NAP2 (Figure 2B). Thus, unlike HIT, VITT appears to target a shared antigenic site on the related chemokines PF4 and NAP2. This raises the question as to whether NAP2, as one the most abundant platelet chemokines released from activated platelets, is involved in the initiation and propagation of the immunothrombotic response. Additional studies are needed to see whether NAP2, which can potently and specifically activate neutrophils via CXCLR2, contributes to the specific thromboinflammatory phenotype seen in VITT. We propose using FcgammaRIIA+ mice that concurrently express human PF4 and NAP2 and specific knockout of each chemokine, available in our group, to further understand the pathogenesis of VITT and its thrombocytopenic/ prothrombotic phenotype.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using an online survey disseminated during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. METHODS: Survey data from 572 direct service providers working in the homeless, supportive housing, and harm reduction service sectors were analyzed for this study. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of paid sick leave benefits. RESULTS: One hundred one (17.7%) participants did not have any paid sick leave benefits. In the univariate models, paid sick leave was associated with older age, greater family income, full-time work, specific employment settings (supportive housing and not emergency shelters or harm reduction programs), having a regular medical doctor, and fewer occupational impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age, full-time work, and non-receipt of emergency financial benefits remained statistically significant predictors in the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of service providers working with people experiencing homelessness have some amount of paid sick leave benefits, there is a precariously employed subset of individuals who are younger and working part-time in the sector.

To improve the yield of these high-sensitivity forms of RBD and support the increased demand for this antigen in serology assays, we investigated several protein expression variables including DNA elements such as promoters and signal peptides, cell culture expression parameters, and purification processes. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently resulted in high levels of the high-sensitivity form of RBD and demonstrated that a carboxyterminal tag is responsible for the increased sensitivity in the ELISA.

It involved all 34 province-level regions in China and included participants aged 18 years and older. Data analysis was performed from March to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress among the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Insomnia Severity Index, and Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore demographic and COVID-19-related risk factors. Results: Of 71a?227 individuals who clicked on the survey link, 56a?932 submitted the questionnaires, for a participation rate of 79.9%. After excluding the invalid questionnaires, 56a?679 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.97 [8.22] years; 27a?149 men [47.9%]) were included in the study; 39a?468 respondents (69.6%) were aged 18 to 39 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of mental health symptoms among the survey respondents were 27.9% (95% CI, 27.5%-28.2%) for depression, 31.6% (95% CI, 31.2%-32.0%) for anxiety, 29.2% (95% CI, 28.8%-29.6%) for insomnia, and 24.4% (95% CI, 24.0%-24.7%) for acute stress. Participants with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and their family members or friends had a high risk for symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratios [ORs], 3.27 [95% CI, 1.84-5.80] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.26-1.85] for family or friends), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.43-4.31] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.27-1.84] for family or friends), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 3.06 [95% CI, 1.73-5.43] for patients; 1.62 [95% CI, 1.35-1.96] for family or friends), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 3.50 [95% CI, 2.02-6.07] for patients; 1.77 [95% CI, 1.46-2.15] for family or friends).

Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. We used historical cohort data from multiple hospitals. There was absence of serial correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several periods (all P .18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all P .23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P =.25). Therefore, we recommend analyzing the presence/absence of transmission. The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using Boschloo's exact test. The total sample size for the 1(st) and 2(nd) stage is N =100 pairs. Because S. aureus transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used (e.g., infections). Only 10/298 combinations of specialty and operating room were relatively common (1.0% of cases) and had expected incidence 0.20 infections per 8 hours of sampled cases. The 10 combinations encompassed ?17% of cases, showing the value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties and rooms.

Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesized avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of AOaV-1 was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and a major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of a recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in a cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagations in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies.","output":"A Scalable Topical Vectored Vaccine Candidate against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A person-centered approach to care shifts the mind-set of care partners from a traditional medical model to a social model in managing chronic conditions.

Background and aims : During this COVID19 pandemic, an important amount of patients have needed admission to ICU and long hospitalizations This study aims to determine the level of adaptation of Rehabilitation Services to the increased demand of rehabilitation management of intensive care patients and inpatients Methods : In this cross-sectional study, a online survey was administered to rehabilitation departments across Spain between 22/12/2020 and 27/02/2021.. Sorecar ( Spanish cardiopulmonary rehabilitation Society ) developed the survey (ICU rehabilitation services identification). Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS. Objective: To evaluate the need of human and material resources for the rehabilitation of ICU patients suffering from SARS-COV-2 and the changes in the Rehab-services due to the pandemia. Results : 38 hospitals from 18 cities (total: 49) participated in the study. ICUs demand average was 7,38 medical consultation (MC) per week(range: 2-45). The average in hospitalization was 9,63 MC per week(range: 2-55). The total worktime dedicate by physicians was 10,38 hours/week by physiotherapists: 25,95 hours/week.. Only 7 hospitals (16,7%) have occupational therapists(OT)(average dedication: 5 hours / week). The average time per rehab- sessions was 30 minutes. 59,1 %(n=23) of the studied hospitals had a specific rehab-consultation for patients follow-up, 9,1%(n=4) are planning one. 64,3% (n=24) of the surveyed centers developed a specific protocol for COVID19 patients, another 7,1%(n=3) were in development. In the 48.5% (n=18) of surveyed centers there is no specific training program in ICU and respiratory rehab-areas for the MIR (Internal medical residents). Conclusions : During the pandemic, there has been a significantly increase in the working hours and in demand of the Rehab-services. Rehab-medical doctor postICU consultant associated with a Rehab-program might be necessary for an adequate treatment and ambulatory follow-up. The Rehabilitation in critical patients is actually a trending topic in this medical speciality.

However, there is little guidance on how to manage the inclusion of vertical programmes, funded by external partners, in health benefits packages (HBP) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE: We conducted a scoping review to map the inclusion of six vertical programmes (HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal and child health, contraceptives, immunisation) in 26 LMICs. METHODS: We identified 26 LMICs with an HBP that was not aspirational (eg, with evidence of implementation or funding). For each HBP, we collected information on the corresponding UHC scheme, health financing at the time of establishment, revisions since inception and entitlements. For each vertical programme, we developed a list of tracer interventions based on the Disease Control Priorities 3 and the 100 Core Health Indicators List. We then used this list of tracer interventions to map the coverage of the six vertical programmes. RESULTS: The review shows that there is no common starting point for countries embarking into UHC. Some HBPs were almost three decades old. Whole package revisions are rare. The inclusion of vertical programme does not follow a given pattern based on health financing indicators or countrys income group. Maternal child health services are the most often included and family planning the least. Six countries in our sample covered all vertical programmes, while one covered only one of six. CONCLUSIONS: This review has shown that there has been a long history of countries facing this question and we have provided the first mapping of inclusion of vertical programmes in UHC. The results of the mapping can inform decisions in countries embarking in UHC.","output":"The journey to UHC: how well are vertical programmes integrated in the health benefits package?

OBJECTIVES: We examined vape shop non-compliance with state-ordered business closures during COVID-19, changes in their marketing and experiences among consumers. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study of vape retail in six metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs; Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego and Seattle), we conducted: (1) legal research to determine whether statewide COVID-19 orders required vape shops to close; (2) phone-based and web-based surveillance to assess vape shop activity in March-June 2020 during shelter-in-place periods; and (3) a concurrent online survey of e-cigarette users about their experiences with vape retail. RESULTS: Non-essential business closure varied in timing/duration across states and applied to vape shops in California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma (for a brief period) and Washington (Georgia's orders were ambiguous). Surveillance analysis focused on the five MSAs in these states. Of 156 vape shops, 53.2% were open as usual, 11.5% permanently closed and 3.8% temporarily closed; 31.4% offered pick-up/delivery services. Among survey respondents (n=354, M age =23.94.6; 46.9% male, 71.8% white, 13.0% Hispanic), 27.4% worried their vape shop would close/go out of business during COVID-19; 7.3% said their vape shop did so. Few noticed increases in vape product delivery options (7.3%), discounts/price promotions (9.9%) and/or prices (9.3%). While 20.3% stockpiled vape products, 20.3% tried to reduce use and 15.8% tried to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Many vape shops were non-compliant with state COVID-19 orders.

METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter, observational study carried out in the 8 Galician tertiary hospitals. All Patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from 1st of March to April 24th, 2020 were included. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify the relationship between risk factors, therapeutic interventions and the composite outcome variable. RESULTS: A total of 1292 patients (56.1% male) were included. Two hundred and twenty-five (17.4%) died and 327 (25.3%) reached the main outcome variable.

Sensitivity analysis using different alternative logistic regression models identified consistently the ratio admissions/hospital beds as a predictor of the outcome [OR = 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02-1.11)]. CONCLUSION: These findings may help to identify patients at hospital admission with a higher risk of death and may urge healthcare authorities to implement policies aimed at reducing deaths by increasing the availability of hospital beds.","output":"COVID-19 pneumonia in Galicia (Spain): Impact of prognostic factors and therapies on mortality and need for mechanical ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human CD317 is an intrinsic immunity factor that restricts the release of enveloped viruses, including the major pathogens HIV and Lassa virus, from infected cells in culture. Its importance for infection control in humans is unclear, due in part to its incompletely defined in vivo expression pattern. CD317 also has been proposed as a selective target for immunotherapy of multiple myeloma. To provide a framework for studies of the biological functions, regulation, and therapeutic potential of CD317, we performed microarray-based expression profiling in 468 tissue samples from 25 healthy organs from more than 210 patients. We found that CD317 protein was expressed to varying degrees in all organs tested and detected in a number of specialized cell types, including hepatocytes, pneumocytes, ducts of major salivary glands, pancreas and kidney, Paneth cells, epithelia, Leydig cells, plasma cells, bone marrow stromal cells, monocytes, and vascular endothelium. Although many of these cell types are in vivo targets for pathogenic viruses, restriction by CD317 or virus-encoded antagonists has been documented in only some of them. Limited cell type-dependent coexpression of CD317 with the IFN biomarker MxA in vivo and lack of responsive stimulation in organ explants suggest that interferons may only partially regulate CD317. This in vivo expression profiling sheds light on the biology and species-specificity of CD317, identifies multiple thus far unknown interaction sites of viruses with this restriction factor, and refutes the concept of its restricted constitutive expression and primary IFN inducibility. CD317's widespread expression calls into question its suitability as a target for immunotherapy.","output":"In vivo expression profile of the antiviral restriction factor and tumor-targeting antigen CD317/BST-2/HM1.24/tetherin in humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in various target organs has been extensively studied and described. However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of oral cavity involvement. This is surprising, considering that oral mucosal and salivary gland cells are known targets for the direct replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that the presence of the virus in saliva is a source of transmission of the infection. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence and prevalence of oral manifestations in COVID-19 survivors. We profiled the oral involvement in 122 COVID-19 survivors that were hospitalized and followed up at a single-referral university hospital in Milan, Italy, between July 23, 2020 and September 7, 2020, after a median (interquartile range) time from hospital discharge of 104 (95 to 132) d. We found that oral manifestations, specifically salivary gland ectasia, were unexpectedly common, with oral manifestations being detected in 83.9% while salivary gland ectasia in 43% of COVID-19 survivors. Salivary gland ectasia reflected the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the significant relationship with C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at hospital admission, and with the use of antibiotics during acute disease. Both LDH levels and antibiotic administration survived as independent predictors of salivary gland ectasia at multivariable analysis. Temporomandibular joint abnormalities, facial pain, and masticatory muscle weakness were also common. Overall, this retrospective and prospective cohort study of COVID-19 survivors revealed that residual damage of the oral cavity persists in the vast majority of patients far beyond clinical recovery, and suggests that the oral cavity represents a preferential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Even within transmission studies, the focus on free-living survival is a smaller subset, though recent studies have examined its importance in the ecology of infectious diseases. Few studies have examined the epidemic-scale consequences of variation in survival across different virulenceCsurvival relationships. In this study, we utilize a mathematical model motivated by aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) natural history to investigate how evolutionary changes in survival may influence several aspects of disease dynamics at the epidemiological scale. Across virulenceCsurvival relationships (where these traits are either positively or negatively correlated), we found that small changes (5% above and below the nominal value) in survival can have a meaningful effect on certain outbreak features, including R(0), and on the size of the infectious peak in the population.

Here, we used mass spectrometry to study the proteome, Enzym-linkend immunoassays, semiquantitative cytokine arrays, autoantibody screening, and RNA profiling to study the neuroinflammation. We study the inflammatory response in paired CSF and serum samples of patients with COVID-19 (n=38). Patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE, n=10) and patients with non-inflammatory, non-neurodegenerative neurological diseases (n=28) served as controls. Proteomics on single protein level and subsequent pathway analysis showed similar yet strongly attenuated inflammatory changes in the CSF of COVID-19 patients compared to HSVE patients. CSF/serum indices of interleukin-6, interleukin-16 and CXCL10 together point at an origin from these inflammatory proteins from outside the central nervous system. When stratifying COVID-19 patients into those with and without bacterial superinfection as indicated by elevated procalcitonin levels, inflammatory markers were significantly higher in those with concomitant bacterial superinfection.

MBL deficiency and susceptibility to different types of infections have been subject to extensive studies over the last decades. In humans and chickens, several studies have shown that MBL participates in the protection of hosts against virus infections. Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of economic importance in the poultry industry caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). MBL has earlier been described to play a potential role in the pathogenesis of IBV infection and the production of IBV-specific antibodies, which may be exploited in optimising IBV vaccine strategies. The present study shows that MBL has the capability to bind to IBV in vitro. Chickens from two inbred lines (L10H and L10L) selected for high or low MBL serum concentrations, respectively, were vaccinated against IBV with or without the addition of the MBL ligands mannan, chitosan and fructooligosaccharide (FOS). The addition of MBL ligands to the IBV vaccine, especially FOS, enhanced the production of IBV-specific IgG antibody production in L10H chickens, but not L10L chickens after the second vaccination. The addition of FOS to the vaccine also increased the number of circulating CD4+ cells in L10H chickens compared to L10L chickens. The L10H chickens as well as the L10L chickens also showed an increased number of CD4?CD8?æ T-cells when an MBL ligand was added to the vaccine, most pronouncedly after the first vaccination. As MBL ligands co-administered with IBV vaccine induced differences between the two chicken lines, these results indirectly suggest that MBL is involved in the immune response to IBV vaccination.

A 3-D airway system of a volunteer subject with a large respiratory system was reconstructed from the nostril inlet to the end of the tracheobronchial tree 4th generation and was integrated into a standing mannequin at the center of a room. The room ventilation system supplied air through a diffuser and expelled air via a damper in three modes. The airflow field was first evaluated by solving the governing equations and the k- SST transitional turbulence model using the Ansys-Fluent software. Then spherical particles with various diameters were released into the room, and their trajectories were evaluated using the Lagrangian approach. Aspiration fraction and particle deposition for inhalation flow rates of 15 and 30 L/min were analyzed using a modified discrete random walk (DRW) stochastic model using a user-defined function (UDF) coupled to the Ansys-Fluent discrete phase model. For the first ventilation mode, a recirculation flow region formed behind the mannequin that led the airflow streamlines to the breathing zone. A recirculation flow formed in front of the face for the second ventilation mode that led the airflow streamlines out of the mannequin breathing zone. For the third mode, however, there was no strong recirculation flow zone around the mannequin. Simulation results showed that the aspiration fraction in the first ventilation mode was higher than the other modes. In addition, the regional deposition rates and deposition patterns of particles inside the respiratory system were presented for each region. Accordingly, most large particles were trapped in the nasal passage; however, some large particles penetrated deeper into the airway due to the large airway size. For the higher breathing rate, the percentage of large escaped particles from the lobe branches dropped by a factor of 7 compared to the lower breathing rate.","output":"Particle inhalability of a standing mannequin with large airways in a ventilated room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Life during the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, intense, and traumatic.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression. However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans. The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis. We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans. The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach. Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes. Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed. Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model. Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition.","output":"Increasing the translation of mouse models of MERS coronavirus pathogenesis through kinetic hematological analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Recent advances in RNA-based medicine have provided new opportunities for the global current challenge, i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic. Novel vaccines are based on a messenger RNA (mRNA) motif with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vector, consisting of high content of unique pH-sensitive ionizable lipids (ILs). Here we provide molecular insights into the role of the ILs and lipid mixtures used in current mRNA vaccines. We observed that the lipid mixtures adopted a nonlamellar organization, with ILs separating into a very disordered, pH-sensitive phase. We describe structural differences of the two ILs leading to their different congregation, with implications for the vaccine stability. Finally, as RNA interacts preferentially with IL-rich phases located at the regions with high curvature of lipid phase, local changes in RNA flexibility and base pairing are induced by lipids. A proper atomistic understanding of RNAClipid interactions may enable rational tailoring of LNP composition for efficient RNA delivery.","output":"Role of Ionizable Lipids in SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines As Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations: From Membrane Structure to Interaction with mRNA Fragments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that has dramatically spread worldwide.

States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government \\" Although this clause might seem to confer significant power to oversee the political structures of the states, ambiguity about the Clause's meaning, coupled with the Supreme Court's historic disinclination to define its contours, have led some observers to question whether the Clause is a paper tiger While recent scholarship has focused mostly on what a \\"Republican Form of Government\\" might entail, less attention has been given to the threshold questions of who might serve as guarantors of the Clause and precisely what forms of action they might take under it This Article concludes that while all federal branches may have a role to play as guarantors of republican government, the logic, location, and history of the Republican Guarantee Clause suggest that the Clause most directly empowers the political branches, and especially Congress, to act as guarantor Often forgotten, but of critical importance, is that the Clause served as the chief constitutional basis for Reconstruction after the Civil War, and it helped pave the way for ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments in the southern states This history suggests that the Clause and those Amendments-- on which twentieth-century voting rights legislation was based--should be understood and interpreted in light of one another This Article explores the role the Clause might play as an alternative source of federal legislative power to guarantee basic political processes alongside--or in place of--these Reconstruction Amendments These questions have renewed significance today, given recent and frequent constitutional confrontations between Congress and the Supreme Court regarding the scope of Congress's constitutional power to interpret and enforce the Reconstruction Amendments Most recently, in Shelby County v Holder (2013), the Court struck down portions of the Voting Rights Act as extending beyond Congress's Fifteenth Amendment Enforcement Clause power Around the same time, many state governments began to impose new restrictions on voter registration and access to the ballot box These new measures, coupled with the Supreme Court's holding in Rucho v Common Cause (2019) that legal challenges to partisan gerrymandering are not justiciable in federal courts, has provoked renewed calls for federal protections to guarantee fairness in state political processes Other recent developments, including the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, have also led to calls for greater congressional oversight of state electoral procedures This Article considers whether the Clause might serve as an additional constitutional basis for federal legislation and explores the interpretive arguments Congress might raise to justify the power to reform electoral processes in the states under the Clause This Article also questions the prevailing view that the Supreme Court has always treated the Clause as functionally nonjusticiable It argues that even following established precedents, the contemporary Court might well engage with the merits of legislation and litigation commenced under the Clause, given the Court's recent penchant for enhanced scrutiny of congressional enforcement powers under the Reconstruction Amendments Such challenges would spark a historical constitutional confrontation between Congress and the Court as to the meaning of the Clause The Court might take one of several approaches when interpreting Congress's power to legislate under the Clause, and this Article concludes that the Clause is the rare constitutional provision that would seem to grant both the courts and the political branches independent and complementary bases to guarantee republican government Judicial scrutiny of congressional actions taken under the Clause should be heightened when congressional efforts can more readily be achieved by the states or by the courts and diminished when only Congress or president could eff ctively serve as the guarantor [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Vanderbilt Law Review is the property of Vanderbilt Law Review and

way to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is by using vaccination to generate widespread immunity. The urgent need to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines was met with unprecedented speed and action from the global community. There are now 289 vaccines in the development pipeline. More remarkably, there are 20 publicly available vaccines, and more than 3.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across 180 countries. This is just the beginning of our fight against the pandemic. Even at the current vaccination rate, it could take years to vaccinate the world's population; many high-income countries are focusing on their needs, whereas the poorer nations are waiting for vaccines. There is still much that we do not understand about immunity to this new disease, and we will have to contend with the emerging variants. In this commentary, we describe the current status of COVID-19 vaccine development and provide insights into how the development and approvals happened so quickly. We discuss the clinical trial data that led to rapid emergency use authorization and the many challenges of global rollout. We also comment on some of the key unanswered questions and future directions for COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: Where Are We Now?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To explore the clinical effect of \\"Feiyan Yihao\\" Chinese medicine granules in the treatment of cases of COVID-19","output":"Therapeutic effect of integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine on COVID-19 in Guangzhou"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE This article analyzes the changes in downloads and activity of users of select popular mental health mobile applications (mHealth apps) during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BACKGROUND The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond. METHOD Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. RESULTS Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. CONCLUSION This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows. APPLICATION The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care. Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered, easy to use, evidence-based, well-integrated with professional care, and used sustainably.","output":"Investigating Popular Mental Health Mobile Application Downloads and Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/purpose: Dental visits are a high risk activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigated the utilization of emergency dental services and clinical practical attitudes of dental residents in this period. Materials and methods: Retrospective chart data from 13th November 2019 to 31st March 2020 in Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Taiwan were used. We obtained electronic medical records to review data from 515 patients who visited the emergency department with dental complaints and we contacted the 26 residents assigned to act as primary care providers to participate in this study. Results: After the COVID-19 outbreak, 17% fewer patients had dental emergency utilization at a hospital emergency center relative to the previous period. A survey of residents also showed a decline in the number of patients. There were no significant differences of patients' problems and diagnoses between the two periods. After the COVID-19 outbreak, 61.5% of the residents were afraid of being infected by a patient's disease and the proportions of dentists wearing waterproof gowns, face shields, and surgical hair caps were 76.9%, 88.5%, and 76.3%, respectively. These variables increased significantly after the outbreak of COVID-19. Conclusion: Despite the trend of a decreased number of patients, their utilization of dental emergency services seems to be similar before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, possibly related to strict hospital infection control policies and the relatively low number of COVID-19 confirmed patients internationally at that time.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the utilization of dental services and attitudes of dental residents at the emergency department of a medical center in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus agent of the COVID-19 pandemic causing high mortalities. In contrast, the widely spread human coronaviruses OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL63 tend to cause only mild symptoms. The present study shows, by in silico analysis, that these common human viruses are expected to induce immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 by sharing protein fragments (antigen epitopes) for presentation to the immune system by MHC class I. A list of such epitopes is provided. The number of these epitopes and the prevalence of the common coronaviruses suggest that a large part of the world population has some degree of specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 already, even without having been infected by that virus. For inducing protection, booster vaccinations enhancing existing immunity are less demanding than primary vaccinations against new antigens. Therefore, for the discussion on vaccination strategies against COVID-19, the available immune memory against related viruses should be part of the consideration.","output":"Expected immune recognition of COVID-19 virus by memory from earlier infections with common coronaviruses in a large part of the world population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adjuvants are vaccine components that enhance the magnitude, breadth and durability of the immune response. Following its introduction in the 1920s, alum remained the only adjuvant licensed for human use for the next 70 years. Since the 1990s, a further five adjuvants have been included in licensed vaccines, but the molecular mechanisms by which these adjuvants work remain only partially understood. However, a revolution in our understanding of the activation of the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) is improving the mechanistic understanding of adjuvants, and recent conceptual advances highlight the notion that tissue damage, different forms of cell death, and metabolic and nutrient sensors can all modulate the innate immune system to activate adaptive immunity. Furthermore, recent advances in the use of systems biology to probe the molecular networks driving immune response to vaccines ('systems vaccinology') are revealing mechanistic insights and providing a new paradigm for the vaccine discovery and development process. Here, we review the 'known knowns' and 'known unknowns' of adjuvants, discuss these emerging concepts and highlight how our expanding knowledge about innate immunity and systems vaccinology are revitalizing the science and development of novel adjuvants for use in vaccines against COVID-19 and future pandemics.","output":"Emerging concepts in the science of vaccine adjuvants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Little is known about social determinants among refugees resettled in Germany.

We used logistic regression analysis to investigate the effect of family separation on (i) being time-stressed and (ii) having a high risk for adverse mental health, considering sociodemographic and postmigration factors. As a result, more than 30% of participants with a spouse or partner and about 18% with a child or children reported separation. Multiple logistic regression showed that family separation was not associated with being time-stressed, but separation from at least one child was associated with adverse mental health (OR = 3.53, 95% CI = [1.23, 10.11]).

RESULTS All of these cases evidence the continued important role of both the multidisciplinary planning prior to any surgical interventions in people with bleeding disorders and the key role of the Nurse Specialist in ensuring this plan is then implemented. Key focuses of communication with all parties involved in the patient journey, performing education for the patient, family and wider healthcare team about the underlying bleeding disorder and the importance of time critical medicines being given on time is essential. CONCLUSION These cases demonstrate that individuals with bleeding disorders are at risk of developing other rare conditions alongside their life long condition, in addition to comorbidities associated with ageing.

This study explores at global scale whether the loss and gain of forest cover and the rise of oil palm plantations can promote outbreaks of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Taking into account the human population growth, we find that the increases in outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases from 1990 to 2016 are linked with deforestation, mostly in tropical countries, and with reforestation, mostly in temperate countries. We also find that outbreaks of vector-borne diseases are associated with the increase in areas of palm oil plantations. Our study gives new support for a link between global deforestation and outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases as well as evidences that reforestation and plantations may also contribute to epidemics of infectious diseases. The results are discussed in light of the importance of forests for biodiversity, livelihoods and human health and the need to urgently build an international governance framework to ensure the preservation of forests and the ecosystem services they provide, including the regulation of diseases. We develop recommendations to scientists, public health officers and policymakers who should reconcile the need to preserve biodiversity while taking into account the health risks posed by lack or mismanagement of forests.","output":"Outbreaks of Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases Are Associated With Changes in Forest Cover and Oil Palm Expansion at Global Scale"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Popular media coverage, including of recent positive late stage clinical trials in depression and PTSD, and decriminalization initiatives, are transforming the public perception of psychedelics. However, little is known about levels of knowledge and personal use of psychedelic mushroom(s) (PM) among American adults. Methods: We examined PM use and various measures of health status, quality of life and self-reported mental health outcome measures obtained through a national on-line, cross-sectional survey of adults with a demographic composition representative of the US adult population by region, gender, age, and race (weighted N = 251,297,495) from November 2020-March 2021. Results: General mental health and well-being was a popular reason for PM use (63.6%). PM users were less likely to be overweight than non-users, but overall quality of life (VR-12) was lower for mental health (39.5 vs 45.5). PM users reported significantly higher levels of anxiety (GAD-7 scores of 9.6 vs 5.9) and depression (PHQ-9 scores of 11.2 vs 6.8). They were less likely to have health insurance [OR=0.50 (0.35-0.72)], but reported significantly more healthcare services utilization. Discussion and Conclusions: There is a mismatch between our findings of an association between PM use and poor mental health outcomes, and current discourse on the positive health benefits of PM consumption.

Those who develop delirium are at an increased risk of dementia, cognitive decline and death. Electroencephalography (EEG) during delirium in older adults is characterised by slowing and reduced functional connectivity, but markers of vulnerability are poorly described. We aim to identify EEG spectral power and event-related potential (ERP) markers of incident delirium in older adults to understand neural mechanisms of delirium vulnerability. Characterising delirium vulnerability will provide substantial theoretical advances and outcomes have the potential to be translated into delirium risk assessment tools. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will record EEG in 90 participants over 65 years of age prior to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We will record 4-minutes of resting state (eyes open and eyes closed) and a 5-minute frequency auditory oddball paradigm. Outcome measures will include frequency band power, 1/f offset and slope, and ERP amplitude measures. Participants will undergo cognitive and EEG testing before their elective procedures and daily postoperative delirium assessments.

According to this hypothesis, these agents have capacity to evade the host immune system leading to chronic infection, inflammation, and subsequent deposition of A and phosphorylated-tau in the brain. Co-existing proteinopathies and age-related pathologies are common in AD and the brains of elderly individuals, but whether these are also related to neuroinfections remain to be established. This study determined the prevalence and distribution of neurodegenerative proteinopathies in patients with infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis (n = 13) and neurosyphilis (n = 23). The mean age at death in HSV patients was 53  12 years (range 24C65 years) and survival was 9 daysC6 years following initial infection. The mean age at death and survival in neurosyphilis patients was 60  15 years (range 36C86 years) and 1C5 years, respectively. Neuronal tau-immunoreactivity and neurites were observed in 8 HSV patients and 19 neurosyphilis patients, and in approximately half of these, this was found in regions associated with inflammation and expanding beyond regions expected from the Braak stage of neurofibrillary degeneration. Five neurosyphilis patients had cortical ageing-related tau astrogliopathy. A-plaques were found in 4 HSV patients and 11 neurosyphilis patients. Lewy bodies were observed in one HSV patient and two neurosyphilis patients. TDP-43 pathology was absent.

Large-scale monetary and fiscal measures have been taken globally to minimize the negative outcomes of the pandemic regarding domestic demand, foreign trade, and tourism activities. The aim of this study is to determine how the changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Eurozone countries affect the macroeconomic indicators. The findings obtained within the scope of the study were mapped in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment. In this study, the economic effects of the pandemic on the Eurozone countries are evaluated in terms of the gross domestic product (GDP), one of the most important indicators for evaluating the strength of the country's economies and development levels, inflation, unemployment, and industrial production. It was seen that the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Eurozone economies manifested themselves in the first quarter of 2020 (Q1) and these effects reached their maximum level in the second quarter (Q2) of the same year. The recovery period and the positive trends signaling a way out of this crisis are observed to start in the third quarter (Q3). The economic developments in this period emerged from the normalization attempts and the relaxation of the tight restriction measures which had been put into practice at the beginning of the pandemic process. The restrictions aiming to prevent the spread of pandemic caused contractions in tourism, industry, and other sectors while resulting in unemployment in these sectors. Switching back to normal, gave way decreases in unemployment rates in the related sectors.","output":"Covid-19 Pandemisinin Avro B?lgesinde Byme, ?sizlik, Enflasyon ve Endstriyel retim zerine Etkileri"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak and high fatality rate of COVID-19 infection have attracted the attention of scientists due to the strong interactions between components of metabolic syndrome, metabolic abnormalities, and viral pathobiology of COVID-19. Combined metabolic cofactors supplementation (CMCS) consisting of L-serine, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and L-carnitine tartrate is being studied for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a placebo-controlled, phase-2 clinical trial involving ambulatory COVID-19 patients. A total of 100 patients were randomly assigned on a 3:1 basis to hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS or hydroxychloroquine plus placebo. The total treatment period for the hydroxychloroquine was 5 days, and for the CMCS/placebo was 14 days. Clinical status was evaluated daily by phone, using a binomial scale for subject reported presence or absence for multiple COVID-19 related symptoms. Plasma samples for clinical chemistry analyses were collected on day 0 and day 14. RESULTS A total of 93 patients completed the trial. The combination of CMCS and hydroxychloroquine significantly reduced the average complete recovery time compared with hydroxychloroquine and placebo (6.6 days vs 9.3 days, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in ALT, AST and LDH levels on day 14 compared to day 0 in the hydroxychloroquine plus CMCS group. The adverse effects were uncommon and self-limiting. CONCLUSIONS In patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, CMCS resulted in a significant reduction in recovery time and liver enzymes associated with hepatic function compared to placebo. We observed that CMSC is associated with a low incidence of adverse events.","output":"Combined metabolic cofactor supplementation accelerates recovery in mild-to-moderate COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential effects of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are uncertain, although numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact. This paper aims to synthesize and review all the literature regarding the topic in a systematic manner to eliminate the bias and provide an overall insight, while incorporating some statistical analysis to provide an interval estimate of these studies. This paper addressed the effect of the positive and negative impacts reported in the literature in two categories of AVs: partial automation and full automation. The positive impacts represented in AVs' possibility to reduce GHG emission can be attributed to some factors, including eco-driving, eco traffic signal, platooning, and less hunting for parking. The increase in vehicle mile travel (VMT) due to (i) modal shift to AVs by captive passengers, including elderly and disabled people and (ii) easier travel compared to other modes will contribute to raising the GHG emissions. The result shows that eco-driving and platooning have the most significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions by 35%. On the other side, easier travel and faster travel significantly contribute to the increase of GHG emissions by 41.24%. Study findings reveal that the positive emission changes may not be realized at a lower AV penetration rate, where the maximum emission reduction might take place within 60-80% of AV penetration into the network.","output":"Impacts of Autonomous Vehicles on Greenhouse Gas Emissions-Positive or Negative?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing.

This study aims at assessing global research evolution, precedence, and preparedness toward combating the COVID-19 pandemic via systematic analysis of published studies. We retrieved COVID-19 studies from Scopus and Web of Science databases from January 01, 2020, to March 23, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines using the search term COVID-19 OR coronavir?. The dataset was analyzed for productivity indices, conceptual frameworks (CFs), discipline, and collaboration networks (CNs). Results revealed a total of 817 studies on COVID-19. The top two productive researchers include those by Wang Y. (3.55%) and Li Y. (2.94%). Among disciplines, virology (n = 40, 5 h-index), microbiology (n = 27, 2 h-index), immunology (n = 22), and infectious diseases (n = 21) were at the forefront. China (n = 181) and the United States (n = 69) ranked the first and second productive nations, respectively. Country CNs in COVID-19 can be clustered into four subnetworks. Also, four thematic areas evolved in COVID-19 research for the period, namely, epidemiologic studies of infectious bronchitis virus including coronavirus, elucidation of historical respiratory viral outbreaks, zoonoses and phylogenetic analysis, and influenza zoonosis; while the prevailing CFs of research prioritization ranged from comparative symptomatology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), perceptivity studies from SARS-CoV-1,2 outbreaks, antigenic structural studies for vaccine production to antibody therapeutic target studies.

Systematic appraisal of senior surgeons' consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK consultants' opinions on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We E-mailed a Web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland mailing list on the April 17, 2020, and we predetermined to close the survey on the April 21, 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons' opinions using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. RESULTS: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least 1 consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions: (1) before any hospital admission for cardiac surgery, nasopharyngeal swab, polymerase chain reaction, and computed tomography of the chest should be performed; (2) the use of full personal protective equipment should to be adopted in every case by the theater team regardless of the patient's COVID-19 status; (3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; and (4) cardiac procedures should be decided based on a rapidly convened multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery during the pandemic was controversial.

The disease is characterized by strong infectivity, high morbidity, and high mortality. It is still spreading in some countries. Microbiota and their metabolites affect human physiological health and diseases by participating in host digestion and nutrition, promoting metabolic function, and regulating the immune system. Studies have shown that human microecology is associated with many diseases, including COVID-19. In this research, we first reviewed the microbial characteristics of COVID-19 from the aspects of gut microbiome, lung microbime, and oral microbiome. We found that significant changes take place in both the gut microbiome and airway microbiome in patients with COVID-19 and are characterized by an increase in conditional pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacteria. Then, we summarized the possible microecological mechanisms involved in the progression of COVID-19. Intestinal microecological disorders in individuals may be involved in the occurrence and development of COVID-19 in the host through interaction with ACE2, mitochondria, and the lung-gut axis. In addition, fecal bacteria transplantation (FMT), prebiotics, and probiotics may play a positive role in the treatment of COVID-19 and reduce the fatal consequences of the disease.","output":"Potential Associations Between Microbiome and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this review was to propose multi-pronged resumption strategies for lacrimal practice in an effort to plan a sustainable recommencement of elective surgeries after we emerge from the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies for lacrimal practice were classified into 7 subtypes, and each of the blueprints were reassessed based on existing information on resumption strategies of elective surgeries from other specialties in COVID-19 era. The specific needs of lacrimal practice were then added to construct algorithms summarizing the resumption strategies. The basic principle of 'primum non nocere' needs to be followed. The overall proposed plan advocates the transition to a more sustainable health care reality in a world where we would still co-exist with COVID-19. A comprehensive effort involving screening, laboratory testing, appropriate triage, effective personal protection and specific precautionary measures for lacrimal clinics and operating room are needed to be able to safely resume elective surgery when the pandemic peak declines. To predict the timing of the resumption of elective surgeries is quite complex and influenced by several geographic, political and economic factors. It is equally important to remember that COVID-19 crisis is a dynamic situation and constantly evolving, hence the strategies provided are subject to change. Strict adherence to standard COVID-19 guidelines combined with effective testing and personal protection strategies can ensure slow yet smooth and safe return to full lacrimal practice after the COVID-19 pandemic calms down.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 2 1/2 years old girl was diagnosed as having alveolar proteinosis. Whole lung lavages were performed with a new catheter balloon technique, feasible in small sized airways. Because of some interstitial inflammation in the lung biopsy and to further improve the condition, empirical therapy with systemic steroids and azathioprin, and inhaled and subcutaneous GMCSF, were used. Based on clinical measures, total protein and lipid recovered by whole lung lavages, all these treatments were without benefit. Conversely, severe respiratory viral infections and an invasive aspergillosis with aspergilloma formation occurred. Recently the novel homozygous stop mutation p.Ser25X of the GMCSF receptor alpha chain was identified in the patient. This mutation leads to a lack of functional GMCSF receptor and a reduced response to GMCSF stimulation of CD11b expression of mononuclear cells of the patient. Subsequently a very intense treatment with monthly lavages was initiated, resulting for the first time in complete resolution of partial respiratory insufficiency and a significant improvement of the overall somato-psychosocial condition of the child.

CONCLUSION RA-LDP for benign or borderline tumors of the pancreas is a safe procedure and tended to be associated with a better vessel-preservation rate, thereby making it a good alternative to C-LDP.","output":"Robotic-Assisted Approach Improves Vessel Preservation in Spleen-Preserving Distal Pancreatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging global threat The severe patients were given supportive treatment in the ICU where is the primary site for the hospital-acq","output":"Risk Factors Associated with Hospital-Acquired Infections for COVID-19 Patients in ICU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study was to modernize the existing prognostic regression models in the context of expanding knowledge about the new coronavirus infection Materials and Methods The modification of models and the increase in their predictive ability are based on collecting the available data from international and Russian databases We calculated the traditional descriptive statistics and used the linear regression analysis for modeling The work was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 26 0 and the R 3 6 0 (RStudio) software Results Manifestations of the COVID-19 epidemic process in several countries were studied;special attention was put to the number of deaths associated with the infection A significant proportion of severe cases were noted among patients both in Russia and elsewhere Considering that the disease incidence has reached its peak in China and Italy, we were able to improve the previously published (Sovremennye tehnologii v medicine 2020, Vol 12, No 2) regression models and to compare their performance The first modified model is based on the absolute increase in new cases of the infection: its regression coefficient is 0 16 (95% CI 0 137C0 181) In the extended version of the updated model, we additionally considered cases of aggravated COVID-19: the regression coefficients were 0 128 (95% CI 0 103C0 153) for model 2 and 0 053 (95% CI 0 029C0 077) for model 1 1;p=0 0001 Conclusion Based on the most recent data (from January to May 2020) on the incidence of COVID-19 in the world, we have developed more specific versions of the basic and extended regression models of lethal outcomes The resulting models are optimized and extrapolated to the current epidemiological situation;they will allow us to improve our analytical approach For that purpose, data collection is currently ongoing","output":"Modernization of regression models to predict the number of deaths from the new coronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: To validate a real-time Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Activity Index as a marker of ICU strain from daily data available from the Critical Health Resource Information System (CHRIS), and to investigate the association between this Index and the need to transfer critically ill patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Victoria, Australia. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: All 45 hospitals with an ICU in Victoria, Australia. Participants: Patients in all Victorian ICUs and all critically ill patients transferred between Victorian hospitals from 27 June to 6 September 2020. Main outcome measure: Acute interhospital transfer of one or more critically ill patients per day from one site to an ICU in another hospital. Results: 150 patients were transported over 61 days from 29 hospitals (64%). ICU Activity Index scores were higher on days when critical care transfers occurred (median, 1.0 [IQR, 0.4-1.7] v 0.6 [IQR, 0.3-1.2];P < 0.001). Transfers were more common on days of higher ICU occupancy, higher numbers of ventilated or COVID-19 patients, and when more critical care staff were unavailable. The highest ICU Activity Index scores were observed at hospitals in northwestern Melbourne, where the COVID-19 disease burden was greatest. After adjusting for confounding factors, including occupancy and lack of available ICU staff, a rising ICU Activity Index score was associated with an increased risk of a critical care transfer (odds ratio, 4.10;95% CI, 2.34-7.18;P < 0.001). Conclusions: The ICU Activity Index appeared to be a valid marker of ICU strain during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is proven that the leading greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone,influence genetic activity and affect humans. It is also known that because of this effect, water vapor in the Finnish sauna and Russian bath also has a positive impact on a person. In this paper, a comparative analysis of this phenomenon is carried out based on the obtained experimental data. In the first case, the total radiation power (absorption) was calculated in the dipole approximation, taking into account the dipole moment and the resonant frequency of the DNA molecule-the number of all DNA in the cell and all human cells. The emission power of greenhouse gases was determined, taking into account the radiation power in its model spectrum and the coefficient corresponding to the ratio of the integral intensities of the observed spectrum and the spectrum according to the model representations. In the second case, a calculated model of the greenhouse effect was used to estimate the impact on humans of the optical power of radiation in the I.R. region in the band of deformation vibrations of water vapor in the Finnish sauna and Russian bath. This power was calculated using the classical formula for dipole radiation in quantum mechanical analysis. Consequently, the power was determined by the energy of the considered oscillation and the probability of spontaneous transition to the main oscillatory level of water vapor, taking into account humidity and temperature in the Russian bath Finnish sauna. It turned out that the two powers at these given parameters coincide, and they are much larger than the corresponding optical powers for greenhouse (atmospheric) gases falling on a person.","output":"Analysing the Impact of Greenhouse Gases on Genetic and Human Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all portions of the global population.

METHODS Systematic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to 30th September 2020 were conducted. Phase II and III double blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of JAKi at licensed doses were included. RCTs with no placebo arm, Long term extension studies, post hoc, and pooled analyses were excluded. Three researchers independently extracted data on JAKi and placebo exposure and VTE (pulmonary emboli and deep vein thromboses) events and assessed study quality. RESULTS A total of 42 studies were included, from an initial search of 619. There were 6,542 JAKi patient exposure years (PEY), compared to 1,578 placebo PEY. There were 15 VTE events in the JAKi group and four in the placebo group.

We previously surveyed patients within our health system and found that a large majority wanted to view their own radiology images online, and we have since implemented this new feature. OBJECTIVE We aim to understand patient experiences, opinions, and actions taken after viewing their own radiology images online. METHODS We emailed a web-based survey to patients who recently viewed their radiology images via our electronic patient portal. RESULTS We sent 1825 surveys to patients and received 299 responses (response rate 16.4%). Patients reported a favorable experience (258/299, 86.3% agree) viewing their radiology images online. Patients found value in reading their radiology reports (288/299, 96.3% agree) and viewing their images (267/299, 89.3% agree). Overall, patients felt that accessing and viewing their radiology images online increased their understanding of their medical condition (258/299, 82.9%), made them feel more in control and reassured (237/299, 79.2% and 220/299, 73.6%, respectively), and increased levels of trust (214/299, 71.6%). Only 6.4% (19/299) of the patients indicated concerns with finding errors, 6.4% (19/299) felt that viewing their images online made them worry more, and 7% (21/299) felt confused when viewing their images online. Of patients who viewed their images online, 45.2% (135/299) took no action with their images, 32.8% (98/299) saved a copy for their records, 25.4% (76/299) shared them with their doctor, and 14.7% (44/299) shared them with another doctor for a second opinion. A total of 9 patients (3%) shared their radiology images on Facebook, Instagram, or both, primarily to inform family and friends. Approximately 10.4% (31/299) of the patients had questions about their radiology images after viewing them online, with the majority (20/31, 65%) seeking out a doctor, and far fewer (5/31, 16%) choosing to ask a family member about their images. Finally, respondents viewed their images online using 1 or more devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, or a combination of these devices. Approximately 26.7% (103/385) of the responses noted technical difficulties, with the highest incidence rate occurring with smartphones. CONCLUSIONS We report the first known survey results from patients who viewed their own radiology images through a web-based portal. Patients reported high levels of satisfaction and increased levels of trust, autonomy, reassurance, and medical understanding. Only a small minority of patients expressed anxiety or confusion. We suggest that patient access to radiology images, such as patient access to radiology reports, is highly desired by patients and is operationally practical. Other health care institutions should consider offering patients access to their radiology images online in the pursuit of information transparency.","output":"Understanding Patient Experiences, Opinions, and Actions Taken After Viewing Their Own Radiology Images Online: Web-Based Survey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a mid-life onset neurodegenerative disease that manifests its symptomatology with motor impairments and cognitive deficits overlapping with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD).

By the end of nineteenth century, these beliefs were displaced by more modern concepts of disease, namely, the formulation of the germ theory, which asserted that bacteria or other microorganisms caused disease. With the emergence of chronic degenerative and of autoimmune diseases in the last century, the causative role of microorganisms has been intensely debated; however, no clear explanatory models have been achieved. In this review, we examine the current available literature regarding the relationships between infections and 16 autoimmune diseases. We critically analyzed clinical, serological, and molecular associations, and reviewed experimental models of induction of and, alternatively, protection from autoimmune diseases by infection. After reviewing several studies and reports, a clinical and experimental pattern emerges: Chronic and multiple infections with viruses, such as EpsteinCBarr virus and cytomegalovirus, and bacteria, such as H. pylori, may, in susceptible individuals, play a role in the evolvement of autoimmune diseases. As the vast majority of infections pertain to our resident microbiota and endogenous retroviruses and healthy carriage of infections is the rule, we propose to focus on understanding the mechanisms of this healthy carrier state and what changes its configurations to infectious syndromes, to the restoration of health, or to the sustaining of illness into a chronic state and/or autoimmune disease. It seems that in the development of this healthy carriage state, the infection or colonization in early stages of ontogenesis with key microorganisms, also called old friends (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria among others), are important for the healthy living and for the protection from infectious and autoimmune syndromes.","output":"Infections and Autoimmunity: A Panorama"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a major clinical, economic, and societal burden, the development of curative antiviral therapy may accelerate the path toward elimination. This analysis assessed the progress of United States (US) states towards achieving the World Health Organizations (WHO) 2030 HCV elimination targets for incidence, mortality, diagnosis, and treatment. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was used to simulate HCV progression over time to estimate the path to HCV elimination in each state based on prevalence, annual treatment, and diagnosis inputs from two large US laboratory datasets from January 2013 to December 2017. State-specific fibrosis stage restrictions on treatment in 2017 were included. The model estimated the year individual states would meet the WHO targets for diagnosing 90% of the HCV-infected population, treating 80% of the eligible population, reducing new HCV infections by 80%, and reducing HCV-related deaths by 65%. The minimum number of annual treatments needed between 2020 and 2030 to achieve the WHO treatment target was also calculated. RESULTS: Overall, the USA is projected to achieve HCV elimination by 2037, with individual targets related to mortality, diagnosis, treatment, and incidence being achieved by 2020, 2027, 2033, and 2037, respectively. Three states (Connecticut, South Carolina, and Washington) are on track to meet all four elimination targets by 2030, and 18 states are not expected to meet these targets before 2040. The estimated annual number of treatments required during 2020C2030 nationally to reach the WHO treatment target is 173,514. CONCLUSION: With the exception of three states, the USA is not on target to meet the WHO 2030 elimination targets and 35% are off track by 10 years or more. Strategies must be implemented to reduce overall prevalence by preventing new infections, increasing rates of screening, improving linkage to care, and implementing unfettered access to curative therapy.

The patients were divided into two groups as successful (group A) and failed ETV group (group B) according to their postoperative evaluation. ONSD was measured on pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) and Evan's index (EI), diameter of third ventricule (V3), the patency of ETV stoma and periventricular edema were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS The mean ONSD was measured as 6.390.92mm for the right eye, 6.500.91mm for the left eye on preoperative CT. The mean ONSD by CT (after surgery) was 4.890.87mm for the right eye, 5.020.1mm for the left eye (p<0.05). Postoperative group A and group B were compared according to ONSD measurement; mean ONSD in group A was 4.520.69mm for the right and 4.590.9mm for the left, mean ONSD in group B was 5.820.51mm for the right and 6.10.32mm for the left (p<0.05). The best ONSD value for detecting failed ETV was 5.40mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.938) for right and 5.91mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.950) for left.

However, this led to more caution, which may lead to xenophobia. Via ethnography, this study unmasks the xenophobic attitude. This research discusses the root causes of panic in the community so that remedies can be implemented. The research attempts to explain, from a socio-anthropological viewpoint, how people and religious groups in the village perceive the pandemic of COVID-19 based on their belief in their faith and in the science. The research takes place in Cigagak village, an area of approximately 7000 m2 on the outskirts of Bandung of West Java of Indonesia. This study examines the selected respondents (20 respondents as the samples) from about 190 inhabitants (as the population) who had close ties to managing places of worship (mosques) and public places. This study utilises a collaborative self-ethnographic method and qualitative analysis. The influence of COVID-19 has moved to new exclusive and disintegrating practices from the inclusion-cohesive religious tradition. Therefore, this study tries to find out ways on how to reduce exclusive perception and religious practices to a minimum level and how to disappear xenophobia. Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, inclusive awareness and actions were re-established, and even social cohesiveness was fostered. This study concludes that in its deep conviction nature, theology can change exclusive behaviour to be inclusive if it is based on the religious principles that are raised in response to human events.

It is recommended that CVD patients attend cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following a cardiac event to reduce mortality, improve recovery and positively influence behaviour around CVD risk factors. Despite the recognised benefits and international recommendations for exercise-based CR, uptake and attendance remain suboptimal. A greater understanding of CR barriers and facilitators is required, not least to inform service development. Through understanding current cardiac patients attitudes and opinions around CR and physical activity (PA) could inform patient-led improvements. Moreover, through understanding aspects of CR and PA that participants like/dislike could provide healthcare providers and policy makers with information around what elements to target in the future. AIM: To investigate participants attitudes and opinions around CR and PA. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional survey design on 567 cardiac patients. Cardiac patients who were referred for standard CR classes at a hospital in the Scottish Highlands, from May 2016 to May 2017 were sampled. As part of a larger survey, the current study analysed the free-text responses to 5 open-ended questions included within the wider survey. Questions were related to the participants experience of CR, reasons for non-attendance, ideas to increase attendance and their opinions on PA. Qualitative data were analysed using a 6-step, reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two main topic areas were explored: Cardiac rehabilitation experience and physical activity. Self-efficacy was increased as a result of attending CR due to exercising with similar individuals and the safe environment offered. Barriers ranged from age and health to distance and starting times of the classes which increased travel time and costs. Moreover, responses demonstrated a lack of information and communication around the classes. Respondents highlighted that the provision of more classes and classes being held out with working hours, in addition to a greater variety would increase attendance. In terms of PA, respondents viewed this as different to the CR experience. Responses demonstrated increased freedom when conducting PA with regards to the location, time and type of exercise conducted. CONCLUSION: Changes to the structure of CR may prove important in creating long term behaviour change after completing the rehabilitation programme.","output":"Barriers and facilitators to participating in cardiac rehabilitation and physical activity: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We have determined the kinetics of virus production and virus-specific RNA synthesis in Sac(?) cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Immunofluorescence showed that all cells became infected at a multiplicity of 10 PFU/cell. The virus was concentrated and purified to obtain the high titered stocks needed for these one-step growth experiments. Release of virus into the culture medium started 4 hr after infection (pi) and was complete at 10 hr pi. Synthesis of virus-specific RNA, measured by the incorporation of [3H]uridine in the presence of 1 g/ml actinomycin D, also started at 4 hr pi and its maximum rate occurred between 6 and 8 hr pi. RNA labeled during this period was isolated from infected cells. About 50% of this RNA bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured with glyoxal-dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Seven RNA species with the following molecular weights were present: 5.6  106 (RNA1), 4.0  106 (RNA2), 3.0  106 (RNA3), 1.4  106 (RNA4), 1.2  106 (RNA5), 0.9  106 (RNA6), and 0.6  106 (RNA7). RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. To determine whether these RNA species were functional as messengers in infected cells, virus-specific RNAs present in polyribosomes were analyzed. EDTA treatment was used to discriminate between RNA present in polyribosomes and in EDTA-resistant, presumably ribonucleoprotein, particles. Most (91%) of RNA1 was present in EDTA-resistant particles; the remainder and all other RNAs synthesized between 6 and 8 hr pi were present in polyribosomes. We conclude that MHV-A59 has six subgenomic mRNAs. Since the total molecular mass (11.1  106 daltons) of these messengers is about twice that of the viral genome, sequence homologies must exist between the mRNAs. The position of these homologous regions and the translation products of each of the mRNAs remain to be determined.","output":"Isolation and identification of virus-specific mRNAs in cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The major cause for the continuous spreading of the COVID-19 disease is the human to human transmission of the virus. The virus enters the human body through exposed areas such as the mouth, nose and eyes through touching, coughing, sneezing or close proximity with infected people. So it is imperative people cover specific body parts to avoid contracting the disease and stop the transmission of the virus. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as face mask, face shield, gloves help in this cause. Unfortunately some people are reluctant to wear PPE. In such situations a real-time monitoring system for PPE is needed. In this study we have developed a detector which can detect in real time if people are wearing PPE or not. The detector is developed using YOLOv4 computer vision model which specially performs well in real time object detection. We have prepared a combined dataset consisting of collected images and our captured images. We have annotated our images and image augmentation is done on all the training set images. We have also converted the detector weight to TensorFlow format to check live detection performance and added features like live object count and record keeping.

The era of Internet of Everything has therefore started to come into play, giving rise to unprecedented traffic growths. In this context, optical core networks forming the backbone of Internet infrastructure have been under critical issues of reaching the capacity limit of conventional fiber, a phenomenon widely referred as capacity crunch. For many years, the many-fold increases in fiber capacity is thanks to exploiting physical dimensions for multiplexing optical signals such as wavelength, polarization, time and lately space-division multiplexing using multi-core fibers and such route seems to come to an end as almost all known ways have been exploited. This necessitates for a departure from traditional approaches to use the fiber capacity more efficiently and thereby improve economics of scale. This paper lays out a new perspective to integrate network coding (NC) functions into optical networks to achieve greater capacity efficiency by upgrading intermediate nodes functionalities. In addition to the review of recent proposals on new research problems enabled by NC operation in optical networks, we also report state-of-the-art findings in the literature in an effort to renew the interest of NC in optical networks and discuss three critical points for pushing forward its applicability and practicality including i) NC as a new dimension for multiplexing optical signals ii) algorithmic aspects of NC-enabled optical networks design iii) NC as an entirely fresh way for securing optical signals at physical layers","output":"Network Coding in Photonic-land: Three Commandments for Future-proof Optical Core Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professions have taken a significant blow from the shutdown of businesses, the need for social distancing, the disruptions in supply chains, and the personnel issues brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic How soon the markets will recover, and to what extent, depends on many factors ? 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers","output":"What Now?

This study aimed to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of a previously designed peptide named PVP towards the clinical strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. Secondary structure, cytotoxicity, and membrane-permeabilizing effects of the peptide were also assessed. PVP had a tendency to adopt alpha-helical conformation based upon structural predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy (in 50% trifluoroethanol). The peptide showed MIC values ranging from 1 to 16 g/mL against 10 strains of MRSA. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, PVP at sub-lethal concentration (1 g/mL) did not provoke the development of peptide resistance after 14 serial passages. Remarkably, 1 h of exposure to 4  MBC of PVP (8 g/mL) was sufficient for total bacterial clearance, whereas 4  MBC of vancomycin (8 g/mL) failed to totally eradicate bacterial cells, even after 8 h. PVP showed negligible cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts at concentrations required to kill the MRSA strains. The results of flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy revealed that PVP caused bacterial membrane permeabilization, eventually culminating in cell death. Owing to the potent anti-bacterial activity, fast bactericidal kinetics, and negligible cytotoxicity, PVP has the potential to be used as a candidate antibiotic for the topical treatment of MRSA infections.","output":"Anti-Staphylococcal and cytotoxic activities of the short anti-microbial peptide PVP."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical inactivity is a major public health problem, and there are concerns this might have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and pre-dispose to secondary infections. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of critically ill COVID-19 patients during an 8-week span and compared the prevalence of secondary infection and outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. Results: One hundred eleven patients were identified, of which 54 had received tocilizumab while 57 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (48.1 vs. 28.1%; p = 0.029 and fungal (5.6 vs. 0%; p = 0.112) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (35.2 vs. 19.3%; p = 0.020). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In three cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the four cases that had not been given tocilizumab, two showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and two exhibited diffuse alveolar damage.

How droplets and aerosol particles disperse are being transported into the human breathing zone-the last few inches for airborne transmission to effectuate-remains a key question which has been widely overlooked. Human thermal plume refers to the constantly rising airflows around the boundary layer of human body due to persisting temperature gradients between the body surfaces and the ambient air. Ample evidence indicated that the thermal plume controls the dispersion and transport of aerosols in the human microenvironment. Given that in calm indoor environments most air inhaled by human comes from the boundary layer where thermal plume flows through constantly, the role of thermal plume needs to be scrutinized to predict the diffusion of droplets, aerosols and other airborne carriers of the novel coronavirus around the human body for prioritizing infection control strategies. Here, we assessed the potential influences of the thermal plume on the transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens by reviewing the most pertinent evidence and analyzing key variables in the formation of thermal plume in indoor environments, e.g., ambient temperature, human posture and type of clothing. Our reviewed evidence and data indicate that the human thermal plume should facilitate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces by elevating small droplets and airborne particles into the breathing zone from lower regions and ascending respiratory droplets from the sources into the upper atmosphere. By drawing attention to aerosol transport dynamics in the human microenvironment, these insights may be useful for understanding COVID-19 transmission in enclosed spaces, especially those intended for public use.","output":"How human thermal plume influences near-human transport of respiratory droplets and airborne particles: a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Sexual violence (SV) is an important public health problem which may cause long-lasting health problems.

Design: Cross-sectional general population study. Setting: Community-dwelling, assisted living and nursing homes. Participants: 513 people of 70 years and older living in Belgium. Methods: SV was measured using behaviourally specific questions based on a broad definition of SV. Participants were selected via a cluster random probability sampling with a random route finding approach.

Here, we investigated structural factors leading to the mutagenicity of these compounds by synthesizing 1- and 3-NO2BaP derivatives with C6-position substituents that affect reduction properties and testing the mutagenicity of the compounds and their derivatives against Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA98NR. The LUMO and LUMO+1 energies of 6-substituted 3-NO2BaPs were found to correlate with mutagenicity, but such correlations were much weaker with 6-substituted 1-NO2BaPs, indicating that the mutagenicity of 3-NO2BaPs is influenced by the ease of reductive metabolic activation. In silico structural analyses demonstrated that the distances between the nitrogen of the N-acetoxyamino group in reductive metabolites and a DNA alkylation target were longer for 1-NO2BaPs than for 3-NO2BaPs. Therefore, the active metabolites of 6-substituted 3-NO2BaPs intercalate with DNA at a distance where they can readily form adducts with guanine. Conversely, the unfavorable position of intercalated active metabolites of 1-NO2BaPs relative to guanine leads to difficult adduct formation despite the facile formation of the active metabolite due to a low LUMO energy. Therefore, the chemical reducibility of the nitro group and, more importantly, the ease of adduct formation between an active metabolite and DNA are essential for the prediction of the mutagenicity of NO2PAHs.","output":"The position of the nitro group affects the mutagenicity of nitroarenes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated large volumes of clinical data that can be an invaluable resource towards answering a number of important questions for this and future pandemics.

We used data generated from local and state governments, and news organizations to measure the enactment dates and the duration of the orders;and from the US Census Bureau (dated 2019) to measure municipal, county, and state populations. Results: The average coverage over all states was 57.7% of the maximum person days of coverage. States which issued statewide orders from their governors had a total of 67.1% coverage;this includes coverage from regional government orders prior to the statewide orders. States with orders only from municipal or county councils had on average 27.1% coverage.

Many cities around the world promoted temporary transformations of streets, redistributing road space to create emergency cycleways and expand sidewalks to allow the movement of people while granting a certain physical distance between people. While Europe and, to a lesser extent, North America have initially led these initiatives, Latin America has soon followed suit, without much of their technical experience, governance, resources and sometimes public acceptance for sustainable mobility. The paper examines if and how the major disruptive event posed by the COVID-19 has reconfigured sustainable mobility initiatives in Latin American cities. Interviewing key decision-makers, the paper reviews five initiatives across the region to examine the typology of interventions promoted and the spaces involved, the governance schemes that allowed them and the public acceptance towards such measures. The analysis demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic has fostered a faster adoption of sustainable mobility measures such as emergency cycleways, street pedestrianisations and other traffic calming initiatives, facilitating the creation of new coalitions and the public acceptance of these interventions thanks to the sense of urgency generated by the pandemic.","output":"Pandemic-related streets transformations: accelerating sustainable mobility transitions in Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed age-/sex-specific morbidity and mortality data from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China and Republic of Korea (ROK).

SARS-CoV-2 shares many similarities with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A viral replication complex containing non-structural proteins (nsps) is the toolbox for RNA replication and transcription of both coronaviruses. In both cases, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the coronaviral replication complex dictates the primary polymerase activity by cooperating with cofactors. The higher transmissibility and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 are related to its higher RNA replication activity compared to SARS-CoV. The discrepancy between the RNA replication efficiency of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can be understood by exploring interactions within their viral replication complexes. Our modeling of molecular interactions within the viral replication complexes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using molecular dynamics simulations suggests that in contrast to SARS-CoVnsp12, SARS-CoV2nsp12 prefers helices as the dominant interacting secondary motifs. The relative differences in nonbonded interactions between nsps could suggest viral RNA replication ability in coronaviruses.

So far, there are no vaccines or drugs to treat COVID-19. So, research groups worldwide are seeking new molecules targeting the S protein to prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 establishment. We performed molecular docking analysis of eight synthetic peptides against SARS-CoV-2 S protein. All interacted with the protein, but Mo-CBP(3)-PepII and PepKAA had the highest affinity with it. By binding to the S protein, both peptides led to conformational alterations in the protein, resulting in incorrect interaction with ACE2. Therefore, given the importance of the S protein-ACE2 interaction for SARS-CoV-2 infection, synthetic peptides could block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, unlike other antiviral drugs, peptides have no toxicity to human cells. Thus, these peptides are potential molecules to be tested against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new drugs to treat COVID-19.","output":"A molecular docking study revealed that synthetic peptides induced

SETTING The databases including Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Embase (Ovid) were searched between 2010 and 2021, to extract published articles in English, describing ML-based models utilising vital sign variables to predict in-hospital mortality for patients admitted at EDs. Critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies checklist was used for study planning and data extraction. The risk of bias for included papers was assessed using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool. PARTICIPANTS Admitted patients to the ED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE In-hospital mortality. RESULTS Fifteen articles were included in the final review. We found that eight models including logistic regression, decision tree, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, gradient boosting, random forest, artificial neural networks and deep neural networks have been applied in this domain. Most studies failed to report essential main analysis steps such as data preprocessing and handling missing values. Fourteen included studies had a high risk of bias in the statistical analysis part, which could lead to poor performance in practice. Although the main aim of all studies was developing a predictive model for mortality, nine articles did not provide a time horizon for the prediction. CONCLUSION This review provided an updated overview of the state-of-the-art and revealed research gaps; based on these, we provide eight recommendations for future studies to make the use of ML more feasible in practice.

Within this context, the ability of pain specialists to accurately diagnose and plan appropriate interventional spine procedures based entirely on telemedicine visits, without an in-person evaluation, remains to be established. In this study, our primary objective was to assess the relevance of telemedicine to interventional spine procedure planning by determining whether procedure plans established solely from virtual visits changed following in-person evaluation. METHODS: We reviewed virtual and in-person clinical encounters from our academic health system's 10 interventional spine specialists. We included patients who were seen exclusively via telemedicine encounters and indicated for an interventional procedure with documented procedural plans. Virtual plans were then compared with the actual procedures performed following in-person evaluation. Demographic data as well as the type and extent of physical examination performed by the interventional spine specialist were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 87 new patients included, the mean age was 60 years (SE 1.4 years) and the preprocedural plan established by telemedicine, primarily videoconferencing, did not change for 76 individuals (87%; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94) following in-person evaluation. Based on the size of our sample, interventional procedures indicated solely during telemedicine encounters may be accurate in 79%-94% of cases in the broader population. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that telemedicine evaluations are a generally accurate means of preprocedural assessment and development of interventional spine procedure plans.

However, since both the environment and any population are spatially heterogeneous, it is obviously desirable to include spatial structure into an epidemic model. Individuals with tuberculosis can spread the disease by moving from one area to another. In addition, people travel by air between cities, so diseases can be spread quickly between very distant places (as was the case with the COVID-19). In our model, each region's studied population is divided into five compartments S, L1, I, L2, and R. Further, we introduce in our discrete systems three control variables which represent the effectiveness rates of vaccination, travel-blocking operation, and treatment. We focus in our study to control the outbreaks of an epidemic that affects a hypothetical population belonging to a specific region. Firstly, we analyze the epidemic model when the control strategy is based on the vaccination control only, and secondly, when the travel-blocking control is added, we finish with the introduction of the treatment control. The optimal control theory, based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, is applied thrice in this paper, for the characterizations of the vaccination, travel-blocking, and treatment controls. The numerical results associated with the multipoint boundary value problems are obtained based on the forward-backward sweep method combined with progressive-regressive RungeCKutta fourth-order schemes.

In particular, L-type Ca2+ channels, usually located on motoneuron dendrites, play a primary role in amplification of synaptic inputs. However, recent experimental findings on L-type Ca2+ channel behaviors challenge some fundamental assumptions that have been used in interpreting experimental and computational modeling data. Thus, the objectives of this study were to incorporate recent experimental data into an updated, high-fidelity computational model in order to explain apparent inconsistencies, and to better elucidate the spatial distributions, expression patterns, and functional roles of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels. Specifically, the updated model incorporated asymmetric channel activation/deactivation kinetics, depolarization-dependent facilitation, randomness in channel gating, and coactivation of SKL channels. Our simulation results suggest that L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels co-localize primarily on distal dendrites of motoneurons, in a punctate expression. Also, punctate expression, as opposed to a homogenous expression, provides high synaptic current amplification, limits bistability and firing rates, and robustly regulates the Ca2+ persistent inward current, thereby reducing risk of excitotoxicity. The hysteresis and bistability observed experimentally in current/voltage and frequency/current relationships result from the L-type Ca2+ channels' distal location and intrinsic warm-up. Accordingly, our results indicate that punctate expression of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels is a potent mechanism for regulating excitability, which would provide a strong neuroprotective effect. Our results could provide broader insights into the functional significance of warm-up and punctate expression of ion channels to regulation of cell excitability.","output":"Dendritic distributions of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels in spinal motoneurons: A simulation study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Age and severity are significant predictors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes in the immature brain. TBI studies have segregated TBI injury into three severity groups: mild, moderate, and severe. While mild TBI is most frequent form in children and adults, there is debate over the indicators used to denote mild injury. Clinically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are used to diagnose the TBI severity when medically warranted. Herein, we induced mild, moderate, and severe TBI in juvenile rats (jTBI) using the controlled cortical impact model. We characterized the temporal and spatial injury after graded jTBI in vivo using high-field MRI at 0.25 (6 hr), 1 and 3 days post-injury (dpi) with comparative histology. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for blood and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) for edema were quantified over the 0.25-3 dpi. Edema volumes increased linearly with severity at 0.25 dpi that slowly continued to decrease over the 3 dpi. In contrast, blood volumes did not decrease over time. Mild TBI had the least amount of blood visible on SWI. Fluoro-jade B (FJB) staining for cell death confirmed increased cellular death with increasing severity and increased FJB + cells in the corpus callosum (CC). Interestingly, the strongest correlation was observed for cell death and the presence of extravascular blood. A clear understanding of acute brain injury (jTBI) and how blood/edema contribute to mild, moderate, and severe jTBI is needed prior to embarking on therapeutic interventions. Noninvasive imaging should be used in mild jTBI to verify lack of overt injury.","output":"Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging stratifies injury severity in a rodent model of male juvenile traumatic brain injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) were victims of workplace violence (WPV). There are no reliable statistics on the occurrence and consequences of WPV against HCWs in Turkey throughout the pandemic period. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the rates of WPV against HCWs in Turkey in the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, variables associated with WPV, and the relationship between these variables and job satisfaction and burnout. METHODS: A structured online questionnaire was disseminated through social media channels to HCWs in various healthcare settings. All the respondents also completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Job Satisfaction Scale. Based on the data obtained, we determined the frequency, causes, and consequences of WPV against HCWs before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 701 completed questionnaires. 68.2% of participants were female, and 65.6% of them were doctors. The rate of WPV was 54.1% and 24.3% before and during the pandemic, respectively. Verbal abuse was the most common kind of WPV. Female HCWs were more likely to be physically assaulted than their male counterparts, especially those working in COVID-19 units. The majority of HCWs who were exposed to the violence at least once did not report WPV. HCWs exposed to WPV during the pandemic reported more emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and a lower perceived level of personal achievement. CONCLUSION: HCWs were exposed to significant levels of violence both before and during the pandemic. Preventing WPV against HCWs and removing barriers to reporting abuse is crucial.","output":"The occurrence and consequences of violence against healthcare workers in Turkey: before and during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A mathematical model to estimate transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is developed A real data of confirmed cases for Ethiopia is used for parameter estimation via model fitting Results showed that, the diseases free and endemic equilibrium points are found to be locally and globally asymptotically stable for Ro1 respectively The basic reproduction number is Ro=1 5085 Optimal control analysis also showed that, combination of optimal preventive strategies such as public health education, personal protective measures and treatment of hospitalized cases are effective to significantly decrease the number of COVID-19 cases in different compartments of the model","output":"Modeling and Optimal Control Analysis of Transmission Dynamics of COVID-19: The Case of Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is often difficult to insert a long intestinal tube (LT) in patients with small bowel obstruction (SBO).

Objective: To identify excess risk and risk factors associated with hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study included 88a?747 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between Feburary 28 and May 14, 2020, and followed up through June 22, 2020, in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national health care system, including 10a?131 patients (11.4%) who tested positive. Exposures: Sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, symptoms, and laboratory test results. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death were estimated in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The 10a?131 veterans with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly male (9221 [91.0%]), with diverse race/ethnicity (5022 [49.6%] White, 4215 [41.6%] Black, and 944 [9.3%] Hispanic) and a mean (SD) age of 63.6 (16.2) years. Compared with patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, those who tested positive had higher rates of 30-day hospitalization (30.4% vs 29.3%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.13), mechanical ventilation (6.7% vs 1.7%; aHR, 4.15; 95% CI, 3.74-4.61), and death (10.8% vs 2.4%; aHR, 4.44; 95% CI, 4.07-4.83). Among patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, characteristics significantly associated with mortality included older age (eg, &#8805;80 years vs <50 years: aHR, 60.80; 95% CI, 29.67-124.61), high regional COVID-19 disease burden (eg, &#8805;700 vs <130 deaths per 1 million residents: aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.45), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (eg, &#8805;5 vs 0: aHR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.54-2.42), fever (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.32-1.72), dyspnea (aHR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.53-2.07), and abnormalities in the certain blood tests, which exhibited dose-response associations with mortality, including aspartate aminotransferase (>89 U/L vs &#8804;25 U/L: aHR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.35-2.57), creatinine (>3.80 mg/dL vs 0.98 mg/dL: aHR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.62-5.48), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (>12.70 vs &#8804;2.71: aHR, 2.88; 95% CI, 2.12-3.91). With the exception of geographic region, the same covariates were independently associated with mechanical ventilation along with Black race (aHR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25-1.85), male sex (aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.30-3.32), diabetes (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.67), and hypertension (aHR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.64). Notable characteristics that were not significantly associated with mortality in adjusted analyses included obesity (body mass index &#8805;35 vs 18.5-24.9: aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.21), Black race (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.88-1.21), Hispanic ethnicity (aHR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79-1.35), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88-1.19), hypertension (aHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.12), and smoking (eg, current vs never: aHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.67-1.13). Most deaths in this cohort occurred in patients with age of 50 years or older (63.4%), male sex (12.3%), and Charlson Comorbidity Index score of at least 1 (11.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this national cohort of VA patients, most SARS-CoV-2 deaths were associated with older age, male sex, and comorbidity burden. Many factors previously reported to be associated with mortality in smaller studies were not confirmed, such as obesity, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and smoking.","output":"Risk Factors for Hospitalization, Mechanical Ventilation, or Death Among 10a?131 US Veterans With SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rhinoviral infections belong to the most frequent human infections characterized by common cold, chronic bronchitis, exacerbations of asthma, otitis media and sinusitis. Here, we define molecular mechanisms that mediate infections of human epithelial cells with human rhinovirus strain 14 (RV14). We demonstrate that RV14 activates p38-MAPKinase (p38-K) in a biphasic time course. Early stimulation of p38-K by RV14 was observed a few minutes after initiation of the infection, while the late increase of p38-K activity occurred 7-12 hrs upon infection. The stimulation of p38-K was mediated by the small G-protein RhoA,which was activated by RV14. Transfection of a genetic construct preventing RhoA activation blocked RV14-induced p38-K activation. Further, integrity of cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched membrane domains was required for RV14-mediated p38-K activation, which was inhibited by destruction of membrane rafts. The data indicate that RV employs a signaling cascade from membrane rafts via the small G-protein RhoA to p38-K to infect human cells.","output":"Rhinoviral infections activate p38MAP-kinases via membrane rafts and RhoA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emotional costs of the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns among clinicians and scholars.

Moreover, the contribution of neuroticism and conscientiousness was assessed over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions, and the unique contribution of personal belief in a just world was evaluated beyond all the other study variables. Samples were collected in three different countries-Israel (N = 917), Germany (N = 213), and India (N = 160). Online self-report questionnaires were utilized to measure age, gender, COVID-19 perceptions (probability, severity, and self-efficacy), neuroticism, conscientiousness, personal belief in a just world, and depression. The findings indicated that, across the three countries, neuroticism was positively associated with depression (correlations ranging from .24 to .44), and conscientiousness and personal belief in a just world were negatively associated with depression (correlations ranging from - .31 to - .21, and from - .35 to - .23, respectively). Moreover, neuroticism and conscientiousness explained unique variance over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions (except conscientiousness in India), and the effect of personal belief in a just world on depression was significant beyond the effects of all other study variables.

However, progress into the clinic has been hampered by the relatively low magnitude of the immune response typically induced following administration in large target species, which is likely due to low transfection efficiency as well as insufficient recruitment of antigen-presenting cells to the injection site. Electroporation addresses both of these limitations by inducing transiently enhanced cell membrane permeability, thus facilitating uptake of the DNA into the host cell and creating a low level of inflammation conducive to enhanced influx of antigen-presenting cells to the injection site. Consequently, electroporation-mediated delivery of DNA vaccines results in very significant improvements in the transfection efficiency and immune responses in comparison to conventional injection. Importantly, electroporation is effective in virtually every animal model tested to date and has a favorable safety profile, which is promising for clinical application. In support of the potential for electroporation in human disease situations, early clinical results suggest that the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines is greatly improved when delivered with electroporation.","output":"Electroporation for DNA immunization: clinical application."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CAR-T cell therapy represents a therapeutic revolution in the prognosis and treatment of patients with certain types of hematological cancer.

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence advancing capacity to identify patterns and make predictions using large datasets. ML approaches have the potential to improve clinical decision-making and policy design, but there has been no systematic assembly of current evidence. Methods: We conducted a rapid review, searching systematically seven databases from inception to December 31st, 2018: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, WOS, SCOPUS and ECONLIT. We included peer-reviewed studies that used ML approaches on routine data to improve palliative and EOL care for adults. Our specified outcomes were survival, quality of life (QoL), place of death, costs, and receipt of high-intensity treatment near end of life. We did not search grey literature and excluded material that was not a peer-reviewed article. Results: The database search identified 426 citations. We discarded 162 duplicates and screened 264 unique title/abstracts, of which 22 were forwarded for full text review.

Models using only routine administrative data had limited benefit from ML methods.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 13 population-based national surveys in nine countries (n=8361). We used k-means to develop a clustering model; predictors were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and T2DM family history. The training data set included all surveys, and the clusters were then predicted in each country-year data set. We used Euclidean distance, elbow and silhouette plots to select the optimal number of clusters and described each cluster according to the underlying predictors (mean and proportions). RESULTS: The optimal number of clusters was 4. Cluster 0 grouped more men and those with the highest mean SBP/DBP. Cluster 1 had the highest mean BMI and WC, as well as the largest proportion of T2DM family history. We observed the smallest values of all predictors in cluster 2. Cluster 3 had the highest mean age. When we reflected the four clusters in each country-year data set, a different distribution was observed. For example, cluster 3 was the most frequent in the training data set, and so it was in 7 out of 13 other country-year data sets.

This educational gap is prominent in many medical schools as most radiology curricula are a part of other specialty trainings, usually provided by non-radiologists. After COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increased trend in online education. However, questions have been raised about the efficacy and acceptance of online education. We developed a course on the principles of radiology and medical imaging basics to target Egyptian medical students. We then assessed the impact of these educational videos through several online surveys. Our \\"The Principles of Radiology Online Course\\" was delivered to students at various Egyptian medical schools; it was a prerecorded series composed of nine sessions, and each session followed the sequence of a pre-test, video, and post-test. There was a final survey to assess the overall feedback. Finally, we analyzed the results to give insight onto how teaching radiology through online lectures can help build better physicians.

Ninety-eight percent of the students agreed that this program increased their understanding of radiology. Eighty-four percent of the students found the platform friendly and easy to use. Seventy-nine percent found these webinars were more convenient compared to in-person education. Statistical significance (p-value < 0.05) was achieved in all sessions after comparing students pre and post-test scores, and in students confidence and knowledge level before and after the course. CONCLUSIONS: Radiology is an underrepresented subject for a lot of medical students. Online radiology webinars have proven to be a promising method of teaching medical students key medical imaging concepts. An online course of radiology basics and principles can help improve a medical students knowledge and enhance overall future patient care.","output":"Effectiveness of virtual teaching of diagnostic and interventional imaging fundamentals to Egyptian medical students: an analytical cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After recognition of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by mid- to late February 2020, indicators of influenza activity began to decline in the Northern Hemisphere. These changes were attributed to both artifactual changes related to declines in routine health seeking for respiratory illness as well as real changes in influenza virus circulation because of widespread implementation of measures to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data from clinical laboratories in the United States indicated a 61% decrease in the number of specimens submitted (from a median of 49,696 per week during September 29, 2019-February 29, 2020, to 19,537 during March 1-May 16, 2020) and a 98% decrease in influenza activity as measured by percentage of submitted specimens testing positive (from a median of 19.34% to 0.33%). Interseasonal (i.e., summer) circulation of influenza in the United States (May 17-August 8, 2020) is currently at historical lows (median = 0.20% tests positive in 2020 versus 2.35% in 2019, 1.04% in 2018, and 2.36% in 2017). Influenza data reported to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) FluNet platform from three Southern Hemisphere countries that serve as robust sentinel sites for influenza from Oceania (Australia), South America (Chile), and Southern Africa (South Africa) showed very low influenza activity during June-August 2020, the months that constitute the typical Southern Hemisphere influenza season. In countries or jurisdictions where extensive community mitigation measures are maintained (e.g., face masks, social distancing, school closures, and teleworking), those locations might have little influenza circulation during the upcoming 2020-21 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The use of community mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, plus influenza vaccination, are likely to be effective in reducing the incidence and impact of influenza, and some of these mitigation measures could have a role in preventing influenza in future seasons. However, given the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of continued community mitigation measures, it is important to plan for seasonal influenza circulation in the United States this fall and winter. Influenza vaccination of all persons aged 6 months remains the best method for influenza prevention and is especially important this season when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus might cocirculate (1).","output":"Decreased Influenza Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic  United States, Australia, Chile, and South Africa, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The population health approach is increasingly recognized for its role in health system reform; however, its broad scope and definition have been criticized for being a barrier to clear communication.

However, there have been few epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions. The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype. METHODS: We present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions. We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions. RESULTS: All three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic. Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years. Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21). CONCLUSION: The large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities. Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.","output":"A comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS in Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules play an important role in the immune response of vertebrates. In this paper, full-length MHC IIA cDNA was isolated from swamp eel (Monopterus albus) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR.

The full-length cDNA (GenBank accession No.: KC616308) is 1,509 bp in length including an 83 bp-long 5 untranslated region (UTR) and a 709 bp-long 3 UTR, which encoded a 238 amino acids protein. In the 2,339 bp-long MHC IIA genomic DNA, four exons and three introns were identified. Sequence comparison exhibited that the deduced amino acid sequence shared 27.1C66.3% identity with those of other species. Seven alleles were identified from five healthy individuals. Number of alleles per individual diversified from two to five. Five different 5 UTR sequences and two different 3 UTR sequences from one individual may infer the existence of five loci at least.

Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a health care professional, such as saliva collection, would be more preferable. We compared saliva specimens and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs with respect to sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2. We obtained a nasopharyngeal and two saliva specimens (collected by spitting or oral swabbing) from >2500 individuals. All samples were tested by RT-qPCR, detecting RNA of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the test sensitivity on the two saliva collections with the nasopharyngeal specimen for all subjects and stratified by symptom status and viral load. Of the 2850 patients for whom all three samples were available, 105 were positive on NP swab, whereas 32 and 23 were also positive on saliva spitting and saliva swabbing samples, respectively. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 among NP-positive patients was 30.5% (95% CI, 1.9%-40.2%) for saliva spitting and 21.9% (95% CI, 14.4%-31.0%) for saliva swabbing. However, when focusing on subjects with medium to high viral load, sensitivity on saliva increased substantially: 93.9% (95% CI, 79.8%-99.3%) and 76.9% (95% CI, 56.4%-91.0%) for spitting and swabbing, respectively, regardless of symptomatic status.

In this study, we examined suicide rates among welfare support workers and compared them to other occupations in Australia. METHODS We used data from the National Coroners Information System to obtain suicide deaths between the years 2001 and 2016. Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for age and year of death, both males (rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.78) and female welfare support workers (rate ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86) have higher suicide rate ratios compared with the reference group (excluding occupations from the comparison groups). CONCLUSION The age-standardised suicide rates of male welfare support workers are comparable to occupations which have been identified as high-risk occupations for suicide. Both female and male welfare support workers are at elevated risk of suicide compared with other occupations.

This method involved using unmanned aerial vehicles with mounted cameras to generate photogrammetric models of dumps. Twenty-eight dump profiles were created from twenty-three drone flights. Their characteristics were presented and summarized. Four types of dump profiles were observed to exist. Factors that influence the determination of these profiles include the location of the truck relative to the dump crest, the movement of the underlying dump material during the dumping process and the differences in the dump profile prior to dumping.

Cases of secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have been described. METHODS Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 between 03/2020 and 07/2021 were included. Patients were stratified as having (i) no chronic liver disease (CLD), (ii) non-advanced (non-ACLD), or (iii) advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD). CLD patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were matched to CLD patients with COVID-19 as a control cohort. Liver chemistries before (Pre), at first, second and third blood withdrawal after SARS-CoV-2 infection (T1-T3) and at last available time point (last) were recorded. RESULTS 496 patients were included. 13.1% (n=65) had CLD (non-ACLD: 70.8%; ACLD: 29.2%); the predominant etiology was non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH; 60.0%). COVID-19-related liver injury was more common among CLD patients (24.6% vs. 10.6%; p=0.001). After SARS-CoV-2 infection, CLD patients exhibited progressive cholestasis with persistently increasing levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Pre: 91.0 vs. T1: 121.0 vs. last: 175.0U/L; p<0.001) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT; Pre: 95.0 vs. T1: 135.0 vs. last: 202.0U/L; p=0.001). 23.1% of CLD patients (n=15/65) developed cholestatic liver failure (cholestasis plus bilirubin 6mg/dL) during COVID-19 and 15.4% of patients (n=10/65) developed SSC. SSC was significantly more frequent among CLD patients with COVID-19 than in CLD patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia (p=0.040). COVID-19-associated SSC occurred predominantly in NAFLD/NASH patients with metabolic risk factors. 26.3% (n=5/19) of ACLD patients experienced hepatic decompensation after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TSWs often experience violence from clients, police, and others, but it is estimated that 50% of these acts of violence are at the hands of their intimate partners. The marginalization of TSWs is fueled by abuse through isolation and shaming which prevents them from seeking help through formal channels like police or counselling services. There is limited research on intimate partner violence (IPV) involving transgender sex workers (biologically male at birth who transition to women) and their partners who are typically heterosexual/bisexual men. In China, stigmatization, homophobia, heterosexism, and transphobia structurally disadvantage TSWs and this power structure tacitly supports violence and abuse against them. To survive, TSWs rely on informal networks with their 'sisters' for advice and emotional support which is more effective at combatting IPV than criminal justice or social policy efforts. Ethnographic data from in-depth interviews with 25 TSWs provide insight about IPV and how informal social support is a protective factor that helps them cope with routine acts of violence.

Evidence on effectiveness over time for the CoronaVac vaccine is lacking despite its widespread use globally. In Malaysia, a diverse set-up of COVID-19 vaccines was rolled out nationwide, and the waning of vaccine protection is a concern. We aimed to investigate and compare waning vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 related ICU admission and COVID-19 related deaths for BNT162b2 and CoronaVac vaccines. In this observational study, we consolidated nationally representative data on COVID-19 vaccination and patients' outcomes. Data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases from 1 to 30 September 2021 were used to compare vaccine effectiveness between the 'early' group (fully vaccinated in April to June 2021) and the 'late' group (fully vaccinated in Jul to Aug 2021). We used a negative binomial regression model to estimate vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infections for both 'early' and 'late' groups, by comparing the rates of infection for individuals vaccinated in the two different periods relative to the unvaccinated. Among confirmed COVID-19 cases, we used logistic regression to estimate and compare vaccine effectiveness against ICU admission and deaths between the two different periods. For BNT162b2, vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infections declined from 90.8% (95% CI 89.4, 92.0) in the late group to 79.1% (95% CI 75.8, 81.9) in the late group. Vaccine effectiveness for BNT162b2 against ICU admission and deaths were comparable between the two different periods. For CoronaVac, vaccine effectiveness waned against COVID-19 infections from 74.4% in the late group (95% CI 209 70.4, 77.8) to 30.0% (95% CI 18.4, 39.9) in the early group. It also declined significantly against ICU admission, dropping from 56.1% (95% CI 51.4, 60.2) to 29.9% (95% CI 13.9, 43.0). For deaths, however, CoronaVac's effectiveness did not wane after three to five months of full vaccination. Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 infections waned after three to five months of full vaccination for both BNT162b2 and CoronaVac in Malaysia.

This permitted the introduction of a fully telemedical model of abortion care with consultations taking place via phone or video call and medications delivered to women's homes. The approvals in England and Wales will expire at the end of March 2022, while that in Scotland remains under consultation. Methods: We interviewed 30 women who had undergone an abortion in England, Scotland or Wales between August and December 2021. We explored their views on the changes in abortion service configuration during the pandemic and whether abortion via telemedicine and use of abortion medications at home should continue. Results: Support for continuation of the permission to use mifepristone and misoprostol at home was overwhelmingly positive. Reasons cited included convenience, comfort, reduced stigma, privacy, and respect for autonomy. A telemedical model was also highly regarded for similar reasons but for some its necessity was linked to safety measures during the pandemic and an option to have an in-person interaction with a health professional at some point in the care pathway was endorsed.

By enabling definition of lineages it facilitates tracking of the global spread of the virus. The evolution of new variants can be monitored and knowledge of specific mutations provides insights into the mechanisms through which the virus increases transmissibility or evades immunity. To date almost 1 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced by members of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium. To achieve similar feats in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner in future, improved high throughput virus sequencing protocols are required. We have therefore developed a miniaturized library preparation protocol with drastically reduced consumable use and costs. RESULTS: We present the Mini-XT miniaturized tagmentation-based library preparation protocol available on protocols.io (10.17504/protocols.io.bvntn5en). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was amplified using the ARTIC nCov-2019 multiplex RT-PCR protocol and purified using a conventional liquid handling system. Acoustic liquid transfer (Echo 525) was employed to reduce reaction volumes and the number of tips required for a Nextera XT library preparation. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq. The final version of Mini-XT has been used to sequence 4384 SARS-CoV-2 samples from N. Ireland with a COG-UK QC pass rate of 97.4%. Sequencing quality was comparable and lineage calling consistent for replicate samples processed with full volume Nextera DNA Flex (333 samples) or using nanopore technology (20 samples). SNP calling between Mini-XT and these technologies was consistent and sequences from replicate samples paired together in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-XT protocol maintains sequence quality while reducing library preparation reagent volumes eightfold and halving overall tip usage from sample to sequence to provide concomitant cost savings relative to standard protocols. This will enable more efficient high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates and future pathogen WGS.

Besides, on December 2019, a new virus known as coronavirus appeared, that its rapid prevalence caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider it a pandemic. As a potential drug for controlling or treating these two undesired diseases at the cellular level, chloroquine and its derivatives are being investigated, although they possess side effects, which must be reduced for effective and safe treatments. With respect to the importance of this medicine, the current research aimed to calculate the solubility of chloroquine in supercritical carbon dioxide, and evaluated effect of pressure and temperature on the solubility. The pressure varied between 120 and 400a?bar, and temperatures between 308 and 338a?K were set for the measurements. The experimental results revealed that the solubility of chloroquine lies between 1.64a?a?10-5 to 8.92a?a?10-4 (mole fraction) with different functionality to temperature and pressure. Although the solubility was indicated to be strong function of pressure and temperature, the effect of temperature was more profound and complicated. A crossover pressure point was found in the solubility measurements, which indicated similar behaviour to an inflection point. For the pressures higher than the crossover point, the temperature indicated direct effect on the solubility of chloroquine. On the other hand, for pressures less than the crossover point, temperature enhancement led to a reduction in the solubility of chloroquine.

Meanwhile, the disruption in sleep bioparameters is experienced more in people with a history of sleep disorders. The behavioral sleep disorders in the current situations are prevalent given the today's amount of anxiety everyone is feeling about COVID-19. On the other hand, evidences indicated that the cross-link between impaired sleep efficiency and disrupted innate immunity makes people susceptible to viral infections. The present brief review highlights the links between psychosocial stress, sleep insufficiency, and susceptibility to viral infections in relevance to COVID-19 situation. The stress management measures, including addressing sleep-related disorders and sleep hygiene, will have a notable impact by harnessing immune response and thus reducing the susceptibility to viral infections.","output":"A New Hypothesis on Anxiety, Sleep Insufficiency, and Viral Infections; Reciprocal Links to Consider in Today's \\"World vs. COVID-19\\" Endeavors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an international outbreak of respiratory illness described as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Small studies suggest that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may upregulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, affecting susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. This may be of great importance considering the large number of patients worldwide who are treated with RAS blockers, and the well-proven clinical benefit of these treatments in several cardiovascular conditions. In contrast, RAS blockers have also been associated with better outcomes in pneumonia models, and may be beneficial in COVID-19. This review sought to analyse the evidence regarding RAS blockers in the context of COVID-19 and to perform a pooled analysis of the published observational studies to guide clinical decision making. A total of 21 studies were included, comprising 11,539 patients, of whom 3417 (29.6%) were treated with RAS blockers. All-cause mortality occurred in 587/3417 (17.1%) patients with RAS blocker treatment and in 982/8122 (12.1%) patients without RAS blocker treatment (odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69-1.45; P=0.49; I2=84%). As several hypotheses can be drawn from experimental analysis, we also present the ongoing randomized studies assessing the efficacy and safety of RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, according to the current data and the results of the pooled analysis, there is no evidence supporting any harmful effect of RAS blockers on the course of patients with COVID-19, and it seems reasonable to recommend their continuation.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and renin-angiotensin system blockers: A review and pooled analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Qingfei Paidu Decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine compound recommended by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for clinical therapies of coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19).

However, the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma has been questioned by some people, because of one ancient proverb. To explore the rationality of the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, this study systematically examined the ancient and modern physicians' understanding of the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma, and collated the application and dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient prescriptions and modern clinics based on literature analysis. As a result, we found that ancient and modern physicians have different understanding on the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma and that the theory about the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma is flawed. We also found that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient and modern clinical applications was not constrained by ancient experience. Physicians usually increase the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in clinical therapy according to the actual conditions, and there were no adverse reactions. Additionally, according to laws and regulations concerning medical affairs, physician could increase or decrease the dosage of the drug under special circumstances.

Internationally, recommendations to guide the management of COVID-19 have been created and updated continuously by the WHO and CDC, which have been locally adapted by different countries. Similarly, Pakistan's National Command Operation Center (NCOC), in its national COVID-19 management strategy, generated guidelines for national implementation. Keeping the guidelines updated has proved challenging globally and locally. Here, we present a summary of the process to assess the evidence, including a time-restricted systematic review based on NCOC Clinical Management Guidelines for COVID-19 Infections v4 published on 11(th) December 2020 version, correlating it with current recommendations and with input one of the guidelines authors, particularly noting the methodological challenges. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review synthesizing global research on treatment options for COVID-19 hospitalized patients, limiting it to pharmacological interventions for hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in Pakistan's NCOC's national guidelines v4 published on 11(th) December 2020. Each treatment recommendation's strength and quality of evidence was assessed based on the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) methodology. These were then compared to the most current living WHO COVID-19 pharmacological treatment guidelines v7.1. One of the authors of the NCOC guidelines reviewed and commented on the findings as well. RESULTS: We note that the data from our systematic review strongly supports corticosteroids use in treating severe and critically ill COVID-19 hospitalized patients correlating with WHO v7.1 guidelines 24 September 2021. However, evidence from our review and WHO v7.1 for the use of tocilizumab had some conflicting evidence, with data from our review until December 2020 supporting only a weak recommendation for its use, compared to the strong recommendation by the WHO for the use of tocilizumab in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 infection. Regarding the use of antibiotics and ivermectin use in treating COVID-19 hospitalized patients, data from our review and WHO v 7.1 recommend against their use. CONCLUSION: Research data about the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are rapidly evolving, and based on it, the evidence for or against recommendations changes accordingly. Our study illustrates the challenges of keeping up with the evidence; the recommendations were based on studies up till December 2021, and we have compared our recommendations with the WHO v7.1, which showed some significant changes in the use of pharmacological treatment options.","output":"Development of Evidence-Based COVID-19 Management Guidelines for Local Context: The Methodological Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To identify incidence of abdominal findings in COVID-19 patients with and without abdominal symptoms on various imaging modalities including chest-only CT scans and to correlate them with clinical, laboratory and chest CT findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we searched our clinical database between March 1st, 2020 and May 22nd, 2020 to identify patients who had positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat swabs for COVID-19, had availability of clinical, laboratory information and had availability of CT scan of chest or abdominal radiograph, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan within 2 weeks of the diagnosis. Abdominal imaging findings on all imaging modalities were documented. Chest CT severity score (CT-SS) was assessed in all patients. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded from the electronic medical record. Statistical analysis was performed to determine correlation of abdominal findings with CT-SS, clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Out of 264 patients with positive RT-PCR, 73 patients (38 males and 35 females; 35 African American) with mean age of 62.2 (range 21C94) years were included. The median CTSS was 13.5 (IQR 75C25 18C8). Most common finding in the abdomen on CT scans (n = 72) were in the gastrointestinal system in 13/72 patients (18.1%) with fluid-filled colon without wall thickening or pericolonic stranding (n = 12) being the most common finding. Chest-only CT (n = 49) found bowel findings in 3 patients. CTSS did not differ in terms of age, sex, race or number of comorbidities but was associated with longer duration of hospitalization (p = 0.0.0256), longer intensive care unit stay (p = 0.0263), more frequent serum lactate dehydrogenase elevation (p = 0.0120) and serum C-reactive protein elevation (p = 0.0402). No statistically significant correlation of occurrence of bowel abnormalities with CTSS, clinical or laboratory features. Deep venous thrombosis was seen in 7/72 patients (9.8%) with three patients developing pulmonary embolism CONCLUSION: Abnormal bowel is the most common finding in the abdomen in patients with COVID-19 infection, is often without abdominal symptoms and occurs independent of severity of pulmonary involvement, other clinical and laboratory features.","output":"Are asymptomatic gastrointestinal findings on imaging more common in COVID-19 infection?

However, as biometrics is deployed, it is common to replace damaged or obsolete hardware, or to exchange information between heterogeneous applications. Variations in spectral bands can also occur. For example, surveillance face images (typically acquired in the visible spectrum, VIS) may need to be compared against a legacy iris database (typically acquired in near-infrared, NIR). Here, we propose a multialgorithmic approach to cope with periocular images from different sensors. With face masks in the front line against COVID-19, periocular recognition is regaining popularity since it is the only face region that remains visible. We integrate different comparators with a fusion scheme based on linear logistic regression, in which scores are represented by log-likelihood ratios. This allows easy interpretation of scores and the use of Bayes thresholds for optimal decision-making since scores from different comparators are in the same probabilistic range. We evaluate our approach in the context of the Cross-Eyed Competition, whose aim was to compare recognition approaches when NIR and VIS periocular images are matched. Our approach achieves EER=0.2% and FRR of just 0.47% at FAR=0.01%, representing the best overall approach of the competition. Experiments are also reported with a database of VIS images from different smartphones. We also discuss the impact of template size and computation times, with the most computationally heavy comparator playing an important role in the results. Lastly, the proposed method is shown to outperform other popular fusion approaches, such as the average of scores, SVMs or Random Forest.","output":"Cross-Sensor Periocular Biometrics in a Global Pandemic: Comparative Benchmark and Novel Multialgorithmic Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 virus and other pathogenic microbes are transmitted to the environment through contacting surfaces, which need to be sterilized for the prevention of COVID-19 and related diseases. In this study, a prototype of a cost-effective sterilization box is developed to disinfect small items. The box utilizes ultra violet (UV) radiation with heat. For performance assessment, two studies were performed. First, IgG (glycoprotein, a model protein similar to that of spike glycoprotein of SARS-COV-2) was incubated under UV and heat sterilization. An incubation with UV at 70 C for 15 min was found to be effective in unfolding and aggregation of the protein. At optimized condition, the hydrodynamic size of the protein increased to ~171 nm from ~5 nm of the native protein. Similarly, the OD280 values also increased from 0.17 to 0.78 indicating the exposure of more aromatic moieties and unfolding of the protein. The unfolding and aggregation of the protein were further confirmed by the intrinsic fluorescence measurement and FTIR studies, showing a 70% increase in the ?-sheets and a 22% decrease in the &#945;-helixes of the protein. The designed box was effective in damaging the protein's native structure indicating the effective inactivation of the SARS-COV-2. Furthermore, the incubation at 70 C for 15 min inside the chamber resulted in 100% antibacterial efficacy for the clinically relevant E.coli bacteria as well as for bacteria collected from daily use items.

Traditionally, epidemic management (EM) has been guided by experts and policymakers, and is executed most attentively. It can however still be controversial in the public sphere. The question arises if public engagement (PE) could be a means to improve the quality and effectiveness of EM, as it has proven to be for other domains of healthcare policy. METHODS: From June to October 2020, seven Deliberative Discussion Focus Groups were executed with 35 Dutch citizens between 19 and 84 years old, to discuss their views on PE in COVID-19 management. Timeline Interviews were conducted to elucidate meaningful experiences during the epidemic. Next, benefits, barriers, timing and possible forms of PE in EM were discussed. RESULTS: Almost all participants supported PE in EM, as the integration of experiences and ideas of the public would benefit the quality of EM, and PE would increase awareness and acceptance of measures. Also, participants emphasized the importance of receiving information on the process of EM, to overcome the perceived lack of transparency herein. Consultation was seen as a fitting form for PE since the public could share ideas and feedback on EM, particularly on communication campaigns and control measures, however final authority stayed with experts. PE could be executed after the first acute phase of the epidemic, but also during evaluations. Moreover, barriers for PE were identified such as time constraints and the lack of knowledge of the public. CONCLUSIONS: A foundation of values and conditions for PE in EM from the perspective of the public was laid. Support for PE was identified and considered valuable for quality and effectiveness of EM. Next, the results should be confirmed within a broader audience and the views of experts and policymakers on PE in EM should be elucidated. KEY MESSAGES: According to participants, public engagement can increase quality and effectiveness of outbreak management, by sharing knowledge, experiences and ideas between the public, experts and policymakers.

The existing gene sequence representation methods extract features from high dimension gene sequence mostly through manual process, which usually are computationally expensive. What's more, the precision of prediction heavily relies on how to utilize the biology background knowledge. In this work, we construct a gene sequence representation method based on graph context information in virus transmission network. After coding the target node's virus sequence, we use attention mechanism to aggregate the neighbor nodes' gene sequence information, and thus we can achieve a new representation of the target node's gene sequence. The gene sequence representation model is optimized based on the fact that the similarity of gene sequence of neighbor nodes is higher than that of non-neighbor nodes. The new representation after being well trained not only extracts the feature of sequence exactly, but also reduces the dimension of gene sequence greatly and improve the computation efficiency. We first train the gene sequence representation model respectively on a simulation transmission network, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV transmission network, and then predict the un-sampled infections in each transmission network. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our model, and its performance is better than other models. What's more, its success on effectively predicting the un-sampled infections in virus transmission network has a certain practical significance in the epidemiological investigation area. ? 2021, Science Press.

SETTING: Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, a tertiary hospital in Argentina. PARTICIPANTS: Non-Hospitalized Adults vaccinated with the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. EXPOSURE: Vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines available during the study period: Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca/Oxford or Covishield), BBIBP-CorV (Beijing Institute of Biological Products) (Sinopharm). Active comparator group exposure was Influenza vaccine. MAIN OUTCOME: Primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of any symptomatic thrombotic event at 30 days, defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following: symptomatic acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT); symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE); acute ischemic stroke (AIS); acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or arterial thrombosis. RESULTS: From a total of 29,985 adult patients who received at least a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine during study period and 24,777 who received Influenza vaccine in 2019, we excluded those who were vaccinated during hospitalization. We finally included 29,918 and 24,753 patients respectively. Median age was 73 years old (IQR 75C81) and 67% were females in both groups. Thirty six subjects in the Covid-19 vaccination group (36/29,918) and 15 patients in the Influenza vaccination group (15/24,753) presented at least one thrombotic event.

In the United States, strict social distancing during the first wave of virus spread has resulted in different types of infection dynamics. In some states, such as New York, extensive infection spread was followed by a pronounced decline of infection levels. In other states, such as California, less infection spread occurred before strict social distancing, and a different pattern was observed. Instead of a pronounced infection decline, a long-lasting plateau is evident, characterized by similar daily new infection levels. Here we show that network models, in which individuals and their social contacts are explicitly tracked, can reproduce the plateau if network connections are cut due to social distancing measures. The reason is that in networks characterized by a 2D spatial structure, infection tends to spread quadratically with time, but as edges are randomly removed, the infection spreads along nearly one-dimensional infection \\"corridors\\", resulting in plateau dynamics. Further, we show that plateau dynamics are observed only if interventions start sufficiently early; late intervention leads to a \\"peak and decay\\" pattern.

As the country that currently implements one of the tightest technology-based COVID prevention policy, China has protected its citizen with a prolonged peaceful time of zero case as well as a fast reaction to potential upsurging of the disease. However, such mobile-based technology does come with sacrifices, especially for senior citizens who find themselves difficult to adapt to modern technologies. In this study, we demonstrated the fact that most senior citizens find it difficult to use the health code apps called ''JKM'', to which they responded by cutting down on travel and reducing local commuting to locations where the verification of JKM is needed. Such compromise has physical and mental consequences and leads to inequalities in infrastructure, social isolation and self-sufficiency. As we illustrated in the paper, such decrease in life quality of senior citizens can be greatly reduced if improvements on the user interactions of the JKM can be implemented. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first systemic study of digital inequality due to mobile-based COVID prevention technologies for senior citizens in China.

They are also found in mammalian milk as part of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), making milk an important dietary component for the rapidly growing infant. This study reports the development of a robust analytical method for the identification and characterization of 44 Crb and 23 LacCer molecular species in milk, using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in data-dependent acquisition mode. For the first time, it also compares the distributions of these species in human and bovine milks, a commercial MFGM-enriched dairy ingredient (MFGM Lipid 100) and commercial standards purified from bovine milk. A method for quantifying Crb and LacCer in milk using mass spectrometry in neutral loss scan mode was developed and validated for human milk, bovine milk and MFGM Lipid 100. Human milk was found to contain approximately 9.9-17.4 g Crb/mL and 1.3-3.0 g LacCer/mL, whereas bovine milk (pooled milk from a Friesian herd) contained 9.8-12.0 and 14.3-16.2 g/mL of these lipids, respectively. The process used to produce MFGM Lipid 100 was shown to have enriched these components to 448 and 1036 g/g, respectively.

Historically, HBx has defied biochemical and structural characterization, deterring efforts to understand its molecular mechanisms. Here we show that soluble HBx fused to solubility tags copurifies with either a [2Fe-2S] or a [4Fe-4S] cluster, a feature that is shared among five HBV genotypes. We show that the O(2)-stable [2Fe-2S] cluster form converts to an O(2)-sensitive [4Fe-4S] state when reacted with chemical reductants, a transformation that is best described by a reductive coupling mechanism reminiscent of Fe-S cluster scaffold proteins. In addition, the Fe-S cluster conversions are partially reversible in successive reductionCoxidation cycles, with cluster loss mainly occurring during (re)oxidation. The considerably negative reduction potential of the [4Fe-4S](2+/1+) couple (?520 mV) suggests that electron transfer may not be likely in the cell. Collectively, our findings identify HBx as an Fe-S protein with striking similarities to Fe-S scaffold proteins both in cluster type and reductive transformation. An Fe-S cluster in HBx offers new insights into its previously unknown molecular properties and sets the stage for deciphering the roles of HBx-associated iron (mis)regulation and reactive oxygen species in the context of liver tumorigenesis.","output":"The HBx protein from hepatitis B virus coordinates a redox-active Fe-S cluster"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists are among the nation's most accessible and underused health professionals. Within their scope of practice, pharmacists can prescribe and administer vaccines, conduct point-of-care testing, and address drug shortages through therapeutic substitutions. OBJECTIVES: To better use pharmacists as first responders to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we conducted a needs and capacity assessment to (1) determine individual commitment to provide COVID-19 testing and management services, (2) identify resources required to provide these services, and (3) help prioritize unmet community needs that could be addressed by pharmacists. METHODS: In March 2020, pharmacists and student pharmacists within the Alaska Pharmacist Association worked to tailor, administer, and evaluate results from a 10-question survey, including demographics (respondent name, ZIP Code, cell phone, and alternate e-mail). The survey was developed on the basis of published COVID-19 guidelines, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 screening and management guidelines, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidance, and joint policy recommendation from pharmacy organizations. RESULTS: Pharmacies are located in the areas of greatest COVID-19 need in Alaska. Pharmacists are willing and interested in providing support. Approximately 63% of the pharmacists who completed the survey indicated that they were interested in providing COVID-19 nasal testing, 60% were interested in conducting COVID-19 antibody testing, and 93% were interested in prescribing and administering immunizations for COVID-19, as available. When asked about resources needed to enable pharmacists to prescribe antiviral therapy, 37% of the pharmacists indicated they needed additional education or training, and 39% required access to technology to bill and document provided services. CONCLUSION: The primary barrier to pharmacists augmenting the current COVID-19 response is an inability to cover the costs of providing these health services. Pharmacists in Alaska are ready to meet COVID-19-related clinical needs if public and private insurers and legislators can help address the barriers to service sustainability.","output":"Alaska pharmacists: First responders to the pandemic in the last frontier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P14ARF (ARF; Alternative Reading Frame) is an extensively characterized tumor suppressor which, in response to oncogenic stimuli, mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via p53-dependent and independent routes. ARF has been shown to be frequently lost through CpG island promoter methylation in a wide spectrum of human malignancies, such as colorectal, prostate, breast, and gastric cancers, while point mutations and deletions in the p14ARF locus have been linked with various forms of melanomas and glioblastomas. Although ARF has been mostly studied in the context of tumorigenesis, it has been also implicated in purely developmental processes, such as spermatogenesis, and mammary gland and ocular development, while it has been additionally involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Moreover, ARF has been found to hold important roles in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. As is often the case with tumor suppressors, ARF functions as a pleiotropic protein regulating a number of different mechanisms at the crossroad of development and tumorigenesis.

While intense occupational exposure associated with aerosol-generating procedures underlines the necessity of using personal protective equipment (PPE) by HCWs, high-transmission efficiency of the causative agent [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] could also lead to infections beyond such settings. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a repurposed antimalarial drug, was empirically recommended as prophylaxis by the National COVID-19 Task Force in India to cover such added risk. Against this background, the current investigation was carried out to identify the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs in the country. METHODS: A case-control design was adopted and participants were randomly drawn from the countrywide COVID-19 testing data portal maintained by the ICMR. The test results and contact details of HCWs, diagnosed as positive (cases) or negative (controls) for SARS-CoV-2 using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), were available from this database. A 20-item brief-questionnaire elicited information on place of work, procedures conducted and use of PPE. RESULTS: Compared to controls, cases were slightly older (34.7 vs. 33.5 yr) and had more males (58 vs. 50%). In multivariate analyses, HCWs performing endotracheal intubation had higher odds of being SARS-CoV-2 infected [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-16.07]. Consumption of four or more maintenance doses of HCQ was associated with a significant decline in the odds of getting infected (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22-0.88); a dose-response relationship existed between frequency of exposure to HCQ and such reductions ((2) for trend=48.88; P<0.001). In addition, the use of PPE was independently associated with the reduction in odds of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATIONS & CONCLUSIONS: Until results of clinical trials for HCQ prophylaxis become available, this study provides actionable information for policymakers to protect HCWs at the forefront of COVID-19 response. The public health message of sustained intake of HCQ prophylaxis as well as appropriate PPE use need to be considered in conjunction with risk homoeostasis operating at individual levels.","output":"Healthcare workers & SARS-CoV-2 infection in India: A case-control investigation in the time of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study/paper To focus on finding COVID-19 with the help of DarkCovidNet architecture on patient images.

They do not spread to other areas of the body, and they usually do not pose a serious health risk. In fact, in most cases, benign liver tumors are not diagnosed because patients are asymptomatic. When they are detected, its usually because the person has had medical imaging tests, such as an ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), for another condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search of the literature was made using cancer literature and the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WOS) database for the following keywords: hepatic benign tumors, hepatic cystic tumors, polycystic liver disease, liver macroregenerative nodules, hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma, hepatic angiomyolipoma, biliary cystadenoma, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in some areas of the world; there is an increasing incidence worldwide. Approximately 750,000 new cases are reported per year. More than 75 % of cases occur in the Asia-Pacific region, largely in association with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The incidence of HCC is increasing in the USA and Europe because of the increased incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unlike the liver HCC, benign tumors are less frequent. However, they represent a chapter always more interesting of liver disease. In fact, a careful differential diagnosis with the forms of malignant tumor is often required in such a way so as to direct the patient to the correct therapy. In conclusion, many of these tumors present with typical features in various imaging studies. On occasions, biopsies are required, and/or surgical removal is needed. In the majority of cases of benign hepatic tumors, no treatment is indicated. The main indication for treatment is the presence of significant clinical symptoms or suspicion of malignancy or fear of malignant transformation.","output":"Rare Benign Tumors of the Liver: Still Rare?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) emerged shortly after introduction of rifamycins in the 1960s; isoniazid resistance had already emerged by the mid-1950s. Without these two drugs, tuberculosis is very difficult and costly to treat, with unacceptably high rates of treatment failure, death, loss to follow-up, and no known preventive treatment. Global attention first focused on MDR TB in the early 1990s when nosocomial outbreaks with high case fatality rates were reported in many countries. Prevalence data for MDR TB on a global scale first became available in 1997. In 2016, about 4.1% of estimated ~10.4 million new TB patients plus 19% of ~1 million previously treated patients, that is ~600,000 people develop MDR TB or rifampicin resistant TB; 250,000 die annually. Ten years ago, <5% of them were diagnosed and enrolled on treatment, increasing to about 21.6% in 2016, leaving much room for improvement. Over that same period of time, momentum has been building to combat MDR TB, including advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and care; decentralizing patient-centered care coupled with social support; growing improvements in prevention of transmission; increasing use of highly effective antiretroviral treatment; communications, advocacy, and social mobilization; leadership and updated policy guidance. Taking into account long-term epidemiological trends, all of these factors coupled with funding from the Global Fund and other major donors, suggest we may be on the verge of accelerating declines in MDR TB morbidity and mortality. Extreme poverty, which allows tuberculosis to flourish, has actually decreased by about one billion people over the past 25 years. What is needed now is political will on the part of national governments to apply these advances diligently and further reductions in poverty, pushing epidemiological trends past the inflection point to the downward slope.

Apoptin is highly studied for its ability to selectively induce apoptosis in human tumor cells and, thus, is a protein of interest in anti-tumor therapy. CAV apoptin is known to localize to different subcellular compartments in transformed and non-transformed cells, depending on the DNA damage response, and the phosphorylation of several identified threonine residues. In addition, apoptin interacts with molecular machinery such as the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to inhibit the cell cycle and induce arrest in G2/M phase. While these functions of apoptin contribute to the tumor-selective effect of the protein, they also provide an important fundamental framework to apoptins role in viral infection, pathogenesis, and propagation. Here, we reviewed how the regulation, localization, and functions of apoptin contribute to the viral life cycle and postulated its importance in efficient replication of CAV.

Patients with a compromised immune system are expected to be more susceptible to a severe disease course. In this report we suggest that patients with systemic lupus erythematous might be especially prone to severe COVID-19 independent of their immunosuppressed state from lupus treatment. Specially, we provide evidence in lupus to suggest hypomethylation and overexpression of ACE2, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Oxidative stress induced by viral infections exacerbates the DNA methylation defect in lupus, possibly resulting in further ACE2 hypomethylation and enhanced viremia. In addition, demethylation of interferon-regulated genes, NF{kappa}B, and key cytokine genes in lupus patients might exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the likelihood of cytokine storm. These arguments suggest that inherent epigenetic dysregulation in lupus might facilitate viral entry, viremia, and an excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Further, maintaining disease remission in lupus patients is critical to prevent a vicious cycle of demethylation and increased oxidative stress, which will exacerbate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the current pandemic.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 in these patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SciELO, and other databases to identify all relevant studies published up to 10 January, 2020. The proportion and mortality in the patients were assessed by odd ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). RESULTS: A total of ten case-series including 11,755 cases with SARS-COV-2 infection and 942 deaths were selected. Among them, there were total of 791 DM patients with 186 deaths, 225 CKD patients with 45 deaths, 790 hypertension cases with 86 deaths, and 471 CVDs cases with 60 deaths. Pooled data revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the patients with hypertension, DM, CVDs and CKD were 21.1 %, 16.3 %, 14.0 % and 5.0 %, respectively. Moreover, the SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of mortality in DM (OR = 0.549, CI 95 % 0.448C0.671, p  0.001) and CKD (OR = 0.552, 95 % CI 0.367C0.829, p = 0.004) patients, but not hypertension and CVDs.

This was contrasted to a control group of influenza-positive patients admitted during the 2019-2020 flu season. Patient demographics, microbiology and clinical outcomes were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 836 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included; 27 (3.2%) of 836 had early confirmed bacterial isolates identified (0-5 days after admission), rising to 51 (6.1%) of 836 throughout admission.

A positive blood culture was identified in 60 patients (7.1%), of which 39 were classified as contaminants. Bacteraemia resulting from respiratory infection was confirmed in two cases (one each community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae and ventilator-associated Enterobacter cloacae). Line-related bacteraemia was identified in six patients (three Candida, two Enterococcus spp. and one Pseudomonas aeruginosa). All other community-acquired bacteraemias (n = 16) were attributed to nonrespiratory infection. Zero concomitant pneumococcal, Legionella or influenza infection was detected. A low yield of positive respiratory cultures was identified; Staphylococcus aureus was the most common respiratory pathogen isolated in community-acquired coinfection (4/24; 16.7%), with pseudomonas and yeast identified in late-onset infection.

The aggregate size cannot be maintained when the temperature is lowered below the LCST, unless the system exhibits hysteresis and forms irreversible aggregates. This study shows that conjugation of ELP with PEI preserves the aggregation behavior that occurs above the LCST and achieves precise aggregate radii when the solution conditions of pH (3, 7, 10), polymer concentration (0.1, 0.15, 0.3 mg/mL), and salt concentration (none, 0.2, 1 M) are carefully controlled. K-means cluster analyses showed that salt concentration was the most critical factor controlling the hydrodynamic radius and LCST. Conjugating ELP to PEI allowed crosslinking the aggregates and achieved stable particles that maintained their size below LCST, even after removal of the harsh (high salt or pH) conditions used to create them. Taken together, the ability to control aggregate sizes and use of crosslinking to maintain stability holds excellent potential for use in biological delivery systems.","output":"Machine learning to determine optimal conditions for controlling the size of elastin-based particles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a health emergency such as the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, immediate access to validated information is of utmost importance.

These helplines received more than 6.4 million calls over a period of 6 months. The volume of calls mirrored key announcements and events taking place in India as a response to the pandemic, such as the nation-wide lockdown, extension of lockdown, and so on. Nearly three quarters of the callers belonged to the economically productive age group of 20 to 59 years. The majority of the callers were males across all 8 states.

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15C49 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (40 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83C4.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

To overcome these issues, we performed a global scale study considering 134,871 virologic-climatic-demographic data (209 countries, first 16 weeks of the pandemic). To analyze the relation among COVID-19, population density, and climate, a theoretical path diagram was hypothesized and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), a powerful statistical technique for the evaluation of causal assumptions. The results of the analysis showed that both climate and population density significantly influence the spread of COVID-19 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Overall, climate outweighs population density (path coefficients: climate vs. incidence = 0.18, climate vs. prevalence = 0.11, population density vs. incidence = 0.04, population density vs. prevalence = 0.05). Among the climatic factors, irradiation plays the most relevant role, with a factor-loading of ? 0.77, followed by temperature (? 0.56), humidity (0.52), precipitation (0.44), and pressure (0.073); for all p < 0.001. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that climatic factors significantly influence the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

We hypothesized that a nocturnal decrease of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) causes a temporary rise of [Epo] not detected by morning measurements. SaO2 (continuous, finger oximeter) and [Epo] (ELISA, every 4 h) were determined in young highlanders (altitude 2600 m) during 24 h of usual daily activity. In Series I (six male, nine female students), SaO2 fell during the night with the nadir occurring between 01:00 and 03:00; daily means (range 92.4-95.2%) were higher in females (+1.7%, P < 0.01).

In Series II (seven females), only SaO2 was measured. During follicular and luteal phases, SaO2 variation was similar to Series I, but the rhythm was disturbed during menstruation. While daily [Epo] variations at sea level are not homogeneous, there is a diurnal variation at altitude following changes in SaO2 Larger hypoventilation-dependent decreases of alveolar PO2 decreases during the night probably cause a stronger reduction of SaO2 in highlanders compared to lowlanders. This variation might be enlarged by a diurnal fluctuation of Hb concentration.

A vast majority of these tests detect only SARS-CoV-2 which causes symptoms similar to those caused by other respiratory pathogens. Hence, other etiologies or co-infections requiring a different therapy may be missed. The prototype BioFire? Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) continues the syndromic approach of the FDA-cleared BioFire? Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2), to provide the ability to simultaneously detect 22 common respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. The goal of this study was to rapidly develop a RP2.1 prototype that contains high-performing SARS-CoV-2 assays and maintains the performance of assays retained from RP2. METHODS: Twelve assays designed for four SARS-CoV-2 genes were tested for compatibility with the RP2 assays and conditions. All retained RP2 assays were evaluated to verify established RP2 performance. The sensitivity of novel SARS-CoV-2 assays was estimated with nucleic acids at BioFire and contrived live virus NPS samples at MRIGlobal. Primer homology of SARS-CoV-2 assays to > 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from accessible databases was assessed for in silico inclusivity RESULTS: A prototype multiplexed PCR panel containing assays for 22 pathogens was developed in a 5-week period. Of the 12 SARS-CoV-2 assays, 7 were compatible with the RP2 conditions; 2 were selected for the prototype. No false positive results due to cross-reactivity with unintended analytes or non-specific amplification in negative samples were observed for any assays. All retained RP2 assays were detected at or near their established LoD. The SARS-CoV-2 LoD was estimated at 10(3) -10(2) genomes/mL with both nucleic acid and live virus spiked into NPS. Together, the assays are 100% inclusive for all 15,370 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes assessed in silico for reactivity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate a strong potential for RP2.1 to serve as a sensitive comprehensive syndromic option to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as respiratory syndromes caused by other pathogens, including co-infections.

Here we use movement data of mobile phone users to show that mobility in Germany has not only been reduced considerably: Lockdown measures caused substantial and long-lasting structural changes in the mobility network.

In addition, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo, Japan were selected for comparison by assessing four destination attributes including culture, transportation, architecture, and food. In this study, we used a sample of 400 Chinese tourists who have traveled to Bangkok. The main research issue is to reveal the first- and second-order potential factors generating significant influences on Chinese tourists' choice of Bangkok as their destination. The aim of this study is to explore the structural relationships among the mentioned first-order and second-order latent variables, and their impact on the choice of tourist destinations in China. Due to the competitive nature of Chinese tourist destinations, we believe that there might be some potential factors that significantly affected their choice decision, therefore we applied the second-order Structural Equation Models (SEM) to capture these potentially unobservable factors. The result showed that our proposed model appeared to fit well: the RMSEA was 0.03 (<0.06) and values of GFI, AGFI, NFI, TLI, and CFI were greater than 0.9 (most of them were even larger than 0.95). More importantly, Food (F), Emotional Factor (EF) representing food and cultural indulgence, and Physical Factor (PF) representing Architecture and Transportation facility of the destination showed significant impacts on tourist destination choice as their p-values were less than 0.05.

Here, we report, for the first time in Korea, two cases of CPV-2c infection in two dogs with severe diarrhoea. The complete open reading frame (4,269nt) of CPV-2, encoding both non-structural (NS) and structural (VP) proteins, was sequenced. Based on the amino acid Gln present at residue 426 of the VP2 gene, these strains were typed as CPV-2c, and were named Korea CPV-2c_1 and Korea CPV-2c_2. These strains shared 99.48% reciprocal nucleotide sequence identity and had the highest nucleotide identity (99.77%-99.34%) with Asian CPV strains isolated in China, Italy (found in a dog imported from Thailand), and Vietnam from 2013 to 2017. Phylogenetic analysis based on the non-structural (NS1) and capsid (VP2) genes revealed that Korean CPV-2c strains clustered closely to Asian CPV strains, and separately from strains isolated in Europe, South America and North America.

This virus primarily spreads through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This virus was named after its shape, which takes the form of a crown with protrusions around it. The World Health Organization has recommended personal protective equipments (PPE) to doctors and health care workers attending COVID-19 patients. PPE generally includes masks, goggles, respirators, gloves, face shields, and isolation gowns. The principle aim of this study is to create awareness among dental students about the preventive measures taken by health care professionals while attending patients affected with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: A questionnaire comprising 15 questions was created using an online Google forms website and was circulated among 100 dental students. The survey was conducted within a week in the months of April to May 2020. The results and observations were recorded in the form of pie charts. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants have stated that health care professionals must clean their hands often, cover their nose and mouth, and maintain safe distance from everyone in order to prevent the virus from affecting them. Sixty-three percent of the participants are familiar with the term PPE. Majority assume that health care professionals are given enough safety precautions while treating a patient with coronavirus.

Compared to the alone condition, the presence condition was associated with an enhanced N400 component and a more centro-posterior LAN component (interpreted as an N400). The results seem to imply a boosting of heuristic language processing strategies, proper of lexico-semantic operations, which actually entails a shift in the strategy to process morphosyntactic violations, typically based on algorithmic or rule-based strategies. The effects cannot be related to increased arousal levels. The apparent enhancement of the activity in the precuneus while in presence of another person suggests that the effects conceivably relate to social cognitive and attentional factors. The present results suggest that understanding language comprehension would not be complete without considering the impact of social presence effects, inherent to the most natural and fundamental communicative scenarios.","output":"Language comprehension in the social brain: Electrophysiological brain signals of social presence effects during syntactic and semantic sentence processing."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic started in December 2019 and still is a major global health challenge.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the use of AI in the healthcare sector has been largely evident. This chapter provides a detailed analysis regarding the use of AI technology in the healthcare sector and identifies its contributions in the fighting against the deadly pandemic, i.e. COVID-19. Discussion regarding the challenges in the AI technology is further provided. Following the analysis, it has been revealed that AI is effective and contributes under six areas; including the production of early warnings and alerts, tracking and prediction, data bash boards, diagnosis and prognosis, information related to treatment and cures resulting in controlling the widespread of the disease. In broader terms, AI is effective and can be used to identify and analyze patterns in complex and large data sets in a more precise time and high speed which was never done before. It is further useful in providing a thorough search related to the literary studies conducted previously regarding the development of different drugs. Furthermore, manufacturing of drugs is held through robots designed by the infusion of the AI technology for fast and quick delivery of services. Contributions of AI when used in the healthcare industry is further important to search out patients that are suitable for the clinical studies. AI due to its fast-tracking systems is further effective in reducing the workload of radiologists, since it is capable of reading the radiological reports through deep learning and machine learning systems. These scans can be stored for some time and are available when required in order to train the AI systems. AI through its fast-tracking quality, allows cost and time effective functions by quickly analyzing a number of scans resulting in providing better treatment to patients. In the healthcare sector, AI has shown promising results by detecting conditions such as; pneumonia, skin cancer, eye diseases etc. Also, most hospitals used AI technologies to analyze echocardiography scans, ultra sound system, neurological conditions, speech patterns or to predict the psychotic episodes. Many surgical robotics are being designed to assist clinical experts in surgical processes. In the prevailing diseases like pandemic, AI technology-based robots are used by various countries for medication and routine checkup purposes in order to reduce the chances of doctors being affected by the disease contact. However, in the existing crisis the role of AI has been limited since only limited countries were able to install the AI technology which has limited its impact in controlling the virus. Besides, the lack of data in providing the accurate predictions regarding the spread of disease was another major gap in reducing the overall impact of the disease. Overcoming these barriers and limitations are effective in developing the right balance between public health and data privacy leading towards the development of human based AI interactions. These gaps will likely to address the issues faced in the time of the present pandemic situation, as by gathering extensive data related to the infected population countries will be able to save thousands of lives, through prior preparations.","output":"Artificial Intelligence and Coronavirus COVID-19: Applications, Impact and Future Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess poor treatment outcomes and their predictors among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients treated in Ethiopia.

RESULTS The aims of our infection control measures are to 1) minimize cross-infection within the hospital; 2) protect and support hospital staff; 3) ensure environmental control. To minimize the risk of cross-infection, outpatient attendance and elective surgery have been reduced by 40%, and general anesthesia procedures were reduced by 90%. Patients entering the hospital are screened for fever, travel history, contact and cluster history, and COVID-19 related symptoms. To protect and support hospital staff, we ensure provision of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and provide clear guidelines on the level of PPE needed, depending on the clinical situation. Other protective measures include provision of work uniforms, easy access to alcohol-based hand rub, opening new lunch areas, implementation of self-monitoring and self-reporting systems, and communication via online education and updates. Finally, environmental control is achieved by ensuring regular disinfection of the hospital premise, enhancing ventilation, and usage of disposable ophthalmic instruments.

BVD viruses are genetically highly variable. They are classified into two genetic species (BVDV-1 and -2) that are further divided into numerous subgroups, particularly for BVDV-1. The complexity of these viruses is also reflected in their interaction with the host animals. Infections are either transient or persistent and can cause a wide spectrum of clinical signs, from no or very mild disease to severe forms, reminiscent of viral haemorrhagic fevers. In this work, we have analysed the clinical signs and the pathology of BVD viral infections in a cattle population where different subgroups of BVDV-1 genotype viruses are endemic. In addition, we have examined potential virulence properties of BVDV-1 subgroups during persistent infection by comparing the viral subgroups present in clinical cases with those detected in persistently infected (PI) animals sampled for epidemiological criteria, irrespective of their health condition. Furthermore, the clinical and postmortem findings were compared with respect to genetic characteristics of the viruses isolated from these animals. Our results indicate that the BVDV positive animals fall roughly into two categories, depending on the primary organ affected and the age, with lung-centred pathology occurring mainly in young animals and mucosal pathology predominantly in older animals. Furthermore, we found a markedly higher proportion of representatives of the BVDV-1e subgroup in stillborn calves and aborted foetuses originating from epidemically unrelated cattle herds, suggesting that BVDV-1e may play a special role in prenatal and perinatal losses.","output":"Clinical appearance and pathology of cattle persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus of different genetic subgroups"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Significance: The primary method of COVID-19 detection is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.

To understand the molecular pathogenesis of these infections, we searched for cellular targets of the virulence protein C of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3-C). We found that hPIV3-C interacts directly through its C-terminal domain with STAT1 and GRB2, whereas C proteins from measles or Nipah viruses failed to do so. Binding to STAT1 explains the previously reported capacity of hPIV3-C to block type I interferon signaling, but the interaction with GRB2 was unexpected. This adaptor protein bridges Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor to MAPK/ERK pathway, a signaling cascade recently found to be involved in airway inflammatory response. We report that either hPIV3 infection or transient expression of hPIV3-C both increase cellular response to EGF, as assessed by Elk1 transactivation and phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 and translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 prevented viral protein expression in infected cells.

Independent predictors of MERS\\\\CoV infection were identified, including chest pain (OR = 24.194; P = 0.011), leukopenia (OR = 6.080; P = 0.049), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR = 11.179; P = 0.013). The adequacy of this prediction model was good (P = 0.728), with a high predictive utility (area under curve [AUC] = 76.99%; 95% CI: 67.05% to 86.38%). The prediction of the model had optimism\\\\corrected bootstrap resampling AUC of 71.79%. The Youden index yielded a value of 0.439 or greater as the best cut\\\\off for high risk of MERS infection. Discussion This risk\\\\prediction model in dialysis patients appears to depend markedly on chest pain, leukopenia, and elevated AST. The model accurately predicts the high risk of MERS\\\\CoV infection in dialysis patients. This could be clinically useful in applying timely intervention and control measures to prevent clusters of infections in dialysis facilities or other health care settings. The predictive utility of the model warrants further validation in external samples and prospective studies.","output":"Development of a risk\\\\prediction model for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in dialysis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main aim of this study was to investigate the various factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and actual intake among older Germans aged over 75 years old (N = 1037).

Strikingly, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and found to be the causative agent of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), shows 88% of sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, 79% with SARS-CoV and 50% with MERS-CoV, respectively. Despite key amino acid residual variability, there is an incredible structural similarity between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. During infection, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV displays 10-20 times greater affinity for its cognate host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading proteolytic cleavage of S protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following cellular entry, the ORF-1a and ORF-1ab, located downstream to 5' end of + ssRNA genome, undergo translation, thereby forming two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. These polyproteins, following protease-induced cleavage and molecular assembly, form functional viral RNA polymerase, also referred to as replicase. Thereafter, uninterrupted orchestrated replication-transcription molecular events lead to the synthesis of multiple nested sets of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs), which are finally translated to several structural and accessory proteins participating in structure formation and various molecular functions of virus, respectively. These multiple structural proteins assemble and encapsulate genomic RNA (gRNA), resulting in numerous viral progenies, which eventually exit the host cell, and spread infection to rest of the body. In this review, we primarily focus on genomic organization, structural and non-structural protein components, and potential prospective molecular targets for development of therapeutic drugs, convalescent plasm therapy, and a myriad of potential vaccines to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Role of Structural and Non-Structural Proteins and Therapeutic Targets of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Cardiothoracic surgical outcomes are poorer in people with diabetes compared with those without diabetes.

We previously demonstrated the feasibility of delivering the Optimising Cardiac Surgery ouTcOmes in People with diabeteS (OCTOPuS) intervention, an outpatient intervention delivered by diabetes healthcare professionals for people with suboptimally managed diabetes over 8C12 weeks before elective cardiac surgery. The present study will assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the intervention in cardiothoracic centres across the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel group, single-blinded 1:1 individually randomised trial comparing time from surgery until clinically fit for discharge in adults with suboptimally managed type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes undergoing elective surgery between the OCTOPuS intervention and usual care (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints will include actual time from surgery to discharge from hospital; days alive and either out of hospital or judged as clinically fit for discharge; mortality; time on intensive therapy unit (ITU)/ventilator; infections; acute myocardial infarction; change in weight; effect on postoperative renal function and incidence of acute kidney injury; change in HbA(1c); frequency and severity of self-reported hypoglycaemia; operations permanently cancelled for suboptimal glycaemic levels; cost-effectiveness; psychosocial questionnaires.

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/L, respectively, were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1. Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages. Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than 800/L may still require urgent intervention, even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","output":"Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All companies, regardless of size, all over the world to cope with COVID-19 pandemia must innovate to overcome the difficult economic situation.

Results: Our work revealed several clinical parameters measurable in blood samples, which discriminated between healthy people and COVID-19 positive patients and showed predictive value for later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We thus developed a number of analytic methods that showed accuracy and precision for disease severity and mortality outcome predictions that were above 90%. Conclusions: In sum, we developed methodologies to analyse patient routine clinical data which enables more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. This type of approaches could, by employing standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood, be utilised to identify, COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality and so enable their treatment to be optimised.","output":"Predicting Patient COVID-19 Disease Severity by means of Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis of Blood Cell Transcriptome Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of chloroquine derivatives in patients, based on unpublished and published reports available publicly on the internet as of 27 May 2020. The keywords hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, coronavirus, COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2 were used in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Google search engines without any restrictions as to date or language. Twenty studies were identified involving 105 040 patients (19 270 treated patients) from nine countries (Brazil, China, France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and the USA). Big data observational studies were associated with conflict of interest, lack of treatment dosage and duration, and absence of favourable outcome. Clinical studies were associated with favourable outcomes and details on therapy. Among clinical studies, three of four randomized controlled trials reported a significant favourable effect. Among clinical studies, a significant favourable summary effect was observed for duration of cough (OR 0.19, p 0.00003), duration of fever (OR 0.11, p 0.039), clinical cure (OR 0.21, p 0.0495), death (OR 0.32, p 4.1  10(?6)) and viral shedding (OR 0.43, p 0.031). A trend for a favourable effect was noted for the outcome death and/or intensive care unit transfer (OR 0.29, p 0.069) with a point estimate remarkably similar to that observed for death (0.3). In conclusion, a meta-analysis of publicly available clinical reports demonstrates that chloroquine derivatives are effective to improve clinical and virological outcomes, but, more importantly, they reduce mortality by a factor of 3 in patients with COVID-19.

It requires in-depth understanding of the effect of congenital shunt lesions on the uptake, delivery, and equilibration of anesthetic drugs. Intracardiac shunts can alter the induction time and if delivery of anesthetic agent is not carefully titrated, can lead to overdosing and undesirable myocardial depression. AIMS To study the effect of congenital shunt lesions on the speed of inhalational induction and also the impact of inhalational induction on hemodynamics in the presence of congenital shunt lesions. SETTING Tertiary care hospital. DESIGN A prospective, single-center clinical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ninety-three pediatric patients undergoing elective surgery were segregated into three equal groups, namely, Group 1: no CHD, Group 2: acyanotic CHD, and Group 3: cyanotic CHD. General anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 6 L/min air-oxygen. The time to induction was noted at loss of eyelash reflex and decrease in bispectral index (BIS) value below 60. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration, minimum alveolar concentration, and BIS were recorded at 15 s intervals for the 1 st min followed by 30 s interval for another 1 min during induction. Hemodynamic data were recorded before and after induction. RESULTS Patients in Group 3 had significantly prolonged induction time (99  12.3 s; P < 0.001), almost twice that of the patients in other two groups (51  11.3 s in Group 1 and 53  12.0 s in Group 2). Hypotension occurred after induction in Group 1. No other adverse hemodynamic perturbations were observed. CONCLUSION The time to inhalational induction of anesthesia is significantly prolonged in patients with right-to-left shunt, compared to patients without CHD or those with left-to-right shunt, in whom it is similar. Sevoflurane is safe and maintains stable hemodynamics in the presence of CHD.","output":"Comparison of speed of inhalational induction in children with and without congenital heart disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell surface receptor ACE2 is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection. By analyzing the spike-hACE2 interacting surface, we predicted many hot spot residues that make major contributions to the binding affinity. Mutations on most of these residues are likely to be deleterious, leading to less infectious virus strains that may suffer from negative selection. Meanwhile, several residues with mostly advantageous mutations have been predicted. It is more probable that mutations on these residues increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike-hACE2 interaction. So far, only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region. However, the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still serve as a tracking list for SARS-CoV-2 evolution studies. Coincidentally, one advantageous mutation, p.476G>S, started to surge in the last couple of weeks based on the data submitted to the public domain, indicating that virus strains with increased transmission ability may have already spread.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain is Subject to Negative Selection with Predicted Positive Selection Mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is important to understand the processes behind how and why individuals emerge as leaders, so that the best and most capable individuals may occupy leadership positions.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: Field area of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. PARTICIPANTS: More than 30 000 individuals irrespective of their age, sex, acute/past COVID-19 infection participated in the serosurvey which covered all the 75 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) across 48 wards and 7 zones of the city. Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation. RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%).

The aim of this study was to assess potential environmental and individual factors associated to COVID-19 mortality in children and adolescents in Mexico. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed the official data of 131,001 children under 10 years of age and adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age with COVID-19 disease, in Mexico. Participants were diagnosticated between March 2020 and June 13, 2021. The environmental variables such as malnutrition, vaccination coverage and social lag index were evaluated at the state level. Multilevel models were fitted to evaluate the association between environmental and individual factors and COVID-19 mortality. FINDINGS: A total of 773 (0.6%) children and adolescents died due to COVID-19. Younger age (OR = 0.878, 95%CI: 0.869-0.888), diabetes (OR = 3.898, 95%CI: 2.596-5.851), immunosuppression (OR = 5.410, 95%CI: 4.088-7.158), obesity (OR = 1.876, 95%CI: 1.397-2.521), hypertension (OR = 1.906, 95%CI: 1.239-2.932), cardiovascular disease (OR = 2.288, 95%CI: 1.482-3.531), and chronic kidney disease (OR = 13.250, 95%CI: 9.066-19.350) were associated with mortality. COVID-19 mortality was directly associated with social lag index and malnutrition (OR(very high) = 2.939, 95%CI: 1.111-7.775, and OR = 1.390, 95%CI: 1.073-1.802, respectively), and inversely associated with population density (OR = 0.374, 95%CI: 0.204-0.688). Finally, children and adolescents living in areas with a higher percentage of people with incomplete education (OR = 1.045, 95%CI: 1.011-1.081), of children of school age of 6C14 years who do not attend school (OR = 1.266, 95%CI: 1.032-1.554), and of illiterate population aged 15 and over (OR = 1.086, 95%CI: 0.999-1.179) were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.

Materials and methods: COVID-19 patients' records were retrospectively scanned from the hospital's automation system and recorded on patients' files. Results: Of 1452 COVID-19 patients, 17 (1.2%) were diagnosed with PE. Compared cases with PE with controls, it was seen that mean age was higher (p=0.036), male gender was prominent (p=0.016), patients presented with dyspnea symptoms further (p<0.001), while O2 saturation measured at room air on admission was lower (p=0.002). In PE patients, glucose (p=0.007), D-dimer (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (p<0.001) and ferritin levels (p=0.002) were higher than controls. In Receiver-Operator Characteristics analysis, the cut-off value of D-dimer in predicting PE was found to be 4211 ng/mL (p<0.001). COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with PE median five (min:max=0:36) days after hospitalization. Additionally, PE patients were found to have longer hospitalization time (p<0.001), the requirement for caring in the intensive care unit (p<0.001), and intubation (p=0.001), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) in more patients, compared to controls. Mortality rates were similar in both groups, with three and 106 deaths in PE and control groups, respectively. Lower-extremity Doppler ultrasonography was performed in 196 patients, and thrombi were detected in the femoral vein in four patients, also presenting with PE. Conclusions: Even if there is no embolism without any obvious clinic of PE in all cases with COVID-19, such cases should be screened for PE in the presence of significant D-dimer elevation. ? 2021 A.

In response to the epidemic, a new crisis management program was implemented and tested in Taipei. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Having noticed that transmission surged on weekends during the Keelung epidemic, Taipei City launched a multi-channel mass risk communications program that included short message service (SMS) messages sent directly to approximately 2.2 million Taipei residents on Friday, October 12th, 2007. The public was told to keep symptomatic students from schools and was provided guidelines for preventing the spread of the disease at home. Epidemiological characteristics of Taipei's outbreak were analyzed from 461 sampled AHC cases. Median time from exposure to onset of the disease was 1 day. This was significantly shorter for cases occurring in family clusters than in class clusters (meanSD: 2.63.2 vs. 4.394.82 days, p = 0.03), as well as for cases occurring in larger family clusters as opposed to smaller ones (1.21.7 days vs. 3.94.0 days, p<0.01). Taipei's program had a significant impact on patient compliance. Home confinement of symptomatic children increased from 10% to 60% (p<0.05) and helped curb the spread of AHC. Taipei experienced a rapid decrease in AHC cases between the Friday of the SMS announcement and the following Monday, October 15, (0.70% vs. 0.36%). By October 26, AHC cases reduced to 0.01%. The success of this risk communication program in Taipei (as compared to Keelung) is further reflected through rapid improvements in three epidemic indicators: (1) significantly lower crude attack rates (1.95% vs. 14.92%, p<0.001), (2) a short epidemic period of AHC (13 vs. 34 days), and (3) a quick drop in risk level (12 weeks) in Taipei districts that border Keelung (the original domestic epicenter). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The timely launch of this systematic, communication-based intervention proved effective at preventing a dangerous spike in AHC and was able to bring this high-risk disease under control. We recommend that public health officials incorporate similar methods into existing guidelines for preventing pandemic influenza and other emerging infectious diseases.","output":"Taipei's Use of a Multi-Channel Mass Risk Communication Program to Rapidly Reverse an Epidemic of Highly Communicable Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the mental health care.

Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out for articles published until until November 11, 2020, in the Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. We included studies on COVID-19 patients with signs and symptoms of GIB. Results: Our search yielded 49 studies, of which eight with a collective 127 patients (86 males and 41 females) met our inclusion criteria.

Early detection and smooth trajectories of diagnostics, rehabilitation and support affect the child's development and opportunities. A specialized multidisciplinary team must do a diagnostic evaluation. While accessibility to multidisciplinary diagnostics for all children in Flanders (Belgium) is problematic in regular times, the lockdown measures taken by the end of March 2020 in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic could amplify this problem. This article aims to explore the impact of lockdown policy measures on the accessibility of multidisciplinary diagnostics of developmental disorders. Methods: This rapid response study was commissioned by the Flemish authorities, as a follow up of a broader study on accessibility of multidisciplinary diagnostics. A questionnaire with open-ended questions was sent out to respondents of three key types of facilities: the Centers for Ambulatory Rehabilitation, Autism Reference Centers and Centers for Developmental Disorders. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed in an iterative process by researcher triangulation. Results: Measures taken in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic negatively impacted on waiting periods which lengthened with at least three months and even longer for certain target groups. Specific guidelines to minimize the risk of virus contamination, impact on planning, time management and the quality of the diagnostic assessments. Respondents reported them as being time consuming, uncomfortable, with an increasing workload and leading to a reduction in the number of daily diagnostic activities. Suggested catching-up strategies were increase of public funding, a less rigid application of regulations and a complete or partial assignment stop. Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic reinforced the existing problem of accessibility because of a general shortage of diagnostic capacity. On a shorter term accessibility problems can be tempered by providing  bridging care during waiting periods. On the longer term, strengthening regional interorganisational collaboration is required, to enhance more efficient and effective diagnostic trajectories in facilities providing adapted services to the needs of the children.","output":"The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the accessibility of multidisciplinary diagnostics of neurodevelopmental disorders in Flanders, Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus flared in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei Province, China.

However, sustainable implementation of eHealth technologies within this target group can be difficult. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to gain a thorough understanding of why it is often difficult to implement eHealth technologies in practice, even though numerous technologies are designed to support people with dementia and their informal caregivers at home. In particular, our study aimed to (1) provide an overview of technologies that have been used and studied in the context of informal dementia care and (2) explore factors influencing the implementation of these technologies. METHODS: Following an umbrella review design, five different databases were searched (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane) for (systematic) reviews. Among 2205 reviews retrieved, 21 were included in our analysis based on our screening and selection procedure. A combination of deductive and inductive thematic analyses was performed, using the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework for organizing the findings. RESULTS: We identified technologies designed to be used by informal caregivers, by people with dementia, and with people with dementia. Within those groups, most of the represented technologies included, respectively: (i) devices for in-home monitoring of lifestyle, health, and safety; (ii) technologies for supporting memory, orientation, and day structure; and (iii) technologies to facilitate communication between the informal caregiver and person with dementia. Most of the identified factors influencing implementation related to the condition of dementia, characteristics of the technology, expected/perceived value of users, and characteristics of the informal caregiver. Considerably less information has been reported on factors related to the implementing organization and technology supplier, wider institutional and sociocultural context of policy and regulations, and continued adaptation of technology over time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study offers a comprehensive overview of eHealth technologies in the context of informal dementia care and contributes to gaining a better understanding of a broad range of factors influencing their implementation. Our results uncovered a knowledge gap regarding success factors for implementation related to the organizational and broader context and continuous adaptation over the long term.

In the present study, we investigated the human protein-host protein interactions in the small intestine. Methods Public databases and published works were used to collect data related to small intestine tissue and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and showed interactions of host proteins in the small intestine. Associated modules, biological processes, functional pathways, regulatory transcription factors, disease ontology categories, and possible drug candidates for therapeutic targets were identified. Results Thirteen primary protein neighbors were found for the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. ACE2 and its four partners were observed in a highly clustered module; moreover, 8 host proteins belonged to this module. The protein digestion and absorption as a significant pathway was highlighted with enriched genes of ACE2, MEP1A, MEP1B, DPP4, and XPNPEP2.

A significant association with 12 diseases was deciphered and 116 drug-target interactions were identified. Conclusion The protein-host protein interactome revealed the important elements and interactions for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine, which can be useful in clarifying the mechanisms of gastrointestinal symptoms and inflammation. The results suggest that antiviral targeting of these interactions may improve the condition of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Investigating the human protein-host protein interactome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the small intestine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Within the literature, there is a variety of different measurement methods for orthorexic behaviours. The ORTO-15 is the one that attracted most research attention. Many scholars criticized the ORTO-15 for its unstable factor structure and over-estimation of the prevalence of orthorexia nervosa. For this purpose, Rogoza and Donini (Eat Weight Disord 26:887C895, 2020) re-assessed the original data and created a new tool, ORTO-R. The development of the ORTO-R theoretically solved many ambiguities associated with its parent measure. However, to date, no study, including the original one, tested the validity of the ORTO-R, leaving its utility somewhat speculative. METHODS: We gathered data from 363 Lebanese individuals, who answered the ORTO-R questions and a set of measures used to determine the validity of the scale (eating attitudes, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression). Within this study, we analysed the internal consistency of the scale and different aspects of its validity (factorial, convergent, and divergent). RESULTS: Results supported all expectations; we successfully confirmed a one-factor measurement model of the ORTO-R, which appeared to be internally consistent. The ORTO-R score correlated positively to other orthorexic behaviours as well as to disordered eating attitudes, perfectionism, anxiety, and depression. It was also negatively related to self-esteem, but was unrelated to body dissatisfaction. CONCLUSION: The ORTO-R may be deemed as a valid instrument for the assessment of orthorexic behaviours. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V: Opinions of authorities, based on descriptive studies, narrative reviews, clinical experience, or reports of expert committees.","output":"Validation of the Arabic version of the ORTO-R among a sample of Lebanese young adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The current study assessed the case fatality rate (CFR) across different income level countries of the world, and the virulence pattern of COVID-19, against the backdrop of panic and uncertainty faced by many governments, who are trying to impose draconian containment measures to control the outbreak. Subjects and Methods: Data on confirmed cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus infection were retrieved from the WHO as on 30 March 2020, and examined for the various income level countries, per the World Bank criteria. The CFR was calculated country-wise and estimated for the various groups such as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income, and the data was analyzed. Results: The overall CFR for the high income countries was 5.0%, compared with a CFR of 2.8% for low-income countries. The upper-middle-income countries showed a CFR of 4.3%, while the lower-middle-income countries stood at 3.7%. The results from our study predict that the maximum CFR in high-income countries will be contained at approximately 5% (95% CI). The CFR for the low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries will range between 2.8 and 4.3% (95% CI). Conclusion: COVID-19, irrespective of its transmissibility, produces a lower CFR compared with that of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, although COVID-19 has infected eight times more countries than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, and caused a higher number of deaths. The nation-wide lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus may be reconsidered, given the hardships for the population and their impact on the economic system.","output":"Case fatality rates of COVID-19 across the globe: are the current draconian measures justified?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Covid-19 remains a pandemic that most countries in the world are still dealing with. This is study aims to report the psychological impact of Covid-19 over time on the Spanish population. Methods: A longitudinal study (N = 1041) was carried out with two measurements: after 2 and 5 weeks starting from the declaration of the state of emergency in Spain. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disease (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, variables about Covid-19, loneliness, spiritual well-being, social support, discrimination, and a sense of belonging were collected. Results: The data showed how depressive symptomatology increased significantly over time, while anxiety and PTSD did not show statistically significant changes. Spiritual well-being and loneliness were the main predictors of psychological impact. A younger age was a significant predictor of depression and anxiety, while female gender was associated with anxiety and PTSD. Conclusions: The impact of the pandemic is sustained over time, even increasing in depression, and vulnerable groups that need greater psychological health support could be identified.","output":"Mental Health Consequences of the Coronavirus 2020 Pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain.
