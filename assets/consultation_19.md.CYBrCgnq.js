Blink detection is realized by computing the eye aspect ratio and the ratio of closed eye frames to the total frames per unit time to evaluate the degree of eye fatigue. Yawn detection is implemented by computing the aspect ratio of the mouth by using the feature points of the inner lip and combining it with the time of opening mouth to distinguish the mouth state. Head pose estimation is first implemented by calculating the head rotation matrix by matching the feature points of 2D face with the 3D face model and then calculating the Euler angle of the head according to the rotation matrix to evaluate the change of the head pose. Especially in yawn detection, we employ the feature points of inner lips in the calculation of the mouth aspect ratio to avoid the impact of lip thickness of various participants. Furthermore, the blink detection, yawn detection, and head pose estimation are first calculated based on the two-dimensional grayscale image of human face, which could reduce the computational complexity and improve the real-time performance of detection. Finally, combining the values of blinking, yawning, and head pose, multiple groups of experiments are carried out to assess the state of different online learners; then, the learning state is evaluated by analyzing the numerical changes of the three characteristics. Experimental results show that our approach could effectively evaluate the state of online learning and provide support for the development of online education.","output":"Learning State Assessment in Online Education Based on Multiple Facial Features Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The psychological consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic are just now starting to be understood; however, the behavioral consequences are less understood.

It can be assessed by self-rating screeners such as the Social Media Disorder Scale (SMDS). However, young age or symptom denial might reduce adolescent assessment accuracy. Therefore, the development and validation of a parental scale (SMDS-P) is desirable. Method: A representative sample of 961 parents and corresponding frequently SM-using children aged 10 to 17 years participated in an online study. Factorial analyses were performed to determine item structure. Adolescents SMDS self-reports, SM usage time, emotional dysregulation, and academic performance were used to assess validity. The SMDS-P cut-off value was calculated by ROC-analysis. Results: A one-factorial structure of the SMDS-P could be confirmed. The internal consistency was good (Cronbachs  = 0.85, McDonalds  = 0.88) and the accordance between parental and self-ratings moderate (kappa = 0.51). SMDS-P was positively associated with adolescents self-ratings (r = 0.68), SM usage time (r = 0.26) and frequency (? = 0.16) as well as with emotional dysregulation (r = 0.35) in a highly significant manner.

A manganese-based inorganic nanomaterial manganese phosphate (MnP) had become a new drug carrier in cancer therapy. However, the approach for manganese phosphate preparation and drug integration is still confined in complex methods. Inspired by mimetic mineralization, we proposed a \\"one-step\\" method for the preparation of manganese phosphate-doxorubicin (DOX) nanomedicines (MnP-DOX) by manganese ion and DOX complexation. The structural characterization results revealed that the prepared MnP-DOX nanocomplexes were homogeneous with controlled sizes and shapes. More importantly, the MnP-DOX nanocomposites could significantly induce cancer inhibition in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that the drug molecules were integrated into MnP nanocarriers by mimetic mineralization, which not only prevented the premature release of the drug but also reduced excessive modification. Moreover, the designed MnP-DOX complex showed high loading efficacy and pH-dependent degradation leading to drug release, achieving high efficiency for cancer chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo via a facile process.

In addition, MNs possess many outstanding properties, such as the ability for the painless traverse of the stratum corneum, minimal invasiveness, facile fabrication, excellent biocompatibility, convenient administration, and bypassing first-pass metabolism that allows direct translocation of therapeutics into the systematic circulation. These advantages make MNs excellent candidates for the delivery of immunological biomolecules to the dermal antigen-presenting cells in the skin with the aim of vaccinating or treating different diseases, such as cancer and autoimmune disorders, with minimal invasiveness and side effects.

Our categories of analysis were: information sources, news frames, predominant topics, resources used for dramatic effects, and breaches of journalism ethics in reporting news. In general, TVE1 did not engage in sensationalized or dramatized news coverage, but instead attempted to transmit a message that was educational and instructional. Its policy was to provide information on measures adopted by authorities to help prevent the spread of the pandemic. Nevertheless, TVE's benevolent attitude towards the government and its policies can be observed in its news reporting, revealing a lack of impartiality and editorial independence by this media. Despite the importance of specialized and expert information in times of a pandemic, eyewitness sources were those most used in reporting news, even in economic news framing.

This paper proposes a generalized Markov-Switching approach, the SUIHR model, designed to study border control policies and contact tracing against COVID-19 in a period where countries start to re-open. We offer the following contributions. First, the SUIHR model can include multiple entities, reflecting different government bodies with different containment measures. Second, constraints as, for example, new case targets and medical resource limits can be imposed in a linear programming framework. Third, in contrast to most SIR models, we focus on the spreading of infectious people without symptoms instead of the spreading of people who are already showing symptoms. We find that even if a country has closed its borders completely, domestic contact tracing is not enough to go back to normal life. Countries having successfully controlled the virus can keep it under check as long as imported risk is not growing, meaning they can lift travel restrictions with similar countries. However, opening borders towards countries with less controlled infection dynamics would require a mandatory quarantine or a strict test on arrival.","output":"Optimal Border Control during the Re-opening Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the pathological characteristics and outcomes of elderly patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) accompanied by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The diagnosis and treatment process of one elderly patient with CAP accompanied by COVID-19 who was admitted to COVID-19 Treatment Center of Liaoning Province on February 7, 2020 were reviewed. The experience of treatment by analyzing the characteristics of such type of patients during diagnosis and treatment were summarized. RESULTS A female patient, aged 79 years ald, was admitted to the Center with following features: fever, dry cough, fatigue with dyspnea, scattered moist rales in both lungs, oxygenation index (PaCO2/FiO2) of 95 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and diffuse interstitial pneumonia in both lungs indicated by chest CT, of which the majority were ground glass-like and fibrous lesions. It was confirmed to be consistent with the feature of severe COVID-19 cases. The patient was successfully cured one month later following anti-inflammatory, anti-viral and high-flow oxygen therapies, homeostasis maintenance of the body, psychological counseling, etc. Accordingly, the treatment experience in CAP combined with COVID-19 in the elderly patients was summarized as follows. In respiratory system, the timing of high-flow oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation should be seized. As for anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapy, attention should be paid to the treatment of CAP as well as antiviral therapy and symptomatic and supportive therapy. With the progression of the disease, the production of drug-resistant bacteria and the possibility of fungal infection should be paid attention to. For the circulatory system, we should pay attention to the stability of fluid volume and internal environment, and strengthen hemodynamic monitoring and bedside ultrasound to evaluate the cardiovascular capacity-load. In the aspect of the immune system, the selection of the application time of immune-enhancers and glucocorticoids should be paid attention to. In terms of enteral nutrition, early low-fat and high-protein diet is conducive to the recovery of intestinal function and the prevention of bacterial translocation. In addition to the protection of the function of important organs, therapies such as reasonable sedation and psychological intervention should also be used. CONCLUSIONS Elderly patients with CAP accompanied by COVID-19 have complicated conditions and high degree of difficulty in treatment.

Working on behalf of NHS England we therefore set out to deliver a secure and pseudonymised analytics platform inside the data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor establishing coverage across detailed primary care records for a substantial proportion of all patients in England. The following results are preliminary. Data sources Primary care electronic health records managed by the electronic health record vendor TPP, pseudonymously linked to patient-level data from the COVID-19 Patient Notification System (CPNS) for death of hospital inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, using the new OpenSAFELY platform. Population 17,425,445 adults. Time period 1st Feb 2020 to 25th April 2020. Primary outcome Death in hospital among people with confirmed COVID-19. Methods Cohort study analysed by Cox-regression to generate hazard ratios: age and sex adjusted, and multiply adjusted for co-variates selected prospectively on the basis of clinical interest and prior findings. Results There were 5683 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In summary after full adjustment, death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with: being male (hazard ratio 1.99, 95%CI 1.88-2.10); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); uncontrolled diabetes (HR 2.36 95% CI 2.18-2.56); severe asthma (HR 1.25 CI 1.08-1.44); and various other prior medical conditions. Compared to people with ethnicity recorded as white, black people were at higher risk of death, with only partial attenuation in hazard ratios from the fully adjusted model (age-sex adjusted HR 2.17 95% CI 1.84-2.57; fully adjusted HR 1.71 95% CI 1.44-2.02); with similar findings for Asian people (age-sex adjusted HR 1.95 95% CI 1.73-2.18; fully adjusted HR 1.62 95% CI 1.43-1.82). Conclusions We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for death from COVID-19, some of which were not previously well characterised, in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. People from Asian and black groups are at markedly increased risk of in-hospital death from COVID-19, and contrary to some prior speculation this is only partially attributable to pre-existing clinical risk factors or deprivation; further research into the drivers of this association is therefore urgently required. Deprivation is also a major risk factor with, again, little of the excess risk explained by co-morbidity or other risk factors. The findings for clinical risk factors are concordant with policies in the UK for protecting those at highest risk.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients receiving dialysis and adults in the US in January 2021 before the widespread introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the third largest US dialysis organization (US Renal Care), which has facilities located nationwide, to estimate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among US patients receiving dialysis. Remainder plasma (ie, plasma that would have otherwise been discarded) of all patients receiving dialysis at US Renal Care facilities from January 1 to 31, 2021, was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Patients were excluded if they had a documented dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or if a residence zip code was missing from electronic medical records. Crude seroprevalence estimates from this sample (January 2021) were standardized to the US adult population using the 2018 American Community Survey 1-year estimates and stratified by age group, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, neighborhood race/ethnicity composition, neighborhood income level, and urban or rural status. These data and case detection rates were then compared with data from a July 2020 subsample of patients who received dialysis at the same facilities. EXPOSURES: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and region of residence as well as neighborhood race/ethnicity composition, poverty, population density, and urban or rural status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The spike protein receptor-binding domain total antibody assay (Siemens Healthineers; manufacturer-reported sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.8%) was used to estimate crude SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the unweighted sample, and then the estimated seroprevalence rates for the US dialysis and adult populations were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, and region. RESULTS: A total of 21 464 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [14.2] years; 12 265 men [57%]) were included in the unweighted sample from January 2021. The patients were disproportionately older (aged 65-79 years, 7847 [37%]; aged 80 years, 2668 [12%]) and members of racial/ethnic minority groups (Hispanic patients, 2945 [18%]; non-Hispanic Black patients, 4875 [29%]). Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 18.9% (95% CI, 18.3%-19.5%) in the sample, with a seroprevalence of 18.7% (95% CI, 18.1%-19.2%) standardized to the US dialysis population, and 21.3% (95% CI, 20.3%-22.3%) standardized to the US adult population. In the unweighted sample, younger persons (aged 18-44 years, 25.9%; 95% CI, 24.1%-27.8%), those who self-identified as Hispanic or living in Hispanic neighborhoods (25.1%; 95% CI, 23.6%-26.4%), and those living in the lowest-income neighborhoods (24.8%; 95% CI, 23.2%-26.5%) were among the subgroups with the highest seroprevalence. Little variability was observed in seroprevalence by geographic region, population density, and urban or rural status in the January 2021 sample (largest regional difference, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.3] higher odds of seroprevalence in residents of the Northeast vs West). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of patients receiving dialysis in the US, fewer than 1 in 4 patients had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 1 year after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in the US. Results standardized to the US population indicate similar prevalence of antibodies among US adults. Vaccine introduction to younger individuals, those living in neighborhoods with a large population of racial/ethnic minority residents, and those living in low-income neighborhoods may be critical to disrupting the spread of infection.","output":"Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in US Patients Receiving Dialysis 1 Year After the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The authors present a premedical education program, unprecedented in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), that has been able to address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Malaria and tuberculosis still cause millions of deaths. Influenza pandemics with new, deadly versions continue to appear. Neglected tropical diseases are responding to global donor efforts. Newly emerging diseases move to new regions and became endemic, and deadly localized hemorrhagic fevers threaten to transmit more widely. Rapid mass travel allows infectious diseases in isolated villages to quickly become global threats. New strains of viruses, antibiotic resistance, and microorganisms causing chronic diseases are challenges for infectious disease control requiring continuing political, financial, and scientific support, and much tenacity.","output":"Chapter 4 Communicable Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Assess whether impactibility modelling is being used to refine risk stratification for preventive health interventions. DESIGN Systematic review. SETTING Primary and secondary healthcare populations. PAPERS Articles published from 2010 to 2020 on the use or implementation of impactibility modelling in population health management, reported with the terms 'intervenability', 'amenability', and 'propensity to succeed' (PTS) and associated with the themes 'care sensitivity', 'characteristic responders', 'needs gap', 'case finding', 'patient selection' and 'risk stratification'. INTERVENTIONS Qualitative synthesis to identify themes for approaches to impactibility modelling. RESULTS Of 1244 records identified, 20 were eligible for inclusion. Identified themes were 'health conditions amenable to care' (n=6), 'PTS modelling' (n=8) and 'comparison or combination with clinical judgement' (n=6). For the theme 'health conditions amenable to care', changes in practice did not reduce admissions, particularly for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and sometimes increased them, with implementation noted as a possible issue. For 'PTS modelling', high costs and needs did not necessarily equate to high impactibility and targeting a larger number of individuals with disorders associated with lower costs had more potential. PTS modelling seemed to improve accuracy in care planning, estimation of cost savings, engagement and/or care quality. The 'comparison or combination with clinical judgement' theme suggested that models can reach reasonable to good discriminatory power to detect impactable patients. For instance, a model used to identify patients appropriate for proactive multimorbid care management showed good concordance with physicians (c-statistic 0.75). Another model employing electronic health record scores reached 65% concordance with nurse and physician decisions when referring elderly hospitalised patients to a readmission prevention programme. However, healthcare professionals consider much wider information that might improve or impede the likelihood of treatment impact, suggesting that complementary use of models might be optimum. CONCLUSIONS The efficiency and equity of targeted preventive care guided by risk stratification could be augmented and personalised by impactibility modelling.","output":"Bridging the impactibility gap in population health management: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a type of viral pneumonia that has paralysed the entire world both in terms of health and economy.

Our results confirm that vaccines are reasonably effective in both limiting the spread of infections and containing more severe disease progression in symptomatic patients. First, the results show that full vaccination rate is consistently negatively correlated with the number of new COVID cases, whereby a 10 percent increase in vaccination rate is associated with a 1.3 to 1.7 percent decrease in new COVID cases. Second, the magnitude of vaccination is shown to contribute significantly to moderating severe disease progression. On average, a 10 percent increase in the rate of vaccination leads to a reduction of about 5 percent in the number of new hospitalizations, 12 percent decrease in the number of new intensive care patients and 2 percent reduction in the number of new deaths. Finally, by comparing the data for the same period between 2020 and 2021, we also check how well vaccination performs as a substitute for lockdowns or other stringent government protection measures. Results suggest that vaccination appears to be an effective substitute for more stringent government safety measures to contain the spread of COVID infections only at a sufficiently high vaccination coverage threshold (more than 70 percent). On the other hand, vaccination is shown to be quite effective in limiting the more severe course of the disease in symptomatic patients already at moderate vaccination coverage (between 40 and 70 percent). This suggests that vaccination can also help to reduce pressure on the health system and thus benefit the overall public health of society. On the other hand, the efficient rollout of vaccines could explain the favourable economic performance in the second half of 2021 despite the severe outbreak of the delta variant.","output":"Vaccination Is Reasonably Effective in Limiting the Spread of COVID-19 Infections, Hospitalizations and Deaths with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of COVID\\\\19, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has increased globally at a dramatic speed.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze gender differences in state anxiety, daily functional self-actualization, and functional cognition as well as the relationships among those factors in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: We collected data on the web from a sample of 204 people (102 men and 102 women) aged 60 years and older. In addition to a demographic questionnaire, we used the State-Trait Personality Inventory to assess state anxiety, the Daily Functional Actualization questionnaire to evaluate daily functional self-actualization, and the Daily Living Questionnaire to measure functional cognition. RESULTS: Significant gender differences were found for state anxiety (t(202)=?2.36, P=.02); daily functional self-actualization (t(202)=2.15, P=.03); and the functional cognition components: complex tasks (Z=?3.07, P=.002); cognitive symptoms that might be interfering (Z=?2.15, P=.028); executive functions (Z=?2.21, P=.024); and executive function monitoring (Z=?2.21, P=.027). Significant medium correlations were found between both state anxiety level and daily functional self-actualization (r=?0.62, P<.001) and functional cognition (r=0.37-0.40, P<.001).

We recently reported a small molecule inhibitor of CREB, XX-650-23, which inhibits CREB activity in AML cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis for chemical compounds with structures similar to XX-650-23 led to the identification of the anthelminthic drug niclosamide as a potent anti-leukemic agent that suppresses cell viability of AML cell lines and primary AML cells without a significant decrease in colony forming activity of normal bone marrow cells. Niclosamide significantly inhibited CREB function and CREB-mediated gene expression in cells, leading to apoptosis and G1/S cell cycle arrest with reduced phosphorylated CREB levels. CREB knockdown protected cells from niclosamide treatment-mediated cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, treatment with a combination of niclosamide and CREB inhibitor XX-650-23 showed an additive anti-proliferative effect, consistent with the hypothesis that niclosamide and XX-650-23 regulate the same targets or pathways to inhibit proliferation and survival of AML cells. Niclosamide significantly inhibited the progression of disease in AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice, and prolonged survival of PDX mice. Niclosamide also showed synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs to inhibit AML cell proliferation. While chemotherapy antagonized the cytotoxic potential of niclosamide, pretreatment with niclosamide sensitized cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine, daunorubicin, and vincristine. Therefore, our results demonstrate niclosamide as a potential drug to treat AML by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest through inhibition of CREB-dependent pathways in AML cells.","output":"Niclosamide suppresses acute myeloid leukemia cell proliferation through inhibition of CREB-dependent signaling pathways."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This longitudinal study examines the impact that terrorist attacks within a representative group of European countries can have on the tourism demand of a South European country with no record of terrorism attacks.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this work was to study the prevalence of ABCG5/G8 genetic variants in mutation-negative FH, as defects in these genes relate to intestinal hyperabsorption of cholesterol and thus ABCG5/G8 variants could explain in part the mechanism of hypercholesterolemia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS We sequenced the ABCG5/G8 genes in 214 mutation-negative FH and 97 controls. Surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption (5-cholestanol, -sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and sitostanol) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in both studied groups. RESULTS We found 8 mutation-negative FH patients (3.73%) with a pathogenic mutation in ABCG5/G8 genes. We observed significantly higher concentration of surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption in mutation-negative FH than in controls. In addition, we found significantly higher concentrations of cholesterol absorption markers in mutation-negative FH with ABCG5/G8 defects than in mutation-negative, ABCG5/G8-negative FH. A gene score reflecting the number of common single nucleotide variants associated with hypercholesterolemia was significantly higher in cases than in controls (P = .032). Subjects with a gene score above the mean had significantly higher 5-cholestanol and stigmasterol than those with a lower gene score. CONCLUSIONS Mutation-negative FH subjects accumulate an excess of rare and common gene variations in ABCG5/G8 genes. This variation is associated with increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol, as determined by surrogate makers, suggesting that these loci contribute to hypercholesterolemia by enhancing intestinal cholesterol absorption.","output":"ABCG5/G8 gene is associated with hypercholesterolemias without mutation in candidate genes and noncholesterol sterols."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing methods for RNA diagnostics, such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), mainly rely on nucleic acid amplification (NAA) and RT processes, which are known to introduce substantial issues, including amplification bias, cross-contamination, and sample loss.

Design/methodology/approach: The COVID-19 pandemic created a wide variety of problems for higher education. Classes moved quickly from in-person to virtual instruction with little time for training;faculty and students had to adapt to new learning platforms, learning styles, study techniques and technological challenges. Emotions ran high due to constant change, transitions and numerous unknowns. The LC structure embedded in the curriculum of this US medical school aided in the navigation of these challenges. Findings: Of the 95 MD1-MD4 respondents combined who responded to the COVID-19 LC survey, 67% rated the LC sessions good/outstanding, 20% average, 7% poor/fair and 5% N/A. When asked if LCs had helped them during the pandemic, overall, 66% said \\"yes\\" and 34% said \\"no.\\" When asked how LCs have helped during the pandemic, themes emerged related to safety, adapting to feelings of isolation/mental health/emotional support, and academic progress. Originality/value: The small LC group structure created a sense of security for receiving academic help, emotional support, a network of assistance resources and a place to process COVID-19 losses and insecurities. Receptivity to utilizing the LC structure for support may relate to the medical students' commitment to addressing health disparities, serving the underserved and embracing a medical school culture that values community.","output":"Navigating COVID-19 through diverse student learning communities: importance and lessons learned.

The aim of this study was to explore sonographic muscle indices as predictors of COVID\\\\19 outcome and to test the feasibility of sonographic muscle measurement in an isolation context. METHODS: Muscle indices, derived from the psoas muscle or thigh muscles, were quantified by sonography in a cohort of patients without COVID\\\\19 to obtain reference values for low muscle quantity. Gender\\\\specific median of different muscle indices were defined as threshold value for low muscle quantity. The prognostic relevance of low muscle quantity, was prospectively explored in two cohorts of hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients. Optimal muscle index cutoff values predictive for 30 day mortality during COVID\\\\19 were determined by receiver operating characteristic\\\\area under the curve and Youden index calculation. Muscle quantity and known prognostic factors of COVID\\\\19 were analysed by multivariable log\\\\regression. RESULTS: Compared with other muscle indices, the psoas muscle area index (PMAI) showed the most favourable characteristics to predict outcome of COVID\\\\19 disease. Sonographic morphometry of patients without COVID\\\\19 (n = 136) revealed a gender\\\\specific median for PMAI (male: 291.1 mm(2)/m(2), female 260.6 mm(2)/m(2)) as threshold value of low muscle quantity. Subsequently, COVID\\\\19 patients (Cohort I: n = 58; Cohort II: n = 55) were prospectively assessed by bedside sonography. The studied COVID\\\\19 patients developed a critical course of disease in 22.4% (Cohort I: n = 13/58) and 34.5% (Cohort II: n = 20/55). Mortality rate reached 12.1% (Cohort I: n = 7/58) and 20.0% (Cohort I: n = 11/55) within 30 days of follow up. COVID\\\\19 patients with a PMAI below the gender\\\\specific median showed a higher 30 day mortality in both COVID\\\\19 cohorts (log rank, P < 0.05). The optimal PMAI cutoff value (206 mm(2)/m(2)) predicted 30 day mortality of hospitalized COVID\\\\19 patients with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 78.5% (receiver operating characteristic\\\\area under the curve: 0.793, 95% confidence interval 0.671C0.914, P = 0.008). Multivariable log\\\\regression analysis of PMAI, age, gender, BMI and comorbidities confirmed an independent association of low PMAI with 30 day mortality of COVID\\\\19 patients (P = 0.018).

OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes for mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 transferred to a tertiary referral center with increased surge capacity with patients admitted from the emergency department. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Observational cohort study of single center urban academic medical center ICUs. All patients admitted and discharged with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia who received invasive ventilation between March 17, 2020, and October 14, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from the electronic medical record. Patients were classified as emergency department admits or interhospital transfers. Regression models tested the association between transfer status and survival, adjusting for demographics and presentation severity. RESULTS: In total, 298 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia were admitted to the ICU and received mechanical ventilation. Of these, 117 were transferred from another facility and 181 were admitted through the emergency department. Patients were primarily male (64%) and Black (38%) or Hispanic (45%). Transfer patients differed from emergency department admits in having English as a preferred language (71% vs 56%; p = 0.008) and younger age (median 57 vs 61 yr; p < 0.001). There were no differences in race/ethnicity or primary payor. Transfers were more likely to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (12% vs 3%; p = 0.004). Overall, 50 (43%) transferred patients and 78 (43%) emergency department admits died prior to discharge. There was no significant difference in hospital mortality or days from intubation to discharge between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a single-center retrospective cohort, no significant differences in hospital mortality or length of stay between interhospital transfers and emergency department admits were found. While more study is needed, this suggests that interhospital transfer of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 can be done safely and effectively.","output":"Interhospital Transfer Outcomes for Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Requiring Mechanical Ventilation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background In clinical trials two vaccinations with mRNA vaccines have shown high efficacy in preventing COVID-19. However, in the context of a pandemic, the time to generation of protective immunity, the need for and timing of a second vaccination are matters of legitimate debate. This manuscript explores the efficacy and timing of the second dose COVID-19 vaccines, including a reanalysis of data from the Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine phase 3 study. Methods and findings A non-weighted three-segment, two knot linear regression was fitted to the published cumulative infection incidence from the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine Phase III trial using the lspine routine in R. The optimal knot days were estimated through sensitivity analysis and the confidence limits for efficacy estimates were determined by Monte Carlo Simulations. This analysis showed the vaccine was effective from day 11 post first vaccination. The estimated efficacy over the period 11 to 28 days post first vaccination was 0.94 and there was no detectable increase in efficacy following the second vaccination. The efficacy post first vaccination substantially preceded the development of detectable serum neutralizing antibody. Conclusions Strongly protective immunity develops rapidly following a single vaccination and at least in the short period covered by the timetable of the Phase III trial, there was no additional benefit from a second vaccination. This increases options for use of this vaccine, e.g., for ring fence vaccination, for use in travelers and for mass vaccination rollout. It highlights the need for further research into duration of immunity following a single vaccination and for understanding mechanisms of protection.","output":"Reanalysis of the Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine data fails to find any increased efficacy following the boost: Implications for vaccination policy and our understanding of the mode of action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshifting (?1 PRF).

Trials are particularly essential to support large-scale implementations of consumer health technologies, such as smartphone-supported home tests. However, trials are generally fraught with challenges, such as inadequate enrollment, lack of fidelity to interventions, and high dropout rates. Understanding the reasons underlying individuals participation in trials can inform the design and execution of future trials of smartphone-supported home tests. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the enablers of potential participants trial engagement for clinical trials of smartphone-supported home tests. We use influenza home testing as our instantiation of a consumer health technology subject to trial to investigate the dispositional and situational enablers that influenced trial engagement. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 31 trial participants using purposive sampling to facilitate demographic diversity. The interviews included a discussion of participants personal characteristics and external factors that enabled their trial engagement with a smartphone-supported home test for influenza. We performed both deductive and inductive thematic analyses to analyze the interview transcripts and identify enabler themes. RESULTS: Our thematic analyses revealed a structure of dispositional and situational enablers that enhanced trial engagement. Situationally, clinical affiliation, personal advice, promotional recruitment strategies, financial incentives, and insurance status influenced trial engagement. In addition, digital health literacy, motivation to advance medical research, personal innovativeness, altruism, curiosity, positive attitude, and potential to minimize doctors visits were identified as the dispositional enablers for trial engagement in our study. CONCLUSIONS: We organized the identified themes for dispositional and situational enablers of trial engagement with a smartphone-supported home test into a research framework that can guide future research as well as the trial design and execution of smartphone-supported home tests. We suggest several trial design and engagement strategies to enhance the financial and scientific viability of these trials that pave the way for advancements in patient care. Furthermore, our study also offers practical strategies to trial organizers to enhance participants enrollment and engagement in clinical trials of these home tests.","output":"Identifying Enablers of Participant Engagement in Clinical Trials of Consumer Health Technologies: Qualitative Study of Influenza Home Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: We aimed to explore the dynamic changes in coagulation function and the effect of age on coagulation function in patients with pneumonia under admission and non-admission treatment.","output":"Dynamic Changes in Coagulation Function in Patients With Pneumonia Under Admission and Non-admission Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In this study, the use of lung ultrasonography (LUS) to diagnosis lung findings was evaluated in patients with suspected COVID-19 who were admitted to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: This observational clinical study was conducted in the ED of the Ankara City Hospital during the period April 1C30, 2020. Patients who were admitted to the ED were triaged as COVID-19 infected and who agreed to undergo LUS/LCT (lung computed tomography) were included in the study. RESULTS: Included in the study were 40 patients who had been prediagnosed with COVID-19. Pneumonia was detected with LCT in 32 (80%) patients, while the LUS examination identified pneumonia in 23 patients. The most common finding in LCT was ground-glass opacity (n = 29, 90.6%). Of the 23 patients with pneumonia findings in LUS, 15 (65.2%) had direct consolidation. Among the 32 patients who were found to have pneumonia as a result of LCT, 20 (62.5%) had signs of pneumonia on LUS examination, and 12 had no signs of pneumonia. In addition, 3 patients showed no signs of pneumonia with LCT, but they were misdiagnosed with pneumonia by LUS. The sensitivity of LUS in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the COVID-19 patients was 62.5%, while its specificity was 62.5%. In addition, its positive predictive value was 87.0%, and its negative predictive value was 29.4%. CONCLUSION: LUS may also be used in the diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients because it is a valuable and accessible bedside diagnostic tool.

From a network theory perspective, this is since international airports and flights, essentially playing the roles of bridge nodes and bridge links between countries as individual communities, dominate the epidemic spreading characteristics in the whole multi-community system. Among all epidemic characteristics, the peak infection rate, $I_{\\\\max}$, is a decisive factor in evaluating an epidemic strategy given limited capacity of medical resources, but is seldom considered in multi-community models. In this paper, we study a general two-community system interconnected by a fraction $r$ of bridge nodes and its dynamic properties, especially $I_{\\\\max}$, under the evolution of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Comparing the characteristic time scales of different parts of the system allows us to analytically derive the asymptotic behavior of $I_{\\\\max}$ with $r$, as $r\\\\rightarrow 0$, which follows different power-law relations in each regime of the phase diagram.

Sulphate green rust (GRSO4), a naturally occurring mixed-valent iron layered double hydroxide has shown to be highly effective in the reduction of Cr(VI) to poorly soluble Cr(III), giving promise for its use as reactant for in situ remedial applications. However, little is known about its immobilization efficiency inside porous geological media, such as soils and sediments, where this reactant would ultimately be applied. In this study, we tested the removal of Cr(VI) by GRSO4 in quartz sand fixed-bed column systems (diameter  length = 1.4 cm  11 cm), under anoxic conditions. Cr(VI) removal efficiency (relative to the available reducing equivalents in the added GRSO4) was determined by evaluating breakthrough curves performed at different inlet Cr(VI) concentrations (0.125-1 mM) which are representative of Cr(VI) concentrations found at contaminated sites, different flow rates (0.25-3 ml/min) and solution pH (4.5, 7 and 9.5). Results showed that (i) increasing Cr(VI) inlet concentration substantially decreased Cr(VI) removal efficiency of GRSO4, (ii) flow rates had a lower impact on removal efficiencies, although values tended to be lower at higher flow rates, and (iii) Cr(VI) removal was enhanced at acidic pH conditions compared to neutral and alkaline conditions. For comparison, Cr(VI) removal by sulphidized nanoscale zerovalent iron (S-nZVI) in identical column experiments was substantially lower, indicating that S-nZVI reactivity with Cr(VI) is much slower compared to GRSO4. Overall, GRSO4 performed reasonably well, even at the highest tested flow rate, showing its versatility and suitability for Cr(VI) remediation applications in high flow environments.","output":"Immobilization of Cr(VI) by sulphate green rust and sulphidized nanoscale zerovalent iron in sand media: batch and column studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human Infection Studies (HIC) involve intentional infection of volunteers with a challenge agent or pathogen with the aim of understanding and developing vaccines as well as understanding the disease pathophysiology in a well-controlled environment.

Given the imminent introduction of HIC in Zambia, we sought to understand potential participants willingness to volunteer for such studies. We used a qualitative exploratory approach to understand the potential participants perceptions on willingness to participate in HIC using the example of typhoid. Healthy adults, recruited using random selection and purposive sampling from higher learning institutions in Lusaka, participated in 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) respectively. Participants considered typhoid a serious disease with potential for life-long consequences and death. After sharing audio-visual materials introducing the concepts of HIC, some participants expressed open willingness to participate or alternatively the need to consult parents and professors, and expressed fear of death and illness. Though willing to be quarantined for up to six months, participants expressed concerns regarding separation from family and duties, having insufficient information to decide, inadequate access to care, severe disease, life-long injury or side-effects, death, and vaccine failure. These concerns along with possibility of underlying conditions that compromise individual immunity, competing priorities, parental refusal, and distrust of study or vaccine efficacy could lead to refusal to participate. Reasons for willingness to participate included monetary compensation, altruism and being part of a team that comes up with a vaccine.

Scientists worldwide are engaged in attempts to elucidate the transmission and pathogenic mechanisms of the causative coronavirus. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, making it critical to track and review the state of research on COVID-19 to provide guidance for further investigations. Here, bibliometric and knowledge mapping analyses of studies on COVID-19 were performed, including more than 1500 papers on COVID-19 available in the PubMed and CNKI databases from January 1, 2020 to March 8, 2020. In this review, we found that because of the rapid response of researchers worldwide, the number of COVID-19-related publications showed a high growth trend in the first ten days of February; among these, the largest number of studies originated in China, the country most affected by pandemic in its early stages. Our findings revealed that the epidemic situation and data accessibility of different research teams have caused obvious difference in emphases of the publications. Besides, there was an unprecedented level of close cooperation and information sharing within the global scientific community relative to previous coronavirus research. We combed and drew the knowledge map of the SARS-CoV-2 literature, explored early status of research on etiology, pathology, epidemiology, treatment, prevention, and control, and discussed knowledge gaps that remain to be urgently addressed.

METHODS: Prospective case series, which included patients, diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive autoantibodies against type I IFNs in two French intensive care units (ICUs) between October 8 and November 14, 2020. Six critically ill COVID-19 patients with no anti-IFN antibodies were used as controls. Anti-IFN autoantibodies and IFN concentrations, together with the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, were measured sequentially in serum. Viral load was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Patients were followed during hospital stay. RESULTS: Three men and one woman were included. Three of the patients had four PE sessions each, while another had three PE sessions. PE decreased the concentrations of autoantibodies against type I IFN in all four patients, whereas anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels remained stable. Autoantibodies against type I IFN levels were high in tracheal aspirates of one patient and decreased after three PE sessions. By contrast, anti-IFN autoantibodies were not detected in tracheal aspirates from five control patients without detectable anti-IFN autoantibodies in serum. During PE, serum IFN-&#945; levels slightly increased in three out of four patients, and upper respiratory tract viral load decreased in all patients. All patients were alive at day 28 of ICU admission. Two patients eventually died in the ICU, while the two survivors were discharged from the ICU at days 50 and 66. CONCLUSIONS: PE efficiently removes autoantibodies against type I IFNs, including those detected in tracheal aspirates, without affecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.

Management is mainly based on empirical prescribing, but there are concerns about overtreatment and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), especially in patients with recurrent uUTIs. METHODS A multidisciplinary panel of experts met to discuss diagnosis, treatment, prevention, guidelines, AMR, clinical trial design, and the impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice. RESULTS Symptoms remain the cornerstone of uUTI diagnosis, and urine culture is necessary only when empirical treatment fails, or rapid recurrence of symptoms or AMR is suspected. Specific antimicrobials are first-line therapy (typically nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and pivmecillinam; dependent on availability and local resistance data). Fluoroquinolones are not first-line options for uUTIs due primarily to safety concerns, but also rising resistance rates. High-quality data to support most non-antimicrobial approaches are lacking. Local AMR data specific to community-acquired uUTIs are needed, but representative information is difficult to obtain; instead, identification of risk factors for AMR can provide a basis to guide empirical antimicrobial prescribing. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted management of uUTIs in some countries and may have long-lasting implications for future models of care. CONCLUSIONS The management of uUTIs in women can be improved without increasing complexity, including simplified diagnosis, and empirical antimicrobial prescribing based on patient characteristics, including review of recent antimicrobial use and past pathogen resistance profiles, drug availability, and guidelines.

Silicosis increases their risk of tuberculosis (TB), exacerbated by the HIV epidemic. Work-related factors are likely to increase transmission, severity, and post infection sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding these relationships is important to control the impact of the epidemic. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among mineworkers exceed the population rates in the provinces in which those mines are located. Migrant work, living in crowded hostels, working in narrow poorly ventilated shafts mainly underground constitute important factors that increase transmission risk. Mineworkers continue to experience high levels of silica exposure. The prevalences of silicosis, HIV and pulmonary TB, remain high. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary TB, and HIV have all been associated with poorer outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Mineworkers with post infection respiratory sequelae are likely to lose their jobs or lose income, due to the physically demanding nature of underground minework. SUMMARY: Further research into the unique work-related risk factors in mining that influence the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial for optimizing current interventions. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission, health monitoring of infected and vulnerable workers, and following up of postinfection outcomes is essential to protect the respiratory health of miners.","output":"COVID-19: a new burden of respiratory disease among South African miners?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Osteonecrosis is a common human disease in orthopedics. It is difficult to treat, and half of patients may need artificial joint replacement, resulting in a considerable economic burden and a reduction in quality of life. Hormones are one of the major causes of osteonecrosis and high doses of corticosteroids are considered the most dangerous factor. Because of the complexity of treatment, we still need a better animal model that can be widely used in drug development and testing. Tree shrews are more closely related to primates than rodents. As such, we constructed a successful tree shrew model to establish and evaluate steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON). We found that low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) combined with high-dose methylprednisolone (MPS) over 12 weeks could be used to establish a tree shrew model with femoral head necrosis. Serum biochemical and histological analyses showed that an ideal model was obtained. Thus, this work provides a useful animal model for the study of SAON and for the optimization of treatment methods.","output":"A tree shrew model for steroid-associated osteonecrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 infection include a wide spectrum of cutaneous, endocrine, and cardiovascular complications.

However, individual measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage are noisy, inherently variable, and can be left-censored. Aim We aimed to infer latent virus loads in a comprehensive sewage surveillance program that includes all sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the Netherlands and covers 99.6% of the Dutch population. Methods A multilevel Bayesian penalized spline model was developed and applied to estimate time- and STP-specific virus loads based on water flow adjusted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR data from 1-4 sewage samples per week for each of the >300 STPs. Results The model provided an adequate fit to the data and captured the epidemic upsurges and downturns in the Netherlands, despite substantial day-to-day measurement variation. Estimated STP virus loads varied by more than two orders of magnitude, from approximately 1012 (virus particles per 100,000 persons per day) in the epidemic trough in August 2020 to almost 1015 in many STPs in January 2022. Epidemics at the local levels were slightly shifted between STPs and municipalities, which resulted in less pronounced peaks and troughs at the national level. Conclusion Although substantial day-to-day variation is observed in virus load measurements, wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 can track long-term epidemic progression at a local scale in near real-time, especially at high sampling frequency.","output":"Modelling patterns of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the Netherlands, August 2020-February 2022, revealed by a nationwide sewage surveillance program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is associated with immune dysregulation and hyperinflammation, including elevated interleukin-6 levels. The use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor, has resulted in better outcomes in patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in case reports and retrospective observational cohort studies. Data are needed from randomized, placebo-controlled trials. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio receive a single intravenous infusion of tocilizumab (at a dose of 8 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo. Approximately one quarter of the participants received a second dose of tocilizumab or placebo 8 to 24 hours after the first dose. The primary outcome was clinical status at day 28 on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (discharged or ready for discharge) to 7 (death) in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who had received at least one dose of tocilizumab or placebo. RESULTS: Of the 452 patients who underwent randomization, 438 (294 in the tocilizumab group and 144 in the placebo group) were included in the primary and secondary analyses. The median value for clinical status on the ordinal scale at day 28 was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 1.0) in the tocilizumab group and 2.0 (non-ICU hospitalization without supplemental oxygen) (95% CI, 1.0 to 4.0) in the placebo group (between-group difference, ?1.0; 95% CI, ?2.5 to 0; P=0.31 by the van Elteren test). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 103 of 295 patients (34.9%) in the tocilizumab group and in 55 of 143 patients (38.5%) in the placebo group.

It is currently recommended that patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears are fast tracked for surgical opinion. However, there is uncertainty about the most clinically and cost-effective intervention for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears and further research is required. SPeEDy will assess the feasibility of a fully powered, multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypothesis that, compared to surgical repair (and usual post-operative rehabilitation), a programme of physiotherapist-led exercise is not clinically inferior, but is more cost-effective for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears. METHODS: SPeEDy is a two-arm, multi-centre pilot and feasibility RCT with integrated Quintet Recruitment Intervention (QRI) and further qualitative investigation of patient experience. A total of 76 patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears will be recruited from approximately eight UK NHS hospitals and randomly allocated to either surgical repair and usual post-operative rehabilitation or a programme of physiotherapist-led exercise. The QRI is a mixed-methods approach that includes data collection and analysis of screening logs, audio recordings of recruitment consultations, interviews with patients and clinicians involved in recruitment, and review of study documentation as a basis for developing action plans to address identified difficulties whilst recruitment to the RCT is underway. A further sample of patient participants will be purposively sampled from both intervention groups and interviewed to explore reasons for initial participation, treatment acceptability, reasons for non-completion of treatment, where relevant, and any reasons for treatment crossover. DISCUSSION: Research to date suggests that there is uncertainty regarding the most clinically and cost-effective interventions for patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears. There is a clear need for a high-quality, fully powered, RCT to better inform clinical practice. Prior to this, we first need to undertake a pilot and feasibility RCT to address current uncertainties about recruitment, retention and number of and reasons for treatment crossover.

They were divided into 5 groups using a random number table, the control group (group A, 6 sides) and the material group 1, 2, 3, 4 (respectively group B, C, D, E, 9 sides in each group). All animals were prepared with 12-mm-diameter skull defect models, and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) non-covalently bound multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)-COOH+poly ( L-lactide) (PLLA), BMP-2 non-covalently bound MWCNT-NH 2+PLLA, BMP-2 covalently bound MWCNT-COOH+PLLA, and BMP-2 covalently bound MWCNT-NH 2+PLLA were implanted into the defects of groups B, C, D, and E, respectively. At 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, the samples were taken for CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction, the ratio of bone tissue regeneration volume to total volume and bone mineral density were measured, and the histological observation of HE staining and Masson trichrome staining were performed to quantitatively analyze the volume ratio of new bone tissue. Results: CT scanning and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that with the extension of time, the defects in groups A-E were filled gradually, and the defect in group E was completely filled at 12 weeks after operation. HE staining and Masson trichrome staining showed that the volume of new bone tissue in each group gradually increased with time, and regenerated mature bone tissue appeared in groups D and E at 12 weeks after operation. Quantitative analysis showed that at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation, the ratio of bone tissue regeneration volume to total volume, bone mineral density, and the volume ratio of new bone tissue increased gradually over time; and at each time point, the above indexes increased gradually from group A to group E, and the differences between groups were significant ( P<0.05).

QALY (quality adjusted life years) & DALY (disability adjusted life years) are also important for consideration of impact of this pandemic. The healthcare systems is under constant massive pressure to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus & a huge part of this responsibility is being shouldered by frontline health care workers including doctors, nurses, paramedical workers, ASHAs and Anganwadi services etc. Hence HCWs are inevitably and routinely exposed to the virus hence naturally are at high risk of infection, possible mortality & morbidities. Objectives The key objective is to find out impact of SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers (HCWs) Mortality & Infections across 36 states & union territories of India.

Several studies consider COVID-19 a zoonotic disease and, since Italy is the repository of a high biodiversity, SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals can be considered as a reservoir of the virus or favor the spreading between animals and humans. In this work, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of ACE2 protein of the most common domestic and wild animals present in Italy. Among the latter, we focused on ACE2 of the Chiroptera species present in Italy, to identify the primary reservoir in this region. First, we reproduced in silico the Chiroptera ACE2/viral Spike (S) protein interactions on the human ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S complex model and identified the critical residues for the binding. In silico molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to Chiroptera vs. SARS-CoV-2 S protein pointed to Rhinolophus ferrumequinum as a bat living in Italy, that may be a potential primary reservoir of the virus. On the other hand, a sequence similarity search on ACE2 of domestic and wild animals living in Italy pointed to domestic (horses, cats, cattle and sheep) and wild (European rabbits and grizzly bears) animal species as potential SARS-CoV-2 secondary reservoirs. Molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to these species vs. S protein of Bat coronavirus (Bt-CoV/Rp3/2004) suggests that the primary reservoir Rhinolophus ferrumequinum may infect the secondary reservoirs, domestic and worldwide animals living in Italy, determining a specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"New putative animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian fauna: a bioinformatic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a surge of misinformation has flooded social media and other internet channels, and some of it has the potential to cause real-world harm To counteract this misinformation, reliably identifying it is a principal problem to be solved However, the identification of misinformation poses a formidable challenge for language processing systems since the texts containing misinformation are short, work with insinuation rather than explicitly stating a false claim, or resemble other postings that deal with the same topic ironically Accordingly, for the development of better detection systems, it is not only essential to use hand-labeled ground truth data and extend the analysis with methods beyond Natural Language Processing to consider the characteristics of the participant's relationships and the diffusion of misinformation This paper presents a novel dataset that deals with a specific piece of misinformation: the idea that the 5G wireless network is causally connected to the COVID-19 pandemic We have extracted the subgraphs of 3,000 manually classified Tweets from Twitter's follower network and distinguished them into three categories First, subgraphs of Tweets that propagate the specific 5G misinformation, those that spread other conspiracy theories, and Tweets that do neither We created the WICO (Wireless Networks and Coronavirus Conspiracy) dataset to support experts in machine learning experts, graph processing, and related fields in studying the spread of misinformation Furthermore, we provide a series of baseline experiments using both Graph Neural Networks and other established classifiers that use simple graph metrics as features The dataset is available at https://datasets simula no/wico-graph ? 2021 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda","output":"WICO graph: A labeled dataset of twitter subgraphs based on conspiracy theory and 5G-corona misinformation tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cases of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) were reported on 21 February in the small town of Vo' near Padua in the Veneto region of Italy.

Thus, the search for natural bio-active molecules is of great interest that will exert antiviral activity as well as have least chances of toxicity. Fungi are considered as bio-enriched source of producing antiviral compounds. This study is focused on identifying potential fungal derived antiviral molecules with good binding affinity against SARS-CoV-2 M-Pro using molecular docking. Semicochliodinol B was identified as the best lead molecule with higher binding affinity (-8.9kcal/mol) as compared to the co-crystalized ligand (-8.5kcal/mol). The results of molecular docking confirm the hydrogen bond interaction of Semicochliodinol B with Glu166 and Asn142 as well as hydrophobic interactions with 20 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 M-Pro. Semicochliodinol B also exhibited good binding affinity against SARS-CoV M-Pro and Middle east respiratory syndrome-related corona virus (MERS-CoV M-Pro), suggesting its broad-spectrum activity. Druglikeness, Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and toxicity studies also directed that Semicochliodinol B may become a promising drug candidate and thus it can be further investigated as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M-Pro. Virtual screening was done on fungal-derived antivirals to identify SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors.

During the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic, as well as earlier SARS and MERS epidemics, it has been observed that COVID19-positive women on average tend to have milder symptoms and lower fatality rates than men. There is a number of differences between the sexes known to contribute to different immune responses and severity of the disease, one being the effect of estrogen via estrogen receptor signalling. We wondered if estrogen might also affect the SARS-CoV2 more directly, perhaps by binding to the surface glycoprotein (S protein), thus possibly reducing its infectivity. Experimental approach. To assess whether there is a possibility for estrogen binding on the SARS-CoV2 S protein, we used BLAST and HHpred to compare protein sequences of S protein and human estrogen receptor , while 3D structures of a potential estrogen binding site and an active site of estrogen receptor  were visualized and compared using PyMOL. Results and conclusions. By comparing the sequence of SARS-CoV2 S protein with the human estrogen receptor , we identified a potential estrogen binding site on S protein and further determined that it also shares notable similarities with the active site of ER  when observed in 3D structure of their respective proteins. As a control, SARS-CoV2 S protein was compared with the human androgen receptor, and no such similarities were found. The potential estrogen binding site is part of coronavirus S2 superfamily domain, which is involved in host-virus membrane fusion during infection and appears to be conserved throughout the Coronaviridae family. Novelty and scientific contribution: This preliminary communication shows that SARS-CoV2 S protein features a potential estrogen binding site. Hopefully, this will prompt a more comprehensive study on the possibilities of estrogen binding on the S protein and the effect this might confer on the virus infectivity. ? 2021, University of Zagreb.

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a federal government advisory group recommended a rapid, tailored Indigenous response to prevent predicted high morbidity and mortality rates. This paper examines the efforts of one ACCHO, which in the absence of dedicated funding, pivoted its operations in response to COVID-19. Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service (Gurriny) is the only primary healthcare service in the discrete Indigenous community of Yarrabah, Far North Queensland. METHODS: The research was conducted at the request of the Chief Executive Officer of Gurriny. Using grounded theory methods, thirteen Gurriny staff and five Yarrabah and government leaders and community members were interviewed, transcripts of these interviews and 59 documents were imported into NVIVO-12 and coded, and key concepts were compared, organised into higher order constructs, then structured into a theoretical framework. RESULTS: Gurriny responded to COVID-19 by leading with local solutions to keep Yarrabah safe. Four key strategies were implemented: managing the health service operations, realigning services, educating and supporting community, and working across agencies. These strategies were enabled or hindered by five conditions: the governance and leadership capacity of Gurriny, relying on the health taskforce, locking the door, copping it, and (not) having resources. A year after the first case was experienced in Australia and on the eve of vaccine rollout to Indigenous communities, there have been no COVID-19 cases in Yarrabah. DISCUSSION: The success of the locally led, holistic, comprehensive and culturally safe response of Gurriny suggests that such tailored place-based approaches to pandemics (and other health issues) are appropriate, but require dedicated resourcing. Key challenges were the fragmented and rapidly changing government processes, poorly coordinated communication and resource allocation channels, and bottlenecks in hierarchical funding approval processes.

The diffeomorphic property reflects the credibility of the registration results. METHOD: To improve the diffeomorphic property in 3D medical image registration, we propose a diffeomorphic cascaded network based on the compressed loss, named LDVoxelMorph. the proposed network has several constituent U-Nets and is trained with deep supervision, which uses a different spatial smoothness regularization parameter in each constituent U-Nets for training. This cascade-variant smoothness regularization parameter can maintain the diffeomorphic property in top cascades with large displacement and achieves precise registration in bottom cascades. Besides, we develop the compressed loss (CL) as a penalty for the velocity field, which can accurately limit the velocity field that causes the deformation field overlap after the velocity field integration. RESULTS: In our registration experiments, the dice scores of our method were 0.8920.040 on liver CT datasets SLIVER37 , 0.8480.044 on liver CT datasets LiTS38 , 0.6890.014 on brain MRI datasets LPBA38 , and the number of overlapping voxels of deformation field were 325, 159 and 0, respectively.

This pattern of decreased food intake is similar to that occurring during indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, where we previously measured an increase in plasma tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-. Anorexia in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide administration, which is also linked to plasma TNF-, is however, caused only via a decrease in meal number.

These high-risk groups have been identified as developing diminished humoral and cellular immune responses. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remains detectable in nasopharyngeal swabs of these patients for a prolonged period of time. These factors complicate the clinical management of these vulnerable patient groups. To date, there are no well-defined guidelines for an appropriate duration of isolation for elderly and immunocompromised patients, especially in hospitals or nursing homes. The aim of the present study was to characterize at-risk patient cohorts capable of producing a replication-competent virus over an extended period after symptomatic COVID-19, and to investigate the humoral and cellular immune responses and infectivity to provide a better basis for future clinical management. In our cohort, the rate of positive viral cultures and the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests correlated with higher viral loads. Elderly patients and patients with diabetes mellitus had adequate cellular and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while immunocompromised patients had reduced humoral and cellular immune responses. Our patient cohort was hospitalized for longer compared with previously published cohorts.

The intervention entails the establishment of green zones for high-risk persons to live in, either within their homes or in communal structures, in a safe and dignified manner, for extended periods of time during the epidemic. To our knowledge, this concept has not been tested or evaluated in resource-poor settings. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of strategies to shield persons at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, during the COVID-19 epidemic in six communities in Sudan. METHODS: We purposively sampled participants from six communities, illustrative of urban, rural and forcibly-displaced settings. In-depth telephone interviews were held with 59 members of households with one or more members at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. Follow-up interviews were held with 30 community members after movement restrictions were eased across the country. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using a two-stage deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Most participants were aware that some people are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes but were unaware of the concept of shielding. Most participants found shielding acceptable and consistent with cultural inclinations to respect elders and protect the vulnerable. However, extra-household shielding arrangements were mostly seen as socially unacceptable. Participants reported feasibility concerns related to the reduced socialisation of shielded persons and loss of income for shielding families. The acceptability and feasibility of shielding strategies were reduced after movement restrictions were eased, as participants reported lower perception of risk in their communities and increased pressure to comply with social commitments outside the house. CONCLUSION: Shielding is generally acceptable in the study communities. Acceptability is influenced by feasibility, and by contextual changes in the epidemic and associated policy response. The promotion of shielding should capitalise on the cultural and moral sense of duty towards elders and vulnerable groups. Communities and households should be provided with practical guidance to implement feasible shielding options. Households must be socially, psychologically and financially supported to adopt and sustain shielding effectively.

Specifically, due to a significant degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the coronavirus family, memory B-cells that emerged from previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could be re-activated upon encountering the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, thus prompting the production of cross-reactive antibodies. Understanding the affinity and concentration of these potentially cross-reactive antibodies to the new SARS-CoV-2 antigens is therefore particularly important when assessing both existing immunity against common HCoVs and adverse effects like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19. However, these two fundamental parameters cannot easily be deconvoluted by surface-based assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which are routinely used to assess cross-reactivity. Here, we have used microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling (MAAP) to quantitatively evaluate the humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent patients by determining both antibody affinity and concentration against spike antigens of SARS-CoV-2 directly in nine convalescent COVID-19 patient and three pre-pandemic sera that were seropositive for common HCoVs. All 12 sera contained low concentrations of high affinity antibodies against spike antigens of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, indicative of past exposure to these pathogens, while the affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was lower. These results suggest that cross-reactivity as a consequence of memory re-activation upon an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be a significant factor in generating immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Understanding the role of memory re-activation and cross-reactivity in the defense against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinated, non-vaccinated, and immunosuppressed individuals will continue to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Further on, the energy consumption for heating was established, and the associated energy rating was in compliance with the Romanian regulations. A parametric study was done to illustrate the energy performance of the investigated case in the five representative climatic zones from Romania. An important conclusion of the research indicates that an emphasis must be placed on the thermotechnical design of Light Steel Framed solutions against increased thermal bridge areas caused by the steels high thermal conductivity for all building components to reach nZEB levels.

These consist of a reticular mesh coated or interwoven/knitted with inert materials. This study assesses the performance of two reticular polypropylene-containing hybrid meshes, TiMESH (coated with titanium) and DynaMesh (interwoven with polyvinylidene fluoride), in vitro, as well as their efficiency in adhesion prevention and tissue incorporation in an intraperitoneal model. METHODS The mesothelialization capacity of TiMESH and DynaMesh was evaluated in vitro and compared to that of Surgipro (reticular bare polypropylene) and Preclude (laminar expanded polytetrafluoroethylene). Mesh fragments were placed on the intact parietal peritoneum of New Zealand white rabbits (n = 24), and laparoscopy performed 7 days post-surgery. Fourteen days post-implantation, adhesions were evaluated and host tissue incorporation, macrophage response, collagen expression (immunohistochemistry/RT-PCR) and neoperitoneum formation assessed. Adhesions and omental tissue were also examined. RESULTS Mesh pores in reticular meshes were devoid of cells in the in vitro study. TiMESH, DynaMesh and Surgipro showed similar adhesion rates at 7/14 days and optimal tissue integration, with significant differences in comparison to Preclude. The greatest presence of macrophages was observed for TiMESH and was significant versus that for Preclude. Hybrid meshes revealed significantly higher collagen 1 mRNA expression in implants, with no differences in the levels of collagen 3. Omental samples from animals with a reticular mesh showed significantly greater collagen 1 mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS The reticular structure of a mesh limits the formation of a continuous mesothelial monolayer in vitro, regardless of its composition. The presence of titanium as a coating or polyvinylidene fluoride interwoven with polypropylene in a reticular structure did not prevent adhesions.

COVID-19 in humans is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that range from asymptomatic to mild or severe illness including death. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and is transmitted via the oralCnasal route through droplets and aerosols, or through contact with contaminated fomites. House flies are known to transmit bacterial, parasitic and viral diseases to humans and animals as mechanical vectors. Previous studies have shown that house flies can mechanically transmit coronaviruses, such as turkey coronavirus; however, the house flys role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has not yet been explored. The goal of this work was to investigate the potential of house flies to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, it was determined whether house flies can acquire SARS-CoV-2, harbor live virus and mechanically transmit the virus to naive substrates and surfaces. METHODS: Two independent studies were performed to address the study objectives. In the first study, house flies were tested for infectivity after exposure to SARS-CoV-2-spiked medium or milk. In the second study, environmental samples were tested for infectivity after contact with SARS-CoV-2-exposed flies. During both studies, samples were collected at various time points post-exposure and evaluated by SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR and virus isolation. RESULTS: All flies exposed to SARS-CoV-2-spiked media or milk substrates were positive for viral RNA at 4 h and 24 h post-exposure. Infectious virus was isolated only from the flies exposed to virus-spiked milk but not from those exposed to virus-spiked medium. Moreover, viral RNA was detected in environmental samples after contact with SARS-CoV-2 exposed flies, although no infectious virus was recovered from these samples. CONCLUSIONS: Under laboratory conditions, house flies acquired and harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 h post-exposure. In addition, house flies were able to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to the surrounding environment up to 24 h post-exposure. Further studies are warranted to determine if house fly transmission occurs naturally and the potential public health implications of such events.

On admission, computer tomography (CT) imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction was performed to examine the shapes of wound sinus tract and classify the wounds, and the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by CT imaging (hereinafter referred to as reference lengths) were recorded; the lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds were examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy and measured. The wounds with and without obviously curved sinus tract were classified into curve group and straight group respectively, and the deviation rates between the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy or hard endoscopy and the reference lengths (hereinafter referred to as deviation rates of lengths) in each group were calculated and compared. The differences between the deviation rates of lengths examined by soft endoscopy and hard endoscopy and the deviation rate of reference lengths (0) in each group were compared. Data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t test and Wilcoxon signed rank sum test. Results: CT imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction showed that there were 4 types of wound sinus tract, including tubular (36/46), lamellar (4/46), club-mallet (4/46), and irregular (2/46). Tubular wounds were further divided into type I (23/36), type L (4/36), and type Y (9/36). Wounds with type I tubular, lamellar, and club-mallet sinus tract were classified into linear group (31/46), while those with type Y tubular, type L tubular, and irregular sinus tract were classified into curve group (15/46). In linear group, the deviation rates of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy and soft endoscopy were 0. In curve group, the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by soft endoscopy was 0 (0, 0.58%), which was significantly lower than 41.18% (31.68%, 48.41%) examined by hard endoscopy, Z=-3.408, P<0.01; the deviation rate of lengths of chronic sinus tract wounds examined by hard endoscopy (4019)% was significantly higher than the deviation rate of reference lengths (t=8.343, P<0.01), while the deviation rate of the lengths of wound sinus tract examined by soft endoscopy was similar to the deviation rate of reference lengths (Z=-1.342, P>0.05).

The failure rate of extubation (4.1%), reintubation rate (0.8%), comfort (2.38  0.15 points), dry humidity score (1.07  0.21 points), antibiotic use (7.41  0.74 days), and hospital stay (8.66  1.02 days) in the experimental group were significantly lower than the corresponding indexes in the control group (11.7%, 5%, 4.25  0.26 minutes, 4.94  0.78 minutes, 19.29  1.7 days, and 27.49  2.22 days), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In the experimental group, within 48 hours after extubation, the respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), and HCO(3)(?) were significantly lower than those of the control group; and the values of transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)), and pH were significantly higher than the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the algorithm in this study is superior to the traditional Canny algorithm, and the high-flow oxygen therapy can reduce the failure rate of extubation, strengthen patient comfort, improve the degree of gas humidification, stabilize the respiratory function and circulatory system, and shorten the time of antibiotic use and hospital stay.","output":"Edge Detection Algorithm-Based Lung Ultrasound in Evaluation of Efficacy of High-Flow Oxygen Therapy on Critical Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author takes us on a very personal journey through his experience of a severe COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation and subsequent recovery, along with the sequelae.

Here, we explored the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period based on an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission inventory, in-situ air quality observations and a localized chemical transport modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially affected by the pandemic, with a higher reduction for NOx (75.9%, 125.3 Mg/day) compared to VOCs (53.1%, 52.9 Mg/day). Unexpectedly, our results show that the imbalanced emission abatement of NOx and VOCs from vehicles led to a significant rise of the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in urban areas, but only resulting in modest increases in secondary aerosols due to the inadequate precursors. However, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors, which is mainly responsible for Beijing haze during the lockdown period. Our results indicate that the winter haze in Beijing was insensitive to the local vehicular emissions reduction due to the complicated nonlinear response of the fine particle and air pollutant emissions. We suggest mitigation policies should focus on accelerating VOC and NH3 emissions reduction and synchronously controlling regional sources to release the benefits on local traffic emission control.","output":"Significant reduced traffic in Beijing failed to relieve haze pollution during the COVID-19 lockdown: implications for haze mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Emergency medicine residency program directors (PDs) in areas hit hardest by the initial U S COVID-19 pandemic surge faced novel and rapidly-evolving organizational, educational and resident wellness challenges Despite variations in residency size, hospital setting and patient population, PDs from 8 residencies in ?the epicenter? found uniformity in many of the lessons learned Here we present those lessons and suggestions for high-yield preparation for running a residency during a surge Of particular importance were frequent, transparent communication and stepwise staffing plans Illness of residents and other staff occurred early and were substantially reduced as PPE protocols tightened Wellness was compromised by anxiety and illness, with varying timelines New, rich educational opportunities emerged All programs declared ACGME Pandemic status but remained able to maintain some educational offerings Planning ahead for future surges can significantly reduce the real-time burden for residency leadership, which is particularly important as clinical demands on leadership may also increase with a surge","output":"Residency Leadership Lessons from the Epicenter of the COVID-19 Surge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cells play a fundamental role in the early control and clearance of many viral infections of the respiratory system. In SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, lymphopenia with drastically reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells correlates with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated disease severity and mortality. In this study, we characterized cellular and humoral immune responses induced in patients with mild, severe and critical COVID-19. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 37 patients with mild, severe and critical COVID-19 and 10 healthy individuals were analyzed by IFN ELISpot and multi-color flow cytometry upon stimulation with peptide pools covering complete immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 matrix, nucleocapsid and spike proteins. In addition SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, neutralization abilities and anaphylatoxin levels were evaluated by various commercially available ELISA platforms. Our data clearly demonstrates a significantly stronger induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes and higher IFN production in patients with mild compared to patients with severe or critical COVID-19. In all patients SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies with similar neutralizing activity were detected, but highest titers of total IgGs were observed in critical patients. Finally, elevated anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a levels were identified in severe and critical COVID-19 patients probably caused by aberrant immune complex formation due to elevated antibody titers in these patients. Crucially, we provide a full picture of cellular and humoral immune responses of COVID-19 patients and prove that robust polyfunctional CD8(+) T cell responses concomitant with low anaphylatoxin levels correlate with mild infections.

Increased drinking on the previous day was associated with increased next day negative affect, and the number of household occupants was associated with decreased negative affect. Preconsumption affect was not associated with subsequent drinking. These findings point to a complex relationship between alcohol consumption, social context, and negative affect.

Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with Covid-19 (PIMS-TS) is a new disease entity requiring paediatricians from District General Hospitals (DGHs) to seek advice from a number of specialists. During the first/second peak of the pandemic, patients with suspected PIMS-TS were transferred to AHCH under general paediatricians with subspecialist input.To optimise patient care, during the 3rd peak of the pandemic (January 2021) an efficient virtual multidisciplinary team (MDT) consisting of rheumatology, cardiology, infectious disease and general paediatrics, was created to facilitate discussion of potential PIMS-TS cases. The MDT aimed to coordinate management of patients requiring specialist input, reduce unnecessary transfers whilst ensuring appropriate case management and utilisation of resources.Daily (including weekends) virtual meetings were held to discuss all active referrals including the patients lead clinician, with the option of discussion on consecutive days until clinical improvement.ObjectivesTo analyse the cohort discussed at the MDT (January-March 2021), including demographics, outcomes, and need for transfer to AHCH.MethodsAn online referral form using Microsoft SharePoint was distributed to regional DGHs for completion prior to the MDT. Discussion was documented on a database and outcome uploaded to AHCH patient records. These records were reviewed for this study.Results35 patients were referred over the 6 week study period. 14 (44%) were female. 21 referrals came from DGHs (66%), the remainder were internal. Age range was 4 months to 17 years;9.3% <1year, 25% 2C5 years, 40.6% 6C11 years and 25% 12C17 years. At time of discussion, six had a positive covid-19 PCR test and 13 had a confirmed positive household/family contact. PIMS-TS was diagnosed in 7(20%) patients, three of whom were referred from DGHs. One required transfer to AHCH for inotropic support and one for echocardiogram. Two additional transfers to AHCH for surgical opinions were subsequently referred to the MDT. Of the remaining 25 patients (18 from DGHs), four were treated locally for Kawasakis disease. 19 of 21 (90.5%) DGH referrals to the MDT (majority without PIMS-TS) avoided unnecessary transfer to AHCH for assessment.ConclusionsThe daily virtual MDT allowed efficient discussion with exchange of expertise and a collaborative approach from several specialties for suspected PIMS-TS cases across the region. It also enabled continuity across multiple discussions about individual cases. It provided the opportunity to discuss differentials in a new disease entity, empower DGH clinicians to start early treatment of PIMS-TS and recruit where appropriate to the RECOVERY trial. Unnecessary transfers were avoided in 90.5% of external cases. General paediatricians are key valued team members as the spectrum of disease and possible differential is wide. This MDT approach promoted the role of the general paediatrician in caring for these patients. Early treatment with a lower threshold to react and escalate has improved patient care. The use of better IT infrastructure helped bridge the gap of care delivery by geography.

Personal Information Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale were used as data collection tools. RESULTS: Participants who attended the study were 56.9% of nurses and 43.1% of midwives. Approximately half of the nurses and midwives (48.8%) participating in our study contacted the patient with suspected COVID-19, and 29.8% provided care to the patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Nurses and midwives were scored 52.75  9.80 for State Anxiety, 44.87  7.92 for Trait Anxiety Inventory and 35.16  9.42 for Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. It has been determined that 54.5% of nurses and midwives have been making their lives worse since the outbreak started, 62.4% had difficulties in dealing with the uncertain situation in the outbreak, 42.6% wanted psychological support and 11.8% had alienated from their profession.

However, few studies have tested this messaging through experimental approaches. Furthermore, research on racial priming suggests that framing messages in terms of prioritization of one racial group over another could trigger resentment in the out\\\\group. As the vaccine roll\\\\out continues in the US, policymakers are looking for ways to increase vaccine confidence and uptake, particularly in more hesitant populations. Through a survey experiment, this study asks how popular representations of race\\\\ethnic disparities in Coronavirus cases and deaths impacts vaccine hesitancy in a racially diverse sample of New Yorkers. STUDY DESIGN: Using a survey experiment, respondents were randomized to receive a newspaper prime recommending minority prioritization for vaccination acknowledging historical racism versus a control article without a minority prioritization focus. Respondents were then asked a series of questions about their attitudes towards vaccines, racial justice and socio\\\\demographics. We compared responses of the experimental versus control condition overall and stratified by race\\\\ethnicity. POPULATION STUDIED: 1,353 New York State residents recruited through the survey firm Qualtrics between November 23\\\\December 8. Black and Hispanic respondents were oversampled producing a sample of 429 NH Whites; 443 NH Blacks and 481 Hispanics. Respondents were drawn from both Downstate (43%) from Upstate (57%). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We find no effects of the prime on respondents' intention to vaccinate against Coronavirus altogether and interacted with race\\\\ethnicity. We explore correlates of vaccine hesitancy and find that while African\\\\Americans are more vaccine hesitant than other race\\\\ethnic groups, identifying politically as an independent, being female and watching alternative news media are each stronger predictors of hesitancy. Qualitatively examining reasons for hesitancy or confidence, we find that conspiracy beliefs do not figure prominently in people's vaccine hesitancy, but rather more quotidian (and legitimate) concerns about the speed of the development process and generalized lack of trust in the political and scientific institutions producing the vaccine contributing to a desire to wait and see. These themes cut across race\\\\ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that strong hesitancy views may be relatively fixed and difficult to change at least with simple messaging campaigns among a segment of the population that holds longstanding deep\\\\seated skepticism towards established institutions (justified or not). Nor, do simple messaging campaigns animate racial resentment in out\\\\groups in a way that will influence their behavior. Rather, weaker hesitancy views may give way to willingness relative quickly as more people take the vaccine. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE: While vaccine hesitancy is considered to be a major barrier to widespread uptake of the Coronavirus vaccine, especially among African\\\\Americans, our results suggest that it is a relatively small portion of the population that is hesitant, but that more than messaging will be required to influence behavioral intentions to vaccinate.

So far, the disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and may cause unprecedented socio-economic impact. A viable alternative to mass surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting context/location awareness and data collection capabilities. In particular, technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures.

In 2001, cDNA cloning of dioxygenases acting on prolines and asparagine residues, which play essential roles in this process, was reported. HIF-prolyl hydroxylases (PHs) are molecules that constitute the core molecular mechanism of detecting a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen, or hypoxia, in the cells; they can be called oxygen sensors. In this review, I discuss the process of molecular cloning of HIF and HIF-PH, which explains hypoxia-induced EPO expression; the development of HIF-PH inhibitors that artificially or exogenously activate HIF by inhibiting HIF-PH; and the significance and implications of medical intervention using HIF-PH inhibitors.","output":"HIF- Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors and Their Implications for Biomedicine: A Comprehensive Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of apnoeas in previously healthy young infants with acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) and correlate their occurrence with isolated micro\\\\organisms, clinical findings, disease severity and outcome.

A well-designed healthcare system should not keep patients waiting too long for an appointment and consultation. However, in China, patients spend notable time waiting, and the actual time spent on diagnosis and treatment in the consulting room is comparatively less. METHODS: We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted module and name it XIAO YI. It could help outpatients automatically order imaging examinations or laboratory tests based on their chief complaints. Thus, outpatients could get examined or tested before they went to see the doctor. People who saw the doctor in the traditional way were allocated to the conventional group, and those who used XIAO YI were assigned to the AI-assisted group. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from August 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020. Propensity score matching was used to balance the confounding factor between the two groups. And waiting time was defined as the time from registration to preparation for laboratory tests or imaging examinations. The total cost included the registration fee, test fee, examination fee, and drug fee. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the differences in time and cost. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05 for two sides. RESULTS: Twelve thousand and three hundred forty-two visits were recruited, consisting of 6171 visits in the conventional group and 6171 visits in the AI-assisted group. The median waiting time was 0.38 (interquartile range: 0.20, 1.33) hours for the AI-assisted group compared with 1.97 (0.76, 3.48) hours for the conventional group (p < 0.05). The total cost was 335.97 (interquartile range: 244.80, 437.60) CNY (Chinese Yuan) for the AI-assisted group and 364.58 (249.70, 497.76) CNY for the conventional group (p < 0.05).

Our objective is to provide a framework of methodology for quantifying the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk of COVID-19 and other pandemics by leveraging different sets of parameters. METHODS: Three major categories of control measures on controlling importation risk were parameterized and modelled by the framework: 1) entry restrictions, 2) travel quarantine, and 3) domestic containment measures. Integrating the parameterized intensity of control measures, a modified SEIR model was developed to simulate the case importation and local epidemic under different scenarios of global epidemic dynamics. A web-based tool was also provided to enable interactive visualization of epidemic simulation. RESULTS: The simulated number of case importation and local spread modelled by the proposed framework of methods fitted well to the historical epidemic curve of China and Singapore. Based on the simulation results, the total numbers of infected cases when reducing 30% of visitor arrivals would be 884 (IQR 875-896) and 588 (IQR 583-595) times more than those when reducing 99% of visitor arrivals in mainland China and Singapore respectively, assuming actual time-varying Rt and travel quarantine policy. If the number of global daily new infections reached 100,000, 85%-91% of inbound travels should be reduced to keep the daily new infected number below 100 for a country with a similar travel volume as Singapore (daily 52,000 tourist arrivals in 2019). Whereas if the number was lower than 10,000, the daily new infected case would be less than 100 even with no entry restrictions. DISCUSSIONS: We proposed a framework that first estimated the intensity of travel restrictions and local containment measures for countries since the first overseas imported case. Our approach then quantified the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine using a modified SEIR model to simulate the potential epidemic spread under hypothetical intensities of these control measures. We also developed a web-based system that enables interactive simulation, which could serve as a valuable tool for health system administrators to assess policy effects on managing the importation risk. By leveraging different sets of parameters, it could adapt to any specific country and specific type of epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: This framework has provided a valuable tool to parameterize the intensity of control measures, simulate both the case importation and local epidemic, and quantify the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk.","output":"An integrated framework for modelling quantitative effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on importation risk of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is limited information on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection clustering within families with children. We aimed to study the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within families with children in Greece. We studied 23 family clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in respiratory specimens. The level of viral load was categorized as high, moderate, or low based on the cycle threshold values. There were 109 household members (66 adults and 43 children). The median attack rate per cluster was 60% (range: 33.4%-100%). An adult member with COVID-19 was the first case in 21 (91.3%) clusters. Transmission of infection occurred from an adult to a child in 19 clusters and/or from an adult to another adult in 12 clusters. There was no evidence of child-to-adult or child-to-child transmission. In total 68 household members (62.4%) tested positive. Children were more likely to have an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults (40% vs 10.5%; P = .021). In contrast, adults were more likely to develop a severe clinical course compared with children (8.8% vs 0%; P = .021). In addition, infected children were significantly more likely to have a low viral load while adults were more likely to have a moderate viral load (40.7% and 18.6% vs 13.8% and 51.7%, respectively; P = .016). In conclusion, while children become infected by SARS-CoV-2, they do not appear to transmit infection to others. Furthermore, children more frequently have an asymptomatic or mild course compared to adults.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examine which routine laboratory tests are associated with severe COVID-19 disease. CONTENT: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science were searched until March 22, 2020, for studies on COVID-19. Eligible studies were original articles reporting on laboratory tests and outcome of patients with COVID-19. Data were synthesized, and we conducted random-effects meta-analysis, and determined mean difference (MD) and standard mean difference at the biomarker level for disease severity. Risk of bias and applicability concerns were evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. SUMMARY: 45 studies were included, of which 21 publications were used for the meta-analysis. Studies were heterogeneous but had low risk of bias and applicability concern in terms of patient selection and reference standard. Severe disease was associated with higher white blood cell count (MD, 1.28 109/L), neutrophil count (MD, 1.49 109/L), C-reactive protein (MD, 49.2 mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (MD, 196 U/L), D-dimer (standardized MD, 0.58), and aspartate aminotransferase (MD, 8.5 U/L); all p < 0.001. Furthermore, low lymphocyte count (MD -0.32  109/L), platelet count (MD -22.4  109/L), and hemoglobin (MD, -4.1 g/L); all p < 0.001 were also associated with severe disease.

While some of those contaminants, such as lead and soot, are decreasing in the environment, thanks to international regulations, other novel contaminants emerge. Plastic pollution has been shown as a durable novel pollutant, and, since recently, smaller and smaller plastics particles have been identified in various environments (air, water and soil). Considerable research already exists measuring the plastics in the 5 mm to micrometre size range (microplastics). However, far less is known about the plastics debris that fragmented to the sub-micrometre size (nanoplastics). As these small particles are light, it is expected that they have already reached the most remote places on Earth, e.g. transported across the globe by air movement. In this work, we used a novel method based on Thermal Desorption - Proton Transfer Reaction - Mass Spectrometry (TD-PTR-MS) to detect and measure nanoplastics of different types in the water sampled from a Greenland firn core (T2015-A5) and a sea ice core from Antarctica. We identify polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and Tire wear nanoparticles in the 14 m deep Greenland firn core and PE, PP and PET in sea ice from Antarctica. Nanoplastics mass concentrations were on average 13.2 ng/mL for Greenland firn samples and 52.3 ng/mL for Antarctic sea ice.

Main objective was to determine efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in patients with COVID-19-related SARS. RESULTS: Even though we could not show a significant reduction of COVID-19 pneumonia patients requiring intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (primary endpoint), a trend to a lower mortality rate in critical ill patients receiving ruxolitinib was reported. Administered ruxolitinib dose had to be increased according to protocol in 32% of patients, without additional toxicity.

Inoculation of the neuroattenuated JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) into the CNS of susceptible mice results in an acute encephalomyelitis that evolves into a chronic demyelinating disease, modeling white matter pathology observed in the human demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: JHMV infection induced the rapid and sustained expression of transcripts specific for the ELR (+) chemokine ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2, as well as their binding receptor CXCR2, which was enriched within the spinal cord during chronic infection. Inhibiting CXCR2 signaling with neutralizing antiserum significantly (p<0.03) delayed clinical recovery. Moreover, CXCR2 neutralization was associated with an increase in the severity of demyelination that was independent of viral recrudescence or modulation of neuroinflammation. Rather, blocking CXCR2 was associated with increased numbers of apoptotic cells primarily within white matter tracts, suggesting that oligodendrocytes were affected. JHMV infection of enriched oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures revealed that apoptosis was associated with elevated expression of cleaved caspase 3 and muted Bcl-2 expression. Inclusion of CXCL1 within JHMV infected cultures restricted caspase 3 cleavage and increased Bcl-2 expression that was associated with a significant (p<0.001) decrease in apoptosis. CXCR2 deficient oligodendrocytes were refractory to CXCL1 mediated protection from JHMV C induced apoptosis, readily activating caspase 3 and down regulating Bcl-2. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for CXCR2 signaling in protecting oligodendrocyte lineage cells from apoptosis during inflammatory demyelination initiated by viral infection of the CNS.","output":"CXCR2 Signaling Protects Oligodendrocytes and Restricts Demyelination in a Mouse Model of Viral-Induced Demyelination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a global emergency, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The gold standard for its diagnosis is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, but considering the high number of infected people, the low availability of this diagnostic tool in some contexts, and the limitations of the test, other tools that aid in the identification of the disease are necessary. In this scenario, imaging exams such as chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) have played important roles. CXR is useful for assessing disease progression because it allows the detection of extensive consolidations, besides being a fast and cheap method. On the other hand, CT is more sensitive for detecting lung changes in the early stages of the disease and is also useful for assessing disease progression. Of note, ground-glass opacities are the main COVID-19-related CT findings. Positron emission tomography combined with CT can be used to evaluate chronic and substantial damage to the lungs and other organs; however, it is an expensive test. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been shown to be a promising technique in that context as well, being useful in the screening and monitoring of patients, disease classification, and management related to mechanical ventilation. Moreover, LUS is an inexpensive alternative available at the bedside. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging, although not usually requested, allows the detection of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological abnormalities associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, it is important to consider the challenges faced in the radiology field in the adoption of control measures to prevent infection and in the follow-up of post-COVID-19 patients.","output":"Highlighting COVID-19: What the imaging exams show about the disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leaf growth and photosynthetic characteristics of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas var.

One week after emergence, all leaves had similar area and water content. However, leaf fresh weight and dry weight were significantly higher in plants grown under SL+L-LED and SL + H-LED than under SL due to their thicker leaves reflected by the lower specific leaf area. Plants grown under SL had significantly lower concentrations of total chlorophyll (Chl) and total carotenoids (Car) but higher Chl a/b ratio than under SL + L-LED and SL + H-LED. However, all plants had similar Chl/Car ratios. Although midday F(v)/F(m) ratio was the lowest in leaves grown under SL+ H-LED followed by SL + L-LED and SL, predawn F(v)/F(m) ratios of all leaves were higher than 0.8. Increasing growth irradiance with supplemental LED resulted in higher electron transport rate and photochemical quenching but lower non-photochemical quenching compared to those of plants grown under SL. Measured under their respective growth irradiance in the greenhouse, attached leaves grown under SL + L-LED and SL+H-LED had significantly higher photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation rate and stomatal conductance than under SL.

In the spine category, mean cases per day in the prelockdown group were 3.13  2.63; in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 0.96  1.36 (P < 0.001). In the functional category, mean cases per day in the prelockdown group were 1.31  1.51, whereas in the postlockdown group, this dropped to 0.11  0.42 (P < 0.001). For cranial (P = 0.245), peripheral nerve (P = 0.16), pediatrics (P = 0.34), and endovascular (P = 0.48) cases, the volumes dropped but were not statistically significant decreases. CONCLUSION: The impact of this outbreak on operative training does appear to be significant based solely on statistics. Although the drop in case volumes during this time can be accounted for by the pandemic, it is important to understand that this is a multifactorial effect.

These EOs are present in many over- the- counter balms and oils. The effect of exposure to these EOs and occurrence of seizure is not systematically studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between essential oils and the first episode of seizure and breakthrough seizures in known epileptic patients. METHODS This was a multi-center prospective study, conducted in four hospitals over four years. Every person presenting with the first episode of seizure or breakthrough seizure was asked about exposure to EOs, mode of exposure, time to onset of a seizure in relationship to exposure, duration of seizure, type of seizure, and antiepileptic drug therapy. RESULTS During the four-year period there were 55 patients with essential oil-related seizure (EORS). 22(40 %) had essential oil-induced seizures (EOIS) and 33(60 %) had essential oil-provoked seizures (EOPS). The female: male ratio was 1:1.1, the age of the patients ranged from 8 months to 77 years. In the EOIS group, 95 % had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 5% had focal impaired awareness seizures. In the EOPS group, 42.4 % had focal impaired awareness seizures, 27.3 % generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 15 % focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, and 15 % focal aware motor seizures. EOs implicated were preparations containing eucalyptus and camphor. CONCLUSION Exposure to essential oils of eucalyptus and camphor is an under-recognized cause of the first and breakthrough seizure.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with healthcare utilization, out-of-pocket medical costs, and perceived health among middle-aged and older individuals in Singapore. METHOD: Utilizing data collected from a monthly panel survey, a difference-in-differences approach was used to characterize monthly changes of healthcare use and spending and estimate the probability of being diagnosed with a chronic condition and self-reported health status before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. SUBJECTS: Data were analyzed from 7569 nationally representative individuals from 2019 January and 2020 December. MEASURES: Healthcare utilization and healthcare spending by medical service categories as well as self-reported health status. RESULTS: Between January and April 2020 (the first peak period of COVID-19 in Singapore), doctor visits decreased by 30%, and out-of-pocket medical spending decreased by 23%, mostly driven by reductions in inpatient and outpatient care. As a result, the probability of any diagnosis of chronic conditions decreased by 19% in April 2020. The decreased healthcare utilization and spending recovered after lifting the national lockdown in June, 2020 and remained similar to the pre-pandemic level through the rest of 2020.

In order to achieve this goal, science educators need to explore students decisions and reasoning about vaccination. The aim of the study reported in the paper, therefore, is to explore eighth graders' reasoning about vaccination throughout a 4-week implementation of small group and plenary discussion of false claims about vaccinations. The implementation consisted of a five-phase procedure including teacher presentation of false claims and related evidence texts about vaccination, small group discussions, a plenary discussion, and finally, an introduction to valid scientific content about vaccination. The explanations of the representatives from each group during the plenary discussion were video-taped and analyzed by the researchers independently to examine student decisions on each claim. Another data source of this study included student interviews in which the researchers videotaped and analyzed eight interviewees responses. The findings revealed that including well-informed students in small group and plenary discussions may have a positive impact on other students reasoning. This result indicated the benefit of encouraging students to provide evidence about vaccines during small group and plenary discussions in terms of their reasoning. The implications of this study suggest the necessity of emphasizing on scientific knowledge as well as argumentation for further investigations of students reasoning on vaccination.

This survey aimed to investigate these current practices and if the COVID-19 pandemic has changed them. METHODS: This study was an open multinational electronic survey directed to physicians working in adult intensive care units (ICUs), which was performed in two steps: before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We analyzed 1768 questionnaires and 1539 (87%) were complete. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, we received 1476 questionnaires and 292 were submitted later. The following practices were observed before the pandemic: the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (61.5%), the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) (48.2%), the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) (76.6%), and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) (66.6%) were the most frequently tools used to assess pain, sedation level, and delirium, respectively; midazolam and fentanyl were the most frequently used drugs for inducing sedation and analgesia (84.8% and 78.3%, respectively), whereas haloperidol (68.8%) and atypical antipsychotics (69.4%) were the most prescribed drugs for delirium treatment; some physicians regularly prescribed drugs to induce sleep (19.1%) or ordered mechanical restraints as part of their routine (6.2%) for patients on mechanical ventilation; non-pharmacological strategies were frequently applied for pain, delirium, and sleep deprivation management. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the intensive care specialty was independently associated with best practices. Moreover, the mechanical ventilation rate was higher, patients received sedation more often (94% versus 86.1%, p < 0.001) and sedation goals were discussed more frequently in daily rounds. Morphine was the main drug used for analgesia (77.2%), and some sedative drugs, such as midazolam, propofol, ketamine and quetiapine, were used more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: Most sedation, analgesia and delirium practices were comparable before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specialists agree on the importance of early treatment to improve the prognosis of patients. We identified the international literature regarding untreated strokes main consequences in the context of the decrease in emergency care for ischemic stroke during the covid-19 outbreak. Methods: A Scoping Review was conducted following the PCC strategy (population, context, and concept) to identify the international literature regarding the decrease in stroke-emergency care and the main consequences of untreated stroke. The search was carried out in PubMed, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, Google, and Google Scholar, combining Mesh terms and Boolean terms. Results: N=1748 articles were retrieved, and n=53 were included for analysis. International data shows a decrease in emergency care (20% less), endovascular procedures (up to 32% less), and indications for thrombolysis (5.5% less). Fewer admissions for stroke (46% less) are temporally related to the pandemics onset and quarantines. Untreated stroke patients are more likely to present severe stroke, 13% more severe disability, 12% more functional dependence at 6-12 months (p&lt;0.001), higher rehabilitation costs and hospital length-of-stay (&gt;15% more), more cognitive disability (16.6% more likely for stroke recurrence (p=0,006)) and 4-6% more likely to die, compared to patients treated with thrombolysis (r-tPA).

Here, a simulation technique is shown that allows producing an optical model for any bending geometries of melt-spun polymer optical fibres. The developed model takes all relevant loss mechanisms into account, especially regarding the scattering losses at the interface of core and cladding as well as those of the cladding-air interface. The latter is caused by interfacial roughness for which experimental data have been obtained by atomic force microscopy measurements. To show the validity of the simulation, the model is compared to experimental results for several fibres and a variety of geometries. The variance between model and experimental data is low (S < 4.6%). The model not only contributes to improving the understanding of the optical properties of POFs, but it also has direct applicability to the design of photonic textile sensors for medicine, where the fibres are incorporated with small bending radii.","output":"Experimental determination and ray-tracing simulation of bending losses in melt-spun polymer optical fibres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The spike (S) of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on a host cell to trigger viral-cell membrane fusion and infection.

This qualitative study explored attitudes towards walking in older people with regard to habits, intensity, preferences and strategies for increasing walking behaviour. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 26 older adults who were either close to retirement or recently retired. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Three themes were identified from the data; 1) Engagement and perceived value of walking; was focused on the meaning of walking for the participant and the attributes they associate with their walking practice. 2) Integration and connectivity of walking; was focused on how participants integrate walking in their daily lives and whether walking can be practiced as a viable means of connectivity. 3) Strategies to increase walking; was focused on what factors motivate participants in their walking practice and what strategies they perceived to be beneficial to increase walking distance and intensity at an individual level. DISCUSSION: The views of walking in people of retirement age were represented within 3 key themes. The factors contained in these themes that may influence future walking practice are discussed with regard to future strategies to promote walking in the retirement life change.

METHODS: Twelve prepubertal boys (12.3  1.6 years), 14 untrained men (21.8  2.2 years) and 16 well-trained adult male endurance athletes (24.5  4.8 years) completed an incremental maximal run field test on a track. Immediately after exercise completion, heart rate recovery (HRR) was assessed in the supine position for 5 min. Heart rate variability was analyzed in the time domain, and log-transformed values of the root mean square of successive differences in heart beats (Ln RMSSD(30)) were calculated over consecutive 30 s windows. RESULTS: Prepubertal children and well-trained adult endurance athletes showed significantly faster HRR than untrained adults from 30 s post-exercise until the end of recovery (p < 0.05). Ln RMSSD(30) was significantly higher in prepubertal children and athletes than untrained adults over the post-exercise time interval 60C150 s (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed for HRR and Ln RMSSD(30) between prepubertal children and athletes. CONCLUSION: Prepubertal children and well-trained adult endurance athletes exhibited comparable and faster HRR and parasympathetic reactivation than untrained adults following maximal exercise. This indirectly suggests that oxidative profile may be preserved by exercise training during growth and maturation to offset the decline in post-exercise HRR, parasympathetic reactivation and aspects of metabolic health.","output":"Post-exercise heart rate recovery and parasympathetic reactivation are comparable between prepubertal boys and well-trained adult male endurance athletes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of COVID-19 lockdown measures and an outlook on return to normality are demanding societal changes.

RESULTS: The primary factor driving user response to screening hotlines (human or chatbot) is perceptions of the agents ability. When ability is the same, users view chatbots no differently or more positively than human agents. The primary factor driving perceptions of ability is the users trust in the hotline provider, with a slight negative bias against chatbots ability.

Pregnant Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with azithromycin (37.5 and 150 mg/kgd) from gestational day (GD) 9 to 18. After PAE, the bodyweight gain rates of pregnant mice and the birthweights of the offspring were decreased, and the liver morphology, development indexes and metabolic function were all altered in different degree in the PAE fetuses. Meanwhile, PAE decreased the fetal serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels and liver IGF1 signal pathway expression, accompanied by glucocorticoid receptor-CCAAT enhancer-binding protein  (GR-C/EBP) signal enhancement. Furthermore, azithromycin disturbed hepatocyte differentiation, maturation and metabolic function via upregulating GR-C/EBP signal and reducing the expression and secretion levels of IGF1 in HepG2 cells. These changes could be reversed by GR siRNA or exogenous IGF1. These results indicated that PAE could cause fetal liver developmental toxicity in mice, and one of the main mechanisms was that azithromycin activated the GR-C/EBP signal, inhibited the IGF1 signal pathway, and then disturbed the hepatic proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and glycose and lipid metabolism.","output":"GR-C/EBP-IGF1 axis mediated azithromycin-induced liver developmental toxicity in fetal mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE : Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered in Wuhan and spread rapidly across China and worldwide Characteristics of infected patients are needed to get insight into the full spectrum of the disease","output":"Characteristics of 1738 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The prone position is commonly used in certain surgical procedures and to improve oxygenation in mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The period of enforced closure of zoos due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 (and subsequent reopening later that year) allowed for the effect of visitor presence to be evaluated on several species of amphibian. Results have shown that amphibian visibility (i.e., likelihood to be on show in their enclosure) is potentially influenced by the presence of people, and therefore, enclosure layout, collection planning and amphibian husbandry should consider how to minimize any negative influences of the viewing public. ABSTRACT: Amphibians are an understudied group in the zoo-focussed literature. Whilst commonly housed in specialist exhibits and of real conservation value due to the global extinction crisis, amphibian welfare is not often investigated empirically in zoo settings. The limited research that is available suggests that enclosure design (structure, planting and naturalistic theming) has a positive impact on the time that amphibians will be on show to visitors. However, the categorisation of any visitor effect (i.e., influences of visitor presence on amphibian activity and time on display) is hard to find. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of zoological organisations in the UK for several months from March 2020, with gradual re-openings from the summer into autumn and winter. This event provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of the lack of visitors, the presence of essential zoo staff only, the wider return of organisational staff, and then the return of visitors over a prolonged period. This project at WWT Slimbridge Wetlands Centre assessed the number of individuals of six species of amphibiancommon toad (Bufo bufo), common frog (Rana temporaria), smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), pool frog (Pelophylax lessonae), golden mantella (Mantella aurantiaca) and golden poison dart frog (Phyllobates terribilis)visible to observers under different conditions. All amphibians were housed in a purpose-built indoor exhibit of individual enclosures and were recorded when visible (as a proportion of the total population of the enclosure) during closure, the return of extra centre staff and visitor periods. The results showed species-specific differences in visibility, with some species of amphibian being more likely to be on view when the presence of people at their enclosure was less likely or in smaller numbers. Such differences are likely related to the specific camouflage or anti-predation tactics in these focal species. Further study to quantify amphibian sensitivity to, and perception of, environmental change caused by public presence (e.g., light levels and sound) would be useful welfare-themed research extensions. Our results can help inform husbandry, collection planning and amphibian enclosure design to reduce any noticeable visitor effects, and provide a useful benchmark for further, more complex, welfare assessment measures.","output":"Bold Frogs or Shy Toads?

As a result, patients may require an increase in acute healthcare utilization to control potential complications. Qualifying patients can apply for patient assistance programs (PAPs) through various manufacturers to receive medications at little to no cost. Having consistent access to necessary medications can increase adherence and decrease acute care utilization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of PAP enrollment on healthcare utilization in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to compare the number of ED visits and hospitalizations before and after PAP enrollment. Secondary objectives were the estimated ED and hospitalization costs before and after PAP enrollment. METHODS: The retrospective, observational cohort study included patients of Piedmont Athens Regional Community Care Clinic who received medications for asthma or COPD through PAPs from January 2018 to March 2019. RESULTS: A total of 269 patients were screened, and 56 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 28 patients had at least one hospital encounter. Primary objective resulted in cumulative number of ED visits decreased from 54 to 7 (P < 0.001) and cumulative hospitalizations decreased from 13 to 0 (P < 0.001). Secondary objective showed patients with at least one hospital encounter had a median cost decrease from $4683 to $0 (P < 0.001).

Discharge d-dimer was defined as the last d-dimer within 15 days of discharge from hospital. Kaplan-Meier and cox regression analyses were performed to explore the association with mortality. Results: A total of 560 patients were included. Mean age was 5818 years. A total of 97 patients were managed in the intensive care unit, 424 were managed as inpatient, and 39 patients were managed in the emergency department. The median time between last d-dimer and discharge date was 0 [-2 to 0] days. The median discharge d-dimer was 840 [505-1580] ng/ml. At a median follow-up of 124 days, 100 patients died (90-day mortality of 5%). The 90-day mortality was 1% for tertile 1, 3% for tertile 2, and 12% for tertile 3 of last d-dimer, figure. Compared with tertile 1, patients in tertile 3 of discharge d-dimer had 10-fold higher mortality (age-adjusted HR 9.62 [2.11-43.92], P&lt;0.001).

A discharge d-dimer of 1717 ng/ml was determined to be the best threshold for mortality (sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 81%). Conclusions: Patients discharged with high D-Dimer are at increased risk of death.

Unfortunately, structural delays in vaccine design, development, manufacture, clinical testing and licensure processes remain significant obstacles to an effective national biodefense rapid response capability. This is particularly true for the very real threat of novel pathogens such as the avian-origin influenzas H7N9 and H5N1, and new coronaviruses such as hCoV-EMC. Conventional approaches to vaccine development, production, clinical testing and licensure are incompatible with the prompt deployment needed for an effective public health response.

The objective of this study was to describe the AAR and SimEx supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) globally in 2016C2019. METHODS: In 2016C2019, WHO supported 63 AAR and 117 SimEx, of which 42 (66.7%) AAR reports and 56 (47.9%) SimEx reports were available. We extracted key information from these reports and created two central databases for AAR and SimEx, respectively. We conducted descriptive analysis and linked the findings according to the 13 IHR (2005) core capacities. RESULTS: Among the 42 AAR and 56 SimEx available reports, AAR and SimEx were most commonly conducted in the WHO African Region (AAR: n = 32, 76.2%; SimEx: n = 32, 52.5%). The most common public health events reviewed or tested in AAR and SimEx, respectively, were epidemics and pandemics (AAR: n = 38, 90.5%; SimEx: n = 46, 82.1%). For AAR, 10 (76.9%) of the 13 IHR core capacities were reviewed at least once, with no AAR conducted for food safety, chemical events, and radiation emergencies, among the reports available. For SimEx, all 13 (100.0%) IHR capacities were tested at least once. For AAR, the most commonly reviewed IHR core capacities were health services provision (n = 41, 97.6%), risk communication (n = 39, 92.9%), national health emergency framework (n = 39, 92.9%), surveillance (n = 37, 88.1%) and laboratory (n = 35, 83.3%). For SimEx, the most commonly tested IHR core capacity were national health emergency framework (n = 56, 91.1%), followed by risk communication (n = 48, 85.7%), IHR coordination and national IHR focal point functions (n = 45, 80.4%), surveillance (n = 31, 55.4%), and health service provision (n = 29, 51.8%). For AAR, the median timeframe between the end of the event and AAR was 125 days (range = 25C399 days). CONCLUSIONS: WHO has recently published guidance for the planning, execution, and follow-up of AAR and SimEx. Through the guidance and the simplified reporting format provided, we hope to see more countries conduct AAR and SimEx and standardization in their methodology, practice, reporting and follow-up.

We studied the effects of corrosion inhibitors on chlorine decay and associated disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation by biofilms grown with simulated drinking water amended with silicate, phosphate, and the phosphate blends. Experiments were conducted with either intact biofilms or biofilm materials dispersed in solution during sonication (referred to as biomass). While there was no significant difference in chlorine decay among biomass from different biofilms, biomass from the phosphate blend biofilm showed the lowest trihalomethane (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) formation. The chlorine decay rate constants from the biofilm experiment were ranked as: phosphate blendsa?>a?phosphatea?a?groundwater (GW)a?>a?silicate. The kinetics of chlorine decay and formation of DBPs were successfully described by pseudo-first-order kinetics. These fitting parameters were used to predict the DBPs formation in a realistic premise plumbing system. The results showed that biofilm-derived THMs and HAAs increased with increasing chlorine concentration, while THMs and HAAs first increased and then stabilized to a maximum with increasing biofilm total organic carbon (TOC) concentration. In general, the biofilms grown with phosphate-based corrosion inhibitors resulted in smaller DBPs formation yield but larger bacterial release, which could potentially increase the risk of user exposure to opportunistic pathogens in drinking water. The silicate biofilms showed the largest yield coefficient of DBPs formation but had the least biomass and lower bacterial release.","output":"Chlorine decay and disinfection by-products formation during chlorination of biofilms formed with simulated drinking water containing corrosion inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Se describe el caso clnico de un adolescente de 18 a?os de edad con antecedentes patolgicos personales de hipertensin arterial crnica esencial y obesidad de grado II, que fue atendido en el Hospital Peditrico Provincial Jos Mart Prez de Sancti Spritus por presentar tos hmeda ocasional, fiebre y falta de aire Inicialmente se diagnostic neumona en la base del pulmn derecho, que luego evolucion a bronconeumona Durante su hospitalizacin se recibi el resultado de la prueba de reaccin en cadena de la polimerasa en tiempo real, que fue positivo en el coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Se logr estabilizar el cuadro clnico del paciente, el cual tuvo una evolucin favorable;se le dio el alta hospitalaria tras cumplir el periodo de vigilancia epidemiolgica ABSTRACT The case report of an 18 years teenager with a personal pathological history of chronic essencial hypertension and grade II obesity, who was assisted in Jos Mart Provincial Pediatric Hospital from Sancti Spiritus due to occasional humid cough, fever and lack of air Initially pneumonia was diagnosed at the base of the right lung, which became a bronchopneumonia later During his hospitalization, the result of the polymerase reaction test in real time was received, which was positive in the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 It was possible to stabilize the patient clinical pattern, which had a favorable clinical course;he was discharged after fulfilling the surveillance period","output":"Bronchopneumonia due to COVID-19 in a 18 years adolescent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prenatal maternal physiological changes may cause severe COVID-19 among pregnant women. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 mRNA) has been shown to be highly effective and it is recommended for individuals aged 16 years, including pregnant women, although the vaccine has not been tested on the latter. OBJECTIVE: To study the association between prenatal Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination, pregnancy course and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed, including all women who delivered between January and June 2021 at Soroka University Medical Center, the largest birth center in Israel. Excluded were women diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past, multiple gestations or unknown vaccination status. Pregnancy, delivery and newborn complications were compared between women who received 1 or 2-dose vaccines during pregnancy and unvaccinated women. Multivariable models were used to adjust for background characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,399 women participated in this study, 913 (20.8%) of which were vaccinated during pregnancy. All vaccinations occurred during second or third trimesters. As compared to the unvaccinated women, vaccinated women were older, more likely to conceive following fertility treatments, to have sufficient prenatal care, and of higher socioeconomic position. In both crude and multivariable analyses, no differences were found between the groups in pregnancy, delivery and newborn complications, including gestational age at delivery, incidence of small for gestational age and newborn respiratory complications.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: NMIBC patients in instillations with BCG (induction or maintenance) during 2019/2020 were included, establishing a COVID-19 group (with a diagnosis according to the national registry) and a control group (NO-COVID). The cumulative incidence (cases/total patients) and the case fatality rate (deaths/cases) were established, and compared with the national statistics for the same age group. T-test was used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: 175 patients were included. Eleven patients presented CIS (11/175, 6.3%), 84/175 (48.0%) Ta and 68/175 (38.9%) T1. Average number of instillations = 13.25  7.4. One hundred sixty-seven patients (95.4%) had complete induction.

New clinical findings of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are coming out every day, and one such mystery is the formation of mysterious blood clots in the various tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, which needs critical attention. To address this issue, we hypothesis that, high ACE2 expression in the endothelium of blood vessels facilitates the high-affinity binding of SARS-CoV-2 using spike protein, causing infection and internal injury inside the vascular wall of blood vessels. This viral associated injury may directly/indirectly initiate activation of coagulation and clotting cascades forming internal blood clots.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, many research works have emerged, studying different aspects of viral SARS-CoV-2 DNA concentrations (viral load) in wastewater and its potential as an early warning method. However, one of the questions that has remained unanswered is the quantitative relation between viral load and clinical indicators such as daily cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. Few studies have tried to couple viral load data with an epidemiological model to relate the number of infections in the community to the viral burden. This paper proposes a stochastic wastewater-based SEIR model to showcase the importance of viral load in the early detection and prediction of an outbreak in a community. We built three models based on whether or not they use the case count and viral load data and compared their simulations and forecasting quality. Our results demonstrate that a simple SEIR model based on viral load data can reliably predict the number of infections in the future.

Spatio-temporal disease mapping models, which allow dealing with highly disaggregated spatial and temporal units of analysis, are a priority in this sense.

Moreover, the use of spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context, facilitates estimating newly demanded epidemiological indicators, such as the instantaneous reproduction number (R_t), even for small areas. This, in turn, allows to adapt traditional disease mapping models to these new circumstancies and make their results more useful in this particular context. In this paper we propose a new spatio-temporal disease mapping model, particularly suited to Covid-19 surveillance. As an additional result, we derive instantaneous reproduction number estimates for small areas, enabling monitoring this parameter with a high spatial disaggregation. We illustrate the use of our proposal with the separate study of the disease pandemics in two Spanish regions.

Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a viral cytokine that is similar to but distinct from interleukin 17A (IL-17A) as it induces stronger and broader human IL-17 receptor (hIL-17R) signaling than IL-17A. ORF8 primarily targeted blood monocytes and induced the heterodimerization of hIL-17RA and hIL-17RC, triggering a robust inflammatory response. Transcriptome analysis revealed that besides its activation of the hIL-17R pathway, ORF8 upregulated gene expression for fibrosis signaling and coagulation dysregulation. A naturally occurring ORF8 L84S variant that was highly associated with mild COVID-19 showed reduced hIL-17RA binding and attenuated inflammatory responses.

Drawing on dialogic theory by integrating both speak from power and speak to power measurements, the article aims to propose a systematic framework to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The impact of social media on risk communication is measured by the correlation between speak from power and speak to power levels, where the former primarily spoke to two facets of the risk communication process C rapidness and attentiveness, and the latter was benchmarked against popularity and commitment. The framework was empirically validated with data relating to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) risk communication in 25,024 selected posts on 17 official provincial Weibo accounts in China. Findings: The analysis results suggest the relationship between the speak from power and speak to power is mixed rather than causality, which confirms that neither the outcome-centric nor the process-centric method alone can render a full picture of governmentCpublic interconnectivity. Besides, the proposed interconnectivity matrix reveals that two provinces have evidenced the formation of governmentCpublic mutuality, which provides empirical evidence that dialogic relationships could exist in social media during risk communication.

PptH is the first structurally characterized enzyme of the phosphopantetheinyl hydrolase family. However, conditions for optimal activity of PptH have not been defined, and only one substrate has been identified. Here, we provide biochemical characterization of PptH and demonstrate that the enzyme hydrolyzes Ppt in vitro from more than one M. tuberculosis holo-CP as well as holo-CPs from other organisms. PptH provided the only detectable activity in mycobacterial lysates that dephosphopantetheinylated acyl carrier protein M (AcpM), suggesting that PptH is the main Ppt hydrolase in M. tuberculosis. We could not detect a role for PptH in coenzyme A (CoA) salvage, and PptH was not required for virulence of M. tuberculosis during infection of mice. It remains to be determined why mycobacteria conserve a broadly acting phosphohydrolase that removes the Ppt prosthetic group from essential CPs. We speculate that the enzyme is critical for aspects of the life cycle of M. tuberculosis that are not routinely modeled. IMPORTANCE Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was the leading cause of death from an infectious disease before COVID, yet the in vivo essentiality and function of many of the protein-encoding genes expressed by M. tuberculosis are not known. We biochemically characterize M. tuberculosis's phosphopantetheinyl hydrolase, PptH, a protein unique to mycobacteria that removes an essential posttranslational modification on proteins involved in synthesis of lipids important for the bacterium's cell wall and virulence.

The aim of this study is to ascertain the genetic diversity among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Initial examination of the phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=3123) from different continents deposited at GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) revealed multiple origin for Indian isolates. An in-depth analysis of 449 viral genomes derived from samples representing countries from USA, Europe, China, East Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East regions and India revealed that most Indian samples are divided into two clusters (A and B) with cluster A showing more similarity to samples from Oceania and Kuwait and the cluster B grouping with countries from Europe, Middle East and South Asia. Diversity analysis of viral clades, which are characterized by specific non-synonymous mutations in viral proteins, discovered that the cluster A Indian samples belong to I clade (V378I in ORF1ab), which is an Oceania clade with samples having Iran connections and the cluster B Indian samples belong to G clade (D614G in Spike protein), which is an European clade.

This study aimed to identify causes of delay in interfacility transport by air ambulance in Ontario. METHODS Causes of delay were identified by manual review of electronic patient care records (ePCRs). All emergent interfacility transfers conducted by Ornge, the sole provider of air-based medical transport in Ontario, between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 were included. The ePCRs were reviewed if they met one or more of the following: (1) contained a standardized delay code; (2) contained free text including \\"delay\\", \\"wait\\", or \\"duty-out\\"; (3) were above the 75th percentile in total transport time; or (4) were above the 90th percentile in time to bedside, time at the sending hospital, or time to receiving facility. RESULTS Our search strategy identified 1,220 ePCRs for manual review, which identified a total of 872 delays. Common delays cited included aircraft refueling (234 delays), waiting for land emergency medical service (EMS) escort (146), and staffing- or dispatch-related issues (124).

As the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that the interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus (DM) are complex pathophysiological mechanisms. The outcome of COVID-19 is more severe in people with DM, which has the potential to accelerate the onset of acute metabolic complications of DM such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. These mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear, but they likely include the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2, a binding site for SARS-CoV-2, which is expressed in key metabolic organs such as in the pancreas, in particular in -cells. The potential -cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 can damage cells and impair insulin secretion, causing hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Understanding the bidirectional interaction between DM and COVID-19 will be critical to protecting and treating people with DM. Current epidemiological data on COVID-19 do not support the hypothesis that diabetic patients are at increased risk of infection compared to the general population. To date, it has been established that decompensated DM is an independent factor that aggravates the course of coronavirus infection and significantly increases the risk of a fatal outcome of the disease. The review provides a brief summary of the evolution of pathogenetic and clinical aspects for understanding the mechanisms of this pathological tandem, as well as therapeutic strategies for treating patients with COVID-19 and DM. As the incidence of DM continues to rise globally, more than ever, diabetes prevention and control must be a priority for health systems around the world.","output":"Diabetes mellitus in combination with covid-19: Modern views on therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID 19 is a contagious viral disease caused via SARS CoV 2 appeared at Wuhan,the chinese city, which has spread worldwide SARSCoV-2 has been shown to be relatively associated with bat {SARS-like} viruses, and therefore bats may be a potential reservoir of infection origin and transmission for humans is unknown, but rapid transmission from humans to humans has been confirmed widely O glycosylation plays a major role in causing coronavirus infection, which creates an antigenic structure,virus can not survive outside its host and by default uses cells of the host Host cell adhesion to the virus occurs mainly independently of blood type ABO via a genetically unspecified evolutionary structure, and appears to act as a pathogen host pathway functional for many contagious diseases however, while susceptibility and severity depend on several factors such as individuals of A blood type who unable to respond to acquired or inherent antibodies for synthesize hybrid ((A-like)) formations due to the selection of clonal and plasma protein adaptation Thus individuals with a blood group A will be a preferred target of the virus that uses glycotransferase to phenotype, and leads to more hybrid correlation of the blood type A-allelic type of hybrid while associated O individuals with the lowest risk to be infected ? 2020, Advanced Scientific Research All rights reserved","output":"Susceptibility of abo system for infection of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In de vorige eeuw heerste gedurende een korte periode de optimistische opinie dat infectieziekten dankzij vaccinatie en antibiotica overwonnen waren.

In order to re-open parts of society, policy-makers need to consider how combinations of measures will affect transmission and understand the trade-offs between them. We use age-specific social contact data, together with epidemiological data, to quantify the components of the COVID-19 reproduction number. We estimate the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number by turning contacts on and off based on context and age. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a background of wider social distancing measures. We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data can be used to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). We find that following lockdown (when R = 0.7, 95% CI 0.6, 0.8), opening primary schools has a modest impact on transmission (R = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.97) as long as other social interactions are not increased. Opening secondary and primary schools is predicted to have a larger impact (R = 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.53). Contact tracing and COVID security can be used to mitigate the impact of increased social mixing to some extent; however, social distancing measures are still required to control transmission. Our approach has been widely used by policy-makers to project the impact of social distancing measures and assess the trade-offs between them. Effective social distancing, contact tracing and COVID security are required if all age groups are to return to school while controlling transmission.

Among the various methods for indoor localisation, received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based fingerprinting attracts massive attention. However, the RSSI fingerprinting method is susceptible to lower accuracies because of the disturbance triggered by various factors from the indoors that influence the link quality of radio signals. Localisation using body-mounted wearable devices introduces an additional source of error when calculating the RSSI, leading to the deterioration of localisation performance. The broad aim of this study is to mitigate the users body shadowing effect on RSSI to improve localisation accuracy. Firstly, this study examines the effect of the users body on RSSI. Then, an angle estimation method is proposed by leveraging the concept of landmark. For precise identification of landmarks, an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-aided decision tree-based motion mode classifier is implemented. After that, a compensation model is proposed to correct the RSSI. Finally, the unknown location is estimated using the nearest neighbour method. Results demonstrated that the proposed system can significantly improve the localisation accuracy, where a median localisation accuracy of 1.46 m is achieved after compensating the body effect, which is 2.68 m before the compensation using the classical K-nearest neighbour method. Moreover, the proposed system noticeably outperformed others when comparing its performance with two other related works. The median accuracy is further improved to 0.74 m by applying a proposed weighted K-nearest neighbour algorithm.","output":"Landmark-Assisted Compensation of Users Body Shadowing on RSSI for Improved Indoor Localisation with Chest-Mounted Wearable Device"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered family life, but whether family exposures to and worries about the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted child conduct problems (CP) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits is unknown.

Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates.

Currently, there are no effective therapies against smallpox and new treatment strategies are greatly needed. METHODS In this study, specifically designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), targeting five proteins essential for orthopoxvirus replication, were investigated for their ability to inhibit vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACVWR) replication. RESULTS Among these siRNAs, 100 nM siD5R-2, an siRNA targeting the D5 protein, decreased VACVWR replication up to 90% when used either prophylactically or therapeutically in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. This siRNA induced a striking concentration-dependent inhibition of VACVWR replication and a prolonged prophylactic antiviral effect that lasted for 72 h, at a concentration of 100 nM. Confocal microscopy of Alexa-siD5R-2-treated VACVWR-infected cells confirmed a decrease in viral replication. Furthermore, siD5R-2 was shown to specifically reduce the D5R mRNA and protein expression using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting analysis, without inducing interferon-13 in A549 cells. We also demonstrated the antiviral potency of siD5R-2 against different pathogenic orthopoxviruses, such as cowpox and monkeypox viruses, which were inhibited up to 70% at the lowest concentration (1 nM) tested. Finally, siD5R-2 showed antiviral effects in VACVWR-infected human keratinocyte and fibroblast cell cultures.

Several policy options are available to reduce this delay, all of which involve incentives or subsidies to invest in production facilities. We review existing approaches, then propose a novel alternative using option-based guarantees in which the government commits to paying a proportion of the manufacturers preparation costs should the product turn out not to be viable. Counterintuitively, this payment for failure is appropriate because in the case of success, a company makes a profit from the product itself, and does not need additional money from the government.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the risk factors and outcome of sepsis in traumatic patients and to investigate the performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) compared with standard microbiological diagnostics in post-traumatic sepsis. METHODS: The study included 528 patients with multiple traumas among which there were 142 cases with post-traumatic sepsis. Patients' demographic and clinical data were recorded. The outcome measures included mortality during the emergency intensive care unit (EICU), EICU length of stay (LOS), all-cause 28-day mortality, and total ventilator days in 28 days after admission. A total of 89 blood samples from 89 septic patients underwent standard microbiological blood cultures and 89 samples of peripheral blood (n = 21), wound secretion (n = 41), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (19), ascites (n = 5), and sputum (n = 3) underwent mNGS. Pathogen detection was compared between standard microbiological blood cultures and mNGS. RESULTS: The sepsis group and non-sepsis group exhibited significant differences regarding shock on admission, blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, body temperature, heart rate, WBC count, neutrophil count, hematocrit, urea nitrogen, creatinine, CRP, D-D dimer, PCT, scores of APACHE II, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), and Injury Severity Score (ISS) on admission to the EICU, and Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndromes (MODS) (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that scores of APACHE II, SOFA, and ISS on admission, and MODS were independent risk factors for the occurrence of sepsis in patients with multiple traumas. The 28-day mortality was higher in the sepsis group than in the non-sepsis group (45.07% vs. 19.17%, P < 0.001). The mortality during the EICU was higher in the sepsis group than in the non-sepsis group (P=0.002). The LOS in the EICU in the sepsis group was increased compared with the non-sepsis group (P=0.004). The total ventilator days in 28 days after admission in the sepsis group was increased compared with the non-sepsis group (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that septic shock, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score, and MODS were independent risk factors of death for patients with post-traumatic sepsis. The positive detection rate of mNGS was 91.01% (81/89), which was significantly higher than that of standard microbiological blood cultures (39.33% (35/89)). Standard microbiological blood cultures and mNGS methods demonstrated double positive results in 33 (37.08%) specimens and double-negative results in 8 (8.99%) specimens, while 46 (51.69%) samples and 2 (2.25%) samples had positive results only with mNGS or culture alone, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies risk factors for the incidence and death of sepsis in traumatic patients and shows that mNGS may serve as a better diagnostic tool for the identification of pathogens in post-traumatic sepsis than standard microbiological blood cultures.","output":"Risk Factors and Outcome of Sepsis in Traumatic Patients and Pathogen Detection Using Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Digital applications, or DiGA in German, come with the promise of cost-effective interventions to improve patient care.

The characteristic benefit of nanocrystals lies in their ability to boost the bioavailability of such drugs by enhancing their saturation solubility and dissolution velocity. Nanocrystals can be prepared by either bottom-up or top-down approach. The latter is often preferred due to the feasibility of scale-up and economical nature. Hence the emphasis on these methods.Methods: Stable RIF nanocrystals were developed and optimized using media milling and microfluidizer method by incorporating a suitable surfactant/stabilizer. The developed nanocrystals were evaluated for their saturation solubility, in vitro dissolution, solid-state characteristics, morphology, intrinsic dissolution rate, and short-term physical stability.Results: Both the methods were found to be equally efficient in terms of development of stable RIF nanocrystals, while in terms of processing time and efficacy, microfluidization was found to be advantageous. Amorphization and polymorphic conversion were evident based on the results of solid-state characterization. Furthermore, both formulations exhibited an enhanced solubility and faster dissolution velocity.Conclusions: Based on the characterization outcomes, it can be concluded that both the top-down technologies could be successfully applied to develop nanocrystals of poorly water-soluble drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to great demand and shortage, blood sessions in outpatient facilities were organized during the high prevalence period of COVID-19, alongside a national plan to monitor the evolving public health situation by random molecular screening of high-risk groups of the population. Haemovigilance protocols were implemented as well as surveillance for any COVID-19 case reported post-transfusion. A 14-day quarantine and follow-up molecular and antibody testing of any COVID-19 positive case was obligatory. RESULTS: Post-donation, post-transfusion information and molecular testing of swab samples collected from three asymptomatic donors at risk for COVID-19, revealed the case of an immunosupressed patient who had been transfused with whole blood derived platelets from a donor subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The recipient exhibited no symptoms of the disease. Molecular and antibody testing results were negative. CONCLUSION: Haemovigilance provided information supporting the absence of transfusion transmission of COVID-19, thus strengthening the hypothesis that, even if it cannot yet be definitively ruled out, COVID-19 is not transmitted through blood transfusion.

Similar experiments performed with hen's egg IgY preparations showed that IgY+ and Y samples showed higher cytokine-inducing activity than samples additionally purified with the use of size exclusion chromatography (IgY?). The IgY+ at a dose of 100 g was even more active than the positive lipopolysaccharide control. It was also found that Y is able to stimulate macrophage cell line J774.2 to release nitric oxide. The results obtained suggest that IgY, the main chicken immunoglobulin fraction, is accompanied by additional polypeptides and plays a role of a transporter of biologically active substances, which was observed in the case of colostral IgG.","output":"Immunomodulatory activity accompanying chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin Y"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When providing sleep medical services special aspects must be taken into account in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. Despite all prevention, due to the high number of unrecognized cases, SARS-CoV2 contacts in the sleep laboratory must be expected and appropriate precautions are necessary. Nevertheless, the continuation or resumption of sleep medical services under the appropriate hygiene measures is strongly recommended to avoid medical and psychosocial complications. There is no evidence for a deterioration of COVID-19 through CPAP therapy. In principle, the application of positive pressure therapy via various mask systems can be accompanied by the formation of infectious aerosols. In the case of confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2, a pre-existing PAP therapy should be continued in an outpatient setting in accordance with the local guidelines for home isolation, since discontinuation of PAP therapy is associated with additional cardiopulmonary complications due to the untreated sleep-related breathing disorder. According to the current state of knowledge inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF), and PAP therapy can be carried out without increased risk of infection for health care workers (HCW) as long as appropriate personal protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) is being used.This position paper of the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP) and the German Society for Sleep Medicine (DGSM) offers detailed recommendations for the implementation of sleep medicine diagnostics and therapy in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.","output":"Diagnostik und Therapie schlafbezogener Atmungsst?rungen im Zusammenhang mit der Corona-Pandemie: Deutsche Gesellschaft fr Pneumologie und Beatmungsmedizin e.a?V.

An open call for papers was then issued, and attracted five submissions, all of which have been accepted by our reviewers, who produced three careful reports on each of the contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will help further promoting the development of theorem-proving-based software, and that it will collaborate to improve the mutual understanding between computer mathematicians and stakeholders in education. With some luck, we would actually expect that the very special circumstances set up by the worst sanitary crisis in a century will happen to reinforce the need for the application of certified components and of verification methods for the production of educational software that would be available even when the traditional on-site learning experiences turn out not to be recommendable.","output":"Proceedings 9th International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine whether specific asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides present in cell surface glycoproteins are required for cell-cell interactions within the peripheral nervous system, we have used castanospermine to inhibit maturation of N-linked sugars in cell cultures of neurons or neurons plus Schwann cells. Maximally 10-15% of the N-linked oligosaccharides on neuronal proteins have normal structure when cells are cultured in the presence of 250 micrograms/ml castanospermine; the remaining oligosaccharides are present as immature carbohydrate chains not normally found in these glycoproteins. Although cultures were treated for 2 wk with castanospermine, cells always remained viable and appeared healthy. We have analyzed several biological responses of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons, with or without added purified populations of Schwann cells, in the presence of castanospermine. We have observed that a normal complement of mature, N- linked sugars are not required for neurite outgrowth, neuron-Schwann cell adhesion, neuron-induced Schwann cell proliferation, or ensheathment of neurites by Schwann cells. Treatment of neuronal cultures with castanospermine increases the propensity of neurites to fasciculate. Extracellular matrix deposition by Schwann cells and myelination of neurons by Schwann cells are greatly diminished in the presence of castanospermine as assayed by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, suggesting that specific N-linked oligosaccharides are required for the expression of these cellular functions.","output":"Specific asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are not required for certain neuron-neuron and neuron-Schwann cell interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on the problematization of the impact of the pandemic in music making, solutions were sought that were not only viable as an artistic result but that could also be projected in a purposeful and prospective way in times of humanitarian crisis, of dismal symmetry between capitalist neoliberalism and programmed neglect in public health policies.

Our synthesis highlights significant shortfalls of applying command-and-control tactics in emergencies. For one, heavy-handed bans risk enormous unintended consequences and tend to fail if they lack legitimacy or clash with people's values.

Leisure can be a powerful context for positive youth development, but it can also be a context for youth engagement in risk behaviours. Therefore, the research question is: How does participation in structured leisure time activities influence risk sexual behaviour from the perspective of Croatian high school students? The sample consists of a total population of high school students from one county in Croatia (2,977 students, from 9 high schools). The age of the participants ranged from 14 to 20 years (51% female). The following questionnaires were used: (1) Adolescent Leisure Time Questionnaire; (2) Youth Experience Survey; (3) Risk Sexual Behaviour of Adolescents Questionnaire. Preliminary data show that 57% of adolescents currently participate in structured leisure activities. Before the pandemic COVID 19, 23% of adolescents participated in structured leisure activities twice a week, while during the pandemic COVID 19, only 15% did. Moreover, 35% of adolescents did not participate in structured leisure activities during the pandemic because they were anxious. Regarding risk sexual behaviours, 29% of adolescents had sexual intercourse, and of those 16% reported having experienced it before the age of 14. Unprotected sexual intercourse in the past 6 months under the influence of alcohol was reported by 15%, and under the influence of cannabis by 6% of adolescents. In presenting this work, the influence of structured leisure time activities on adolescents' risk sexual behaviour will be emphasized. The broader perspective and understanding of adolescents' leisure time and how it influences adolescent's behaviour and/or developmental outcomes is important for planning evidence-based strategies and interventions in the field of prevention science. KEY MESSAGES: The findings of this study can be an important resource for evidence-based intervention planning aimed at promoting positive youth development/prevention of youth risk behaviours.

OBJECTIVE: Describe the COVID-19 pandemic experiences of and effects on individuals participating in the HERO registry. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered registry enrollment survey conducted from April 10 to July 31, 2020. SETTING: Participants worked in hospitals (74.4%), outpatient clinics (7.4%), and other settings (18.2%) located throughout the nation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,600 healthcare workers. MAIN MEASURES: COVID-19 exposure, viral and antibody testing, diagnosis of COVID-19, job burnout, and physical and emotional distress. KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 42.0 years, 76.4% were female, 78.9% were White, 33.2% were nurses, 18.4% were physicians, and 30.3% worked in settings at high risk for COVID-19 exposure (e.g., ICUs, EDs, COVID-19 units). Overall, 43.7% reported a COVID-19 exposure and 91.3% were exposed at work. Just 3.8% in both high- and low-risk settings experienced COVID-19 illness. In regression analyses controlling for demographics, professional role, and work setting, the risk of COVID-19 illness was higher for Black/African-Americans (aOR 2.32, 99% CI 1.45, 3.70, p < 0.01) and Hispanic/Latinos (aOR 2.19, 99% CI 1.55, 3.08, p < 0.01) compared with Whites. Overall, 41% responded that they were experiencing job burnout. Responding about the day before they completed the survey, 53% of participants reported feeling tired a lot of the day, 51% stress, 41% trouble sleeping, 38% worry, 21% sadness, 19% physical pain, and 15% anger. On average, healthcare workers reported experiencing 2.4 of these 7 distress feelings a lot of the day.

However, understanding the molecular biology and the role of the endothelium in different pathological conditions remains insufficient. The purpose of the study was to characterize and analyze the molecular aspect of harvested ECs using cell culture and transcriptomic techniques in an MT swine model relevant to clinical ischemic stroke. METHODS In swine, preformed thrombi were injected into the external carotid and subclavian arteries to occlude their branches. MT was performed according to clinical routine. The stent retriever device and thrombus were treated with cell dissociation buffer. The resulting cell suspension was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and was cultured. Cultured cells were analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) after fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS A total number of 37 samples were obtained containing CD31-positive cells. Cell culture was successful in 90% of samples, and the cells expressed multiple typical EC protein markers. Eighty-nine percent of the sorted cells yielded high-quality transcriptomes, and single-cell transcriptomes from cultured cells showed that they expressed typical endothelial gene patterns. Gene expression analysis of ECs from an occluded artery did not show distinctive clustering into subtypes.

However, prolonged exposure to hyperoxia compromises the ability of the macrophage to phagocytose and clear bacteria. Previously, we showed that the exposure of mice to hyperoxia elicits the release of the nuclear protein high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) into the airways. Extracellular HMGB1 impairs macrophage phagocytosis and increases the mortality of mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The aim of this study was to determine whether GTS-21 [3-(2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine dihydrochloride], an 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) agonist, could inhibit hyperoxia-induced HMGB1 release into the airways, enhance macrophage function and improve bacterial clearance from the lungs in a mouse model of ventilator-associated pneumonia. GTS-21 (0.04, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg) or saline was systemically administered via intraperitoneal injection to mice that were exposed to hyperoxia (99% O2) and subsequently challenged with PA. We found that systemic administration of 4 mg/kg GTS-21 significantly increased bacterial clearance, decreased acute lung injury and decreased accumulation of airway HMGB1. To investigate the cellular mechanism of these observations, RAW 264.7 cells, a macrophagelike cell line, were incubated with different concentrations of GTS-21 in the presence of 95% O2. The phagocytic activity of macrophages was significantly increased by GTS-21 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, hyperoxia-induced hyperacetylation of HMGB1 was significantly reduced in macrophages incubated with GTS-21. Furthermore, GTS-21 significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic translocation and release of HMGB1 from these macrophages. Our results indicate that GTS-21 is effective in improving bacterial clearance and reducing acute lung injury by enhancing macrophage function via inhibiting the release of nuclear HMGB1. Therefore, the 7nAChR represents a possible pharmacological target to improve the clinical outcome of patients on ventilators by augmenting host defense against bacterial infections.","output":"The 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist GTS-21 improves bacterial clearance in mice by restoring hyperoxia-compromised macrophage function."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite significant investment, mental health issues remain a leading cause of death among young people globally. Sophisticated decision analysis methods are needed to better understand the dynamic and multisector drivers of youth mental health. System modeling can help explore complex issues such as youth mental health and inform strategies to effectively respond to local needs and achieve lasting improvements. The advantages of engaging stakeholders in model development processes have long been recognized; however, the methods for doing so are often not well-described. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to describe the participatory procedures that will be used to support systems modeling for national multisite implementation. The Right Care, First Time, Where You Live research program will focus on regional youth mental health applications of systems modeling in 8 different sites across Australia. METHODS: The participatory model development approach involves an iterative process of engaging with a range of participants, including people with lived experience of mental health issues. Their knowledge of the local systems, pathways, and drivers is combined with the academic literature and data to populate the models and validate their structure. The process centers around 3 workshops where participants interact and actively engage in group model-building activities to define, refine, and validate the systems models. This paper provides a detailed blueprint for the implementation of this process for mental health applications. RESULTS: The participatory modeling methods described in this paper will be implemented at 2 sites per year from 2022 to 2025. The 8 selected sites have been chosen to capture variations in important factors, including determinants of mental health issues and access to services. Site engagement commenced in August 2021, and the first modeling workshops are scheduled to commence in February 2022. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health system decision makers require tools to help navigate complex environments and leverage interdisciplinary problem-solving. Systems modeling can mobilize data from diverse sources to explore a range of scenarios, including the impact of interventions in different combinations and contexts. Involving stakeholders in the model development process ensures that the model findings are context-relevant and fit-for-purpose to inform decision-making.

While excess postpartum weight retention exacerbates T2DM risk, lifestyle changes and behavior modifications can promote healthy postpartum weight loss and contribute to T2DM prevention efforts. However, some women have difficulty prioritizing self-care during this life stage. Efficacious interventions that women can balance with motherhood to reduce T2DM risk remain a goal. The objective of the Moms in Motion study is to evaluate the efficacy of a simple, novel, activity-boosting intervention using ankle weights worn with daily activities during a 6-month postpartum intervention among women with GDM. We hypothesize that women randomized to the 6-month intensity-modifying intervention will (1) demonstrate greater weight loss and (2) greater improvement in body composition and biomarker profile versus controls. METHODS: This study will be a parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 160). Women will be allocated 1:1 to an ankle weight intervention group or a standard-of-care control group. The intervention uses ankle weights (1.1 kg) worn on each ankle during routine daily activities (e.g., cleaning, childcare). Primary outcomes include pre- and post-assessments of weight from Visit 2 to Visit 3. Secondary outcomes include body composition, glycemia (2-h, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test), and fasting insulin. Exploratory outcomes include energy expenditure, diet, and psychosocial well-being. DISCUSSION: Beyond the expected significance of this study in its direct health impacts from weight loss, it will contribute to exploring (1) the mechanism(s) by which the intervention is successful (mediating effects of energy expenditure and diet on weight loss) and (2) the effects of the intervention on body composition and biomarkers associated with insulin resistance and metabolic health.

Notably, recent histological studies of post-mortem human and experimental animal brains indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs neurogenic process in the hippocampus of the brain due to neuroinflammation. Considering the facts, this article describes the prominent neuropathogenic characteristics and neurocognitive impairments in COVID-19 and emphasizes a viewpoint that neuroinflammation-mediated deterioration of hippocampal neurogenesis could contribute to the onset and progression of dementia in COVID-19. Thus, it necessitates the unmet need for regenerative medicine for the effective management of neurocognitive deficits in COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2-Mediated Neuropathogenesis, Deterioration of Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Dementia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bu makale, Trkiye sa&gcaron;lik sisteminin Sa&gcaron;likta D?n?m Programi (2003-13) tecrbesini betimleyici bir ?ekilde tekrar ele aliyor Sa&gcaron;lik sisteminin altyapi geli?imi ve kapasite arti?iyla neticelenen gncel sa&gcaron;lik reformlarini, reglasyonlari ve kismen planlama faaliyetleri yeniden g?zden ge?irildi Bunu yaparken, lke sa&gcaron;lik sistemlerinin genel niteliklerindeki ?e?itlilikler de makalede sunuldu Trkiye'nin yakin bir tarihte tamamlami? oldu&gcaron;u Sa&gcaron;likta D?n?m Programi (2003-13), bilinmezliklerden mte?ekkil COV&Iacute;D-19 kresel salgini ile mcadeleye hazirlikli bir sa&gcaron;lik altyapisi ve kapasitesi ile sa&gcaron;lik sistemini donatmi?tir Bu kresel salgin ile mcadelede, lke y?netimlerinin kararlarina ve vatanda?larinin davrani?larina y?n veren ?nemli bir etmenin kendi sa&gcaron;lik sistemlerinin kapasitesine duyduklari gven oldu&gcaron;u, Trkiye tecrbesinde faydalanilarak, makalede tarti?ildi Bu makale ile, Trkiye'de gncel sa&gcaron;lik reformlari ve reglasyon uygulamalari, lkelerin sa&gcaron;lik sistemleri arasindaki ?e?itlilikleri de sunularak, kisa kisa ele alindi B?ylece, COV&Iacute;D-19 pandemisi ile mcadele srecini inceleyen ?ali?malara sa&gcaron;lik sistemi ile ilgili gerekli ara?tirma zeminini de sunulmu? oldu Alternate abstract:This article revisits the Health Transformation Program (2003-13) of health system in Turkey The most recent health reforms, regulations and planning practices in part, which resulted in a better infrastructure and a higher capacity of the health system, has been examined While doing this, the article has also presented the variety in the main characteristics of health systems The Health Transformation Program (2003-13) has equipped the health sytem in Turkey with a sufficient health infrastructure and system capacity in the fight with such an unknown novel coronavirus illness (COVID-19) In the battle with this pandemic,in the light of Turkey's experience, the article discusses that a vital factor that shape their decisions and behaviors has been the trust and confidence that both governors and citizens have in related to the health system of their countries In this article, the recent health reforms and regulation practices in Turkey, alongside considering differences in main components of a health system, have been reviewed Thus, the article provides a background on the health system for studies in Turkey which will investigate the national fight with the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"TRKYE SA?LIK SSTEMNN D?N?M (2003-13): COVD-19 PANDEMS LE MCADELE SRECNDE SA?LIK REFORMLARINA YENDEN BAKI?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Male ferrets are used in various biomedical research studies and generally thrive in laboratory conditions.

Therefore, we sought to determine the impact of GI symptoms on disease outcomes and the systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19. Methods: In two large, independent cohorts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States (n=634) and Italy (n=287) we examined GI symptoms on admission and related them to mortality and circulating proteomic biomarkers. Disease severity defined by oxygenation and end organ damage was also examined as an outcome in the US cohort. In both cohorts, a multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the association of GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) present on admission and outcomes adjusting for age, gender and examined comorbid diseases. A prediction model was built based on the initial US cohort and validated with a distinct US cohort (n=242). In a subset of patients (n=238), circulating cytokines and chemokines were examined using a multiplexed proteomic assay (Olink) that simultaneously quantified 92 protein analytes. Results: A significant reduction in disease-associated mortality in COVID-19 patients presenting with GI symptoms was observed both in the US cohort (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86) and the Italian cohort (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.67) which was independent of age, gender and comorbidities. A prediction model consisting of age and BMI with the addition of GI symptoms had a significantly improved ability to predict disease severity and mortality compared with age and BMI alone (median area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64 (age + BMI+ GI symptoms) vs 0.59 (age + BMI) for disease severity and 0.73 (age + BMI + GI symptoms) vs 0.70 (age + BMI) for mortality). The proteomic analysis revealed 6 clusters based on their co-segregation across all COVID-19 patients. Among these 6 clusters, clusters 4 and 5, which were enriched in the \\"Hallmark Inflammatory Response\\" and KEGG JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway respectively, and were reduced in patients with diarrhea. The observed mortality reduction in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms was associated with lower circulating levels of key inflammatory proteins including IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A and CCL28 that are known to be associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19;while there was an increase in IL-7 and TRAIL, which both have important immunoregulatory functions. Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms have reduced inflammatory biomarkers and improved survival after adjusting for comorbidities, age and gender. These data highlight GI involvement as an important parameter for severity stratification in COVID-19 and point towards an immunomodulatory role of the GI tract in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Our group carried out a retrospective study from May 2020 to May 2021 to identify CAM cases in patients with previous COVID\\\\19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Six CAM cases occurred in a single centre in Western Mexico during the study period, most of them with diabetes (n = 5/6) and all received corticosteroid therapy even when only three had severe COVID\\\\19. After analysing local COVID\\\\19 burden, it was estimated that in this region, CAM was 300 times more frequent among COVID individuals than the estimates for general population. CONCLUSION: Similar to large reports in India and other countries, CAM cases reported in this study were diagnosed in individuals with diabetes, hyperglycaemic status and with history of previous use of corticosteroids. Identifying these individuals at risk can help the early identification of CAM. In addition, strict glycaemic control and avoidance of unnecessary corticosteroid in non\\\\severe COVID\\\\19 cases could help in preventing this complicated fungal infection.","output":"COVID\\\\19Cassociated mucormycosis, diabetes and steroid therapy: Experience in a single centre in Western Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study assesses the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the pattern of neurological emergencies reaching a tertiary care center.

The primary outcome was number of neurological emergencies visiting ED per week in both periods. Secondary outcomes included disease severity at admission, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), delay in hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, and reasons for poor compliance to ongoing treatment multivariate binary logistic regression was used to find independent predictors of in-hospital mortality which included variables with p <0.1 on univariate analysis. Structural break in the time series analysis was done by using Chow test. Results There was 53.8% reduction in number of neurological emergencies visiting ED during lockdown (22.1 visits vs. 10.2 visits per week, p = 0.001), significantly affecting rural population ( p = 0.004). Presenting patients had comparatively severe illness with increased requirement of MV ( p < 0.001) and significant delay in hospitalization during lockdown ( p < 0.001). Poor compliance to ongoing therapy increased from 34.4% in pre-lockdown to 64.7% patients during lockdown ( p < 0.001), mostly due to nonavailability of drugs ( p < 0.001). Overall, 35 deaths were recorded, with 20 (8.2%) in pre-lockdown and 15 (29.4%) during lockdown ( p = 0.001). Lockdown, nonavailability of local health care, delay in hospitalization, severity at admission, and need for MV emerged as independent predictors of poor outcome in stroke and delay in hospitalization in SE. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown resulted in marked decline in non-COVID neurological emergencies reporting to ED, with more severe presentations and significant delay from onset of symptoms to hospitalization.","output":"Non-COVID Neurological Emergencies: A Silent Killer Going Unnoticed during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

On May 10, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration expanded the Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include persons aged 12-15 years, and CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended it for this age group on May 12, 2021.* Before that time, COVID-19 vaccines had been available only to persons aged &#8805;16 years. Understanding and describing the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in adolescents and comparing it with adolescent hospitalizations associated with other vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses, such as influenza, offers evidence of the benefits of expanding the recommended age range for vaccination and provides a baseline and context from which to assess vaccination impact. Using the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), CDC examined COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among adolescents aged 12-17 years, including demographic and clinical characteristics of adolescents admitted during January 1-March 31, 2021, and hospitalization rates (hospitalizations per 100,000 persons) among adolescents during March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021. Among 204 adolescents who were likely hospitalized primarily for COVID-19 during January 1-March 31, 2021, 31.4% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 4.9% required invasive mechanical ventilation; there were no associated deaths. During March 1, 2020-April 24, 2021, weekly adolescent hospitalization rates peaked at 2.1 per 100,000 in early January 2021, declined to 0.6 in mid-March, and then rose to 1.3 in April.

Subjects included 25 clinical physicians, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives. The intervention involved three monthly self-facilitated groups for faculty. Groups were randomized to have no discussion guide, or to receive a one-page guide. Outcomes of burnout, engagement, and empowerment in work, and stress from uncertainty were assessed using validated metrics. RESULTS Rates of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization decreased significantly over the course of the 3-month study (56%-36%; P < .001; and 20%-15%; P = .006) and overall burnout decreased from 56% to 41% of faculty (P = .002).

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess endoscopic pleural dye marking using radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-EBUS) and virtual bronchoscopy to localize small peripheral lung nodules immediately before minimally invasive resection. METHODS The endoscopic procedure was performed without fluoroscopy, under general anesthesia in the operating room immediately before minimally invasive surgery. Then, 1 mL of methylene blue (0.5%) was instilled into the guide sheath, wedged in the subpleural space. Wedge resection or segmentectomy were guided by visualization of the dye on the pleural surface. Contribution of dye marking to the surgical procedure was rated by the surgeon. RESULTS Twenty-five nodules, including 6 ground glass opacities, were resected in 22 patients by video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection (n = 11) or robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (10 segmentectomies and 1 wedge resection). The median greatest diameter of nodules was 8 mm. No conversion to open thoracotomy was needed. The endoscopic procedure added an average 10 min to surgical resection. The dye was visible on the pleural surface in 24 cases. Histological diagnosis and free margin resection were obtained in all cases. Median skin-to-skin operating time was 90 min for robotic segmentectomy and 40 min for video-assisted wedge resection. The same operative precision was considered impossible by the surgeon without dye marking in 21 cases.

Importantly, mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred resistance to neutralization by the NTD-specific neutralizing antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes need to be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.","output":"Impact of the B.1.1.7 variant on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognizing diverse epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 Spike"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is currently very limited information on the nature and prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms after hospital discharge. METHODS: A purposive sample of 100 survivors discharged from a large University hospital were assessed 4 to 8 weeks after discharge by a multidisciplinary team of rehabilitation professionals using a specialist telephone screening tool designed to capture symptoms and impact on daily life. EQ-5D-5L telephone version was also completed. RESULTS: Participants were between 29 and 71 days (mean 48 days) postdischarge from hospital. Thirty-two participants required treatment in intensive care unit (ICU group) and 68 were managed in hospital wards without needing ICU care (ward group). New illness-related fatigue was the most common reported symptom by 72% participants in ICU group and 60.3% in ward group. The next most common symptoms were breathlessness (65.6% in ICU group and 42.6% in ward group) and psychological distress (46.9% in ICU group and 23.5% in ward group). There was a clinically significant drop in EQ5D in 68.8% in ICU group and in 45.6% in ward group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study from the United Kingdom reporting on postdischarge symptoms.

Unfortunately, the efficiencies of the corresponding devices lag far behind those of ITO-based rigid small-area counterparts. To address this issue, we design and fabricate an advanced device configuration featuring a top-illuminated structure with ultra-thin Ag as the transparent electrode. First, a conjugated polyelectrolyte layer, i.e., PCP-Li, is inserted to effectively connect the bottom Ag anode and the hole transport layer, achieving good photon to electron conversion. Second, charge collecting grids are deposited to suppress the increased resistance loss with the up-scaling of the device area, realizing almost full retention of device efficiency from 0.06 to 1 cm2 . Third, the designed device delivers the best efficiency of 15.56% with the area of 1 cm2 on polyimide (PI) substrate, representing as the record among the ITO-free, large-area, flexible OPVs. Interestingly, the device exhibits no degradation after 100,000 bending cycles with a radius of 4 mm, which is the best result for flexible OPVs. This work provides insight into device structure design and optimization for OPVs with high efficiency, low cost, superior flexibility, and up-scaling capacity, indicating the potential for the future commercialization of OPVs.

Silicosis is a preventable, permanent lung disease. The aim of this study was to assess mental health in workers from the artificial stone benchtop industry at risk of silicosis. METHODS Workers from the artificial stone benchtop industry undergoing assessment for silica-associated disease were included. Information on demographics; occupational, medical and smoking history; modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale; Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) questionnaire; spirometry; and chest x-ray was collected. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS Of the 547 participants, the majority were men, aged under 45 years, in the industry for less than 10 years. With each increase of dyspnoea score, PSS-10 scores increased. Higher PSS-10 scores were also observed in those no longer in the industry, with a history of anxiety or depression, attending assessment early in the programme and a medium exposure duration. Participants who used an interpreter reported lower stress. No difference was observed across job title, age, sex, smoking, spirometry or chest x-ray categories after multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION This study identified workers with dyspnoea as likely to report higher stress.

This has provided a detailed picture of the end point structure of the RBD-ACE2 binding event, but what remains to be elucidated is the conformation and dynamics of the RBD prior to its interaction with ACE2. In this work we utilize molecular dynamics simulations to probe the flexibility and conformational ensemble of the unbound state of the receptor-binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We have found that the unbound RBD has a localized region of dynamic flexibility in Loop 3 and that mutations identified during the COVID-19 pandemic in Loop 3 do not affect this flexibility. We use a loop-modeling protocol to generate and simulate novel conformations of the CoV2-RBD Loop 3 region that sample conformational space beyond the ACE2 bound crystal structure. This has allowed for the identification of interesting substates of the unbound RBD that are lower energy than the ACE2-bound conformation, and that block key residues along the ACE2 binding interface.

Some studies showed that malnutrition is a significant problem among patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 infection, and the outcome of patients with SARS-CoV-2 is strongly associated with their nutritional status. The purpose of this study was to collect useful information about the possible elements of nutritional and probiotic therapy in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods: A narrative review of the literature, including studies published up to 13 September 2021. Results: Probiotics may support patients by inhibiting the ACE2 receptor, i.e., the passage of the virus into the cell, and may also be effective in suppressing the immune response caused by the proinflammatory cytokine cascade. In patients diet, it is crucial to ensure an adequate intake of micronutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids (at 2C4 g/d), selenium (300C450 g/d) and zinc (30C50 mg/d), and vitamins A (900C700 g/d), E (135 mg/d), D (20,000C50,000 IU), C (1C2 g/d), B6, and B12.

COVID-19 and the history of frequent infectious outbreaks in the last two decades suggest that COVID-19 is likely a dry run for future ecological crises. Now is the right time to plan ahead and deploy the armamentarium of systems science scholarship for planetary health. The science of epigenomics, which investigates both genetic and nongenetic traits regarding heritable phenotypic alterations, and new approaches to understanding genome regulation in humans and pathogens offer veritable prospects to boost the global scientific capacities to innovate therapeutics and diagnostics against novel and existing infectious agents. Several reversible epigenetic alterations, such as chromatin remodeling and histone methylation, control and influence gene expression. COVID-19 lethality is linked, in part, to the cytokine storm, age, and status of the immune system in a given person. Additionally, due to reduced human mobility and daily activities, effects of the pandemic on the environment have been both positive and negative. For example, reduction in environmental pollution and lesser extraction from nature have potential positive corollaries on water and air quality. Negative effects include pollution as plastics and other materials were disposed in unconventional places and spaces in the course of the pandemic.

In this challenging time, adolescents require special care. The Persian version of the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) for adolescents was developed to screen for dysfunctional obsession associated with the coronavirus during the global pandemic. The structure and internal consistency of the OCS were established. Design and Measures: Although there are different language versions of the OCS, this is the first study to validate the psychometric properties of the OCS in Iranian adolescents. Seven hundred and nine students (369 girls) participated in the study. Demographic questions and the OCS were administered. Results: The findings provided support for the existence of a unidimensional structure that met the criteria for configural, metric, and full scalar invariance across gender (girls and boys), inhabitancy (urban and rural), and infection experience (infected and non-infected). The OCS is short and highly reliable measurement. However, further research is necessary to establish the validity of the scale in Iranian population. Conclusions: The development of such valid scales is an essential part of both research and practice during times of crisis, like a global pandemic.

Independent head-to-head studies are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT nasal sampling to demonstrate comparability of performance with nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling. We conducted a head-to-head comparison study of a supervised, self-collected nasal mid-turbinate (NMT) swab and a professional-collected NP swab, using the Panbio&#8482; Ag-RDT (distributed by Abbott). We calculated positive and negative percent agreement between the sampling methods as well as sensitivity and specificity for both sampling techniques compared to the reference standard reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A SARS-CoV-2 infection could be diagnosed by RT-PCR in 45 of 290 participants (15.5%). Comparing the NMT and NP sampling the positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42 PCR positives detected; CI 75.0-94.8%). The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248; CI 96.5-99.6%). The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NMT sampling was 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2-92.3%) and 88.9% (40/45; CI 76.5-95.5%) with NP sampling. Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1-99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling. The sensitivity of the Panbio test in participants with high viral load (> 7 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL) was 96.3% (CI 81.7-99.8%) for both, NMT and NP sampling. For the Panbio supervised NMT self-sampling yields comparable results to NP sampling.

We aimed to systematically review the prevalence of liver involvement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at their hospital admission, and its correlation with disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with or without pre-existing chronic liver disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, PMC, clinical trial registries, and other Coronavirus family publications for studies reporting data on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 and liver function tests (LFTs) alterations, as well as clinical course of patients with chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Case reports, preprints, editorials, reviews were excluded. We also revised literature to describe the background of liver involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS 36 studies, including 20724 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were included. The pooled prevalence of LFTs abnormalities at admission was 46.9% (AST 26.5%, ALT 22.8%, GGT 22.5%, ALP 5.7%, tBIL 8.0%). ALT, AST, tBIL were independent predictors of disease severity (ALT OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.17-2.03; AST OR 3.17, 95% CI 2.10-4.77; tBIL OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.18-4.58) and in-hospital mortality (ALT OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.96; AST OR 4.39, 95% CI 2.68-7.18; tBIL OR 7.75, 95% CI 2.28-26.40). Heterogeneity among studies was high. The few available data also reported that COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of liver decompensation and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS LFTs alterations were reported in up to 47% of unselected patients with COVID-19 and were associated with severe disease or in-hospital mortality.

RESULTS: Two patients died of pre-existing viral infections without having thymopoiesis, and 1 late death occurred from autoimmune thrombocytopenia. One infant had septic shock shortly after transplantation, resulting in graft loss and the need for a second transplant. Evidence of thymopoiesis developed from 5 to 6 months after transplantation in 10 patients. Median circulating naive CD4 counts were 44  10(6)/L (range, 11-440  10(6)/L) and 200  10(6)/L (range, 5-310  10(6)/L) at 12 and 24 months after transplantation and T-cell receptor excision circles were 2,238/10(6) T cells (range, 320-8,807/10(6) T cells) and 4,184/10(6) T cells (range, 1,582-24,596/10(6) T cells).

Patients who develop the most severe forms of the disease have high mortality. The interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab has the potential to improve outcomes in these patients by preventing the development of cytokine release storm. AIMS: To evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 disease treated with the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, case-control, single-center study in patients with severe to critical COVID-19 disease treated with tocilizumab. Disease severity was defined based on the amount of oxygen supplementation required. The primary endpoint was the overall mortality. Secondary endpoints were mortality in non-intubated patients and mortality in intubated patients. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients were included in the study. Ninety-six patients received tocilizumab, while 97 served as the control group. The mean age was 60 years. Patients over 65 years represented 43% of the population. More patients in the tocilizumab group reported fever, cough and shortness of breath (83%, 80% and 96% vs. 73%, 69% and 71%, respectively). There was a non-statistically significant lower mortality in the treatment group (52% vs. 62.1%, P = 0.09). When excluding intubated patients, there was statistically significant lower mortality in patients treated with tocilizumab (6% vs. 27%, P = 0.024).

Although it has been shown that the mandated stay-at-home restrictions and self-isolation measures applied in different countries were accosiated with a reduction in physical exercise and activity, such results derive from studying only specific periods of lockdown. However, in order for this hypothesis to be tested, consecutive lockdown periods need to be examined separately. In this study we focus on PA change in Greek adults over time, during each of the last four weeks of lockdown in Greece. The web-based Active-Q questionnaire (see Supplementary file 1_Active-Q) was used to collect data prior to the COVID-19 crisis (PRE condition) and during lockdown measures (POST condition). The period of data collection (5 April to 3 May 2020) was divided into four phases (Ph-I, Ph-II, Ph-III, Ph-V), corresponding to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th lockdown week respectively (out of a six-week total lockdown). There were four independent groups of respondents (G-I, G-II, G-III, G-V) who reported their age, weight, height and usual PA habits. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated (MET-min/week; see Supplementary file 2_Data) in four main different domains (daily occupation activities, means of transportation to and from daily occupation, leisure time and regular sporting activities; see Supplementary file 3_Corresponding MET values).

Methods This is a correlation study, we conducted a linear regression to analyse the correlation between smoking prevalence data in adults and COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) in countries with 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 3, 2020. Results Seventy-five country included with median CFR 3.66%. There are no relationships between adult male or female smoking prevalence with COVID-19 mortality in all over the countries. The multivariate analysis showed p-values of 0.823 and 0.910 for male and female smoking prevalence respectively. However, in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), there is a positive correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking with the lethality of COVID-19. Each percentage point increase in adult male smoking prevalence caused a CFR of COVID-19 increase by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p=0.041). Conclusions A correlation was found between the prevalence of adult male smoking and the CFR of COVID-19 in lower middle-income countries. Based on these findings, strengthening tobacco control policies is needed to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in LMIC. Further researches are still needed.","output":"Correlation Between Adult Tobacco Smoking Prevalence and Mortality of Coronavirus Disease-19 Across The World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND World Health Organization (WHO) has increasingly improved the guidelines to tackle the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the worldwide population. In this context, each country has introduced specific social, healthcare, political and macroeconomic measures to face COVID pandemic locally. OBJECTIVE The general aim of this comparative overview is to highlight the most significant effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the main healthcare systems. Also, we critically analyzed the macroeconomic variables and the most promising solutions to improve both healthcare system and its related risk management, taking into specific consideration the most industrialized countries. METHOD The main strategy has been built on a renewed concept of the hospital, rebuilding the old concepts of \\"triage\\" and \\"intensive care\\". Recently, COVID-19 hospitals have allowed to cater the patients affected by COVID-19. Moreover, the reshaping of several healthcare policies and requirements has led to several positive effects, such as the recruitment of a huge number of human resources in the healthcare systems. Nevertheless, several negative effects have also impacted the communities mostly subjected to infections. CONCLUSION Undoubtedly, the national healthcare systems have somehow addressed the people's needs, trying not to neglect the social, healthcare, economic and political aspects.

With limited knowledge about SARS-CoV-2, no approved treatment or vaccine is available till date. AREAS COVERED: We performed a review of literature on PubMed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 illness including trials of preventive and therapeutic measures. This review presents the basic biology of coronaviruses, epidemiology of COVID-19, clinical presentations, investigational therapies and vaccines, infection prevention and control measures and the lessons from the present pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: The scale of the outbreak has brought the governments, health-care professionals, and scientists around the world under tremendous pressure to devise control strategies and develop novel prevention measures. While availability of vaccine for COVID-19 may take time, the disease may be contained through hand hygiene, physical distancing, travel restriction, and aggressive steps such as 'lockdown.'

IgG antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were also evaluated six months after the onset of symptoms, at the time of the interview. RESULTS: A total of 599 individuals were included (320 female, 53.4%; mean age 53 years, SD 15.8) and interviewed 187 days (22 SD) after the onset. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 syndrome was 40.2% (241/599). The presence of IgG antibodies was significantly associated with the occurrence of post-COVID-19 syndrome (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.48C4.38, p = 0.001) and median SARS-CoV-2 IgG titres were significantly higher in long-haulers than in patients without symptoms (42.1, IQR 17.1-78.4 vs. 29.1, IQR 12.1-54.2 kAU/L, p = 0.004).

Feelings, behavioral actions, and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19 in undergraduates in Hail, Saudi Arabia, were assessed using an online survey. Eighteen feelings and six behavioral acts were assessed. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptomatology. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression techniques were used. The mean age of the participants (n = 418) was 20.2 years (standard deviation (SD) = 1.8 years), and 52.9% (n = 221) were males. Elevated levels of depressive symptoms were reported by 47.1% of male and 51.3% of female participants. Social isolation, loss of interest, obsessive monitoring of symptoms, concentration difficulties, recurrent negative thoughts, and worries about health services emerged as vital negative feelings related to COVID-19 that were expressed by the participants.

A sufficient supply is essential for the effective production of 200 billion erythrocytes daily, a process called erythropoiesis.

The subsequent disturbances in iron homeostasis not only impact on immune function and infection control, but also negatively affect erythropoiesis. The complex interplay between iron, immunity, erythropoiesis and infection control on the molecular and clinical level are highlighted in this review. Diagnostic algorithms for correct interpretation and diagnosis of the iron status in the setting of infection are presented. Therapeutic concepts are discussed regarding effects on anemia correction, but also toward their role on the course of infection. EXPERT OPINION In the setting of infection, anemia is often neglected and its impact on the course of diseases is incompletely understood. Clinical expertise can be improved in correct diagnosing of anemia and disturbances of iron homeostasis. Systemic studies are needed to evaluate the impact of specific therapeutic interventions on anemia correction on the course of infection, but also on patients' cardiovascular performance and quality of life.","output":"Impact of bacterial infections on erythropoiesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research consistently shows that students from academic households are more likely to enter higher education than students from non-academic households. These inequalities are only secondarily due to differences in performance (i.e., primary effects), but mostly due to students decision making behavior (i.e., secondary effects). The relative share to which primary effects and secondary effects mediate the effect of students educational background on their intention to enter higher education is affected by external conditions. One significant external influence that may have had an impact on social disparities in students educational choices is the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we present data from N = 596 upper secondary students (41.6% from non-academic households) that were collected in Germany in April 2021. Building on rational choice theory, we scrutinized students expected benefits (i.e., employment prospects and personal significance), costs (i.e., direct costs and opportunity costs), and subjective probability of success in pursuing higher education as important psychological pillars for their intention to enter higher education. Results show that about 14% of social differences in students intention to enter higher education were due to primary effects, whereas almost 77% were explained by secondary effects. Specifically, we found that differences in the evaluation of benefits most strongly contributed to social inequalities in students intention to enroll in higher education.

However, the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in aerodigestive cancers have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: In this study, the expressions of SARS-CoV-2 receptors and cofactors, including angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), basigin (BSG) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), were comprehensively assessed. We compared BSG and TMPRSS2 expressions between aerodigestive cancers and matched normal tissues through Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2). Furthermore, expressions in healthy colon tissues at different anatomical locations were explored using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset. In addition, expressions among different tumor stages and the prognostic values were detected through GEPIA2. Moreover, the correlation between gene expression and immune infiltration was explored via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). Finally, expressions in primary colorectal cancer (CRC), lung metastasis and liver metastasis were investigated using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE41258. RESULTS: Similar to ACE2, TMPRSS2 and BSG were also highly expressed in the digestive tracts. Intriguingly, BSG/TMPRSS2 expression in adjacent normal colon tissue or lung tissue was higher than that in corresponding healthy tissue, whereas they varied not among different tumor stages and correlated not with prognosis in aerodigestive cancers. Moreover, ACE2 was expressed at higher levels in lung metastases from CRC than in normal lung tissues. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 entry genes were highly expressed in CRC, and we reported for the first time higher expression of ACE2 in lung metastases from CRC than in normal lung, indicating that these patients may be more susceptible to extrapulmonary or pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 infection.

How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology?

Model training was performed on a cohort of patients recruited between 6 February and 20 May 2020, with validation conducted on a second cohort of patients recruited after model development between 21 May and 29 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (age 18 years) admitted to hospital with covid-19 at least four weeks before final data extraction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 35 463 patients were included in the derivation dataset (mortality rate 32.2%) and 22 361 in the validation dataset (mortality rate 30.1%). The final 4C Mortality Score included eight variables readily available at initial hospital assessment: age, sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of consciousness, urea level, and C reactive protein (score range 0-21 points). The 4C Score showed high discrimination for mortality (derivation cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.79; validation cohort: 0.77, 0.76 to 0.77) with excellent calibration (validation: calibration-in-the-large=0, slope=1.0). Patients with a score of at least 15 (n=4158, 19%) had a 62% mortality (positive predictive value 62%) compared with 1% mortality for those with a score of 3 or less (n=1650, 7%; negative predictive value 99%). Discriminatory performance was higher than 15 pre-existing risk stratification scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range 0.61-0.76), with scores developed in other covid-19 cohorts often performing poorly (range 0.63-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: An easy-to-use risk stratification score has been developed and validated based on commonly available parameters at hospital presentation. The 4C Mortality Score outperformed existing scores, showed utility to directly inform clinical decision making, and can be used to stratify patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 into different management groups.

The probability of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was considerably reduced if negative tests were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test probability (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher false-positive test probability, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests.ConclusionNP samples are more sensitive than OP samples.

DESIGN: Living systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Major databases between 1 December 2019 and 3 August 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies of pregnant and recently pregnant women (including after abortion or miscarriage) who sought hospital care for any reason and had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also provided data on offspring SARS-CoV-2 status and risk factors for positivity. Case series and case reports were also included to assess the timing and likelihood of mother-to-child transmission in SARS-CoV-2 positive babies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. A random effects model was used to synthesise data for rates, with associations reported using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Narrative syntheses were performed when meta-analysis was inappropriate. The World Health Organization classification was used to categorise the timing of mother-to-child transmission (in utero, intrapartum, early postnatal). RESULTS: 472 studies (206 cohort studies, 266 case series and case reports; 28 952 mothers, 18 237 babies) were included. Overall, 1.8% (95% confidence interval 1.2% to 2.5%; 140 studies) of the 14 271 babies born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection tested positive for the virus with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of the 592 SARS-CoV-2 positive babies with data on the timing of exposure and type and timing of tests, 14 had confirmed mother-to-child transmission: seven in utero (448 assessed), two intrapartum (18 assessed), and five during the early postnatal period (70 assessed). Of the 800 SARS-CoV-2 positive babies with outcome data, 20 were stillbirths, 23 were neonatal deaths, and eight were early pregnancy losses; 749 babies were alive at the end of follow-up. Severe maternal covid-19 (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), maternal death (14.1, 4.1 to 48.0), maternal admission to an intensive care unit (3.5, 1.7 to 6.9), and maternal postnatal infection (5.0, 1.2 to 20.1) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in offspring. Positivity rates using RT-PCR varied between regions, ranging from 0.1% (95% confidence interval 0.0% to 0.3%) in studies from North America to 5.7% (3.2% to 8.7%) in studies from Latin America and the Caribbean. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates were found to be low in babies born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence suggests confirmed vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although this is likely to be rare. Severity of maternal covid-19 appears to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in offspring.

These changes lead to a growing demand for new skills related to ICT use, computer literacy, internet use, or technical digital skills. However, the extensive literature on digital inequality provides evidence for significant differences in computer skills along the usual dimensions of social inequality. Due to the omnipresence of digital technologies in everyday life, it is all the more important to know the extent of digital inequality to be able to take appropriate measures to ensure that social participation does not degenerate into a question of social stratification in the Digital Age. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence for socio-economic digital inequality in Austria using survey data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) conducted in 2011/2012. We show, for Austria, that higher socio-economic background is positively related to digital problem-solving while being female is negatively correlated. However, when controlling for ICT engagement in everyday life, the positive effect of the socio-economic background only remains significant for groups of people with a very high socio-economic background while the effect of gender becomes statistically insignificant.

During the rise of the COVID-19 epidemic, we tested a comprehensive structural equation model of risk perception to explain adherence to protective behaviors in a crisis context using a survey of 572 Italian citizens. We identified two categories of protective behaviors, labeled promoting hygiene and cleaning, and avoiding social closeness. Social norms and risk perceptions were the more proximal antecedents of both categories. Cultural worldviews, affect, and experience of COVID-19 were the more distal predictors. Promoting hygiene and cleaning was triggered by the negative affective attitude toward coronavirus and mediated by an affective appraisal of risk. The deliberate dimension of risk perception (perceived likelihood) predicted only avoiding social closeness. Social norms predicted both types of behaviors and mediated the relations of cultural worldviews. Individualism (vs. communitarianism), more than hierarchy (vs. egalitarianism), shaped the affective evaluation of coronavirus. The model was an acceptable fit to the data and accounted for 20% and 29% of the variance in promoting hygiene and cleaning, and avoiding social closeness, respectively. The findings were robust to the effect of sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, and zone of the country). Taken together, our findings confirmed the empirical distinction between affective and deliberate processes in risk perception, supported the validity of the affect heuristic, and highlighted the role of social norms as an account for why individualistic people were less likely to follow the prescribed health-protective behaviors. Implications for risk communication are discussed.","output":"Risk Perception and Protective Behaviors During the Rise of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide.

Objective: To characterize self-reported experiences and views of hospital capacity managers regarding the 2017-2018 influenza season in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted between April 2018 and January 2019 with a random sample of capacity management administrators responsible for throughput and hospital capacity at short-term, acute care hospitals throughout the US. Main Outcomes and Measures: Each participant's self-reported experiences and views regarding high patient volumes during the 2017-2018 influenza season, lessons learned, and the extent of hospitals' preparedness planning for future pandemic events. Interviews were recorded and transcribed and then analyzed using thematic content analysis. Outcomes included themes and subthemes. Results: A total of 53 key hospital capacity personnel at 53 hospitals throughout the US were interviewed; 39 (73.6%) were women, 48 (90.6%) had a nursing background, and 29 (54.7%) had been in the occupational role for more than 4 years. Participants' experiences were categorized into several domains: (1) perception of strain, (2) effects of influenza and influenza-like illness on staff and patient care, (3) immediate staffing and capacity responses to influenza and influenza-like illness, and (4) future staffing and capacity preparedness for influenza and influenza-like illness. Participants reported experiencing perceived strain associated with concerns about preparedness for seasonal influenza and influenza-like illness as well as concerns about staffing, patient care, and capacity, but future pandemic planning within hospitals was not reported as being a high priority. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this qualitative study suggest that during the 2017-2018 influenza season, there were systemic vulnerabilities as well as a lack of hospital preparedness planning for future pandemics at US hospitals. These issues should be addressed given the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","output":"US Hospital Capacity Managers' Experiences and Concerns Regarding Preparedness for Seasonal Influenza and Influenza-like Illness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was thought that virus affects only the respiratory system However, now it is clear that it can affect other systems too, particularly the nervous system We aimed to identify the most common neurological symptoms and findings of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and investigate the relationship between these symptoms and clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings A total of 307 patients, including 125 women and 182 men, were included in the study They were classified as confirmed cases or probable cases based on confirmatory tests, including polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample or validated antibody test All medical records, including medical history, clinical course, laboratory data, and radiographic studies, were evaluated by two expert neurologists Altered mental status (AMS) is the most common neurological finding in both confirmed (68 1%) and probable cases (71 8%) Pre-existing neurological diseases were detected as an independent risk factor for AMS The mortality rate of patients with AMS was dramatically higher than normal mental status in both confirmed (43 9% vs 6 2%) and probable cases (47 3% vs 6 9%)(for both p:0 001) The frequency of seizure attacks was 13 2% in confirmed and 17 5% in probable cases (p:0 321) The mortality rate was higher in patients with a seizure attack in both groups We conclude that AMS was one of the most common neurological manifestations in this cohort of COVID-19 patients The development of mental deterioration increases mortality dramatically Also, the existence of seizure attacks was associated with a high mortality rate","output":"Neurological Manifestations of COVID-19 in Confirmed and Probable Cases: A Descriptive Study from a Large Tertiary Care Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been reported that COVID-19 patients had an increased neutrophil count and a decreased lymphocyte count in the severe phase and neutrophils may contribute to organ damage and mortality In this paper, we present the bifurcation analysis of a dynamical model for the initial innate system response to pulmonary infection The model describes the interaction between a pathogen and neutrophilis (also known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes) It is shown that the system undergoes a sequence of bifurcations including subcritical and supercritical Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations, Hopf bifurcation, and degenerate Hopf bifurcation as the parameters vary, and the model exhibits rich dynamics such as the existence of multiple coexistent periodic oscillations, homoclinic orbits, bistability and tristability, etc Numerical simulations are presented to explain the theoretical results ? 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company","output":"Bifurcation Analysis of a Dynamical Model for the Innate Immune Response to Initial Pulmonary Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: E-learning has been widely adopted as a teaching and learning approach in medical education internationally but its adoption in low- and middle-income countries is still at an infantile stage. The use of e-learning may help to overcome some of the barriers to access to quality education and provide flexible, low-cost, user-centred, and easily updated learning. Research can inform improvement in health care, but strategies to develop research skills among health practitioners are complex and require well-designed training. To address the need for research education, we developed and implemented an e-learning course on patient safety research for students enrolled for higher diploma courses at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC). In this paper, we report our experience teaching the online research course in resource-constrained settings to enable other medical educators, students and institutions in similar settings to understand approaches to incorporating e-learning interventions. Methods The eLearning research course is hosted on the Colleges Moodle Learning Management System (LMS). All higher diploma students admitted to the college in the 2020/21 academic year were enrolled on the course. The research course was delivered over 60 hours, but the course materials (text, videos, images, discussion forums, downloadable content) remain accessible to students throughout the academic year. A pretest, posttest, peer-graded assessment and course evaluation were administered on the e-learning platform. The students were expected to conduct individual research projects after the training. Results A total of 933 students undertaking 44 higher diploma courses in 11 campuses of KMTC were enrolled in the course. There was a significant increase in the mean knowledge level of students: scores for pretest (Mean = 56.5%, SD = 14.3) and posttest (Mean = 67.8%, SD = 8.9);t (122) = 7.85, p < .001. Student and faculty experience was generally positive. The challenges included infrastructure and technological skills. The standardization of material and team-teaching improved efficiency, effectiveness and inter-faculty discourse on inter-professional collaboration in research.

This is likely to be more challenging then the first wave for the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the similar symptomology with other respiratory conditions highly prevalent in winter. This study sought to understand the care pathways in place in UK NHS hospitals during the first wave (March-July 2020) for identification of patients with COVID-19 and to learn lessons to inform optimal testing strategies within the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). Design: , setting & participants Sixteen hospital-based clinicians from 12 UK NHS Trusts covering 10 different specialties were interviewed following a semi-structured topic guide. Data were coded soon after the interviews and analysed thematically. Results: We developed a diagrammatic, high-level visualisation of the care pathway describing the main clinical decisions associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 testing influenced infection control considerations more so than treatment decisions. Two main features of service provision influenced the patient management significantly: access to rapid laboratory testing and the number of single occupancy rooms. If time to return of result was greater than 24 hours, patients with a presumptive diagnosis would often be cohorted based on clinical suspicion alone. Undetected COVID-19 during this time could therefore lead to an increased risk of viral transmission. Conclusions: During the winter months, priority for provision of rapid testing at admission should be given to hospitals with limited access to laboratory services and single room availability. Access to rapid testing is essential for urgent decisions related to emergency surgery, maternity services and organ transplant. The pathway and prioritization of need will inform the economic modelling, clinical evaluations, and implementation of new clinical tests in UK.","output":"Care Pathway And Prioritization Of Rapid Testing For Covid-19 In UK Hospitals: A Qualitative Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An epidemiological model [Susceptible, Un-quarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected (SUQC)] has previously been developed and applied to incorporate quarantine measures and calculate COVID-19 contagion dynamics and pandemic control in some Chinese regions. Here, we generalized this model to incorporate the disease recovery rate and applied our model to records of the total number of confirmed cases of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in some Chilean communes. In each commune, two consecutive stages were considered: a stage without quarantine and an immediately subsequent quarantine stage imposed by the Ministry of Health. To adjust the model, typical epidemiological parameters were determined, such as the confirmation rate and the quarantine rate. The latter allowed us to calculate the reproduction number. The mathematical model adequately reproduced the data, indicating a higher quarantine rate when quarantine was imposed by the health authority, with a corresponding decrease in the reproduction number of the virus down to values that prevent or decrease its exponential spread. In general, during this second stage, the communes with the lowest social priority indices had the highest quarantine rates, and therefore, the lowest effective viral reproduction numbers. This study provides useful evidence to address the health inequity of pandemics.

To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies are based on serum detection of antibodies to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralising antibodies) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that are known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of antigens released from infected cells could stimulate antibody responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other non-structural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titre IgG, IgM and IgA antibody responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher antibody titres in these assays associated with more severe disease and no cross-reactive antibodies against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG antibodies specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 antigens can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent antigen in infected patients that can be used in serological tests and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, non-invasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","output":"SARS-Cov-2 cysteine-like protease (Mpro) is immunogenic and can be detected in serum and saliva of COVID-19-seropositive individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans have long sought experiences that transcend or change their sense of self.

The Poisson means are decomposed in the log scale as the sums of fixed effects and latent effects. The areal median age, the educational level, and the number of beds in long-term care homes are included in the fixed effects. To explore the correlation between cases and deaths inside each area and across areas, three bivariate models are considered for the latent effects, namely an independent one, a conditional autoregressive model, and one that allows for both spatially structured and unstructured sources of variability. As the inclusion of spatial effects change some of the fixed effects, we extend the Spatial+ approach to a Bayesian areal set up to investigate the presence of spatial confounding. Results show that the cumulative totals of cases and deaths are negatively correlated inside and across the boroughs of Montreal. The covariates are not associated in a similar manner for the cases and deaths due to COVID-19.

Blood samples were taken and hematological parameters, the activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase, erythrocyte osmotic fragility, and serum concentrations of some trace elements (copper, iron, zinc, manganese, and selenium), were measured. As an index of lipid peroxidation, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was also determined. According to the results, a significant decrease in red blood cell (RBC) count, packed cell volume, the activities of SOD, GPX, and catalase (P <0.001), and also serum concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, and Se (P < 0.05) were evident in the infected sheep. In contrast, significantly increased levels of MDA and erythrocyte osmotic fragility (P < 0.001) as well as serum concentration of iron (P < 0.05) were recorded in the infected animals.

Total Systems Effectiveness (TSE) was developed as an approach to evaluate vaccines with different product attributes from a systems perspective, in order to analyse and compare the value of innovative vaccine products in different settings. The TSE approach has been advanced over the years by various stakeholders including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Gavi, PATH, UNICEF and WHO.

In countries where COVID-19 numbers are subsiding, medical teams should also be prepared to resume normal practices gradually. Here, we aim to review the literature on the impact of COVID-19 on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as discuss modifications to the management of HCC during and after recovery from the pandemic. Summary: Based on current data, 10C40% of patients with COVID-19 have hepatic injury characterized by an elevation of transaminases and/or hyperbilirubinemia. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the hepatic injury, including direct viral entry to hepatocytes/cholangiocytes, immune-mediated hepatitis, hypoxia, and drug-related hepatotoxicity. In patients with HCC, COVID-19 may exacerbate existing chronic liver disease and complicate the management of cancer. Cancer patients generally have a higher risk of infection and worse outcome, especially those who have recently undergone cancer treatment. Although HCC is under-represented in COVID-19 series, mitigation measures should be implemented to minimize the exposure of patients to the virus. A decision on the treatment of HCC should be balanced with consideration of the availability of medical resources, the level of infection risk of COVID-19, and the risk-benefit ratio of the individual patient. In areas where the COVID-19 outbreak is subsiding, clinicians should be prepared to manage a surge of HCC patients with higher disease burdens and complications. Key Messages: Mitigation measures to protect at-risk patients, such as those with cancers, from SARS-CoV-2 infection should be exercised and the impact of COVID-19 on this group of patients should be thoroughly studied.","output":"Impacts of COVID-19 on Liver Cancers: During and after the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diclofenac (DCF), as a typical representative of PPCPs, has potential ecotoxicity to the water environment. In this study, ultrasound (US) enhanced ferrous sulfide (FeS)-activated persulfate (PDS) technology (US/FeS/PDS) was used to degrade DCF. By comparing the degradation effects of US, US/PDS, FeS/PDS and US/FeS/PDS systems on DCF, this study confirmed the synergy and strengthening effects of US. The influences of single-factor experimental conditions on the US/FeS/PDS system were investigated and optimized. The FeS catalysts before and after the reaction were characterized and analyzed by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The heterogeneous reaction proceeded on the surface of FeS, and a small part of FeS2 was formed on FeS surface. During the reaction, the proportion of S2- on the catalyst surface decreased from 51% to 44%. Correspondingly, the proportion of Sx2- increased from 21% to 26%. It indicated that S2- was oxidized into Sx2- in the reaction, and the loss electrons of S2- caused the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+on the FeS surface, which promoted the cycle between Fe2+ and Fe3+ in turn. Furthermore, SO4- and a?OH were the main active free radicals, of which the contribution rate of a?OH was about 34.4%, while that of SO4- was approximately 52.2%. In US/FeS/PDS, the introduction of US could promote the dissolution of iron on the FeS surface. US contributed to the formation of a redox power motor between S2-Sx2- and Fe2+-Fe3+, which continuously decomposed PDS to generate sufficient active SO4- and a?OH radicals, thereby efficiently and continuously degrading DCF. Finally, the related mechanism of DCF degradation by US/FeS/PDS was summarized. Overall, US/FeS/PDS can not only efficiently degrade and remove DCF, but also has potential application value in organic pollution removal and wastewater purification.","output":"FeS redox power motor for PDS continuous generation of active radicals on efficient degradation and removal of diclofenac: Role of ultrasonic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Collisions between opened doors and approaching vehicles such as bicycles are common occurrences in urban areas around the world. For example, in Chicago, 20#x00025;of all bicycle accidents involve collisions with doors, which occur over 300 times a year. In addition, there are concerns about a further rise in accidents due to the recent increase in home delivery services and bicycle commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that are designed to help prevent this type of accident have already been introduced. These systems detect approaching vehicles with sensors and alert the person opening the door via LED lights or a buzzer when the door is opened. The occupant must understand the meaning of the alert and stop opening the door quickly to prevent an accident. However, if the occupant is an elderly person or a child, it is difficult to stop opening the door quickly. One possible countermeasure for this issue is an ADAS that completely locks the door if there is a possibility of collision with the door. This paper presents how this function can be realized. This paper also presents voice guidance as a method of removing the fear of being trapped, which is a new issue associated with the realization of a complete door lock system, and a method of unlocking the door by special operation of the door open button when the occupant wants to open the door even if there is a possibility of collision of present. ? 2022 SAE International.

Here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in Escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion partner. The fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. The fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickelCnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni(2+)CNTA) resin chromatography. After the SUMO-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the SUMO protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a Ni(2+)CNTA column. Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity.

There are about 50 different breeds of domestic rabbits. Rabbits have very thin and delicate skin that is covered with fine fur comprised of both a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs. Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. A rabbit enclosure should be large enough to provide a sleeping space, eating space, and latrine. Animals housed for long periods of time should also have ample room to exercise. The enclosure should be tall enough to allow the rabbit to sit up and not have its ears touch the top of the cage. Because rabbits are prone to heatstroke, they should be housed in temperatures ranging from 60F to 75F. If rabbits are housed outdoors, they must have access to shade and clean water, and the shelter should protect them from the elements as well as from predators. The ideal substrate for rabbits is grass hay; however, for indoor, caged rabbits, a foam rubber pad or a towel covered with newspaper and a thick layer of timothy hay can also be used.","output":"CHAPTER 14 RABBITS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility.

Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy.

However, when COVID-19 was first detected in Singapore in January 2020, the 12-h shift was introduced for better team segregation and deployment to meet the service needs of the Emergency Department. The 12-h shift consisted of the day (9am-9pm) and night (9pm-9am) shifts. While the 12-h shift is common to nursing practices, it is new to the radiography profession within the study centre. This study explores the radiographers' perspectives of the new shift and the impact of shift patterns on radiographers' wellness and work performance compared to the original three shift patterns. METHODS: A mixed-methods design study was adopted for this single-centre evaluation. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to radiographers who had experienced both shift types. Additionally, the number of radiographers who had taken sick leave, and images rejected and accepted from the X-ray consoles were retrospectively collected to measure the impact of the new shift. RESULTS: Radiographers experienced fatigue and appreciated the longer rest days associated with the 12-h shift. Additionally, the sick leave rates and image reject counts were more favourable with the 12-h shift pattern. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the extended shift hours are effective during a pandemic but may result in radiographer burnout during a prolonged outbreak.

PATIENTS AND METHODS A study of 249 patients who underwent RAPN in multiple institutions was performed. Patients were identified using prospective RAPN databases. Complex renal lesion were defined as those with a RENAL nephrometry score 10. Data were analysed and differences among groups examined. RESULTS A total of 31 (12.4%) RAPNs were performed for complex renal tumours. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) patient age was 57 (50.5-70.5) years and 21 patients (67.7%) were men. The median (IQR) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2 (2-3). The median (IQR) operating time was 200 (50-265) min, warm ischaemia time was 23 (18.5-29) min, and estimated blood loss was 200 (50-265) mL. There were no intra-operative complications. Two patients (6.4%) had postoperative complications. One patient (3.2%) had a positive surgical margin. The median (IQR) length of stay was 3.5 (3-5) days and the median (IQR) follow-up was 12.5 (7-24) months. There were no recurrences. RAPN resulted in statistically significant changes in renal function 3 months after RAPN compared with preoperative renal function (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Our results showed that RAPN was a safe approach for selected patients with complex renal tumours and may facilitate tumour resection and renorrhaphy for challenging cases, offering a minimally invasive surgical option for patients who may otherwise require open surgery.","output":"Strategies for success: a multi-institutional study on robot-assisted partial nephrectomy for complex renal lesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Threats to the rights of persons with disabilities and opportunities to develop in relation to their personal autonomy have been revealed during the period of state of alarm of the Spanish state produced by the health emergency derived from the 2019-2020 coronavirus disease pandemic Respect for international human rights treaties obliges states to approach the vulnerable situation of people with disabilities from personal autonomy model and to fight against attitudes based on previous models of treatment of disability Copyright ? 2020 Manuel Garca Ortiz","output":"Risks of violation of the fundamental rights of people with disabilities in relation to health crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The TCM protocol in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Trial Version 7) has been updated from previous versions The protocol was formulated under the direct leadership of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, based on the experience of a panel of experts, supported by evidence from fever clinics and from the outcomes of emergency (EM) observation rooms and inpatients throughout China (especially in Wuhan, Hubei Province) in combination with the latest scientific research results and data The present interpretation of the TCM protocol is based on an overall understanding of the revised content, and aims to guide and standardize its clinical application to provide a reference for clinicians","output":"Interpretation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine portion of the diagnosis and treatment protocol for corona virus disease 2019 (Trial Version 7)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate Ontario adults' reported sleep quantity, quality, and disturbances during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-July 2020).

METHODS Gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-enhanced CMR data from the multinational, multicenter European Society of Cardiovascular Radiology MRCT Registry was included. AAE severity was classified according to the American College of Radiology Manual on Contrast Media (mild, moderate, severe). Multivariable generalized linear mixed effect models were used to assess the likelihood of AAEs in various GBCA, adjusting for pharmacological stressor, main indications (i.e., suspected or known coronary artery disease or myocarditis), age, sex, and submitting center as a random effect. RESULTS In the study population of 72,839 GBCA-enhanced CMRs, a total of 260 AAEs were reported (0.36%), with a minority of severe AAEs (n = 24, 0.033%). Allergic-like AAEs were less likely than physiologic AAEs (29% versus 71%). Patients without pharmacological stress imaging had a lower AAE rate (0.22%) compared to stress imaging (0.75%), with the highest AAE rates for regadenoson (2.95%). AAE rates also varied by GBCA subtype (overall p < 0.001). There was significant interaction between GBCA and pharmacological stressor (interaction p = 0.025), with AAE rates ranging between 0 and 10% for certain GBCA/stressor combinations. There was further marginal evidence that higher GBCA volume was associated with higher AAE incidence (OR = 1.02, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION GBCA-enhanced CMR imaging demonstrates low AAE rates comparable to those of other body regions. AAE likelihood correlates with GBCA subtype, pharmacological stressor, and imaging indication. Intravenous fluid administration in patients with cardiac impairment might contribute to these findings.

S. Paratyphi A was isolated from a fine needle aspirate sample. A descriptive epidemiological review was performed of confirmed cases of S. Paratyphi notified in New South Wales between 2008 and 2017. S. Paratyphi was isolated in blood and/or faecal samples in 247 cases (98.4%). Only four specimens (1.6%) were from a focal site. A literature review of extraintestinal infections of S. Paratyphi A or B was performed. Of the 41 such cases reported, 16 (39%) had a clear history of a prior gastroenteritis and/or febrile illness, or information suggested this was highly likely. No preceding gastroenteritis or febrile illness occurred in 15 (37%) of the cases. Information was reviewed and presented with a public health lens, valuable for 'evidence-informed' public health risk assessment of contacts and exposures related to these types of S. Paratyphi infection. S. Paratyphi infection usually presents as an enteric fever illness. Our case illustrates the variable nature of infectious diseases and the importance of laboratory testing in obtaining a diagnosis. S. Paratyphi can have unusual presentations, which may require adjustment in the public health management of the case. Public health staff should keep an open mind when investigating possible sources and assessing risk. In Western Sydney, this disease is largely associated with residents travelling to high-incidence countries to visit family and friends, and receiving family visits from these countries. The increasing number of cases of S. Paratyphi (prior to COVID-19) in Western Sydney and the importance of awareness of the risk of enteric fever to travellers to endemic regions is highlighted.","output":"Salmonella Paratyphi A infection: implications for public health management of extra-intestinal presentations - case study of a neck abscess"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Systematic reviews are often considered among the highest quality of evidence. Completely reported systematic reviews, however, are required so readers can assess for generalisability of the research to practice and risk of bias. The objective of this study was to assess the completeness of reporting for systematic reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) checklist that was published in 2018. DESIGN AND SETTING In this meta-research study, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched, with no date restriction, on March 1st, 2020 for systematic reviews assessing the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS. Adherence to PRISMA-DTA for the main text and abstract was scored independently and in duplicate using a modified checklist. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the mean PRISMA-DTA checklist adherence for the full-text and abstract. RESULTS A total of 71 studies published from 2008 to 2020 met the inclusion criteria. The overall adherence for the full-text was moderate: 19.8 out of 26.0 items (76%) and for the abstract was 7.0 out of 11.0 items (64%). Although many items in the PRISMA-DTA checklist were frequently reported, several were r infrequently reported (<33% of studies), including item 5 (protocol registration), item D2 (minimally acceptable test accuracy) and item 14 (variability in target condition, index test and reference standards). Subgroup analyses showed a higher PRISMA-DTA mean adherence (SD) for high impact journals (20.9 (2.52) vs 18.9 (1.95); p<0.001), studies including supplemental materials (20.6 (2.48) vs 18.9 (2.28); p=0.004), studies citing adherence to PRISMA reporting guidelines (20.4 (1.95) vs 19.0 (3.00); p=0.038) and studies published in journals endorsing PRISMA guidelines (20.2 (2.47) vs 18.6 (2.37); p=0.025). There was variable adherence based on journal of publication (p=0.006), but not for study population (adult vs paediatric vs mixed) (p=0.62), year of publication (p=0.94), body region (p=0.78) or country (p=0.40). There was no variability in abstract adherence based on whether the abstract was structured with subheadings or not (p=0.25). A Spearman's correlation found moderate correlation between higher word counts and abstractand full-text adherence (R=0.45, p<0.001 and R=0.38, p=0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the reporting of POCUS diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews and meta-analyses was moderate. We identified deficits in several key areas including the preregistration of systematic reviews in an online repository, handling of multiple definitions of target conditions, index tests and reference standards and specifying minimally acceptable test accuracy. Prospective registration of reviews and detailed reporting as per PRISMA-DTA during the research process could improve reporting completeness. At an editorial level, word count and supplemental material limitations may impede reporting completeness, whereas endorsement of reporting guidelines on journal websites could improve reporting.","output":"Completeness of reporting for systematic reviews of point-of-care ultrasound: a meta-research study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the percentage of positivity of close contacts of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients to depict the importance of asymptomatic infections in the patient-to-patient transmission of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective study we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CRP, ferritin, LDH and D-dimer in predicting positive cases of COVID-19 in Iraq. METHODS: It is a retrospective observational cohort study based on STARD guidelines to determine the diagnostic accuracy of (CRP, LDH, ferritin and D dimer) for COVID-19 of electronic medical records of private medical center in Najaf city, at which 566 individuals were recruited. The investigated subjects were either in close contact with previously COVID-19 positive patients or have one or more symptoms of COVID-19. They were categorized into 2 groups, 205 subjects diagnosed with RT-PCR as COVID-19 negative, and 361 COVID-19 positive patients, results of study variables of the cohort were recruited from the medical records. RESULTS: Combining of these parameters had the following findings: CRP + ferritin; AUC: 0.77 with 55% sensitivity and 97% specificity, Ferritin + LDH; AUC: 0.83 with 65% sensitivity and 92% specificity, CRP+LDH; AUC: 0.78 with 56% sensitivity and 98% specificity, CRP + LDH + ferritin; AUC: 0.85, with 73% sensitivity and 88% specificity, CRP + LDH + ferritin + D dimer; AUC: 0.85 75% sensitivity and 87% specificity.

Moreover, larger amplitudes of LPP were observed in response to the stadium preceded by congruent trials than incongruent trials. This effect was more pronounced in the left than right frontal sites. The LPP suggested that a congruent narrative imparted the stadium approaching affective features, and induced approaching responses, which was consistent with the behavioral and correlational results.

In the absence of a safe and effective cure or vaccine during the first ten months of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world implemented these social-isolation strategies and other NPIs to reduce COVID-19 transmission. But, individuals and public perceptions play a crucial role in the success of any social-isolation measure. Thus, in spite of governments initiative to use NPIs to combat COVID-19 in many countries, individual choices rendered social-isolation unsuccessful in some of these countries. This resulted in huge outbreaks that imposed a substantial (morbidity, mortality, hospitalization, economic, etc.) toll on human lives. In particular, human choices pose serious challenges to public health strategic decision-making in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. To unravel the impact of this behavioral response to social-isolation on the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, we develop a model framework that integrates COVID-19 transmission dynamics with a multi-strategy evolutionary game approach of individual decision-making. We use this integrated framework to characterize the evolution of human choices in social-isolation as the disease progresses and public health control measures such as mandatory lockdowns are implemented. Analysis of the model illustrates that SD plays a major role in reducing the burden of the disease compared to SQ. Parameter estimation using COVID-19 incidence data, as well as different lockdown data sets from India, and scenario analysis involving a combination of Voluntary-Mandatory implementation of SQ and SD shows that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the type of isolation, and the time and period of implementation of the selected isolation measure during the outbreak.","output":"Human choice to self-isolate in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic: a game dynamic modelling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk factors for clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well established in patients with underlying liver diseases.

Our findings support a novel model of DNAJC14 action that includes specific membrane targeting of both DNAJC14 and YFV replication proteins, the formation of protein interactions, and a microdomain-specific chaperone event leading to RC formation.

There is a paucity of data describing the role of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) in the assessment of COVID-19 cases. This study aimed at identifying NEWS2 calculated on admission as a valuable tool for risk stratification and prediction of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Materials and method: This prospective, observational study included 814 confirmed COVID-19 cases and was conducted over a period of three months. Vital parameters were assessed and NEWS2 was calculated on admission. Data were entered in excel format and statistical analysis was done in Python 3.8 statistical software (Wilmington, DE: Python Software Foundation). Pearson's chi-squared test was used following which a significant NEWS2 cut-off score to predict in-hospital mortality was determined by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Mortality of 9.09% was noted and correlations were made with age, comorbidity, and NEWS2 score. For in-hospital deaths, comorbidities were present in 66.21% of patients, the mean age was 60.14 years, and average NEWS2 score was 9. For discharged patients only 21.89% had comorbidities, mean age was 42.96 years, and average NEWS2 score was 1.17. NEWS2 score of  6 had a sensitivity of 93.24% and specificity of 98.91%, and hence was a statistically significant cut-off value for predicting mortality on admission. Conclusion:Age, presence of comorbidities, and NEWS2 have a positive correlation with mortality in COVID-19 patients. NEWS2 score being easy, reliable, and quick to calculate, should be used to triage these patients on admission. Scores  6 should be considered to have a higher risk of adverse outcomes and hence should be managed prudently along with clinical judgment.","output":"Assessment of National Early Warning Score 2 as a Tool to Predict the Outcome of COVID-19 Patients on Admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an unprecedented burden on our healthcare systems and workers Healthcare workers are at risk of contracting and spreading SARS-CoV-2 given their proximity to positive cases, often with a lack of personal protective equipment The South African Department of Health requires that all employees be screened daily for symptoms and potential persons under investigation identified timeously This report aims to assesses the efficacy of daily self-screening tools in detecting and managing potential staff cases of SARS-CoV-2 Our hospital, situated in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, developed a daily self-screening tool for all healthcare workers to complete, consisting of questions on symptoms and epidemiological risk factors The screening tools were collected and assessed after four weeks of use Fifty-four forms were assessed Twenty-eight (51 9%) forms were not completed, whilst 12 (22 2%) indicated positive symptoms with no documentation that any further medical assessment, testing or isolation was done We identified that the poor completion of forms was likely because of the lack of education of staff on the importance of the forms, poor oversight by management, staff forgetfulness or lack of awareness of the forms Screening of staff is vital during this pandemic but requires constant oversight by line managers, staff motivation and adequate education Ongoing development of efficient screening programmes is required","output":"Analysis of a SARS-CoV-2 daily screening programme for healthcare workers at a district hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, a quality improvement initiative.

The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial damage involve direct effect of the virus in cardiac cells and indirect effect due to the clinical consequences of Covid-19. Cardiomyocytes are well known to express Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 receptors (ACE-2) to facilitate the virus cell entry, which could explain the occurrence of myocarditis, functional alterations in the myocardium, and more rarely, myocardial infarction. Myocardial injury may also be secondary to systemic inflammation or coagulopathy due to complicated Covid-19. The existence of a cardio-intestinal axis with alteration of tryptophan metabolism in the small bowel leading first to colitis and then to systemic inflammation has also been evoked to explain the myocardial injury. Morphological and metabolic disturbances of the heart during the Covid-19 are associated with elevated concentrations of cardiac blood biomarkers, mainly troponins and natriuretic peptides. The determination of these biomarkers has proven to be very useful for diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification. Indeed, recent data demonstrated that about 20% of infected patients admitted to the hospital have elevated troponin or BNP levels, and Covid-19 patients with elevated troponin concentrations beyond the diagnostic threshold (99th percentile) were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, after more than a year of a unique global pandemic, it is now clearly established that myocardial injury during Covid-19 is frequent and strongly contributes to the severity of the disease. Cardiac alterations secondary to direct infection of cardiac cells by SARS-CoV-2 or to the clinical consequences of Covid-19 are associated with elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers in blood, whose measurement is crucial in clinical decision making.","output":"[Myocardial injury in coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19): main pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical utility of cardiac biomarkers]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans leads to the disease COVID-19, has caused global disruption and more than 2 million fatalities since it first emerged in late 2019. As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority.

We present a phylogenetic study to explore viral introduction and evolution during the exponential early phase of the local COVID-19 outbreak from February 26(th) until March 23(rd). We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 naso-oropharyngeal swabs from 746 positive tests that were performed at the University Hospital Basel during the study period. We successfully generated 468 high quality genomes from unique patients and called variants with our COVID-19 Pipeline (COVGAP), and analysed viral genetic diversity using PANGOLIN taxonomic lineages. To identify introduction and dissemination events we incorporated global SARS-CoV-2 genomes and inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny. Epidemiological data from patient questionnaires was used to facilitate the interpretation of phylogenetic observations. The early outbreak in Basel was dominated by lineage B.1 (836%), detected first on March 2(nd), although the first sample identified belonged to B.1.1. Within B.1, 682% of our samples fall within a clade defined by the SNP C15324T (Basel cluster), including 157 identical sequences at the root of the Basel cluster, some of which we can specifically trace to regional spreading events. We infer the origin of B.1-C15324T to mid-February in our tri-national region. The other genomes map broadly over the global phylogenetic tree, showing several introduction events from and/or dissemination to other regions of the world via travellers. Family transmissions can also be traced in our data. A single lineage variant dominated the outbreak in the Basel area while other lineages, such as the first (B.1.1), did not propagate. A mass gathering event was the predominant initial source of cases, with travel returners and family transmissions to a lesser extent. We highlight the importance of adding specific questions to epidemiological questionnaires, to obtain data on attendance of large gatherings and their locations, as well as travel history, to effectively identify routes of transmissions in up-coming outbreaks. This phylogenetic analysis in concert with epidemiological and contact tracing data, allows connection and interpretation of events, and can inform public health interventions.

It is essential to quantify the independent effects of supply air, contaminant source, and initial condition in a ventilated room with air recirculation. In this paper, the transport process of a contaminant with air recirculation is mathematically derived based on a fixed flow field. A linear expression is established to describe the transient contributions of different influencing factors. The indices of revised transient accessibility of supply air (RTASA), contaminant source (RTACS), and initial condition (RTAIC), are defined to quantify the effect of each factor by incorporating the effect of air recirculation. The prediction accuracy is verified through a comparison with simulation results. The proposed indices are applied to evaluate a ventilated room with an air cleaner and recirculated air curtain. The results indicate that the recirculated airflows from both the air cleaner and air curtain increase the RTASA of each air supply inlet to distant areas. The purification effect (30%) occurs only after a certain period for RTASA and RTACS, while it operates from the initial stage for RTAIC owing to the initial high contamination. The RTACS in the protected zone is reduced significantly owing to the air curtain, with a decrease from 1.33 to 0.77 at 600 s at a height of 1.2 m in the curtain jet.

The failure coincided with emerging stress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient suffered from childhood on from ruminative thinking and depressive mood, which was treated in several settings during his life. He started to use alcohol to control his depression, but developed an alcohol addiction. This was successfully treated and the patient remained abstinent for more than 25 years afterwards. About 7 years ago, he started to use Kratom 3C4 times daily on a regular, but constant rate. Kratom use worked efficiently as a self-management of his depression with no escalation of dosing. It was also very effective in reducing Morbus Menire symptoms of tinnitus and sudden hearing loss, which eventually allowed regular performance as a caregiver in a demanding job on shift-work. During recently increased stress load in the work environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, the established Kratom doses failed to control hyperarousal and mental nervousness. The patient was treatment seeking and subsequently detoxified from Kratom. Anxiety- and depression management was shifted to treatment attempts with Lorazepam, Venlafaxine, Opipramol, Mirtazapine and psychotherapy.

In this study, the 5 and 3 terminal regions of Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Powassan virus were examined using biophysical and computational modeling methods. First, we used size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifuge methods to investigate the purity of in-vitro transcribed RNAs. Next, we employed small-angle X-ray scattering techniques to study solution conformation and low-resolution structures of these RNAs, which suggest that the 3 terminal regions are highly extended as compared to the 5 terminal regions for both viruses. Using computational modeling tools, we reconstructed 3-dimensional structures of each RNA fragment and compared them with derived small-angle X-ray scattering low-resolution structures.

Thus, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral diseases requires the detection of a large number of viruses. In this study, 6 duplex real-time PCR assays, using EvaGreen intercalating dye, were developed to detect 12 major viruses responsible for respiratory diseases: influenza A and B viruses, enteroviruses (including enterovirus spp, and rhinovirus spp), respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses group I (of which CoV 229E and CoV NL63 are part) and II (including CoV OC43 and CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adenoviruses and human bocaviruses. The 2 target viruses of each duplex reaction were distinguishable by the melting temperatures of their amplicons. The 6 duplex real time PCR assays were applied for diagnostic purpose on 202 respiratory samples from 157 patients. One hundred fifty-seven samples were throat swabs and 45 were bronchoalveolar lavages. The results of the duplex PCR assays were confirmed by comparison with a commercial, validated, assay; in addition, the positive results were confirmed by sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the duplex PCR assays varied from 10(3) copies/ml to 10(4) copies/ml. For parainfluenza virus 2 only it was 10(5) copies/ml. Seventy clinical samples (35%) from 55 patients (30 children and 25 adults) were positive for 1 or more viruses. In adult patients, influenza A virus was the most frequently detected respiratory virus followed by rhinoviruses. In contrast, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus in children, followed by enteroviruses, influenza A virus and coronavirus NL63. The small number of samples/patients does not allow us to draw any epidemiological conclusion. Altogether, the results of this study indicate that the 6 duplex PCR assays described in this study are sensitive, specific and cost-effective. Thus, this assay could be particularly useful to identify the main respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples, after nucleic acid extraction, and, also, to screen a large number of patients for epidemiological studies.","output":"Detection of 12 respiratory viruses by duplex real time PCR assays in respiratory samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In managing the Covid-16 pandemic, policy makers took actions which require the cooperation of individual citizens to succeed while the actions partially come at remarkable costs for individuals.

Herein, an Ir@IrNiO sample is prepared with single-atom (SA) Ir4+ doping and surface metallic Ir nanoparticles loaded onto the NiO. Owing to the bonding of the loaded Ir with surface-exposed Ni2+ , the nearby Ni atoms exist in the +3 valence state, that is, the surface-loaded Ir particles behave like a stabilizer for the Ni3+ sites. Under the synergistic effect of SA Ir4+ and high-valance-state Ni3+ , the Ir@IrNiO nanostructure effectively reduces the overpotential to 195 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 .

Following recent methodological developments in the research on the home advantage effect, four different statistical analysesCincluding Pollard's traditional methodCwere used for the assessment of the home advantage effect. There are two main findings. First, home teams were booked significantly more often with yellow cards for committing fouls in ghost games. Most importantly, this effect was independent of the course of the games. In contrast, bookings for other reasons (criticism and unfair sportsmanship) changed similarly for both home and away teams in ghost games. Second, the overall home performance and home advantage effect in the respective elite leaguesCidentified in the respective matches of the regular 2018/19 seasonCvanished in the ghost games of the 2019/20 season. We conclude that the lack of supporters in top European football during the COVID-19 pandemic led to decreased social pressure from the ranks on referees, which also had a potential impact on the home advantage. Referees assessed the play of home teams more objectively, leading to increased yellow cards awarded for fouls committed by the home teams.

Peri-urban settings in Kenya have been reported to exhibit higher rates of maternal death during labor and childbirth as compared to the general Kenyan population. Although research indicates that women in Kenya have increased access to facility-based birth in recent years, a small percentage still give birth outside of the health facility due to access challenges and poor maternal health service quality. Most studies assessing facility-based births have focused on the sociodemographic determinants of birthing location. Few studies have assessed women's user experiences and perceptions of quality of care during childbirth. Understanding women's experiences can provide different stakeholders with strategies to structure the provision of maternity care to be person-centered and to contribute to improvements in women's satisfaction with health services and maternal health outcomes. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted, whereby 70 women from the peri-urban area of Embakasi in the East side of Nairobi City in Kenya were interviewed. Respondents were aged 18 to 49 years and had delivered in a health facility in the preceding six weeks. We conducted in-depth interviews with women who gave birth at both public and private health facilities. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for analysis. Braune and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis were used to generate themes from the interview data. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the analysis.

They had negative experiences when they were mistreated, which was manifested as non-responsive care (including poor reception and long wait times), non-dignified care (including verbal and physical abuse lack of privacy and confidentiality), lack of respectful communication, and lack of supportive care (including being denied companions, neglect and abandonment, and poor facility environment). CONCLUSION: To sustain the gains in increased access to facility-based births, there is a need to improve person-centered care to ensure women have positive facility-based childbirth experiences.","output":"Exploring women's childbirth experiences and perceptions of delivery care in peri-urban settings in Nairobi, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hemodialyzed patients are at risk of multiple catheterizations.

Data was collected from the medical records of the COVID 19 ICUs of both hospitals from May 1, 2020 to April30, 2021. All charts were reviewed for the evidence of positive cultures. The treatment given prior to positive cultures, after the availability of culture results and outcomes were also recorded. Results: A total of 432 records were reviewed and 400 cases were included while 32 cases were excluded because of incomplete data. The frequency of infections per 1,000 days of ICU stay was calculated in 90 (22.5%) patients. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 68 cases (75.5%) with Pseudomonas in 44 cases (48.8%), Acinetobacter in 23/90 (25.5%) while 17 cases (18.8%) had gram positive infection with Enterococcus in 14/18 (77.77%) or 14/90 (15.55%), MRSA in 4/18 (22.22%) 4/90 (4.44%), while 5/90 (5.5%) had more than 2 isolates at same time.

We aimed to provide COVID-19 specific protocol optimization recommendations limiting ultrasound technologist exposure while optimizing patient selection. METHODS: A novel two-pronged algorithm was implemented to limit the DVT ultrasound studies on COVID-19 patients prospectively which included direct physician communication with the care team and a COVID-19 specific imaging protocol was instated to reduce ultrasound technologist exposure. In order to assess pretest risk of DVT, sensitivity and specificity of serum D-Dimer in 500-unit increments from 500 to 8000 ng/mL and a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) to assess performance of serum D-Dimer in predicting DVT was generated. Rates of DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE) and scan times were compared using t-test and Fishers exact test (before and after implementation of the protocol). RESULTS: Direct physician communication resulted in cancellation or deferral of 72% of requested exams in COVID-19 positive patients. A serum D-Dimer > 4000ng/mL yielded a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 70% (CI: 0.54-0.86) for venous thromboembolism. Using the COVID-19 specific protocol, there was a significant (50%) reduction in scan time (p<0.0001) in comparison with conventional protocol. CONCLUSION: A direct physician communication policy between imaging physician and referring physician resulted in deferral or cancellation of a majority of requested DVT ultrasound exams.

Physical health monitoring is shared between primary care and secondary mental healthcare services, though there is debate whether mental health teams should provide more physical healthcare. The views of mental health clinicians and patients with mental illness towards physical healthcare provision are unclear. AIMS To explore the attitudes of Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) clinicians and patients experiencing severe mental illness towards physical healthcare and its provision. DESIGN AND SETTING Qualitative study in a CMHT setting. METHODS Interviews were carried out with CMHT clinicians and patients with severe mental illness. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS There were 14 patients and 15 clinicians recruited. Patients varied in their awareness of the association between physical and mental health, but were engaged in physical health monitoring. Clinicians were aware of the importance of physical healthcare but reported barriers to provision, including lack of training, resource constraints and uncertainty in their role. There was no consensus in either group regarding how physical healthcare should be provided, with diverse attitudes expressed for why CMHTs should and shouldn't provide more physical healthcare. CONCLUSIONS Increasing physical healthcare provision from mental health teams requires healthcare-related barriers be addressed, but it remains unclear whether CMHT clinicians or patients believe this to be a solution.","output":"Attitudes to physical healthcare in severe mental illness; a patient and mental health clinician qualitative interview study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human airway epithelial (HAE) cellular models are widely used in applicative studies of the airway physiology and disease. In vitro expanded and differentiated primary HAE cells collected from patients seem to be an accurate model of human airway, offering a quicker and cheaper alternative to the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) models. However, the biggest drawback of primary HAE models is their limited proliferative lifespan in culture. Much work has been devoted to understand the factors, which govern the HAE cell proliferation and differentiation, both in vivo and in vitro. Here, I have summarized recent achievements in primary HAE culture, with the special emphasis on the models of conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRC), which allow longer in vitro proliferation and differentiation of HAE cells. The review compares the CRC HAE technique variants (feeder culture or HAE mono-culture), based on recently published studies exploiting this model. The advantages and limitations of each CRC HAE model variant are summarized, along with the description of other factors affecting the CRC HAE culture success (tissue type, sampling method, sample quality). CONCLUSIONS: CRC HAE cultures are a useful technique in respiratory research, which in many cases exceeds the iPSCs and organoid culture methods. Until the current limitations of the iPSCs and organoid culture methods will be alleviated, the primary CRC HAE cultures might be a useful model in respiratory research. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Airway epithelium (AE) is a type of tissue, which lines the whole length of human airways, from the nose to the bronchi. Improper functioning of AE causes several human airway disorders, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis (CF). Much work has been devoted to finding the best scientific model of human AE, in order to learn about its functioning in health and disease. Among the popular AE models are the primary in vitro cultured AE cells collected from human donors. Unfortunately, such human AE (HAE) cells do not easily divide (expand) in vitro; this poses a large logistic and ethical problem for the researchers. Here, I summarize recent achievements in the methods for in vitro culture of human AE cells, with special emphasis on the conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) models, which allow longer and more effective expansion of primary human AE cells in vitro. The review describes how the specific chemicals used in the CRC models work to allow the increased HAE divisions and compares the effects of the different so-far developed variants of the CRC HAE culture. The review also pinpoints the areas which need to be refined, in order to maximize the usefulness of the CRC AE cultures from human donors in research on human airway disorders.

It has been proposed that psychiatric disorders may be risk factors and/or consequences of COVID-19 infection. However, observational studies could be affected by confounding bias. MethodsWe performed bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders or traits. We employed the latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. A variety of MR methods including those accounting for horizontal pleiotropy were used. ResultsOverall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BD) (especially BD II), schizophrenia (SCZ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal thought (ST) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, liability to a few psychiatric traits/disorders, for example ADHD, alcohol and opioid use disorders may be causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, cannabis use disorder, ADHD, and anxiety showed significant and positive genetic correlation with critical or hospitalized infection. All the above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05. For pneumonia, in general we observed a different pattern of associations, with bi-directional positive associations with depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes. ConclusionsIn summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 (and severe infection) and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to evaluate the risk to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example, failure to thrive. There is a paucity of data regarding detection and characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in porcines in Ireland. Recently, a number of small novel porcine DNA viruses have emerged globally, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 & 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses which has been recently detected in humans and animals. METHODS: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 specimens were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a subset of specimens (n=44) were then examined individually. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. RESULTS: Initial screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three distinct groups in phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and lineage I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some specimens contained >1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm.

Preventive measures to avoid infections are therefore particularly important for individuals engaging in behavioral risk factors. We seek to determine whether behavioral risk factors (BRFs) play a significant role in the adherence to preventive COVID-19 measures in a population aged 50 and above. The SHARE wave 8 (Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe) and SHARE COVID-19 Survey served as the database, resulting in an analytical sample of 17,588 respondents from 23 European countries plus Israel. Of these 36.04% engaged in at least one BRF and 16.68% engaged in 3 or more BRFs. Multilevel logistic regressions revealed that engagement in one BRF was significantly associated with less adherence to hygiene preventive measures, i.e., hand-sanitizing, hand-washing and covering coughs and sneezes (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78; 0.94), as was engagement in two BRFs (OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.97) and three or more BRFs (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59; 0.88). No such association was found between engagement in BRFs and adherences to social isolation preventive measures, i.e., avoiding meeting more than five people, visiting others or going shopping, or regulated preventive measures, i.e., wearing a mask and keeping physical distance. The found association was also stronger when three or more BRFs were engaged in (1 vs. 3 BRFs: &#967;2 = 3.43, p = 0.06; 2 vs. 3 BRFs: &#967;2 = 6.05; p = 0.01).

To allow distinction between central and peripheral actions of interventions, experiments were conducted in both the DAPM and in a \\"pithed\\" DAPM which has no brainstem or spinal cord control. RESULTS Functional micturition cycles were observed in response to bladder filling. During each void, the bladder showed strong contractions and the external urethral sphincter (EUS) showed bursting activity. Both the frequency and amplitude of non-voiding contractions (NVCs) in DAPM and putative micromotions (pMM) in pithed DAPM increased with bladder filling. Vasopressin (>400 pM) caused dyssynergy of the LUT resulting in retention in DAPM as it increased tonic EUS activity and basal bladder pressure in a dose-dependent manner (basal pressure increase also noted in pithed DAPM). Both neuromuscular blockade (vecuronium) and autonomic ganglion blockade (hexamethonium), initially caused incomplete voiding, and both drugs eventually stopped voiding in DAPM. Intravesical acetic acid (0.2%) decreased the micturition interval.

Patients treated with the combination reached the composite outcome (intensive care unit [ICU] admission or death) less frequently compared with SOC (22.3% vs 36.9%, P = .002). Mortality rate was lower with the combination in the total cohort (14.7% vs 26.6%, P = .005), and ICU admission was lower in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (29.7% vs 44.8%, P = .03). By multivariable analysis, age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36C2.44, per 10-year increase), partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = .52C0.68, per 10 units increase), and use of high-flow nasal cannula (OR = 0.34; 95% CI, .16C0.74) were associated with the composite outcome, whereas baricitinib use was marginally not associated with the composite outcome (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, .26C1.03). However, baricitinib use was found to be significant after inverse-probability weighted regression (OR = 0.93; 95% CI, .87C0.99). No difference in serious events was noted between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: In real-life settings, addition of baricitinib to SOC in patients hospitalized with sCOVID-19 is associated with decreased mortality without concerning safety signals.","output":"Real-Life Effectiveness and Safety of Baricitinib as Adjunctive to Standard-of-Care Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in December 2019, more than 51 million cases had been reported globally. We aimed to identify the risk factors for in-hospital fatal outcome and severe pneumonia of this disease. This is a retrospective, multicentre study, which included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 with definite outcomes (died or discharged) hospitalized between 1 January and 4 March 2020 in Wuhan. Of all 665 patients included, 70 died and 595 discharged (including 333 mild and 262 severe cases). Underlying comorbidity was more commonly observed among deaths (72.9%) than mild (26.4%) and severe (61.5%) survivors, with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular as dominant diseases. Fever and cough were the primary clinical magnifications. Older age (&#8805;65 years) (OR = 3.174, 95% CI = 1.356-7.755), diabetes (OR = 2.540, 95% CI = 0.995-6.377), dyspnoea (OR = 7.478, 95% CI = 3.031-19.528), respiratory failure (OR = 10.528, 95% CI = 4.484-25.829), acute cardiac injury (OR = 25.103, 95% CI = 9.057-76.590) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 7.308, 95% CI = 1.501-46.348) were associated with in-hospital fatal outcome. In addition, older age (OR = 2.149, 95% CI = 1.424-3.248), diabetes (OR = 3.951, 95% CI = 2.077-7.788), cardiovascular disease (OR = 3.414, 95% CI = 1.432-8.799), nervous system disease (OR = 4.125, 95% CI = 1.252-18.681), dyspnoea (OR = 31.944, 95% CI = 18.877-92.741), achieving highest in-hospital temperature of >39.0C (OR = 37.450, 95% CI = 7.402-683.403) and longer onset of illness to diagnosis (&#8805;9 days) were statistically associated with higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.

METHODS: Any relevant studies with or without comparator were included, with outcomes of: COVID-19 incidence, hospitalisation rates, illness severity, death rates, other health and well-being. Six databases (platforms) were searchedCINAHL Plus (Ovid), Cochrane Central (Cochrane Library), Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Scopus between 2019 and 2020 in December 2020, using synonyms for sexual and gender minorities and COVID-19 search terms. Data extraction and quality assessment (using the relevant Joanna Briggs checklist) were in duplicate with differences resolved through discussion. Results were tabulated and synthesis was through narrative description. RESULTS: No published research was found on any outcomes. Eleven grey literature reports found to be of low quality were included, mostly conducted by small LGBT+ charities. Only four had heterosexual/cisgender comparators. Mental health and well-being, health behaviours, safety, social connectedness and access to routine healthcare all showed poorer or worse outcomes than comparators. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of research gives significant concern, given pre-existing health inequities. Social and structural factors may have contributed to poorer outcomes (mental health, well-being and access to healthcare). Paucity of evidence is driven by lack of routinely collected sexual orientation and gender identity data, possibly resulting from institutional homophobia/transphobia which needs to be addressed. Men are more at risk of serious illness from COVID-19 than women, so using data from trans women and men might have started to answer questions around whether higher rates were due to sex hormone or chromosomal effects. Routine data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity is required to examine the extent to which COVID-19 is widening pre-existing health inequalities.

The aim of this study was to explore the post-crisis psychological distress among residents in Taiwan after the SARS epidemic. Methods The target population consisted of a nationwide representative sample of residents aged  18 years. Data were collected using computer assisted telephone interview systems by stratified random sampling according to geographic area. The survey (n = 1278) was conducted in November 2003, about 4 months after resolution of the SARS crisis in Taiwan. The maximum deviation of sampling error at the 95% confidence level was  2.74%. Psychological distress was measured by a question related to subject's changes in perception of life, plus the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the correlation of psychological distress. Results About 9.2% of the participants reported that their perceptions of life became more pessimistic following the SARS crisis. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 11.7%. Major predictors of higher levels of pessimism after the SARS epidemic included demographic factors, perception of SARS and preparedness, knowing people or having personal experiences of SARS-related discrimination, and individual worries and psychiatric morbidity. The correlates of symptomatic cases, as indicated by the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, included age  50 years, senior high school graduate, and worries about recurrence of SARS. Conclusion Psychological distress was significantly correlated with demographic factors and perception regarding the SARS epidemic. It is suggested that marketing of mental health education should be segmented according to age and education level, which should enhance crisis communication for newly emerging infectious diseases among community populations.","output":"Population-based Post-crisis Psychological Distress: An Example From the SARS Outbreak in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies specifically designed to determine the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients are limited and based on case series, self-report questionnaires, and surveys. The objective of the study was to identify and classify the neuropsychological symptoms of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the first wave of the pandemic in one of the most important front-line tertiary hospitals from Spain, and to analyze its correlation with diagnosed mental disorders, as well as to explore potential risk factors associated with mental health problems. This observational, cohort study involved data from COVID-19 patients at the University Hospital 12 de Octubre (Madrid, Spain) from February to May 2020. First, patients underwent a semistructured phone interview (screening phase), based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Then the confirmation of the diagnosis (confirmation phase) was performed in patients who reported a mental disorder development or worsening. A factorial analysis was performed to identify groups of symptoms. A tetrachoric matrix was created, and factorial analysis, by a principal component analysis, was employed upon it. Factors showing values >1.0 were selected, and a varimax rotation was applied to these factors. Symptoms most frequently identified in patients were anosmia/ageusia (54.6%), cognitive complaints (50.3%), worry/nervousness (43.8%), slowing down (36.2%), and sadness (35.4%). Four factors were identified after the screening phase. The first (anxiety/depression) and second (executive dysfunction) factors explained 45.4 and 11.5% of the variance, respectively. Women, age between 50 and 60 years, duration in the hospital (more than 13 days), and psychiatric history showed significant higher levels (number of symptoms) in the factors. This study reports the factor structure of the psychiatric symptoms developed by patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 during the first wave of the COVID-19. Three item domains (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms) were loaded together on one factor, whereas sleep disturbance stood up as a separate factor. Interestingly, the item anosmia/ageusia was not captured by any factor. In conclusion, an increase in neuropsychiatric morbidity is expected in the upcoming months and years. Therefore, screening for early symptoms is the first step to prevent mental health problems associated with this pandemic.","output":"Neuropsychological Symptom Identification and Classification in the Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients During the First Wave of the Pandemic in a Front-Line Spanish Tertiary Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans automatically infer higher-order relationships between events in the environment from their statistical co-occurrence, often without conscious awareness. Neural replay of task representations, which has been described as sampling from a learned transition structure of the environment, is a candidate mechanism by which the brain could use or even learn such relational information in the service of adaptive behavior. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling revealed that participants acquired multi-step transition knowledge through gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model, although half of participants did not indicate any knowledge about the sequential task structure. To investigate neural replay, we analyzed dynamics of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns during short pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task. Evidence for sequential replay consistent with the probabilistic task structure was found in occipito-temporal and sensorimotor cortices during short on-task intervals. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task, and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.","output":"Statistical learning of successor representations is related to on-task replay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extracellular vesicles like exosomes are important therapeutic tactics for treating COVID -19.

This study explored the effect of protectionism (by measuring trade openness based on available data) on the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth. For this, the heterogenous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions were investigated using in data of 182 countries from 1990 to 2015. The results show that trade openness decreased carbon emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, while having no significant impact on carbon emissions of lower-middle-income countries; even worse, for low-income countries, trade openness increased carbon emissions. The heterogeneous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions indicate that trade openness positively impacts the decoupling economic growth from carbon emission in rich countries, but negatively impacts poor countries. In addition, increasing individual incomes and population distort the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. Renewable energy and high oil prices contributed to the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. These effects are similar in all countries.

Visit rates of psychiatric outpatients according to primary psychiatric diagnosis category before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were compared using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model. The temporal associations between the number of daily outpatient visits and the daily number of newly confirmed cases were examined by time-series analysis within each diagnosis category. RESULTS: Total daily outpatient visit rate was significantly reduced during the pandemic. Among the nine most prevalent diagnosis categories, the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were significantly reduced by about 29.8%, 14.8%, and 13.3% respectively. Time-series analysis showed significant temporal correlations between the daily number of newly confirmed cases and the daily visit rates for anxiety disorders and depressive disorders, whereas patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders showed no significant temporal association.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 33 previously healthy patients with persistent pulmonal symptoms after mild/moderate COVID-19 without hospitalization (median age, 39 years). We performed clinical evaluation including pulmonary function tests, computed tomography (CT), and serology for ANA/ENA. In 29 of 33 patients, transbronchial biopsies (TBBs) were taken for histopathological assessment. RESULTS: Most patients presented with disturbed oxygen pulse in spiroergometry and slight lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The CT pattern showed bronchial wall thickening and increased low-attenuation volume. Autoantibodies were detected in 13 of 33 patients (39.4%). Histopathological assessment showed interstitial lymphocytosis with alveolar fibrin and organizing pneumonia. Ultrastructural analyses revealed interstitial collagen deposition. CONCLUSION: While histopathology of pulmonary long-/post-COVID alone is unspecific, the combination with clinical and radiological features together with detection of autoantibodies would allow for a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Since we observe interstitial collagen deposition and since IPAF/CTD-ILD might progress to fibrosis, the persistence of autoantibodies and possible fibrotic change should be closely monitored in autoantibody-positive long-/post-COVID patients.","output":"Klinische, radiologische und histopathologische Merkmale des pulmonalen Post-COVID-Syndroms: Eine Form der autoimmunvermittelten interstitiellen Lungenerkrankung?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, New York City became an international epicenter for this highly infectious respiratory virus.

Recently, multiple preclinical and clinical studies have shown that tumor vasculature is a determinant of whether immunotherapy will elicit an antitumor response; thus, vascular targeting may be a promising strategy to improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes. A successful antitumor immune response requires an intact Cancer\\\\Immunity Cycle, including T cell priming and activation, immune cell recruitment, and recognition and killing of cancer cells.

The study aimed at exploring whether quantitative viral load of COVID-19-infected case indicated by cycle threshold (Ct) value of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction could predict about transmission pattern in the community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted involving 1976 individuals, suspected to be suffering from COVID-19 and contacts, of laboratory confirmed cases from selected districts of Gujarat, India. A total of 138 persons were detected to be positive. Weekly positivity showed an overall increasing trend during the studied weeks. It was observed that only 7% had high, 9% as moderate and rest, 84% had low viral load based on Ct values of real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Most secondary cases clustered around index cases with high viral load whereas fewer secondary cases clustered around index cases with low viral load. Each index high viral load case transmitted an average of 6.25 secondary cases whereas the same of low viral load transmitted an average of 0.8 case. CONCLUSION: If cases with higher viral load are selectively isolated on detection from the rest of the community along with contact tracing of all individuals, who came in contact with them during the previous 5 days, the quantum of transmission will reduce subsequently. Moreover, health-care workers often get infected while working, probably due to the fact that they often handle cases with higher viral load. The Ct value of all may be provided along with test report to safeguard everybody's health including health-care workers.","output":"Initial Viral Load of a COVID-19-Infected Case Indicated by its Cycle Threshold Value of Polymerase Chain Reaction Could be used as a Predictor of its Transmissibility - An Experience from Gujarat, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of 2019, a new viral infection appeared in China that spread throughout the world causing a pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of CP plus standard therapy (ST) vs ST alone in preventing worsening respiratory failure or death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled (1:1 ratio) hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to receive CP plus ST or ST alone between July 15 and December 8, 2020, at 27 clinical sites in Italy. Hospitalized adults with COVID-19 pneumonia and a partial pressure of oxygenCtoCfraction of inspired oxygen (Pao(2)/Fio(2)) ratio between 350 and 200 mm Hg were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the experimental group received intravenous high-titer CP (1:160, by microneutralization test) plus ST. The volume of infused CP was 200 mL given from 1 to a maximum of 3 infusions. Patients in the control group received ST, represented by remdesivir, glucocorticoids, and lowCmolecular weight heparin, according to the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco recommendations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of worsening respiratory failure (Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio <150 mm Hg) or death within 30 days from randomization. RESULTS: Of the 487 randomized patients (241 to CP plus ST; 246 to ST alone), 312 (64.1%) were men; the median (IQR) age was 64 (54.0-74.0) years. The modified intention-to-treat population included 473 patients.

The fourth-generation theories, e.g., multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change, are vital in developing behavioral interventions. Therefore, the current study aims to determine recent trends in COVID-19 vaccination rates and to test the MTM model in predicting the initiation of COVID-19 vaccines among vaccine-hesitant Blacks. A sample of 428 unvaccinated African Americans were recruited through a web-based survey using a 28-item psychometric valid questionnaire. Chi-square, independent-samples-t-test or Welchs t test, and Pearsons correlation tests were utilized for the analyses. Hierarchical regression modelling was performed to determine the increment in variation accounted for through addition of predictors over a set of models. Nearly 48% of unvaccinated Blacks reported being vaccine-hesitant. The vaccine-hesitant group was relatively younger (40.5 years  15.8 vs. 46.2 years  17.4, p < 0.001), were Republicans (22.1% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.001), lived in the North-East region (26.0% vs. 11.4%, p < 0.001) and had religious affiliations other than Christianity (21.2% vs. 13.6%, p = 0.04).

The role of canine personality on this predisposition is unknown. This study used a test where dogs encountered an unsolvable problem. The aim of the study was to understand whether dog personalities could predict their tendency to look at the owner, approach and engage with the task, and show distress during the task. We also compared dogs with life experience in Animal Assistance Interventions and dogs with no work, training, or sport experience. The results indicate that the dogs with a personality more sensitive to uncertain situations looked at the owner more and engaged less often with the task, suggesting they were expecting directions from the owner. Dogs with a personality more sensitive to obtaining rewards and avoiding punishment looked at the owner less often. Dogs with a high tendency to avoid punishment also abandoned and returned more often to the task, possibly as a sign of frustration. Finally, Animal-Assisted Intervention dogs looked more at the owner and had fewer task orientations, confirming the enhancing effect on looking. As personality differences reflect genetic predispositions, it is very important to know the role of personality on cognitive traits that are important to dogs that work and collaborate with humans. ABSTRACT: Dogs are biologically predisposed to communicate with humans in cooperative contexts. They show individual differences in dogChuman communication and inhibition, potentially enhanced by life experience, e.g., Animal-Assisted Interventions. This study aimed to investigate whether dogs personality, defined by biologically meaningful neural circuits described in the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality (RST), predicted dogs communication, task orientation, emotional state, and approach of an unsolvable task. We also investigated the differences between dogs experienced in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) and inexperienced dogs. The results indicated that a high sensitivity to the RST personality trait related to managing uncertainty (Behavioural Inhibition System, BIS) predicted fewer task orientations but increased referential and non-referential looking, which we interpreted as a way to obtain directions from the owner. Conversely, a high sensitivity to the traits reflecting tendencies to approach rewards (Behavioural Approach System, BAS) and avoid punishment (FightCFlightCFreeze System, FFFS) predicted lower looking. High sensitivity to the FFFS also predicted more frequent task orientations, which we interpreted as frustration. Finally, the dogs in the AAI program looked more at their owner and were less oriented towards the task. These results provide empirical evidence of individual differences tied to the psychobiological personality traits in canine cognitive skills. Understanding such cognitive profiles may have an enormous impact on activities that rely upon dogChuman collaborative interaction.","output":"Personality and Cognitive Profiles of Animal-Assisted Intervention Dogs and Pet Dogs in an Unsolvable Task"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes tremendous economic losses to the poultry industry.

We find that interventions focused on these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection rate and the total infected population while retaining high social activity levels. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad sweeping interventions, more heterogeneous strategies that are targeted based on the network effects in human mobility provide a better balance between pandemic control and regular social activities.","output":"Heterogeneous interventions reduce the spread of COVID-19 in simulations on real mobility data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019-2020 global pandemic has been caused by a disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Currently, there are various computer-based approaches that present COVID-19 data through different types of charts, which is very useful to recognise its behavior and trends. Nevertheless, such approaches do not allow for observation of any projection regarding confirmed cases and deaths, which would be useful to understand the trends of COVID-19.

Material and methods. The retrospective study was conducted on the basis of an epidemiological analysis of official statistics as part of the epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021. Results and discussion. At the beginning of April 2021, a total of 13 308 cases of COVID-19 were registered, of which the proportion of recovered was 99.3% (13 218 cases), and the number of cases with a fatal outcome was 0.68% (90 cases;the average age of the deceased was 62.30.07 years). The peak of infection during the first wave occurred in May and June 2020, when the average daily increase was 97 people. For 2 months of the epidemic in the republic, 44.6% of the total number of patients with COVID-19 became infected, and the number of deaths reached 52 people or 57.7%. Among the patients, men prevailed (65%). The largest number of deaths (76.7%;n=69) was among older people with comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, metabolic syndrome, etc.). An analysis of the age structure showed that the main proportion of cases fell on the age group of 40-60 years (42.6%). It was found that a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 was detected in the Sughd region (33.0%) and Dushanbe (30.1%). Conclusion. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that the national healthcare system of the Republic of Tajikistan was not sufficiently prepared for such a development of the COVID-19 epidemic process. There was an acute shortage of medical and preventive specialists in the republic. Given the current situation in the Republic of Tajikistan, within the framework of epidemiological surveillance, the features of the course of the COVID-19 epidemic process were analyzed, adequate emergency measures were developed and proposed to limit the spread of the virus and reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 on public health. The number of beds has been reasonably expanded, the capacity of the laboratory service has been increased, mass vaccination of the population has been started according to epidemic indications. ? 2022 Geotar Media Publishing Group","output":"Features of the course and medical and social aspects of a new coronavirus infection in the Republic of Tajikistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chemistry laboratory experiments are invaluable to students acquisition of necessary synthetic, analytical, and instrumental skills during their undergraduate studies. However, the COVID-19 pandemic rendered face-to-face (f2f), in-person teaching laboratory experiences impossible from late 2019C2020 and forced educators to rapidly develop new solutions to deliver chemistry laboratory education remotely. Unfortunately, achieving learning and teaching objectives to the same caliber of in-person experiments is very difficult through distance learning. To overcome these hurdles, educators have generated many virtual and remote learning options for not only foundational chemistry courses but also laboratory experiments. Although the pandemic challenged high-level chemistry education, it has also created an opportunity for both students and educators to be more cognizant of virtual learning opportunities and their potential benefits within chemistry curriculum. Irrespective of COVID-19, virtual learning techniques, especially virtual lab experiments, can complement f2f laboratories and offer a cost-efficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable alternative to their in-person counterparts. Implementation of virtual and distance learning techniquesincluding kitchen chemistry and at-home laboratories, prerecorded videos, live-stream video conferencing, digital lab environment, virtual and augmented reality, and otherscan provide a wide-ranging venue to teach chemistry laboratories effectively and encourage diversity and inclusivity in the field. Despite their relevance to real-world applications and potential to expand upon fundamental chemical principles, polymer lab experiments are underrepresented in the virtual platform. Polymer chemistry education can help prepare students for industrial and academic positions. The impacts of polymers in our daily life can also promote students interests in science and scientific research. Hence, the translation of polymer lab experiments into virtual settings improves the accessibility of polymer chemistry education.

Such individualisation is possible and necessary, given the known inter-individual variation in cycle length. To achieve this, a hybrid predictive model was built using data on 16,524 cycles collected from a sample of 2125 women (mean age 34.38 years, range 18.00C47.10, number of menstrual cycles ranging from 4 to 53). A mixed-effect state-space model was fitted to capture the within-subject temporal correlation, incorporating a Bayesian approach for process forecasting to predict the duration (in days) of the next menstrual cycle. The modelling procedure was split into three steps (1) a time trend component using a random walk with an overdispersion parameter, (2) an autocorrelation component using an autoregressive moving-average model, and (3) a linear predictor to account for covariates (e.g. injury, stomach cramps, training intensity). The inclusion of an overdispersion parameter suggested that [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] of cycles in the sample were overdispersed. The random walk standard deviation for a non-overdispersed cycle is [Formula: see text] [1.00, 1.09] days while under an overdispersed cycle, the menstrual cycle variance increase in 4.78 [4.57, 5.00] days. To assess the performance and prediction accuracy of the model, each womans last observation was used as test data. The root mean square error (RMSE), concordance correlation coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the observed and predicted values were calculated. The model had an RMSE of 1.6412 days, a precision of 0.7361 and overall accuracy of 0.9871.

Understanding the natural history of CVD in Haitians, including the age of onset, prevalence, incidence, and role of major risk factors and social determinants, is urgently needed to develop prevention and treatment interventions. Aim 1: Establish a population-based cohort of 3000 adults from Port-au-Prince and assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors and diseases and their association with social and environmental determinants. Aim 2: Determine the incidence of CVD risk factors and CVD during 2C3.5 years of follow-up and their association with social and environmental determinants. METHODS: The Haiti CVD Cohort is a longitudinal observational study of 3000 adults > 18 years in Port-au-Prince (PAP), Haiti. The study population is recruited using multistage random sampling from census blocks. Adults receive blood pressure (BP) measurements in the community and those with elevated BP are referred to the Groupe Haitien dEtude Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes Clinic for care. After informed consent, participants undergo a clinical exam with medical history. BP, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, a study questionnaire on health behaviors, and laboratory specimens. Every 6 months, BP is remeasured. At 12 and 24 months, clinical exams and questionnaires are repeated. Labs are repeated at 24 months. Adjudicated study outcomes include the prevalence and incidence of CVD risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, inflammation, poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity) and events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and CVD mortality). We also measure social determinants including poverty. Depression, stress, social isolation, food insecurity, and lead exposure. Blood, urine, and stool samples are biobanked at study enrollment. DISCUSSION: The Haiti CVD Cohort is the largest population-based cohort study evaluating CVD risk factors and CVD among adults in urban Haiti with the goal of understanding the drivers of the CVD epidemic in Haiti. Study outcomes are comparable with existing international cohorts, and the biobank will provide important data for future research.

Significantly, Cts L has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19 due to its recently unveiled critical role in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. However, there are currently no clinically approved specific inhibitors of Cts L, as it is often challenging to obtain specificity against the many highly homologous cathepsin family cysteine proteases. Peptide-based agents are often promising protease inhibitors as they offer high selectivity and potency, but unfortunately are subject to degradation in vivo. Thioamide substitution, a single-atom O-to-S modification in the peptide backbone, has been shown to improve the proteolytic stability of peptides addressing this issue. Utilizing this approach, we demonstrate herein that good peptidyl substrates can be converted into sub-micromolar inhibitors of Cts L by a single thioamide substitution in the peptide backbone. We have designed and scanned several thioamide stabilized peptide scaffolds, in which one peptide, RS1A, was stabilized against proteolysis by all five cathepsins (Cts L, Cts V, Cts K, Cts S, and Cts B) while inhibiting Cts L with >25-fold specificity against the other cathepsins. We further showed that this stabilized RS1A peptide could inhibit Cts L in human liver carcinoma lysates (IC50 = 19 M). Our study demonstrates that one can rationally design a stabilized, specific peptidyl protease inhibitor by strategic placement of a thioamide and reaffirms the place of this single-atom modification in the toolbox of peptide-based rational drug design.

We modelled the effects of enforced inactivity on diabetes burden using published evidence. Methods: Using Health Survey for England data, we estimated the prevalence of pre-diabetes and physical activity in adults aged 70 and older. The number of new diabetes cases directly attributed to lockdown were calculated using population attributable risk. Unit cost estimates of the additional burden on primary care and the cost of complications to secondary care were taken from the literature. Results: From 9 million older (aged 70yrs and above) people living in England, 2.1 million could be defined as pre-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin > 42 < 48 mmol/mol). The estimated population attributable fraction (0.281) (assuming relative risk of diabetes from inactivity, 3.3; 40% physically active pre-lockdown) would give rise to 392,948 new cases of diabetes which we argue are directly attributed to a prolonged period of lockdown. We estimate that the cost of screening and testing these patients in primary care (GBP 35m), their subsequent treatment and management (GBP 229m), and complications (GBP 909m) would equate to an additional GBP 1.17bn to the health care system.

Gender-, culture-, and age-specific interventions are needed to end the HIV epidemic. The Womens CoOp (WC) is an HIV riskCreduction intervention that is proven to be efficacious in various face-to-face formats. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt the delivery method of an evidence-based intervention, the WC, from an in-person format to a self-guided mobile health (mHealth) format while ensuring that core elements are maintained for intervention comparability and fidelity. METHODS: Several adaptation phases were conducted by using the Personal Health Informatics and Intervention Toolkit (PHIT) as a guiding point to create the mobile app version of the WC. Throughout 5 phases, we established the implementation groundwork for the app; conducted formative research activities to test the initial draft of the app and obtain feedback; applied the PHIT toolkit programming structure to produce the mHealth version of the WC intervention; conducted usability testing and pretesting with interested parties, followed by in-house testing by WC interventionists and PHIT developers; and deployed the app to tablets and distributed it to study participants. The app underwent regular maintenance updates during the study. RESULTS: The team converted the seven elements of the WC as accurately as possible for comparability to determine efficacy in a mobile app format while changing little about the basic delivery methods. For instance, cue card presentations of the materials delivered by the intervention staff were presented within the app but with voice-over narration and in a self-guided format rather than being led by a staff member. Other aspects of the intervention did not lend themselves to such straightforward adaptation, such as hands-on condom proficiency practice and one-on-one goal-setting activities. In these cases, the subject matter experts and app developers worked together to find comparable analogs to be used within the app. Once developed, tested, and finalized, the mHealth WC app was deployed into local health departments as part of a randomized trial. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic adaptation process created an accurate mHealth equivalent of an existing, in-person behavioral health intervention. Although participants reception of the app during the formative developmental phase was overall positive, maintaining fidelity to the in-person delivery compromised the natural capabilities of a mobile app, such as further gamification, different types of interactivity, and integrated notifications and messaging, which could be helpful for participants adherence to the intervention schedule. Given the development and implementation of the app, the next step is to examine the impact of the app and its efficacy in HIV and substance use risk-reduction.","output":"An Evidence-Based HIV RiskCReduction Intervention for Young African American Women in the US South Using mHealth: Adaptation and Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for mortality in COVID-19, there have been lack of studies in low- and middle-income countries, including Indonesia. To date, the country has the highest mortality rate among Asian countries. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify the prognostic factors of mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Jakarta. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (18 years old) with confirmed COVID-19 from Koja General Hospital (North Jakarta, Indonesia) who had been hospitalized between March 20(th) and July 31(st), 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiology data were extracted from the medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to explore the prognostic factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-three patients were included in the study, of whom 32 died.

OBJECTIVES To analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths. METHODS Certain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy. The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables. RESULTS Using least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P < 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm. CONCLUSIONS The results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19. Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic.","output":"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination Policy and Consumption of Ammonium Chloride-Enriched Confectioneries May Be Factors Reducing COVID-19 Death Rates in Europe."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is problematic in acute-care settings, particularly in the presence of infective comorbidities.

Subjects aged 40-75 years with or without symptoms of respiratory disease who had no chronic respiratory condition apart from COPD, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, were recruited into the study. The algorithm analysed five cough sounds and four patient-reported clinical symptoms providing a diagnosis in less than one minute. Clinical diagnoses were determined by a specialist physician using all available case notes, including spirometry where available. The algorithm demonstrated high percent agreement (PA) with reference clinical diagnosis for COPD in the total cohort (n=252, Positive PA=93.8%, Negative PA=77.0%, AUC=0.95); in subjects with pneumonia or infective exacerbations of COPD (n=117, PPA=86.7%, NPA=80.5%, AUC=0.93) and in subjects without an infective comorbidity (n=135, PPA=100.0%, NPA=74.0%, AUC=0.97.) In those who had their COPD confirmed by spirometry (n=229), PPA = 100.0% and NPA = 77.0%, AUC=0.97. The algorithm demonstrates high agreement with clinical diagnosis and rapidly detects COPD in subjects presenting with or without other infective lung illnesses.

To investigate this relationship, CRP was examined in serum and saliva samples from 18 septic neonates and compared with saliva samples from 22 healthy neonates. While the measured blood and saliva concentrations of the septic neonates varied individually, a correlation of CRP levels between serum and saliva samples was observed over time. To clarify the presence of active transport of CRP across the bloodCsalivary barrier (BSB), transport studies were performed with CRP using in vitro models of oral mucosa and submandibular salivary gland epithelium. The results showed enhanced transport toward saliva in both models, supporting the clinical relevance for salivary CRP as a biomarker. Furthermore, CRP regulated the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the addition of soluble RAGE during the transport studies indicated a RAGE-dependent transport process for CRP from blood to saliva.","output":"Directed Transport of CRP Across In Vitro Models of the Blood-Saliva Barrier Strengthens the Feasibility of Salivary CRP as Biomarker for Neonatal Sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telehealth (e.g., the delivery and facilitation of health and health-related services via telecommunications and digital communication technologies) has been evolving for the past two decades.

We investigated household secondary attack rate (SAR), transmission dynamics, and contributing factors in households with children. Materials and Methods: In this prospective case-ascertained study in Los Angeles County, California, all households members were enrolled if 1 member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nasopharyngeal PCRs, serology, and symptom data were obtained over multiple visits. Results: A total of 489 individuals in 105 households were enrolled from June to December 2020. The majority (77.3%) reported a household annual income of <$50,000, and most (92.9%) were of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Children <18 years old accounted for 46.9% index cases, of whom 45.3% were asymptomatic. Household index cases were predominantly children during low community transmission and adults during the high community transmission period ((2) = 7.647, p = 0.0036. The mean household SAR was 77.0% (95% CI: 69.4C84.6%). Child and adult index cases both efficiently transmitted SARS-CoV-2 within households [81.9%, (95% CI: 72.1C91.9%) vs. 72.4% (95% CI: 59.8C85.1%), p = 0.23]. Household income and pets were significantly associated with higher SAR in the multivariable analysis of household factors (p = 0.0013 and 0.004, respectively). Conclusions: The SAR in households with children in an urban setting with a large ethnic minority population is much higher than previously described. Children play important roles as index cases. SAR was disproportionately impacted by household income. Vaccination and public health efforts need special focus on children and vulnerable communities to help mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Dynamics in Households With Children, Los Angeles, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The evaluation and risk stratification of patients with TIA/non-disabling ischemic stroke (TIA/NDS) arriving to the Emergency Department (ED) incurs high-cost imaging and increases ED length of stay (EDLOS). We evaluated the safety and feasibility of an ED-toOutpatient Pathway for TIA/NDS. Methods: In April 2020, we developed a risk stratification algorithm for TIA/NDS in the ED using features of the clincal presentation, limited blood tests, telemetry, and head-neck CT/CTA. Patients deemed low risk based on a 'safety checklist' were discharged with plans for expedited outpatient testing as warranted (e.g., brain MRI, echocardiogram) followed by rapid outpatient follow-up. To assess safety/feasibility of this pathway, we analyzed data of the first 101 patients prospectively enrolled through October 2020. Results: Mean age 68 years (range, 33-99);53% men;median NIHSS score 0 (range 0-3). Symptom duration was classified as <10 min (24%), 10-59 min (23%), >60 min (49%), unclear (4%). Deficits included isolated weakness (16%), isolated aphasia (15%), amaurosis fugax (6%), numbness/combined deficits/other (63%). Median ABCD2 score 3 (range 1-7). Outpatient follow-up included stroke clinic (82%), primary care (4%), not required or patient declined (6%), other hospital (1%);7% were lost to follow-up;43% had follow-up within 7 days. Imaging performed in the ED included CT/CTA only (39%), MRI/MRA only (27%), both (33%), or no imaging (1%). EDLOS was significantly less for patients when CT/CTA only was performed, as per pathway (12.8 versus 16.8 hours, p<0.05). The safety checklist was followed in 69% of patients. When the checklist was used properly, there were 0 recurrent strokes or TIAs within 90-days (versus 2 when not used correctly, p<0.05). Return rates to the ED were 8% with use of checklist and 6% without use (p=0.76). Conclusion: Our TIA/NDS pathway, implemented shortly after the outbreak of Covid-19 in the USA, significantly decreased EDLOS, and still allowed for TIA/NDS patients to be safely discharged from the ED. Acceptable risk stratification and safety is suggested by the low rates of recurrent events when the pathway was followed properly.

AIMS To provide additional information which may help clinicians target IPC on the most appropriate patients by exploring the variation in its effects on subgroups defined by predicted prognosis. METHODS A multicentre, parallel group, randomized trial enrolled immobile acute stroke patients and allocated them to IPC or no IPC. The primary outcome was proximal DVT at 30 days. Secondary outcomes at six-months included survival, disability, quality of life, and hospital costs. We stratified patients into quintiles according to their predicted prognosis at randomization, based on the Six Simple Variable model. RESULTS Between December 2008 and September 2012, we enrolled 2876 patients in 94 UK hospitals. Patients with the best predicted outcome had the lowest absolute risk of proximal DVT (67%) and death by six-months (93%). Allocation to IPC had little effect on DVT, survival, disability, quality of life, hospital length of stay, or costs. In patients with the worst predicted outcomes, the overall risk of DVT and death was 160% and 513%, respectively. IPC reduced DVT (odds reduction 34%) and improved survival 17% and significantly increased length of stay and hospital costs. In the three intermediate quintiles, IPC reduced the odds of DVT (35-43%) and improved survival (11-13%). Disability and quality of life at six-months depended on baseline severity but was not influenced significantly by IPC. CONCLUSIONS IPC appears to reduce the risk of DVT and probably improves survival in all immobile stroke patients, other than the fifth with the best prognosis. It therefore seems reasonable to recommend that IPC should be considered in all immobile stroke patients, but that the final decision should be based on a judgment about the individual's prognosis. In some, their prognosis for survival with an acceptable quality of life will be so poor that use of IPC might be considered futile, while at the other end of the spectrum, patients' risk of DVT, and of dying from VTE, may not be high enough to justify the modest cost and inconvenience of IPC use.","output":"Which stroke patients gain most from intermittent pneumatic compression: further analyses of the CLOTS 3 trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To describe the experiences of Italian nurses who have been urgently and compulsorily allocated to a newly established COVID-19 sub-intensive care unit.

For example, using digital proxies of mobile devices/apps may only partially reflect the movement of individuals; using the mobility of the general public and not COVID-19 patients in particular, or only using places where patients were diagnosed to study the spread of the virus may not be accurate; existing studies have focused on either the regional or national spread of COVID-19, and not the spread at the city level; and there are no systematic approaches for understanding the stages of transmission to facilitate the policy-making to contain the spread.

METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional survey research design was used to collect quantitative data from a representative sample of healthcare workers in Dire Dawa, Haramaya, and Harar towns of Eastern Ethiopia. The correctly filled questionnaires were selected and entered into SPSS software for further analysis, where frequency tables, percentages, mean, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used in the process. RESULTS: The findings revealed that most (61.6%) of the research participants are willing to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine, and 10.3% reported that they have not decided yet. Moreover, the main reason for respondents lack of intention to receive the second round of COVID-19 vaccine is the belief that the first round of COVID-19 vaccine is sufficient to prevent infection (27.8%) followed by concern over the safety or side effects of the vaccine (26.6%).

METHODS: Studies were selected based on predefined exclusion criteria and were assessed for quality. Only prospective, randomized, controlled studies of high quality were included in the final analysis. Data were extracted on demographics, AE, indication, delivery method and follow-up duration. RESULTS: Out of 334 articles reviewed, 9 high quality studies with 756 FMTs were selected for final analysis. The pooled rate of AE was 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.642) as they were reported by 112 patients who received FMT. The SAE rate was 5.3% (95%CI 3.1-8.8%). The most common AE reported was abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea. The most common SAE was Clostridium difficile infection. Upper gastrointestinal tract delivery was associated with a higher rate of total AE, but not SAE. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the selected studies, the AE rate of FMT is 39.3%, with most AE being mild and self-limiting. SAE were uncommon at 5.3%, and many were only possibly related to the FMT.

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) detects pulmonary infiltrates with high sensitivity, but findings may be non-specific. This study assesses the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 serology for patients with distinct CT features but negative PCR. METHODS: IgM/IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay was performed for 107 patients with confirmed (group A: PCR + ; CT ) and 46 patients with suspected (group B: repetitive PCR-; CT +) COVID-19, admitted to a German university hospital during the pandemics first wave. A standardized, in-house CT classification of radiological signs of a viral pneumonia was used to assess the probability of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seroconversion rates (SR) determined on day 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 after symptom onset (SO) were 8%, 25%, 65%, 76% and 91% for group A, and 0%, 10%, 19%, 37% and 46% for group B, respectively; (p < 0.01). Compared to hospitalized patients with a non-complicated course (non-ICU patients), seroconversion tended to occur at lower frequency and delayed in patients on intensive care units. SR of patients with CT findings classified as high certainty for COVID-19 were 8%, 22%, 68%, 79% and 93% in group A, compared with 0%, 15%, 28%, 50% and 50% in group B (p < 0.01).

Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology was superior to PCR > 17d after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients with distinct COVID-19 CT findings are tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR rendering correct diagnosis difficult. Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing alongside current CT/PCR-based diagnostic algorithms improves discrimination between COVID-19-related and non-related pulmonary infiltrates in PCR negative patients.

Blood hydroperoxides, as oxidative stress biomarkers, were assessed by Free Oxygen Radical Test (FORT). Serum hsCRP was determined by an ultra-sensitive method (hsCRP). Markedly elevated oxidative stress (400 FORT Units) was found in 77.0% of OC-users and 1.6% of non-OC-users, odds ratio (OR) = 209, 95% CI = 60.9-715.4, p < 0.001.

METHODS: The Palliative Assessment of Needed DEvelopments &Modifications In the Era of Coronavirus (PANDEMIC) cross-sectional online survey was posted on 7 professional listservs between May and June, 2020. We conducted a conventional content analysis of written responses to three open-ended questions regarding the lasting impact of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 207 multidisciplinary respondents from 80 U.S. cities, 148 (71%) provided written responses to open-ended questions and 62 responses (42%) were related to personal, professional, or existential well-being. These responses were sorted into 4 major categories: personal burdens, professional burdens, personal benefits, and professional benefits. Respondents described burdens more commonly than they did benefits (67% versus 33% of comments, respectively). Personal burdens related to increased fear and uncertainty, fear of bringing the virus home, and a sense of collective grief. Professional burdens included a sense of exhaustion, a challenge with work-life balance, personal experiences with colleagues infected with the virus, and considerations of leaving healthcare altogether. Personal benefits included lessons-learned, an evolving sense of what matters, and improved work-life balance. Professional benefits included opportunities for professional development and a sense of professional purpose.

Engineering selective inhibitors based upon tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), endogenous human proteins that tightly yet nonspecifically bind to the family of MMPs, represents a promising new avenue for therapeutic development. Here, we used a counter-selective screening strategy for directed evolution of yeast-displayed human TIMP-1 to obtain TIMP-1 variants highly selective for the inhibition of MMP-3 in preference over MMP-10. As MMP-3 and MMP-10 are the most similar MMPs in sequence, structure, and function, our results thus clearly demonstrate the capability for engineering full-length TIMP proteins to be highly selective MMP inhibitors. We show using protein crystal structures and models of MMP-3-selective TIMP-1 variants bound to MMP-3 and counter-target MMP-10 how structural alterations within the N-terminal and C-terminal TIMP-1 domains create new favorable and selective interactions with MMP-3 and disrupt unique interactions with MMP-10. While our MMP-3-selective inhibitors may be of interest for future investigation in diseases where this enzyme drives pathology, our platform and screening strategy can be employed for developing selective inhibitors of additional MMPs implicated as therapeutic targets in disease.","output":"Engineering of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases TIMP-1 for fine discrimination between closely related stromelysins MMP-3 and MMP-10"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemiological history and clinical characteristics of 7 cases of COVID-19 and 1 case of close contact in the first family aggregation epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu Province were analyzed.

METHODS We conducted interviews with 15 patients with ESLD and 14 informal caregivers. We used semi-structured interview guides to explore their experiences since the diagnosis of ESLD including their care transitions. Two raters coded interviews independently ( = 0.95) using template analysis. RESULTS Participants reported feeling unprepared to manage their informational, psychosocial, and practical care needs as they transitioned from hospital to home after the diagnosis of ESLD. Delay in the timely receipt of supportive care services addressing these care needs resulted in hospital readmissions, emotional distress, caregiver burnout, reduced work capacity, and financial hardship. Participants shared the following resources that they perceived would improve their quality of care: (1) discharge checklist, (2) online resources, (3) mental health support, (4) caregiver support and training, and (5) financial navigation. CONCLUSION Transitional care models that attend to the informational, psychosocial, and practical domains of care are needed to better support patients with ESLD and their caregivers at the time of diagnosis and beyond.

This has led to an ever-growing need for caregiving. Previous literature has shown that caregivers face problems of isolation and loneliness. However, many health organizations mainly focus their efforts on in-person community groups that require participants to meet physically. This is not always convenient or accessible for caregivers who are often juggling caring for their care recipient with family and work responsibilities. Objective: With medical advancements such as the proliferation of mobile phones and internet technology, caregivers may have opportunities for easier access to resources and support. Technological innovations could help empower the caregiving community to seek assistance for improving their quality of life at their convenience. A community network app called Caregivers Circle was conceptualized in response to the needs of the caregivers on a day-to-day caregiving journey. This paper traces the predevelopment inquiry and technical details of this app to provide a clear understanding of its implementation along with a usability study to gauge user opinion of the app within Singapore. Methods: A predevelopment survey was conducted to identify specific needs of caregivers and gaps in the currently available web-based community networks. The survey consisted of questions on demographical data, health-related issues of the care recipient, mental and physical healthCrelated issues of the caregiver, digital media use, information seeking, and support. This preCapp development survey was completed by 103 caregivers. Qualitative enquiries were also conducted with caregivers within Singapore to identify issues related to caregiving, support provided, and what caregivers would want from a caregiving mobile app. Results: From the feedback garnered from the caregivers, the developers were able to identify several caregivers needs and gaps within the current support networks. This feedback was integrated into the mobile app called Caregivers Circle upon development. The features of this app include a public forum for community discussions, a marketplace to buy and sell items, care groups to hold private discussions with friends or other users of the app, and a friends feature to search and add new caregiving friends. Conclusions: In general, the caregivers liked the Caregivers Circle app and were confident that this app could help them have a better quality of life. The Caregivers Circle app is unique in its integrated approach. The integration of many features that caregivers need on a daily basis into an easy app can save their time as well as help them navigate their life smoothly.","output":"A Digital Mobile Community App for Caregivers in Singapore: Predevelopment and Usability Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO declared the COVID-19 Pandemic on 12th March, 2020.

We summarize the currently available evidence on the relationship between altitude/hypoxia conditions and COVID\\\\19 epidemiology and pathophysiology. The potential for treatment strategies used for altitude illnesses is evaluated. Symptomatic overlaps in the pathophysiology of COVID\\\\19 induced ARDS and high altitude illnesses (i.e., hypoxemia, dyspnea) have been reported but are also common to other pathologies (i.e., heart failure, pulmonary embolism, COPD). Most treatments of altitude illnesses have limited value and may even be detrimental in COVID\\\\19. Some may be efficient, potentially the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Physiological adaptations to altitude/hypoxia can exert diverse effects, depending on the constitution of the target individual and the hypoxic dose. In healthy individuals, they may optimize oxygen supply and increase mitochondrial, antioxidant, and immune system function. It is highly debated if these physiological responses to hypoxia overlap in many instances with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection and may exert preventive effects under very specific conditions.

Our study aims to assess the early impact of COVID-19 lockdown on violent and accidental deaths in Peru. Methods: Based on data from the Peruvian National Death Information System, an interrupted time series analysis was performed to assess the immediate impact and change in the trend of COVID-19 lockdown on external causes of death including homicide, suicide, and traffic accidents. The analysis was stratified by sex and the time unit was every 15 days. Results: All forms of deaths examined presented a sudden drop after the lockdown. The biggest drop was in deaths related to traffic accidents, with a reduction of 12.66 deaths per million men per month (95% CI: -15.56, -9.76) and 3.64 deaths per million women per month (95% CI:-5.25, -2.03). Homicide and suicide presented similar level drop in women, while the homicide reduction was twice the size of the suicide reduction in men. The slope in suicide in men during the lock-down period increased by 3.62 deaths per million men per year (95% CI:0.06, 7.18). No other change in slope was detected.

Methods: : Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats. Results: : A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, medical history, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined.

Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic with an increasing incidence in several countries. Speed and accuracy of diagnosis are needed to prevent worsening of patient's condition. Real-Time Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is still a gold standard of COVID-19 diagnosis, however, this test shown false negative results in several case. Radiological examinations, chest X-Ray (CXR) and CT scan, are used to support the diagnosis. The most commonly found in CXR are consolidation, ground-glass opacity (GGO), bilateral distribution, peripheral and in the lower lobe, but this examination is insensitive to find lung abnormalities in early stages of disease. However, CXR can be used to monitor the development of lung abnormalities due to COVID-19, such as the Brixia Score method. On the other hand, CT-Scan is more sensitive than CXR and able to show early lung abnormalities in negative RT-PCR results. CT scan show the presence of GGO, consolidation, crazy-paving stone, and air bronchogram. CT-scanning can reduce the false-negative rate on RT-PCR and become a screening tool in suspected COVID-19 patients at epidemic area where RT-PCR is not available.

Presentation of case: A 42-year old man was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. Fever, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia significantly improved over the next 2 weeks, but the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. Computed tomography scan revealed absence of contrast enhancement of gallbladder wall and a micro-perforation of the fundus. At laparoscopy, gallbladder gangrene was confirmed and a subtotal cholecystectomy performed. Special precautions were adopted for patient transportation from the ward to a dedicated operating room, and two teams with adequate personal protective equipment took charge of the procedure. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 under protective lockdown measures for 2 weeks. Discussion: The pathogenesis of acute acalcolous gangrenous cholecystitis is multifactorial. It is unknown whether a prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 contributes to wall ischemia and perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be avoided in patients with gallbladder gangrene. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to characterize how community pharmacy in Ontario (Canada) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic of winter/spring 2020, in particular in understanding what factors may influence or predict resiliency of individual practitioners and their workplaces. METHODS: One-on-one interviews mediated through technology (Microsoft Teams) were used, following a semi-structured interview protocol. Verbatim transcripts were produced and analyzed by two independent researchers, using an inductive coding process to identify and characterize themes. RESULTS: A total of 21 pharmacists participated in this study. Six themes were identified: a) use of and comfort with technology; b) early adoption of corporate and professional guidance; c) workplaces that emphasized task-focus rather than multi-tasking were more resilient; d) scheduling methods and practices in the workplace are important for personal resilience; e) dedicated specialty staff allowed pharmacists to focus on their work; and f) provision of personal protective equipment was essential.

The focus is on the governments (mis-)management of its non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (or lockdown) to stem the pandemic and the organized business sectors resistance against the lockdown.Design/methodology/approachThis paper makes use of a literature review and provides descriptive statistics and quantitative analysis of COVID-19 and the lockdown stringency in South Africa, based on data from Google Mobility Trends, Oxford Universitys Stringency Index, Johns Hopkins Universitys COVID-19 tracker and Our World in Data.FindingsThis paper finds that both the government and the business sectors responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been problematic. These key actors have been failing to pull together, leaving South Africas citizens in-between corrupt and incompetent officials on the one hand, and lockdown skeptics on the other. This paper argues that to break through this impasse, the country should change direction by agreeing on a smart or Goldilocks lockdown, based on data, testing, decentralization, demographics and appropriate economic support measures, including export support. Such a Goldilocks lockdown is argued, based on available evidence from the emerging scientific literature, to be able to save lives, improve trust in government, limit economic damages and moreover improve the countrys long-term recovery prospects.Research limitations/implicationsThe pandemic is an unprecedented crisis and moreover was still unfolding at the time of writing. This has two implications. First, precise data on the economic impact and certain epidemiological parameters was not (yet) available. Second, the causes of the mismanagement by the government are not clear yet, within such a short time frame. More research and better data may be able in future to allow conclusions to be drawn whether the problems that were besetting the countrys management of COVID-19 are unique or perhaps part of a more general problem across developing countries.Practical implicationsThe paper provides clear practical implications for both government and organized business. The South African Government should not altogether end its lockdown measures, but follow a smart and flexible lockdown. The organized business sector should abandon its calls for ending the lockdown while the country is still among the most affected countries in the world, and no vaccine is available.Social implicationsThere should be better collaboration between government, business and civil society to manage a smart lockdown. Government should re-establish lost trust because of the mismanagement of the lockdown during the first six months of the pandemic.Originality/valueThe outline of the smart lockdown that is proposed for the country combines NPIs with the promotion of exports, as a policy intervention to help aggregate demand to recover.

While size indication refers to internal diameter, there is a considerable variability in the corresponding lengths and proportions of same-sized tubes of different manufacturers which is probably based on the lack of data of nasolaryngeal distances (NLDs) in the adult population. Choosing the best-fitting NET is therefore difficult and carries the risk of endobronchial intubation or, on the contrary, cuff inflation at the vocal cord level. The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model for NLD and a selection guide to choose the appropriate NET based on a radiographic description of NLD in comparison to the measurements of available NETs of several manufacturers. METHODS After institutional ethics board review, 388 computed tomography (CT) scan images of head, neck, and upper thorax in a heterogeneous adult cohort were included. Mean distances from the nares to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage were measured. NETs from different manufacturers were measured and compared to the NLD derived from the radiographic analysis. The patients' sex, body height, and weight were considered as possible covariates in quantile regression models for predicting the NLD. RESULTS Data from 200 patients were analyzed. NLD was associated with sex, body height, and weight. A simple quantile regression model using the body height as the only covariate sufficed to achieve accurate predictions of NLD. Validation on independent test data showed that 92.8% of the NLD predictions were closer than 20 mm to the observed NLD values. Measurements of equal-sized NETs varied considerably in outer diameter, proportion, the nasopharyngeal part, and guide marks. Length differences of the bend-to-cuff distance, containing the anatomically NLD, ranged between 218 and 270 mm at same sizes. CONCLUSIONS A reliable prediction of NLD can be obtained simply by body height, using the formula NLD (mm) = -13.2 + 1.1  body height (cm). As manufacturers' tube lengths vary substantially, additional information about the bend-to-cuff distance as corresponding tube section would allow for more accurate tube selection.","output":"Nasolaryngeal Distances in the Adult Population and an Evaluation of Commercially Available Nasotracheal Tubes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structure determination of membrane-associated proteins (MPs) represents a frontier of structural biology that is characterized by unique challenges in sample preparation and data acquisition.

For comparison, we used a control group with same-sex, same-severity patients. Results. Seven patients received at least one dose of opaganib since April 2, 2020. One patient, who received both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, developed diarrhea and all his medications were stopped. This was the only adverse effect possibly related to opaganib. A second patient was weaned of oxygen and discharged after receiving two doses of opaganib. Therefore, five patients were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between cases and controls. Patients treated with opaganib had significantly faster increase in lymphocyte count.

Furthermore, we investigated the Davis Double Play effect of share pledging to analyze how share pledging affects stock price risk. We found that higher EPS and investor expectations cannot mitigate the positive impact of share pledging on stock price risk.

All patients had acute episodes of asthma ascertained by medical history and physical examination. About 56% of the patients with asthma exacerbations had symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Rapid antigen detection and viral cultures for influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, 2, 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus were negative on all patients. Likewise, in all 16 patients tested, acute and convalescent serologic studies did not show a significant rise in titer by complement fixation test. Thus, despite symptoms consistent with viral infection, viral pathogens could not be shown by current virologic techniques. This study suggests that viral infection may not be as prevalent a precipitate of asthma in adults requiring emergency room treatment as is generally thought.","output":"The Contribution of Respiratory Viruses to Severe Exacerbations of Asthma in Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is not yet under control by vaccination, and effective antivirals are critical for preparedness.

Besides the public health impact, the pandemic necessitated measures, such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and lockdown, that have had a huge effect on digital screen time, dietary habits, lifestyle measures, and exposure to food-related advertising. At the same time, a reduction in physical activity, an increase of social media consumption, and an increase in fitness tutorials during the lockdown have contributed to body image issues. Emerging evidence from India suggests that peer conversations about appearance as negative body talk (fat talk) is particularly salient in contributing to body dissatisfaction and body perception ideals, which are more prevalent in women. Even though there has been an increase in research on the psychosocial impact of COVID-19, its influence on body image perceptions and consequent distress have been stigmatized and classified as under-spoken areas. With this background, this article reviews research on the biopsychosocial factors that influence body dissatisfaction among women, particularly the role of media. It also highlights the development of body image concerns in India, one of the worst-hit countries in the pandemic, through liberalization, importing Western notions of body instrumentality, demographic shift, and resultant social changes. Finally, the psychosocial strategies for positive body image ideas to prevent and mitigate the adverse effects of body dissatisfaction are discussed, particularly those that focus on cognitive behavioral techniques (CBTs) from the perspectives of positive psychology, media literacy programs, and involvement of the media. Interventions and further research to address body dissatisfaction among women, especially in the post-COVID aftermath, need to be a recognized as a public health goal.","output":"A Psychosocial Exploration of Body Dissatisfaction: A Narrative Review With a Focus on India During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute gastroenteritis is among the most common illnesses of human beings, and its associated morbidity and mortality are greatest among those at the extremes of age; children and elderly.

Other viruses, such as the toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, coronavirus, and enterovirus 22, may play a role as well. Transmission by food or water has been documented for astroviruses, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, and norovirus. In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common cause of death in children <5 years, while deaths from diarrhea are less common, much illness leads to hospitalization or doctor visits. Laboratory confirmation of waterborne illness is based on demonstration of virus particles or antigen in stool, detection of viral nucleic acid in stool, or demonstration of a rise in specific antibody to the virus. Newer methods for syndrome surveillance of acute viral gastroenteritis are being developed like multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCRs.

High magnitude strains at rapid rate and short bouts should theoretically elicit an osteogenic response; however, the effects of different levels of impact exercises on several outcomes in people at risk of fracture are still unknown. OBJECTIVE To report the effect of impact exercise on falls, fractures, adverse events, mortality, bone mineral density (BMD), physical functioning, and health-related quality of life (QoL). METHODS We included randomized controlled trials testing the effect of impact exercise compared with a non-exercise control on outcomes in adults  50 years with low BMD or fragility fractures. Two reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Where possible, we pooled outcomes using mean difference (MD) with a fixed-effects model and 95% confidence interval (CI). We reported risk of bias using Cochrane and certainty of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS We included 29 trials; 19 studies evaluated impact exercise alone, and the remaining trials combined impact with resistance or balance training. Impact exercise alone or combined with resistance training improved Timed Up-and-Go values (MD - 0.95 s, 95% CI - 1.09 to - 0.81, low certainty evidence) and lumbar spine (MD 0.04 g/cm2, 95% CI 0.02-0.06, low certainty evidence) and femoral neck BMD (MD 0.04 g/cm2, 95% CI 0.02-0.07, low certainty evidence). Impact exercise did not improve health-related QoL assessed with QUALEFFO-41 (MD 0.06, 95% CI - 2.18 to 2.30, moderate certainty evidence). The effects of impact exercise on falls, fractures, and mortality are uncertain due to insufficient data. Many trials had a high risk of bias for two or more items. CONCLUSIONS There is low certainty evidence that impact exercise may improve physical function and BMD in people at risk of fracture. The effect of impact exercises on falls, fractures, and mortality remains unclear. Our findings should be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias and small sample sizes.

Meanwhile, marked infection rate differences were reported between populations and individuals. To understand the disease dynamic, we developed a computational approach to study the implications of both SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations and ACE2 polymorphism on the stability of the virus-receptor complex. We used the 6LZG PDB RBD/ACE2 3D model, the mCSM platform, the LigPlot+ and PyMol software to analyze the data on SARS-CoV-2 mutations and ACE variants retrieved from GISAID and Ensembl/GnomAD repository. We observed that out of 351 RBD point mutations, 83% destabilizes the complex according to free energy (G) differences. We also spotted variations in the patterns of polar and hydrophobic interactions between the mutations occurring in 15 out of 18 contact residues. Similarly, comparison of the effect on the complex stability of different ACE2 variants showed that the pattern of molecular interactions and the complex stability varies also according to ACE2 polymorphism.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called ?1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of ?1 PRF, and that it also harbors a ?1 PRF attenuation element. Altering ?1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of ?1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated ?1 PRF activity. The upstream attenuator hairpin activity has also been functionally retained. Small-angle x-ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit ?1 PRF was similarly effective against ?1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may provide promising lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.","output":"Structural and functional conservation of the programmed ?1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ligand-binding surface of the B cell receptor (BCR) is formed by encoded and non-encoded antigen complementarity determining regions (CDRs).

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from fecal samples, and active viral replication was reported in human intestinal cells. The human gut also harbors an enormous amount of resident viruses (collectively known as the virome) that play a role in regulating host immunity and disease pathophysiology. Understanding gut virome perturbation that underlies SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity is an unmet need. METHODS: We enrolled 98 COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity (3 asymptomatic, 53 mild, 34 moderate, 5 severe, 3 critical) and 78 non-COVID-19 controls matched for gender and co-morbidities. All subjects had fecal specimens sampled at inclusion. Blood specimens were collected for COVID-19 patients at admission to test for inflammatory markers and white cell counts. Among COVID-19 cases, 37 (38%) patients had serial fecal samples collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until after discharge. Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, we sequenced and profiled the fecal RNA and DNA virome. We investigated alterations and longitudinal dynamics of the gut virome in association with disease severity and blood parameters. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 showed underrepresentation of Pepper mild mottle virus (RNA virus) and multiple bacteriophage lineages (DNA viruses) and enrichment of environment-derived eukaryotic DNA viruses in fecal samples, compared to non-COVID-19 subjects. Such gut virome alterations persisted up to 30 days after disease resolution. Fecal virome in SARS-CoV-2 infection harbored more stress-, inflammation-, and virulence-associated gene encoding capacities including those pertaining to bacteriophage integration, DNA repair, and metabolism and virulence associated with their bacterial host. Baseline fecal abundance of 10 virus species (1 RNA virus, pepper chlorotic spot virus, and 9 DNA virus species) inversely correlated with disease COVID-19 severity. These viruses inversely correlated with blood levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, white cells, and neutrophils. Among the 10 COVID-19 severity-associated DNA virus species, 4 showed inverse correlation with age; 5 showed persistent lower abundance both during disease course and after disease resolution relative to non-COVID-19 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Both enteric RNA and DNA virome in COVID-19 patients were different from non-COVID-19 subjects, which persisted after disease resolution of COVID-19. Gut virome may calibrate host immunity and regulate severity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our observation that gut viruses inversely correlated with both severity of COVID-19 and host age may partly explain that older subjects are prone to severe and worse COVID-19 outcomes. Altogether, our data highlight the importance of human gut virome in severity and potentially therapeutics of COVID-19.

In AIS patients, troponin elevation is associated with increased mortality and worse outcome. However, uncertainty remains regarding the underlying pathophysiology of troponin elevation after stroke, particularly regarding diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. Troponin elevation may be caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) and more precisely acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Both have a high prevalence in stroke patients and contribute to poor outcome. Therefore, better diagnostic algorithms are needed to identify those AIS patients likely to have ACS or other manifestations of CAD. METHODS/DESIGN The primary goal of the \\"PRediction of Acute coronary syndrome in acute Ischemic StrokE\\" (PRAISE) study is to develop a diagnostic algorithm for prediction of ACS in AIS patients. The primary hypothesis will test whether dynamic high-sensitivity troponin levels determined by repeat measurements (i.e., \\"rise or fall-pattern\\") indicate presence of ACS when compared to stable (chronic) troponin elevation. PRAISE is a prospective, multicenter, observational trial with central reading and predefined endpoints guided by a steering committee. Clinical symptoms, troponin levels as well as findings on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and coronary angiogram will be recorded and assessed by central academic core laboratories. Diagnosis of ACS will be made by an endpoint adjudication committee. Severe adverse events will be evaluated by a critical event committee.

Follow-up will be conducted at three and twelve months and will record new vascular events (i.e., stroke and myocardial infarction) as well as death, functional and cognitive status. According to sample size calculation, 251 patients have to be included. DISCUSSION PRAISE will prospectively determine the frequency of ACS and characterize cardiac and coronary pathologies in a large, multicenter cohort of AIS patients with troponin elevation. The findings will elucidate the origin of troponin elevation, shed light on its impact on necessary diagnostic procedures and provide data on the safety and diagnostic yield of coronary angiography early after stroke. Thereby, PRAISE will help to refine algorithms and develop guidelines for the cardiac workup in AIS.

This simply implies the necessity to produce well-rounded medical graduates (physicians) who can competently integrate clinical knowledge/skills (for disease treatment) and public health knowledge/skills (for disease prevention). Moreover, the medical training (MD/MBBS curriculum) largely gives emphasis to the clinical skills needed to treat individual patients, whereas public health training (MPH degree) emphasizes the methods needed to improve the overall community health. Bridging the gap between patients and community is best achieved through a combined multidisciplinary training in both medicine and public health, that is, dual-degree MBBS-MPH programs are the way forward. In United States, for example, there are >80 medical schools that offer such joint MD-MPH programs, whereas there is none in Saudi Arabia.

Opportunities available to men and women as managers, and the role of managers more broadly, are critical in shaping business ethics in contemporary organizations. Research on women in management therefore provides an important lens through which to understand the institutional and cultural context of HR ethics as part of the business ethics of a country. To date, women in management in China remains an under-charted topic of research in the HRM field. Extant research and recommendations on the improvement of the position of women in management in China focus primarily on women themselves from a traditional, gender norm angle, instead of challenging the political and patriarchal system or any institutionalized discriminatory practice. This is, in part, due to the absence in China of a critical feminism approach or feminist movement, as found in Western societies, and the continuing strong influence of the state and media in portraying womens (stereotypical) image. There is significant room for research capacity building in scholarship on women in management research, for example, and through cross-fertilization of different disciplines and more rigorous research design and execution.

These communities impact the health of their occupants in many ways. Children interact with the built environment differently than do adults as a result of their unique behaviors, size, and developmental status. Consequently, understanding the broader bacterial community to which children are exposed will help inform public health efforts and contribute to our growing understanding of the bacterial community associated with childcare centers. METHODS: We sampled childcare centers to survey the variation in bacterial community composition across five surfaces found inside and outside twelve classrooms and six centers using 16S rRNA marker gene amplicon sequencing. We then correlated these bacterial community analyses of surfaces with environmental and demographic measures of illumination and classroom occupant density. RESULTS: The childcare environment was dominated by human-associated bacteria with modest input from outdoor sources. Though the bacterial communities of individual childcare centers differed, there was a greater difference in the bacterial community within a classroom than among centers. Surface habitatsfomiteswithin the classroom, did not differ in community composition despite differing proximity to likely sources of bacteria, and possible environmental filters, such as light. Bacterial communities did correlate with occupant density and differed significantly between high and low usage surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest built environments inhabited by young children are similar to functionally equivalent built environments inhabited by adults, despite the different way young children engage with their environment. Ultimately, these results will be useful when further interrogating microbial dispersal and human exposure to microorganisms in built environments that specifically cater to young children.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from February 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 and involved 562 frontline nurses. The effective response rate was 87.68%. After propensity score matched, there were 498 participants left. Extensive characteristics, including demographics, dietary habits, life-related factors, work-related factors, and psychological factors were collected based on a self-reported questionnaire. Specific scales measured the levels of sleep quality, physical activity, depressive symptoms, perceived organization support and psychological capital. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined by binary paired logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the nurses enrolled in the study, 50.90% had depressive symptoms. Three independent risk factors were identified: poor sleep quality (OR = 1.608, 95% CI: 1.384-1.896), lower optimism of psychological capital (OR = 0.879, 95% CI: 0.805-0.960) and no visiting friend constantly (OR = 0.513, 95% CI: 0.286-0.920). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a considerable high prevalence of depressive symptoms in frontline nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak, and identified three risk factors, which were poor sleep quality, lower optimism of psychological capital, and no visiting friend constantly.

METHODS: The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020.

The health care community has been challenged by the unprecedented burden of caring for patients when they have evolving guidelines and limited information about the effects of the virus on children. PROGRAM: In response, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) rapidly launched a national initiative to increase child health professionals' knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy. This COVID-19 ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) program created communities of learners among child health professionals and subject matter expert faculty using didactic and case-based presentations that foster an \\"all-teach, all-learn\\" approach. IMPLEMENTATION: The initial AAP COVID-19 ECHO program hosted more than 900 participants in 127 individual virtual sessions, with approximately 25 participants per session. The evolving nature of the pandemic necessitated dynamic and continuous bidirectional flow of concerns and information relevant to participants. Session topics were selected in a \\"just-in-time\\" fashion based on participant feedback from the prospective postsession surveys and faculty recommendations; speakers brought data and expert recommendations. EVALUATION: To assess impact, the AAP used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the program's effectiveness in meeting its educational objectives. The 2-phase evaluation collected quantitative and qualitative data through an integrated feedback structure that utilized prospective postsession and retrospective postprogram surveys, along with postprogram focus groups. DISCUSSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic surges and another influenza season is upon us, the ECHO model is an effective strategy for facilitating bidirectional communication and education to build child health professionals' knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy during an unprecedented and ongoing public health emergency.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective procedures have been postponed indefinitely both to provide capacity to deal with the emergency caseload and to avoid exposure of elective patients to COVID-19. This survey aimed to explore the effect of the pandemic on chronic pain in this group and the views of patients towards undergoing SCS treatment when routine services should resume. METHODS: This was a prospective, multi-centre telephone patient survey that analysed data from 330 patients with chronic pain who were on an SCS waiting list. Questions focussed on severity of pain, effect on mental health, medication consumption and reliance on support networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Views towards undergoing SCS therapy were also ascertained. Counts and percentages were generated, and chi-square tests of independence explored the impact of COVID-19 risk (very high, high, low) on survey responses. RESULTS: Pain, mental health and patients ability to self-manage pain deteriorated in around 47%, 50% and 38% of patients, respectively. Some patients reported increases in pain medication consumption (37%) and reliance on support network (41%). Patients showed a willingness to attend for COVID-19 testing (92%), self-isolate prior to SCS (94%) and undergo the procedure as soon as possible (76%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains a strong clinical need for patients with chronic pain identified as likely SCS responders to be treated quickly. The current prioritisation of new SCS at category 4 (delayed more than 3 months) is challenged judging by this national survey.

Significantly, adipocytokines were found to be involved in the physiology of many body functions, including reproduction. The role of body weight, body fat compositions, and nutrition has been largely investigated using animal models and human studies. Malnutrition and/or abnormal body weight may induce disturbances in fertility, puberty, pregnancy, and menstrual cycles. Leptin was the first discovered adipocytokine, and a large body of data over the last 25 years has shown that leptin is not only a molecule that reflects energy stores in the body, but is also an important cytokine involved in many physiological functions, such as inflammatory response, insulin sensitivity, bone metabolism, immunity, and most importantly, reproductive function. Leptin controls the normal physiology of the female reproductive system; it interacts with the hypothalamicCpituitaryCgonadal (HPG) axis by a complex mechanism that connects energy homeostasis with reproduction. However, observational studies have demonstrated inconsistent results about leptin variation during normal menstrual cycle, and the mechanisms involved in the interplay between leptin and the hormones of the HPG axis are largely unknown.

Methods: To improve AYA access to GC, the AYA program at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center implemented GEI, a process for identifying and referring eligible patients for GC. We collected retrospective electronic medical record data between July 12, 2018 and July 12, 2019 to capture AYA's clinical characteristics, genetic referral, scheduled appointments, counseling, testing, and results. Results: In total, 516 AYAs were referred to the AYA clinic during the study period with a median age of first cancer diagnosis of 17 years. One hundred sixty-six AYAs were identified who would benefit from genetic evaluation, 57 (34.3%) of whom had previously undergone counseling.

RESULTS: Compared with contacts during prepandemic conditions, as learned from the Finnish part of the Polymod study, there was a 72% (95% credible interval, CI = 71, 74) reduction in the daily number of all contacts and a 69% (95% CI = 66, 73) reduction in the daily number of physical contacts in April 2020. The largest reduction, of almost 90%, occurred in physical contacts by individuals more than 70 years of age. The estimated reduction in the transmission potential of the virus attributable solely to reduced contact frequencies varied between 59% (whole population; physical contacts; 95% CI = 52, 68) and 77% (over 20-year olds; physical contacts; 95% CI = 70, 89). CONCLUSIONS: We surmise that the large reduction in the daily numbers of social contacts in the early part of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Finland was likely a major contributor to the steady decline of the epidemic in the country since early April.","output":"Social Distancing and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Potential Early in the Epidemic in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical trauma can be considered an unrecognized \\"pandemic\\" because it can occur anywhere and affect anyone and represents a global burden. Following severe tissue trauma, patients frequently develop acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) despite modern surgical and intensive care concepts. The underlying complex pathophysiology of life-threatening ALI/ARDS has been intensively studied in experimental and clinical settings. However, currently, the coronavirus family has become the focus of ALI/ARDS research because it represents an emerging global public health threat. The clinical presentation of the infection is highly heterogeneous, varying from a lack of symptoms to multiple organ dysfunction and mortality. In a particular subset of patients, the primary infection progresses rapidly to ALI and ARDS. The pathophysiological mechanisms triggering and driving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced ALI/ARDS are still poorly understood. Although it is also generally unknown whether insights from trauma-induced ARDS may be readily translated to SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS, it was still recommended to treat coronavirus-positive patients with ALI/ARDS with standard protocols for ALI/ARDS. However, this strategy was questioned by clinical scientists, because it was documented that some severely hypoxic SARS-CoV-2-infected patients exhibited a normal respiratory system compliance, a phenomenon rarely observed in ARDS patients with another underlying etiology. Therefore, coronavirus-induced ARDS was defined as a specific ARDS phenotype, which accordingly requires an adjusted therapeutic approach. These suggestions reflect previous attempts of classifying ARDS into different phenotypes that might overall facilitate ARDS diagnosis and treatment. Based on the clinical data from ARDS patients, two major phenotypes have been proposed: hyper- and hypo-inflammatory. Here, we provide a comparative review of the pathophysiological pathway of trauma-/hemorrhagic shock-induced ARDS and coronavirus-induced ARDS, with an emphasis on the crucial key points in the pathogenesis of both these ARDS forms. Therefore, the manifold available data on trauma-/hemorrhagic shock-induced ARDS may help to better understand coronavirus-induced ARDS.","output":"Inflammation, Thrombosis, and Destruction: The Three-Headed Cerberus of Trauma- and SARS-CoV-2-Induced ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Determining when individuals should be released from quarantine is critical for successfully managing a COVID-19 outbreak and local protocols frequently call for testing during the quarantine period, generally after a reasonable incubation period, which raises a question about the interpretation of test results during the quarantine period.

In particular, we consider the role of population density, transmission rates and social distancing on the disease dynamics and outcomes. Sensitivity analysis shows that there is a strongly negative correlation between the clustering coefficient in the pairwise model and the basic reproduction number and the effective reproduction number. The shelter in place policy makes the clustering coefficient increase thereby reducing the basic reproduction number and the effective reproduction number. By switching population densities in New York and San Francisco we demonstrate how the outbreak would progress if New York had the same density as San Francisco and vice-versa. The results underscore the crucial role that population density has in the epidemic outcomes. We also show that under the assumption of no further changes in policy or transmission dynamics not lifting the shelter in place policy would have little effect on final outbreak size in New York, but would reduce the final size in San Francisco by 97%.","output":"Modeling the early transmission of COVID-19 in New York and San Francisco using a pairwise network model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Macrophages (M?) are immune cells with natural phagocytic ability and play an important role in tumorigenesis, development and metastasis.

This study aims to explore undergraduates perceptions of doing rotations in teaching hospitals using different teaching styles and elicit their views regarding the options of managing practices to design a mobile app that substitutes for checkerboards. Methods: In this sequential exploratory mixed methods study, 38 semi-structured interviews at a teaching hospital were conducted. The data was used to survey 124 students doing their rotations in four teaching hospitals during the first wave of COVID-19. Results: 21 themes highlighted concerns related to the practices, the teacher involvement in the students education, and the students adaptation to clinical culture. The students reported positive perceptions concerning self-managing and organizing practices via a mobile application. However, problems emerged regarding transparency, the lack of feedback, and the need for new tools. Regarding the teaching styles, the facilitator and personal models were perceived as optimal, but the personal style had no effect on using or not using a tool. Conclusions: A mobile-learning application designed like an educational opportunities manager tool can probably promote self-directed learning, flexible teaching, and bidirectional assessments.

Data reporting a viral intra-host and inter-host evolution favouring the appearance of mild SARS-CoV-2 strains are since being accumulating. To better understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and its adaptation to the host, it is therefore crucial to investigate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating lately in the epidemic. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs have been analyzed for viral load in the early (March 2020) and late (May 2020) phases of epidemic in Brescia, Italy. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from 2 high viral load specimens identified on March 9 (AP66) and on May 8 (GZ69) was performed on Vero E6 cells. Amount of virus released was assessed by quantitative PCR. Genotypic characterization of AP66 and GZ69 was performed by next generation sequencing followed by an in-depth in silico analysis of nucleotide mutations. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain, isolated in May from an asymptomatic healthcare worker, showed an unprecedented capability of replication in Vero E6 cells in the absence of any evident cytopathic effect. Vero E6 subculturing, up to passage 4, showed that SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 infection was as productive as the one sustained by the cytopathic strain AP66. Whole genome sequencing of the persistently replicating SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 has shown that this strain differs from the early AP66 variant in 9 nucleotide positions (C2939T; C3828T; G21784T; T21846C; T24631C; G28881A; G28882A; G28883C; G29810T) which lead to 6 non-synonymous substitutions spanning on ORF1ab (P892S; S1188L), S (K74N; I95T) and N (R203K, G204R) proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the peculiar SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain in the late Italian epidemic highlights the need to better characterize viral variants circulating among asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals.

The coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required preventative, diagnostic, and curative measures for persons presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 by healthcare providers, whilst continuing other essential services. We aimed to investigate the reorganisation of primary care services during COVID-19 from the perspectives of primary care nurses in the Western Cape province of South Africa. METHODS: We administered an online survey with closed and open-ended questions to professional nurses enrolled for a Postgraduate Diploma in Primary Care Nursing at Stellenbosch University (2020) and alumni (2017C2019) working in the Western Cape. Eighty-three participants completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of the participants (74.4%) reported that they were reorganising services using a multitude of initiatives in response to the diverse infrastructure, logistics and services of the various healthcare facilities. Despite this, 48.2% of the participants expressed concerns, which mainly related to possible non-adherence of patients with chronic conditions, the lack of promotive and preventative services, challenges with facility infrastructure, and staff time devoted to triage and screening. More than half of the participants (57.8%) indicated that other services were affected by COVID-19, whilst 44.6% indicated that these services were worse than before. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the very necessary reorganisation of services that took place at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa enabled effective management of patients infected with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether changes in psychoactive substance trade on Telegram markets in the Netherlands can be observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Between December 2, 2019, and June 29, 2020, a total of 70,226 posts appeared in two analyzed Telegram groups. A total of 5,643 posts were psychoactive substance related.

The proportion of posts related to specific substances varied between the periods before, during, and after the lockdown. The proportion of posts on the stimulants ecstasy, cocaine, and amphetamine was lower during the lockdown than before and after. For psychedelics ? ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C-B) ? and other substances, there was a relative increase in the number of posts during the lockdown, which was maintained after the lockdown.

The pandemic reveals that it is very difficult to protect HIS from all kinds of possible hazards. They can be unpredictable and spread rapidly; hence, it is hard to find an effective mitigation strategy to completely protect society and its important HIS. Methods: An often raised central question is what we should do if we cannot protect HIS from these types of hazards. To answer this question, the focus should move from HIS protection to HIS resilience. Therefore, in this paper, the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Index (CIRI) is used to estimate the resilience of health infrastructure systems. Results: The results of the case study show that HIS resilience was enhanced significantly after the implementation of measures. The results indicate that among the resilience phases the learning phase of resilience is the weakest part. This requires a root cause analysis, which should be prioritized by HIS managers and stakeholders. Conclusion: This paper discusses how the resilience concept will help decision- and policy-makers to have a clear view of HIS performance before, during, and after the disaster.

METHODS: A total of 1490 clinical laboratories participating in a College of American Pathologists proficiency testing survey for bacterial cultures were queried to determine use of obsolete breakpoints. RESULTS: Between 37.9% and 70.5% of US laboratories reported using obsolete breakpoints for the antimicrobials that were queried. In contrast, only 17.7%C43.7% of international laboratories reported using obsolete breakpoints (P < .001 for all comparisons). Use of current breakpoints varied by AST system, with more laboratories reporting use of current breakpoints in the US if the system had achieved US Food and Drug Administration clearance with current breakpoints. Among laboratories that indicated use of obsolete breakpoints, 55.9% had no plans to update to current standards.

With risk factors for CVD continuing to rise, early identification and management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea is necessary for prevention. Pregnancy is a natural stress test for women with risk factors who may be predisposed to CVD and offers a unique opportunity to not only recognize disease but also implement effective and long-lasting strategies for prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: Prevention begins before pregnancy, as preconception screening, counseling, and optimization of chronic diseases can improve maternal and fetal outcomes. Throughout pregnancy, women should maintain close follow-up, continued reevaluation of risk factors, with counseling when necessary. Continued healthcare engagement during the fourth trimester, 3 months following delivery, allows clinicians to continue monitoring the evolution of chronic diseases, encourage ongoing lifestyle counseling, and connect women with primary care and appropriate specialists if needed. Unfortunately, this postpartum period represents a major care gap, as a significant proportion of most women do not attend their scheduled visits. Social determinants of health including decreased access to care and economic instability lead to increased risk factors throughout pregnancy but particularly play a role in poor compliance with postpartum follow-up. The use of telemedicine clinics and remote monitoring may prove to be effective interventions, bridging the gap between physicians and patients and improving follow-up for at-risk women. SUMMARY: While many clinicians are beginning to understand the impact of CVD on women, screening and prevention strategies are not often implemented until much later in life.

SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by binding to the cellular surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); in addition, the cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is needed for priming of the spike (S) protein of the virus.

Given that the uncertainty of how COVID-19 kills, hampers doctors ability to choose treatments the need for a deep understanding of COVID-19 biology is urgent. Herein, we performed an expression profiling meta-analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSB/L genes (and proteins) in public repository databases and found that all are widely expressed in human tissues; also, the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes tend to be co-regulated.

They respond to different agonists modifying their phenotype and functions. In humans and mice, the regulatory cytokines IL-10 or TGF- are both known to drive macrophage polarization into an anti-inflammatory phenotype, referred to as M2c. However, the immune systems of animal species each have their own peculiarities and the M2c subsets has never been investigated in pigs. A deep knowledge of the porcine immune system is required to design vaccines or control strategies against pathogens, which are a major constraint to pork production. Due to anatomical, physiological, and immunological similarities, swine are attracting increasing attention as a model for human diseases. To better characterize porcine macrophages, we evaluated the effects of IL-10 or TGF- on the phenotype and function of monocyte-derived macrophages. Both cytokines downregulated the expression of MHC II DR and CD14. IL-10, but not TGF-, statistically significantly reduced the ability of macrophages to respond to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4 agonists. Whilst these data suggest differentiation to an M2c-like immunosuppressive phenotype, the responses, and differences between IL-10 and TGF- also reveals species-specific differences. ABSTRACT: Macrophages are phagocytic cells involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis and defense against pathogens. Macrophages may be polarized into different functionally specialized subsets. M2c macrophages arise following stimulation with IL-10 or TGF- and mediate anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions. M2c macrophages remain poorly characterized in the pig, thus we investigated the impact of these regulatory cytokines on porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (moM). The phenotype and functionality of these cells was characterized though confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, ELISA, and RT-qPCR. Both cytokines induced CD14 and MHC II DR down-regulation and reduced IL-6, TNF-, and CD14 expression, suggestive of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, neither IL-10 or TGF- were able to trigger IL-10 induction or release by moM. Differences between these cytokines were observed: stimulation with IL-10, but not TGF-, induced up-regulation of both CD16 and CD163 on moM. In addition, IL-10 down-regulated expression of IL-1 and IL-12p40 4h post-stimulation and induced a stronger impairment of moM ability to respond to either TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. Overall, our results provide an overview of porcine macrophage polarization by two immunosuppressive cytokines, revealing differences between IL-10 and TGF-, and reporting some peculiarity of swine, which should be considered in translational studies.","output":"Comparative Phenotypic and Functional Analyses of the Effects of IL-10 or TGF- on Porcine Macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For critically ill COVID-19 patients surviving the acute phase of the disease could possibly only mean having overcome the first stage of a long and challenging path. Physical, cognitive and psychological consequences seem to be realistic; however, do residual symptoms in patients who have returned to microbiological normalization constitute a post-COVID syndrome and which symptoms are principally possible in this context and are able to cause such a syndrome? It is no novelty that critically ill patients often still sustain functional limitations over a long period after discharge from hospital, in many cases even over many years. In most cases of COVID-19 it is too early for the diagnosis of a post-COVID syndrome. For this the symptoms would have to have lasted over a period of at least 6 months; therefore, only a post-infection fatigue can currently be spoken of. On top of this, even if patients recover physically they could be at particular risk of suffering from long-term mental health problems or perceive a reduced quality of life. Such findings exist not only after ARDS as many intensive care unit patients sustain long-term disorders, which is also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS).

A spike within this wave occurred in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001. The nature of the nationalism introduced in the second wave was somewhat different to that of the previously discussed agrarian populism or the anti-tax neo-liberal populism in the early 1970s. Rather than primarily referring to the social-economic situation of the ordinary people the emphasis moved over to a socio-cultural notion of our people. Although xenophobia and ethno-nationalism was surely a significant part of the populist message from the outset that sort of rhetoric rose much more clearly to the forefront in the second wave.","output":"The Second Wave: The Collapse of Communism and 9/11"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case overview: The Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS), a South African based business school and one of the top ranked business schools in Africa, was yet again facing a crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Having emerged out of an extraordinary year of strict lockdown regulations and having managed a rapid shift to emergency remote teaching. GIBS had managed to maintain its academic programmes, ensuring the completion of the curriculum within the academic year whilst maintaining the exceptionally high standards and quality learning experience it was known for. As 2020 drew to a close, the academic programmes team and the students looked forward to starting the new year in a more normal mode of operation. GIBS closed for Christmas holiday with the intent on returning, in early 2021, in some form of face-to-face teaching. However, on the 27th of December 2020, the President of South Africa announced a return to level-3 lockdown as the second wave of infections swept through the country. Strict measures were once again enforced, significantly impacting GIBS possible return to campus in January 2021. Reflecting on the lessons learnt over the past year, the Executive Director: Academic Programmes, Professor Louise Whittaker, yet again faced the challenge of deciding how best to proceed given the circumstances. The case illustrates the need for effective change management through the application of Kotters 8 steps to transformation, whilst demonstrating the complexity of change management during a crisis. A particular focus on the importance of communication during a change management process in a crisis is illustrated through this case. Expected learning outcomes: The learning outcomes are as follows: students need to understand that in a crisis, change management will be emergent and requires flexibility and adaptability;students will determine what concrete actions may be required during a change management process in a crisis;students will need to discern that theoretical models do not necessarily fit real world contexts, particularly in a crisis situation;and students will identify aspects that might be missing or inadequately formulated in standard models of change management. Complexity academic level: The case is positioned at a post-graduate level and would be ideal as a teaching case for business school students on a Master of Business Administration programme, a specialised business masters programme or selected executive education programmes for general managers or senior executives. The case can be taught in a course in the following fields, namely, change management, leadership or strategy. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

Due to low sensitivity of this method, early-stage cancers are undetected, lowering the treatment success. In this study, we analyzed extracellular vesicles isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage of lung cancer suspects by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The protein composition of bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles of late-stage cancer showed a higher proteome complexity associated with mortality within the two year follow-up period. We identified a potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex which was significantly expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles as well as in tumor tissue. Bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles proteome analysis of immune markers indicates the presence of markers of innate immune and fibroblast cells. ABSTRACT: Acellular bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomics can partially separate lung cancer from non-lung cancer patients based on principal component analysis and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the variance in the proteomics data sets is correlated mainly with lung cancer status and, to a lesser extent, smoking status and gender. Despite these advances BAL small and large extracellular vehicles (EVs) proteomes reveal aberrant protein expression in paracrine signaling mechanisms in cancer initiation and progression. We consequently present a case-control study of 24 bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicle samples which were analyzed by state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We obtained evidence that BAL EVs proteome complexity correlated with lung cancer stage 4 and mortality within two years follow-up (p value = 0.006). The potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex is significantly up-regulated in tumor tissue and BAL EVs. The computational analysis of the immune and fibroblast cell markers in EVs suggests that patients who deceased within the follow-up period display higher marker expression indicative of innate immune and fibroblast cells (four out of five cases). This study provides insights into the proteome content of BAL EVs and their correlation to clinical outcomes.","output":"Is the Proteome of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Extracellular Vesicles a Marker of Advanced Lung Cancer?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and its associated stressors have resulted in decreased sleep quality among front-line workers. However, in China, the general public displayed more psychological problems than the front-line workers during the pandemic. Therefore, we investigated the influence of perceived stress on the sleep quality of the non-diseased general public and developed a moderated mediation model to explain said relationship. METHODS: Questionnaire-based surveys were conducted online from February 18C25, 2020 with 1,630 Chinese participants (aged 18C68 years). RESULTS: Around one-third (36.38%) of participants were poor sleepers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, higher perceived stress was significantly associated with higher anxiety levels, which, in turn, was associated with lower sleep quality. Self-esteem moderated the indirect effect of perceived stress on sleep quality through its moderation of the effect of perceived stress on anxiety. This indicated that the mediation effect of anxiety was stronger in those with low levels of self-esteem than in those with high levels of self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that both the sleep quality and perceived stress levels of the non-diseased general public required attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identify personality characteristics related to better sleep quality, demonstrating the important role of self-esteem in environmental adaptation.","output":"Perceived Stress and Sleep Quality Among the Non-diseased General Public in China During the 2019 Coronavirus Disease: A Moderated Mediation Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has a big impact on health professionals work load, at organizational/psychological level.

Because of the unknown effect this can have on islet function, there can be doubt that patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections are good candidates for autologous islet transplantation after total pancreatectomy (TPAIT). CASE REPORT: A patient with a history of chronic pancreatitis and previous non-surgical interventions was presented as a viable candidate for TPAIT at our institution. Approximately 1 month later, the patient contracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in a mild case of COVID-19. The infection resolved without the need for hospitalization. At the time of this occurrence, COVID-19 was primarily considered a respiratory ailment, and little was known of the potential association between metabolic dysfunction and SARS-CoV-2. Islet isolation and surgery proceeded in a textbook manner with no surgical complications. The patient was weaned off exogenous insulin within 3 months after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable outcomes after surgery included pain reduction, islet function, and improved quality of life for the patient in the first 6 months after the procedure. These successful results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not prevent the patient from achieving good glucose regulation after auto-islet transplantation.

METHODS We reviewed consecutive, newly diagnosed, untreated patients with COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, or adult Still's disease. We compared their clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, including the prevalence of macrophage activation syndrome and lung involvement in each disease. RESULTS The numbers of patients with COVID-19, anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis, and adult-onset Still's disease with hyperferritinaemia (serum ferritin 500ng/dL) who were included for main analysis were 22, 14, and 59, respectively. COVID-19 and adult Still's disease both featured hyperinflammatory status, such as high fever and elevated serum C-reactive protein, whereas COVID-19 and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis both presented with severe interstitial lung disease and hypoxaemia. While two-thirds of the patients in each group met the criteria for macrophage-activated syndrome that is used in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, the HScore, an indicator of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, was low in anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis and COVID-19 even in severe or critical cases. The findings of chest computed tomography were similar between COVID-19 and anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 shared clinical features with rheumatic diseases characterised by hyperferritinaemia, including anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis and adult Still's disease. These findings should be investigated further in order to shed light on the pathogenesis of not only COVID-19 but also the aforementioned rheumatic diseases.","output":"COVID-19 shares clinical features with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 positive dermatomyositis and adult Still's disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adjuvant chemotherapy has reduced the risk of tumor recurrence and improved survival in patients with resected colorectal cancer.

Due to the risks involved in being exposed to the virus, public health actions such as wearing masks and physical distancing are necessary to reduce its spread. However, using non-validated masks is a serious issue as such masks may provide inadequate protection against airborne bioaerosol transmission, resulting in the spread of the virus. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the filtering performances of the masks against bioaerosols as well as particulate matter (PM). Here, we evaluated the filtering performances of sixteen different masks (four brands each of woven, antidroplet, KF80, and KF94 masks) commercially available in Korea with high market shares. As a simulation of being exposed to bioaerosols and to the yellow dust commonly found in Korea, the filtration efficiency levels of the masks were tested against airborne bacteria-containing droplets and against fine dusts of different ranges of particle sizes. Their filtration efficiency levels against the droplets showed strong positive correlations, specifically Pearson correlation coefficient r values of 0.917, 0.905, and 0.894, with their efficiency levels against PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important factor that can affect the health and work quality of nurses. However, there is a lack of big-sample studies exploring factors that affect the insomnia of nurses fighting against COVID-19. METHOD: This cross-sectional study using the Ascension Insomnia Scale, Fatigue Scale-14 and Perceived Stress Scale took place in March 2020. Participants were 1,794 front-line nurses from four tertiary-level general hospitals. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among participants was 52.8%. Insomnia was predicted by gender, working experience, chronic diseases, midday nap duration, direct participation in the rescue of patients with COVID-19, frequency of night shifts, professional psychological assistance during the pandemic, negative experiences (such as family, friends or colleagues being seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19), the degree of fear of COVID-19, fatigue and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The level of insomnia among participants was higher than the normal level. Interventions based on influencing factors should be implemented to ensure nurses' sleep quality.

Describe the frequency of viral RNA detection in stools in a cohort of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2. Perform a systematic review to assess the clearance time in stools of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in two centers between March-May 2020. We included SARS-CoV-2 infected patients of any age and severity. We collected seriated nasopharyngeal swabs and stool samples to detect SARS-CoV-2. After, we performed a systematic review of the prevalence and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in stools (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42020192490). We estimated prevalence using a random-effects model. We assessed clearance time by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results: We included 32 patients; mean age was 43.7;17.7 years, 43.8% were female, and 40.6% reported gastrointestinal symptoms. Twenty-five percent (8/32) of patients had detectable viral RNA in stools. The median clearance time in stools of the cohort was 11[10-15] days. Systematic review included 30 studies (1,392 patients) with stool samples. Six studies were performed in children and 55% were male. The pooled prevalence of viral detection in stools was 34.6% (twenty-four studies, 1,393 patients; 95%CI:25.4-45.1); heterogeneity was high (I2:91.2%, Q:208.6; p=<0.001). A meta-regression demonstrates an association between female-gender and lower presence in stools (p=0.004). The median clearance time in stools was 22 days (nineteen studies, 140 patients; 95%CI:19C25). After 34 days, 19.9% (95%CI:11.3-29.7) of patients have a persistent detection in stools.

Gilts received daily oral retinyl acetate (30 000 IU) starting at gestation day 76 throughout lactation. At 3C4 weeks pre-partum, VA-supplemented (PEDV + VA) and non-supplemented (PEDV) gilts were PEDV or mock inoculated (mock + VA and mock, respectively). PEDV + VA gilts had decreased mean PEDV RNA shedding titers and diarrhea scores. To determine if lactogenic immunity correlated with protection, all piglets were PEDV-challenged at 3C5 days post-partum. The survival rate of PEDV + VA litters was 74.2% compared with 55.9% in PEDV litters. Mock and mock + VA litter survival rates were 5.7% and 8.3%, respectively.

However, selecting suitable internal controls (IC) is crucial for qRT-PCR experiments. Currently, there is no consensus on the ICs for miRNA qRT-PCR experiments in breast cancer. To this end, we tried to identify the most stable (the least expression alteration) and promising miRNAs in normal and tumor breast tissues by employing TCGA miRNA-Seq data and then experimentally validated them on fresh clinical samples. METHODS: A multi-component scoring system was used which takes into account multiple expression stability criteria as well as correlation with clinical characteristics. Furthermore, we extended the scoring system for more than two biological sub-groups. TCGA BRCA samples were analyzed based on two grouping criteria: Tumor & Normal samples and Tumor subtypes. The top 10 most stable miRNAs were further investigated by differential expression and survival analysis. Then, we examined the expression level of the top scored miRNA (hsa-miR-361-5p) along with two commonly used ICs hsa-miR-16-5p and U48 on 34 pairs of Primary breast tumor and their adjacent normal tissues using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: According to our multi-component scoring system, hsa-miR-361-5p had the highest stability score in both grouping criteria and hsa-miR-16-5p showed significantly lower scores. Based on our qRT-PCR assay, while U48 was the most abundant IC, hsa-miR-361-5p had lower standard deviation and also was the only IC capable of detecting a significant up-regulation of hsa-miR-21-5p in breast tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: miRNA-Seq data is a great source to discover stable ICs. Our results demonstrated that hsa-miR-361-5p is a highly stable miRNA in tumor and non-tumor breast tissue and we recommend it as a suitable reference gene for miRNA expression studies in breast cancer.

Thus, we have studied whether the rs4341 and rs4343 polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene, key regulator of the renin-aldosterone-angiotensin system (RAAS), could explain the different outcomes of 128 COVID-19 patients with diverse degree of severity (33 asymptomatic or mildly asymptomatic, 66 hospitalized in the general ward, and 29 admitted to the ICU). We found that G allele of rs4341 and rs4343 was associated with severe COVID-19 in hypertensive patients, independently of gender (p<0.05).

These interruptions in formal in-person educational experiences caused adverse consequences on school-age childrens academic outcomes. Using a pre-existing database, we calculated changes in childrens reading ability without formal education (i.e., the summer months). The resultant models predicted that the rate of reading ability gain in kindergarten children during COVID-19 school closures without formal in-person education will decrease 66% (2.46 vs. 7.17 points/100 days), compared to the business-as-usual scenario, resulting in a 31% less reading ability gain from 1 January 2020 to 1 September 2020. Additionally, the model predicted that kindergarten children who have books read to them daily would have 2.3 points less loss (42%) compared to those who do not, who are predicted to have a 5.6-point loss during the same time period. Even though reading books to children will not substitute the critical role of formal education in teaching children how to read, families, educators, and policy makers can promote this simple strategy to facilitate and maintain reading ability gain during school closures, which may be a common occurrence as nations see the public health benefits of physical distancing for the current and future pandemic outbreaks.","output":"Modeling Reading Ability Gain in Kindergarten Children during COVID-19 School Closures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a natural disaster of historic proportions with widespread and profound psychological sequelae.

There is currently no approved therapeutic for highly pathogenic coronaviruses, even as MERS-CoV is spreading throughout the Middle East. We previously screened a library of FDA-approved drugs for inhibitors of coronavirus replication in which we identified Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitors, including the anticancer drug imatinib, as inhibitors of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro Here we show that the anti-CoV activity of imatinib occurs at the early stages of infection, after internalization and endosomal trafficking, by inhibiting fusion of the virions at the endosomal membrane. We specifically identified the imatinib target, Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (Abl2), as required for efficient SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in vitro These data demonstrate that specific approved drugs can be characterized in vitro for their anticoronavirus activity and used to identify host proteins required for coronavirus replication. This type of study is an important step in the repurposing of approved drugs for treatment of emerging coronaviruses. IMPORTANCE Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic infections, with bats as the primary source. The 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak began in Guangdong Province in China and spread to humans via civet cats and raccoon dogs in the wet markets before spreading to 37 countries. The virus caused 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS and 774 deaths (a case fatality rate of 10%). The MERS-CoV outbreak began in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries. MERS-CoV is believed to have emerged from bats and passed into humans via camels. The ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV has resulted in 1,791 cases of MERS and 640 deaths (a case fatality rate of 36%). The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV provides evidence that coronaviruses are currently spreading from zoonotic sources and can be highly pathogenic, causing serious morbidity and mortality in humans. Treatment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection is limited to providing supportive therapy consistent with any serious lung disease, as no specific drugs have been approved as therapeutics. Highly pathogenic coronaviruses are rare and appear to emerge and disappear within just a few years. Currently, MERS-CoV is still spreading, as new infections continue to be reported. The outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the continuing diagnosis of new MERS cases highlight the need for finding therapeutics for these diseases and potential future coronavirus outbreaks. Screening FDA-approved drugs streamlines the pipeline for this process, as these drugs have already been tested for safety in humans.","output":"Abelson Kinase Inhibitors Are Potent Inhibitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A tanulmny az Orszgos Kriminolgiai Intzetben (OKRI) 2020 szeptemberben ltrehozott COVID-munkacsoport kutatsainak eddigi eredmnyeit mutatja be Az elvgzett desk research eredmnye egy kriminolgiai szempont helyzetfelmrs, ennek megllaptsait adjk k?zre az albbiakban A tanulmny egyttal tervezetknt is szolgl a 2021-re tervezett tfog kutatsokhoz Az eredmnyek minden ktsget kizran rmutatnak, hogy a COVID-jrvny strukturlis vltozsokat hozott a trsadalomban j jelensgek mutatkoztak a b?n?zs terletn is globlisan s Magyarorszgon egyarnt Br Magyarorszgon, a nyugateurpai orszgokkal ellenttben nem voltak er?szakos tiltakoz mozgalmak, s az er?szakos cselekmnyek ?sszes szma a jrvny idejn cs?kkenni ltszott, a gy?l?let j, a b?ncselekmnyi szintet el nem r?, de mindenkppen fenyeget? formi jelentek meg Az llampolgrok t?bb fegyvert vsroltak, a csaldon belli er?szakos cselekmnyek terjed?ben vannak A jrvny szksgess tette, hogy az igazgatsi s gazdasgi gyintzs, valamint a szemlyes kommunikci nagyrszt az online trbe kerlj?n t Ez azonban szlesebbre trta a kaput a kiberb?n?zs, pldul az online trben tevkenyked? csalk s hamistk el?tt, mik?zben a csals nhny rgi formja az offline trben is j el?re kapott Az llampolgrok egszsgnek vdelme s az lhrek terjesztsnek megakadlyozsa rdekben a magyar kormny is szksgesnek tartotta specilis jogi szablyok bevezetst A tanulmny r?viden kitr a jogi vltozsok bemutatsra is A jrvny eddigi id?szaknak vizsglata lehet?v tette egyes relevns jelensgek feltrst, de megbzhatan rtelmezhet? statisztikai adatok csak a ks?bbiekben llnak majd rendelkezsre Ezek elemzse a j?v?beli kutats feladata lesz Alternate abstract: The current study shows the results of the first research conducted by the COVID Working Group established at the National Institute of Criminology (OKRI/NIC) in Budapest, in September 2020 The examination was performed in the form of a desk-research on the criminological aspects of the COVID-epidemic, the results of which are presented in this situation-report The recent report also serves as a draft for a comprehensive research planned for 2021 From the outcome of the analysis, it can be concluded undoubtedly that the COVID-pandemic has brought about certain structural changes on the society and new phenomena have also emerged in the field of crime We could also experience these global tendencies in Hungary, too Although in Hungary, unlike in some Western European countries, there were not any violent protest movements and the general number of violent acts seemed to decrease during the epidemic, new forms of hatred appeared The citizens bought more weapons and there was a growth in domestic violence acts, too The epidemic has strengthened communication in the online space and thus provided an opportunity for cybercrime and the related fraud and counterfeiting, while some old forms of fraud have also begun to spread offline The Hungarian government considered it necessary to introduce special legal rules to protect the health of citizens and to prevent the dissemination of fake news The study briefly presents these legal measures, too The examination of the epidemic period until now allowed us only to discover some relevant phenomena but did not provide an opportunity to obtain interpretable statistical data This will be the task of future researches","output":"A COVID-19 pandmia egyes kriminolgiai aspektusai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Consider a planner who has to decide whether or not to introduce a new policy to a certain local population.

Antibodies for other indications can elicit infusion-related reactions (IRRs), often requiring pre-medication and limiting their application. We report on AMP study IRRs. METHODS From 2016-2018, 2,699 HIV-uninfected, at-risk men and transgender adults in the Americas and Switzerland (704/085) and 1,901 at-risk heterosexual women in sub-Saharan Africa (703/081) were randomized 1:1:1 to VRC01 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or placebo. Participants received infusions every 8 weeks (n=10/participant) over 72 weeks, with 104 weeks of follow-up. Safety assessments were conducted pre- and post-infusion and at non-infusion visits. A total of 40,674 infusions were administered. RESULTS Forty-seven participants (1.7%) experienced 49 IRRs in 704/085; 93 (4.8%) experienced 111 IRRs in 703/081 (p<0.001). IRRs occurred more frequently in VRC01 than placebo recipients in 703/081 (p<0.001). IRRs were associated with atopic history (p=0.046) and with younger age (p=0.023) in 703/081. Four clinical phenotypes of IRRs were observed: urticaria, dyspnea, dyspnea with rash, and \\"other\\". Urticaria was most prevalent, occurring in 25 (0.9%) participants in 704/085 and 41 (2.1%) participants in 703/081. Most IRRs occurred with the initial infusion and incidence diminished through the last infusion. All reactions were managed successfully without sequelae. CONCLUSIONS IRRs in the AMP studies were uncommon, typically mild or moderate, successfully managed at the research clinic, and resolved without sequelae.

While primarily recognized as a respiratory disease, it is clear that COVID-19 is systemic illness impacting multiple organ systems. One defining clinical feature of COVID-19 has been the high incidence of thrombotic events. The underlying processes and risk factors for the occurrence of thrombotic events in COVID-19 remain inadequately understood. While severe bacterial, viral or fungal infections are well recognized to activate the coagulation system, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is likely to have unique mechanistic features. Inflammatory-driven processes are likely primary drivers of coagulopathy in COVID-19, but the exact mechanisms linking inflammation to dysregulated hemostasis and thrombosis are yet to be delineated. Cumulative findings of microvascular thrombosis has raised question if the endothelium and microvasculature should be a point of investigative focus. Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and its protease, ADAMTS13 play important role in the maintenance of microvascular hemostasis. In inflammatory conditions, imbalanced VWF-ADAMTS13 characterized by elevated VWF levels and inhibited and/or reduced activity of ADAMTS13 has been reported. Also, an imbalance between ADAMTS13 activity and VWF antigen is associated with organ dysfunction and death in patients with systemic inflammation. A thorough understanding of VWF-ADAMTS13 interactions during early and advanced phases of COVID-19 could help better define the pathophysiology, guide thromboprophylaxis and treatment and improve clinical prognosis.","output":"Coagulopathy and Thrombosis as a Result of Severe COVID-19 Infection: A Microvascular Focus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Due to the expansion of the tropical flower agribusiness in the southern coastal region of Bahia State, Brazil, and the lack of studies on mites associated to these cultures in the region, mite surveys were conducted from September 2006 to June 2007 in 34 species/cultivars of ornamental plants of the families Costaceae, Heliconiaceae, Musaceae and Zingiberaceae on 11 properties located in 6 counties (13o 21 to 14o 58 of south latitude and 39o 04 to 39o 27 of west longitude) with the aim of determining the composition of functional groups in the field through the analysis of the community at the family level using faunistic indexes.

METHODS: This study actively followed a cohort of social security workers from March to December 2020 to determine the number of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases, asymptomatic associated contacts and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths. Workers were classified into those providing direct care to infected patients (COVID teams), other active healthcare workers (OAHCW), and workers under home protection (HPW). The number of cases and rates were also estimated by job category. RESULTS: Among a total of 542 381 workers, 41 461 were granted stay-at-home protection due to advanced age or comorbidities. Among the 500 920 total active workers, 85 477 and 283 884 were classified into COVID teams and OAHCW, respectively. Infection rates for COVID teams, OAHCW, and HPW were 20.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-20.4], 13.7% (95% CI 15.0-15.3), and 12.2% (95% CI 11.8-12.5), respectively. The risk of hospitalization was higher among HPW. COVID teams had lower mortality rate per 10 000 workers compared to HPW (5.0, 95% CI 4.0-7.0 versus 18.1, 95% CI 14.0-23.0). Compared to administrative workers, ambulance personnel (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.32), social workers (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08-1.24), patient transporters (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.22) and nurses (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.10-1.15) had a higher risk of infection after adjusting for age and gender. Crude differences in mortality rates were observed according to job category, which could be explained by differences in age, sex, and comorbidity distribution. Diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and HIV were associated with increased fatality rates. CONCLUSIONS: COVID team workers had higher infection rates compared to the total population of active workers and HPW. Doctors had lower risk of infection than respiratory therapists, nurses, and patient transporters, among whom interventions should be reconsidered to reduce risks. The presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, arterial hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and HIV, increased the likelihood of complications caused by COVID-19, culminating in a poor prognosis.","output":"Infection and death by COVID-19 in a cohort of healthcare workers in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are effective means to optimize prescribing practices.

Furthermore, there are limited data on how these factors are associated with virological and immunological parameters over time. Methods and Findings: Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were longitudinally collected from a cohort of 58 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Chicago, Illinois between March 27 and June 9, 2020. Samples were assessed for SARS-CoV-2 viral load, viral genotype, viral diversity, and antibody titer. Demographic and clinical information, including patient blood tests and several composite measures of disease severity, were extracted from electronic health records. All parameters were assessed for association with three patient outcome groups: discharge without intensive care unit (ICU) admission (n = 23), discharge with ICU admission (n = 29), and COVID-19 related death (n = 6). Higher age, male sex, and higher body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with ICU admission. At hospital admission, higher 4C Mortality scores and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were likewise associated with ICU admission. Longitudinal trends in Deterioration Index (DI) score, Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and serum neutrophil count were also associated with ICU admission, though only the retrospectively calculated median DI score was predictive of death. While viral load and genotype were not significantly associated with outcome in this study, viral load did correlate positively with C-reactive protein levels and negatively with D-dimer, lymphocyte count, and antibody titer. Intra-host viral genetic diversity resulted in changes in viral genotype in some participants over time, though intra-host evolution was not associated with outcome. A stepwise-generated multivariable model including BMI, lymphocyte count at admission, and neutrophil count at admission was sufficient to predict outcome with a 0.82 accuracy rate in this cohort. Conclusions: These studies suggest that COVID-19 disease severity and poor outcomes among hospitalized patients are likely driven by dysfunctional host responses to infection and underlying co-morbid conditions rather than SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. Several parameters, including 4C mortality score, LDH levels, and DI score, were ultimately predictive of participant outcome and warrant further exploration in larger cohort studies for use in clinical management and risk assessment. Finally, the prevalence of intra-host diversity and viral evolution in hospitalized patients suggests a mechanism for population-level change, further emphasizing the need for effective antivirals to suppress viral replication and to avoid the emergence of new variants.","output":"Assessment and Modeling of COVID-19 Outcomes in a Longitudinal Cohort of Hospitalized Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first reports that the novel coronavirus was showing human-to-human transmission characteristics and asymptomatic cases, the number of patients with associated pneumonia has continued to rise and the epidemic has grown. It now threatens the health and lives of people across the world. The governments of many countries have attached great importance to the prevention of SARS-CoV-2, via research into the etiology and epidemiology of this newly emerged disease. Clinical signs, treatment, and prevention characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia have been receiving attention worldwide, especially from medical personnel. However, owing to the different experimental methods, sample sizes, sample sources, and research perspectives of various studies, results have been inconsistent, or relate to an isolated aspect of the virus or the disease it causes. Currently, systematic summary data on the novel coronavirus are limited. This review combines experimental and clinical evidence into a systematic analysis and summary of the current progress of research into SARS-CoV-2, from multiple perspectives, with the aim of gaining a better overall understanding of the disease. Our report provides important information for current clinicians, for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"New Insights of Emerging SARS-CoV-2: Epidemiology, Etiology, Clinical Features, Clinical Treatment, and Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies have consistently shown that vaccination rates against human papillomavirus (HPV) lag far behind other adolescent vaccinations recommended at the same age, resulting in exposing adolescents to unnecessary future risk of infection, and genital and head and neck cancers. Studies also have demonstrated that a major barrier to vaccination is lack of a strong provider recommendation. Factors that providers offer for failing to give a strong recommendation range from perception that the child is not at risk or the need to explain that the vaccine is not mandated (lack of equity and justice) or respect for parental autonomy. We look at the issue through a different lens, and reframe the above viewpoint by describing how failing to make a strong recommendation means the provider is not meeting the four principles of medical ethics (justice, beneficence, non-maleficence and autonomy).","output":"Medical ethics principles underscore advocating for human papillomavirus vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Accurate detection of filarial parasites in humans and vectors is essential for the implementation and evaluation of Global and National Programs to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Immunological methods to detect infection are available; however, cross-reactivity issues have been reported in most of them. Nucleic acid-based molecular assays offer high levels of specificity and sensitivity and can be used to detect the infections. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) tests to amplify Wuchereria bancrofti DNA in patients' blood. The amplicons were tested by both pH-sensitive dyes for enhanced visual detection and agarose gel electrophoresis. A closed-tube LAMP assay was also evaluated. Cohen's Kappa statistics was used for statistical analysis of the assays. 125 patients consented for blood sampling which were used for clinical analysis of LAMP assays with the PCR method used as the gold standard. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the evaluated Wuchereria bancrofti LAMP was 92.3%, with a specificity of 97.3% and kappa statistics value of 0.84, which is in a strong agreement. CONCLUSION: In this study, LAMP assays coupled with fluorescence dye detection have been found to be suitable for diagnosis and monitoring of Wuchereria bancrofti infections in the Kenyan population.","output":"Optimization of a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay as a Point-of-Care Tool for the Detection of Wuchereria bancrofti in Human Blood in Tana River Delta, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this period of health crisis, while students are facing stressful information, a \\"COVID\\" nurse demystifies the virus, while a Moroccan nurse promotes the cultural diversity of Arabic and French-speaking prevention messages.

Among the implemented policies to reduce the spread of the disease is lockdown. This might have serious impact on farming activities and the livelihoods of millions of people whose daily means of sustenance is tied to agricultural activities. We undertook this study in West Africa, one of the most fragile and vulnerable regions to the epidemic. Our aim was to understand (1) farmers' perception of the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on their farm or business revenue, (2) farmers' preparedness for COVID-19 lockdown on their farm or business revenue, and (3) the impact of effectiveness of COVID-19 lockdown on their farm or business revenue. We combined online questionnaire, physical contact and administration, and social media (Facebook and WhatsApp) to get responses from 303 farmers in Nigeria and Ghana. Our findings show that COVID-19 and lockdown policies negatively affected the farmers. The impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on respondents' farm or business revenue was independent of either age or gender of respondents and the effectiveness of lockdown in both the countries. The status of lockdown in respondent places (locked down versus not locked down) and the level of preparedness of farmers to handle the situation with the current COVID-19 crisis in their farms were also independent in both the countries. However, we found that the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on farm or business revenue depends on the level of preparedness of farmers to handle the situation in each country. We further found that the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on farm or business revenue was independent of the status of lockdown but rather depended on the preparedness for the current COVID-19 crisis and differently across countries. Our findings suggest that building capacities of farmers and supporting them in preparedness for such occurrence, as well as establishing and implementing public policies in this direction, can mitigate the impact of the pandemic on their activities.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on farming, food security, and agribusiness in West Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains a serious health threat to humans and there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics against this deadly virus. Recent scientific evidences have suggested that the main protease (Mpro) enzyme in SARS-CoV-2 can be an ideal drug target due to its crucial role in the viral replication and transcription processes. Therefore, there are ongoing research efforts to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that resulted in hundreds of X-ray crystal structures of ligand-bound Mpro complexes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) describing the interactions of different fragment chemotypes within different sites of the Mpro. In this work, we performed rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of 62 reversible ligand-Mpro complexes in the PDB to gain mechanistic insights about their interactions at the atomic level. Using a total of over 3 s long MD trajectories, we characterized different pockets in the apo Mpro structure, and analyzed the dynamic interactions and binding affinity of ligands within those pockets. Our results identified the key residues that stabilize the ligands in the catalytic sites and other pockets of Mpro. Our analyses unraveled the role of a lateral pocket in the catalytic site in Mpro that is critical for enhancing the ligand binding to the enzyme. We also highlighted the important contribution from HIS163 in the lateral pocket towards ligand binding and affinity against Mpro through computational mutation analyses. Further, we revealed the effects of explicit water molecules and Mpro dimerization in the ligand association with the target. Thus, comprehensive molecular-level insights gained from this work can be useful to identify or design potent small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","output":"Molecular dynamics and in silico mutagenesis on the reversible inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-2 main protease complexes reveal the role of lateral pocket in enhancing the ligand affinity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care workers (HCWs) are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may play a role in transmitting the infection to vulnerable patients and members of the community.

Yet contemporary risk analysis struggles to provide authoritative societal guidance for adequately handling these types of risks, as clearly illustrated by the Coronavirus case. In this paper, we reflect on this situation. We aim to identify critical challenges in current frameworks of risk assessment and management and point to ways to strengthen these, to be better able to confront threats like the Coronavirus in the future.

RESULTS: Intubation and extubation generated small particles (< 5 m) in mean concentrations 12 times greater than background noise (p < 0.001). The mean particle concentrations during endonasal access were 4.5 times greater than background (p = 0.01). Particles were typically large (> 75 m), remained airborne for up to 10 s and travelled up to 1.1 m. Use of a microdebrider generated mean aerosol concentrations 18 times above baseline (p = 0.005).

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify potential failure points in a new chemotherapy preparation technology and to implement changes that prevent or minimize the consequences of those failures before they occur using the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) approach. METHODS: An FMEA was conducted by a team of medication safety pharmacists, oncology pharmacists and technicians, leadership from informatics, investigational drug, and medication safety services, and representatives from the technology vendor. Failure modes were scored using both Risk Priority Number (RPN) and Risk Hazard Index (RHI) scores. RESULTS: The chemotherapy preparation workflow was defined in a 41-step process with 16 failure modes. The RPN and RHI scores were identical for each failure mode because all failure modes were considered detectable. Five failure modes, all attributable to user error, were deemed to pose the highest risk. Mitigation strategies and system changes were identified for 2 failure modes, with subsequent system modifications resulting in reduced risk. CONCLUSION: The FMEA was a useful tool for risk mitigation and workflow optimization prior to implementation of an intravenous compounding technology.

The pre-pandemic mean annual rates per 100,000 population during 2015C2019 were 191 for acute myocardial infarction, 43.9 for idiopathic thrombocytopenia, 28.8 for anaphylaxis, 27.8 for Bells palsy, 25.0 for febrile convulsions, 22.8 for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, 11.3 for myocarditis/pericarditis, 8.7 for pericarditis, 2.9 for myocarditis, 2.0 for Kawasaki disease, 1.9 for Guillain-Barr syndrome, and 1.7 for transverse myelitis, and. Females had higher rates of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis and anaphylaxis while males had higher rates of myocarditis, pericarditis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome. Bells palsy, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Guillain-Barr syndrome increased with age. The mean rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis increased with age up to 79 years; males had higher rates than females: from 12C59 years for myocarditis and 12 years for pericarditis. Febrile convulsions and Kawasaki disease were predominantly childhood diseases and generally decreased with age.

Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics and financial worry with domestic conflict. RESULTS: An increase in domestic conflict was reported by 10.6% (95% CI: 7.7-13.4) of the sample. Domestic conflict increase was significantly associated with younger age, lower education, and financial worry.

We fitted our model to data from the onset of the disease (February 28) until September 15. Estimating the parameters from our model, we predicted the growth of the epidemic for the evolution of the disease until the end of October 2020. We also evaluated via simulations different fictional scenarios for the outcome of alternative policies (those analyses are included in the Supplementary Material). Results and Conclusions: The evolution of the disease has not followed an exponential growth, but rather, stabilized and moved downward after July 2020, starting to increase again after the implementation of the Step-by-Step policy. The lockdown policy implemented in the majority of the country has proven effective in stopping the spread, and the lockdown-relaxation policies, however gradual, appear to have caused an upward break in the trend.","output":"Forecasting the 2020 COVID-19 Epidemic: A Multivariate Quasi-Poisson Regression to Model the Evolution of New Cases in Chile"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 pandemic has impacted the digital public sphere considerably, causing influencers to reflect on their work and social responsibilities.

Experimental studies have revealed a few evidences that coronavirus decayed quickly under the exposure of heat and humidity. This study aims to carry out an epidemiological investigation to establish the association between meteorological factors and COVID-19 in high risk areas of the United States (U.S.). We analyzed daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and seven meteorological measures in top 50 U.S. counties with the most accumulative confirmed cases from March 22, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Our analyses indicate that each meteorological factor and COVID-19 more likely have a nonlinear association rather than a linear association over the wide ranges of temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation observed. Average temperature, minimum relative humidity, and precipitation were better predictors to address the meteorological impact on COVID-19. By including all the three meteorological factors in the same model with their lagged effects up to 3 days, the overall impact of the average temperature on COVID-19 was found to peak at 68.45 F and decrease at higher degrees, though the overall relative risk percentage (RR %) reduction did not become significantly negative up to 85 F. There was a generally downward trend of RR % with the increase of minimum relative humidity; nonetheless, the trend reversed when the minimum relative humidity exceeded 91.42%. The overall RR % of COVID-19 climbed to the highest level of 232.07% (95% confidence interval = 199.77, 267.85) with 1.60 inches of precipitation, and then started to decrease. When precipitation exceeded 1.85 inches, its impact on COVID-19 became significantly negative.

METHODS: A total of 50 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included in our study. For each patient we evaluated the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS), the Summated Xerostomia Inventory-Dutch Version (SXI-DV), The Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED), Schirmer test I, the Hearing Handicap Inventory For Adults (HHIA) and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). All the tests we carried out were performed during the active phase of the symptomatology from COVID-19 (Condition A) and 15 after SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR test negative (Condition B). RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (92%) had olfactory dysfunction related to the infection. The 70% of patients reported gustatory disorders. Cough, fever, headache and asthenia were the most prevalent symptoms. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0,001) in sQOD-NS, SXI-DV, SPEED, Schirmer test, HHIA and THI between Condition A and Condition B.

Results: Selected predictors for acceptance of the vaccination were: being talked through the importance of the vaccination and potential side-effects by a medical professional; sharing living space with others; having a high ranking occupation; suffering from chronic illnesses; being able to access medical services by driving or walking rather than using public transport or relying on others. Those who opted not to be vaccinated most frequently justify their decision by saying that they were concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine or that they were worried about side-effects. Conclusions: It appears that the current nationwide campaign has successfully raised awareness regarding the vaccine, but this research indicates that a more information-based campaign, focusing on evidence of the vaccine's efficacy and the non-serious nature of all side-effects, could lead to improved uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine.","output":"Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake in an elderly sample in Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air pollution levels are uneven within cities, contributing to persistent health disparities between neighborhoods and population sub\\\\groups.

Methods People who had ever injected psychoactive drugs were recruited to the UAM Survey by specialist drug/alcohol services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. From June 2020, in addition to providing a dried blood spot sample and completing the UAM behavioural questionnaire, participants were asked to complete an enhanced coronavirus disease (COVID-19) questionnaire. Preliminary data are presented to the end of October and were compared to data from the 2019 UAM Survey, where possible.

Social isolation (We prefer social support rather than food donations) and 4. Gratitude (Feeling thankful). The physical distancing program introduced to contain the pandemic isolated many elders and diminished their capacity to access support from others needed to perform their daily activities.

For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of lockdown in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed lockdown duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the lockdown can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration lockdown is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the lockdown is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing lockdown duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different lockdown durations.","output":"Effects of latency and age structure on the dynamics and containment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE No studies analyzing the role of dementia as a risk factor for mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.

RNA viruses have extremely high mutation rates and thus represent a significant source of these infectious diseases. In the present study, we showed that a plant-pathogenic RNA virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), could replicate and produce virions in honeybees, Apis mellifera, resulting in infections that were found throughout the entire body. Additionally, we showed that TRSV-infected individuals were continually present in some monitored colonies. While intracellular life cycle, species-level genetic variation, and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts remain to be determined, the increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses from spring toward winter in infected colonies was associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse, suggesting the negative impact of the virus on colony survival. Furthermore, we showed that TRSV was also found in ectoparasitic Varroa mites that feed on bee hemolymph, but in those instances the virus was restricted to the gastric cecum of Varroa mites, suggesting that Varroa mites may facilitate the spread of TRSV in bees but do not experience systemic invasion. Finally, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that TRSV isolates from bees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites clustered together, forming a monophyletic clade. The tree topology indicated that the TRSVs from arthropod hosts shared a common ancestor with those from plant hosts and subsequently evolved as a distinct lineage after transkingdom host alteration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 36 children who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using respiratory specimens. Coronavirus disease-positive and -negative period parameters were evaluated. For measurement of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and urine 2 microglobulin levels, patients urine samples were collected at diagnosis and 1 month after discharge. Additionally, routine urine and hematological parameters were evaluated concurrently. RESULTS: For all patients, the median urine 2 microglobulin, serum urea, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly higher in the coronavirus disease-positive period than in the coronavirus disease-negative period (P < .05). Further, serum platelet count was significantly lower in the coronavirus disease-positive period than in the coronavirus disease-negative period (P < .05). However, there was no difference in serum creatinine, interleukin-6, or interleukin-1 levels between the 2 periods (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest kidney involvement and tubular dysfunction in patients with asymptomatic, mild, and moderate infections.

METHODS: Using a novel methyl-sensitive restriction endonuclease approach to measure site-specific DNA methylation profiles, immune system phentoype EpiMarkers are identified using a machine-learning computational bioinformatics platform. The result is a diagnostic network of 20 to 40 immuno DNA methylation sites having the greatest predictive power for identifying patients whose COVID-19 disease will likely progress to ARDS requiring ICU/intubation care. RESULTS: Immune system status in peripheral whole blood provides a sensitive and responsive sentinel signal reflecting how different functional pathways are currently being regulated in a subject. Deciphering this signal status of how immune cells are set to respond provides deep functional information regarding patient health and potential disease phenotypes resulting from a cytokine storm characteristic of a hyper immune inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to identify future potential changes in patient health using this novel EpiMarker technology opens new avenues for defending populations from severe disease risks of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: A successful EpiMarker Assay for COVID-19 disease severity risk would allow for two important applications: (1) patients could be triaged early in the course of infection to allow for critical decisions for allocating resources, both in terms of hospital infrastructure (ICU beds, ventilators) and therapeutic drug treatments; and (2) pre-infection, individuals could be screened to identify personnel at low-risk for mission critical assignments (first responders, doctors, nurses, military personnel, etc.) during future pandemics and ongoing battles with viral pathogens like influenza.","output":"Rapid COVID-19 Prognostic Blood Test for Disease Severity Using Epigenetic Immune System Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Physiological changes during pregnancy put pregnant women at higher risk for COVID-19 complications.

The risk of premature labor or abortion in cases showed no increase. 12 cases were in ongoing normal status; on follow up, 11 cases had delivered their babies at term and one had ended in IUFD because of pregnancy-induced hypertension. All delivered babies were healthy. Caesarean section in all cases was performed under obstetric indications or maternal demand, and no relation was found between COVID-19 and Caesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes according to gestational age in 8 cases out of 11 (72.72%) were desirable; neonatal morbidity and mortality resulted from pregnancy complications. Blood pH in 6 neonates was assessed due to immaturity and NICU admission, all of which were in normal ranges except one case related to HELLP syndrome. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical symptoms in pregnancy were similar to non-pregnant women, no rise in risk of premature labor or abortion was seen, and vertical transmission was not observed in none of cases. Lymphopenia was the leading laboratory change. Given asymptomatic cases despite severe forms of infection in pregnancies, we propose screening in all suspected cases. All placentas and newborns should be tested in the field for vertical transmission.","output":"Characteristics, clinical and laboratory data and outcomes of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Al-Zahra tertiary referral maternity center in Iran: a case series of 24 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The most susceptible population group to critical and fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is older adults. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host immune response is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiological effects of lung damage. Therefore, corticosteroid therapy could modulate inflammation-mediated pulmonary injury and thereby reduce progression to severe respiratory failure and death. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and clinical efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in older adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: We reviewed the clinical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 75 years or older admitted to our hospital over a three months period (March 1, to May 31, 2020). A total of 143 patients were included in the study cohort. From 2 April, 2020, in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on COVID-19, our hospital protocol added corticosteroid for COVID-19 treatment. We compared in-hospital mortality among patients with critical COVID-19 who received corticosteroids therapy and those who did not. RESULTS: 88 patients (61.5%) were treated with corticosteroids, and 55 patients (38.4%) were not. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The median age was 85 years (IQR, 82C89), and 61.5% (88/143) were male. In-hospital mortality was lower in the corticosteroid group (68.2%) compared with patients in the non-corticosteroid group (81.8%). Treatment with corticosteroids was an independent survival factor (HR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.41C0.93; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill older adults with COVID-19 pneumonia, the use of corticosteroid treatment resulted in lower mortality without severe adverse events.","output":"Impact of systemic corticosteroids on mortality in older adults with critical COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study analyzed trends and patterns in the 22 years of research published in Health Communication.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate patterns and trends in diet quality by food sources among US children and adults overall and in sociodemographic subgroups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This serial, cross-sectional survey study included respondents from 8 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (2003-2018) with valid dietary recalls. Data were analyzed from April 16, 2020, to July 20, 2020. EXPOSURES: Survey cycle, food source, and key sociodemographic subgroups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean diet quality of foods (meals, snacks, and beverages) consumed per person, characterized by the American Heart Association diet score (range, 0-80, with higher scores indicating healthier diets), the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating healthier diets), and their components. For the American Heart Association diet score, poor diet was defined as less than 40.0% adherence (score, <32.0), intermediate diet as 40.0% to 79.9% adherence (score, 32.0-63.9), and ideal as 80.0% or greater adherence (score, 64.0). RESULTS: The study included 20 905 children 5 to 19 years of age (mean [SD] age, 12.1 [5.24] years; 51.0% male) and 39 757 adults 20 years or older (mean [SD] age, 47.3 [15.1] years; 51.9% female). Diet quality of foods consumed from grocery stores increased modestly in children (53.2% to 45.1% with poor diet quality; P = .006 for trend) and adults (40.1% to 32.9% with poor diet quality; P = .001 for trend), with smaller changes for restaurants among children (84.8% to 79.6% with poor diet quality; P = .003 for trend). Changes for restaurants among adults were not statistically significant (65.4% to 65.2% with poor diet quality; P = .07 with poor diet quality); the same was true of worksites (adults: 55.6% to 50.7% with poor diet quality; P = .25 for trend). Food quality from other sources worsened (children: 40.0% to 51.7% with poor diet quality; adults: 33.8% to 43.8% with poor diet quality; P < .001 for trend each). The largest improvement in diet quality was in schools, with the percentage with poor diet quality decreasing from 55.6% to 24.4% (P < .001 for trend), mostly after 2010, and with equitable improvements across population subgroups. Findings were similar for Healthy Eating Index 2015. Significant disparities in diet quality trends were seen by sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and household income for food consumed from grocery stores. For example, the proportion of foods consumed from grocery stores that were of poor diet quality decreased among high-income adults (from 36.9% to 26.5%; P = .001 for trend) but not among low-income adults (from 45.8% to 41.3%; P = .09 for trend). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: By 2017-2018, foods consumed at schools improved significantly and provided the best mean diet quality of major US food sources, without population disparities. Additional improvements are needed from all major US food sources, with particular attention on equity.","output":"Trends in Food Sources and Diet Quality Among US Children and Adults, 2003-2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been generated and shared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and constitute a vital information source that informs outbreak control, disease surveillance, and public health policy. The Pango dynamic nomenclature is a popular system for classifying and naming genetically-distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and is based on the analysis of complete or near-complete virus genomes. However, for several reasons, nucleotide sequences may be generated that cover only the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore important to understand how much information about Pango lineage status is contained in spike-only nucleotide sequences. Here we explore how Pango lineages might be reliably designated and assigned to spike-only nucleotide sequences. We survey the genetic diversity of such sequences, and investigate the information they contain about Pango lineage status. Although many lineages, including the main variants of concern, can be identified clearly using spike-only sequences, some spike-only sequences are shared among tens or hundreds of Pango lineages. To facilitate the classification of SARS-CoV-2 lineages using subgenomic sequences we introduce the notion of designating such sequences to a \\"lineage set\\", which represents the range of Pango lineages that are consistent with the observed mutations in a given spike sequence. These data provide a foundation for the development of software tools that can assign newly-generated spike nucleotide sequences to Pango lineage sets.","output":"Pango lineage designation and assignment using SARS-CoV-2 spike gene nucleotide sequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Hand washing is an important preventive measure to avoid transmission of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Medical students should be acquainted with the World Health Organizations hand-washing guidelines and should follow them to break the chain of spread of the virus This study aims to find the acquaintance of medical undergraduates with the guidelines and to find out if they have started implementing these guidelines since the corona-virus outbreak Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study, conducted among MBBS, BSc and PCL nursing students in first year to internship of a tertiary care hospital from May 2020 to August 2020, and ethical clearance was received from the Institutional Review Committee (ref no: IRC-LMC 11-D/020) of Lumbini Medical College and Teaching Hospital Data collection was done through online questionnaires Data analysis of the obtained information was done in Microsoft-excel Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data Results: Of 462 respondents, 265 (57 4%) (52 9-61 9 at 95% Confidence Interval) respondents followed the World Health Organization hand-washing guidelines during every hand wash Among them 172 (37 2%) participants had learned the guidelines through awareness programs The majority of respondents belonged to 20-25 age groups, 275 (59 5%), and the majority were pursuing an MBBS degree, 360 (77 9%) Conclusions: We conclude that a notable number of medical undergraduates have been acquainted with standard hand-washing guidelines since the corona-virus outbreak, but some of them still do not follow the guidelines practically Therefore, effective and impactful awareness programs need to be launched to improve hand hygiene practices","output":"Washing hands according to the who guideline since the COVID-19 outbreak in the context of medical undergraduates at a tertiary care center: A descriptive cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The era of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) is rapidly evolving.

Several factors were associated with a strong reduction in transmission: public awareness rising, testing and tracing, information on local incidence, and high temperature. Immunity after infection, school and restaurant closures, stay-at-home orders, and mandatory face covering were associated with a smaller reduction in transmission. The data suggests that public distancing rules increased transmission in young adults. Information on local incidence was associated with a reduction in transmission of up to 44% (95%-CI: [40%, 48%]), which suggests a prominent role of behavioral adaptations to local risk of infection. Testing and tracing reduced transmission by 15% (95%-CI: [9%,20%]), where the effect was strongest among the elderly.

The damage related to TBI is first due to the direct injury and then to a secondary phase in which neuroinflammation plays a key role. NLRP3 inflammasome is a component of the innate immune response and different diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, are characterized by NLRP3 activation. This review aims to describe NLRP3 inflammasome and the consequences related to its activation following TBI. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1?, and IL-18 are significantly upregulated after TBI, therefore, the use of nonspecific, but mostly specific NLRP3 inhibitors is useful to ameliorate the damage post-TBI characterized by neuroinflammation. Moreover, NLRP3 and the molecules associated with its activation may be considered as biomarkers and predictive factors for other neurodegenerative diseases consequent to TBI. Complications such as continuous stimuli or viral infections, such as the SARS-CoV-2 infection, may worsen the prognosis of TBI, altering the immune response and increasing the neuroinflammatory processes related to NLRP3, whose activation occurs both in TBI and in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review points out the role of NLRP3 in TBI and highlights the hypothesis that NLRP3 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the management of neuroinflammation in TBI.","output":"The Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome in the Pathogenesis of Traumatic Brain Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Click here to listen to the Podcast.","output":"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies in melanoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using data on stocks held by individual investors at retail brokerage firm Robinhood, we document that these investors are actively engaged in both momentum and contrarian trading strategies.

This issue had not been studied on a broader international level earlier. This research firstly discovers altruism and volunteerism values in the economy. Then, based on the third-party model, observes each part, where participants are the (1) volunteer (employee) (2) company (and its CSR activity) and (3) an external organization, which manages this type of formal volunteerism. Each participant was analyzed through comprehensive analysis using descriptive and inference statistics and classification methods on complex, extensive secondary databases. Altogether, more than 10,000 respondents answers are examined from two worldwide surveys, and further ten international statistical indicators and indices are explored. These methods result in volunteer characteristics on a personal level, afterwards in country classification, which provides a cultural comparison of the employee volunteerism. Our findings prove that demographical differences do not, but company-level actions influence the intensity of formal volunteerism. Moreover, three main clusters (formed from 43 countries) show different values. This diversity might partly be caused by measurement fragmentations and lack of internationally accepted definitions and theories. This paper aims to provide a broader overview of the topic, which might be a useful starting point for the forthcoming aggregated conceptualization. Employee volunteers behavior arises from the personal value of volunteerism. However, the attendance and intensity of voluntary activity are primarily influenced by the environment (e.g., life period, living and working situation). Employee volunteerism programs are an important and essential part of CSR at the company level, and strongly frames this activity, where employee volunteerism could associate each participants interests and improve their values.

This study aims to compare and characterize the emergency department admissions due to physical trauma and injuries among local residents and refugees in greater Beirut. Methods This epidemiological study analyzes injury incidence and characteristics of patients presenting to Emergency Departments of 5 sentinel hospitals between 2017 and 2019. Using the WHO Injury Surveillance Guidelines and Pan-Asia Trauma Outcomes Study form, an injury data surveillance form was designed and used in hospital settings to collect data on injuries. Chi-square test analysis was performed to compare differences in injury characteristics between local residents and refugees. Regression models were constructed to assess the effect of being a refugee on the characteristics of injuries and outcomes of interest. Results A total of 4847 injuries (3933 local residents and 914 refugees) were reported. 87.4% of the total injuries among refugees were sustained by the younger age groups 0-45 years compared to 68.8% among local residents. The most prevalent injury mechanism was fall (39.4%) for locals and road traffic injury (31.5%) for refugees. The most injured body part was extremities for both populations (78.2% and 80.1%). Injuries mostly occurred at home or its vicinity (garden or inside the camp) for both populations (29.3% and 23.1%). Refugees sustained a higher proportion of injuries at work (6%) compared to locals (1.3%). On multivariate analysis, refugee status was associated with higher odds of having an injury due to a stab/gunshot (odds ratio (OR) = 3.392, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.605-4.416), having a concussion injury (OR = 1.718, 95% CI = 1.151-2.565), and being injured at work (OR = 4.147, 95% CI = 2.74-6.278). Refugee status was associated with increased odds of leaving the hospital with injury-related disability (OR = 2.271, 95% CI = 1.891-2.728)].

Parents protect adolescents with depression from the risks of SM use by monitoring their childs SM activity; however, this comes into conflict with the adolescents need for autonomy in their web-based communication. The implications of SM use and monitoring for adolescents with depression and their parents are of particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, as rates of SM use have increased in response to physical distancing measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore parent and child perspectives regarding the use and function of SM in the daily lives of adolescents with depression and parents perceptions of and experience with monitoring their childs SM use. METHODS: We conducted qualitative interviews with adolescents with depression (n=23) and one parent of each adolescent (n=23) between July 2013 and September 2014. The adolescents were patients seeking treatment for depression in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Data analysis included dyadic analysis of the adolescents and parents perspectives and qualitative descriptions of individual parent interviews to explore their experiences with SM use and monitoring. The construct of parental knowledge and factors hypothesized to contribute to parental knowledge, including adolescent disclosure, parental solicitation, and parental control, were used to guide the codebook and dyadic data analysis. RESULTS: Dyadic analyses showed that parents and their children disagreed on the use and function of SM in the daily lives of adolescents with depression, with adolescents viewing SM as a forum for honest expression of their emotions, whereas parents felt that their childrens posts were inconsequential and interfered with the adolescents lives. Furthermore, parents reported using a wide range of strategies to gain knowledge of their childs SM use to monitor their safety on SM, including direct solicitation and indirect solicitation, such as keeping the child's passwords, asking friends or siblings about their child's SM use, and restricting SM behavior and access to devices. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should support adolescents with depression and their parents in finding common ground for an effective and acceptable monitoring approach.

The adequate management of these patients depends on the comprehension of factors such as temporality, clinical presentation and etiology. We hypothesize there is an important temporal relationship between COVID-19 severity and stroke onset. METHODS: a systematic review of the available literature was conducted using Pubmed and Scopus, studies reporting patients with Coronavirus disease 19 and stroke were included. Clinical, sociodemographic and laboratory characteristics of patients were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies and 176 patients were included, with a mean age of 63.1 years (SD= 16 n=122), most of them were males (63.2% n=171). The most frequent etiology was cryptogenic 40.9% n=66), and a mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 14.4 points was found (SD= 8.6 n=73). Large vessel occlusion was reported in 65.9% patients (n=91) and these patients were younger with greater stroke severity. D-dimer, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated in most patients with reported findings. Most patients had severe Coronavirus disease 2019. The mean time from onset of respiratory symptoms to stroke was 9 days (SD=9.9), the shortest time was noted in those with mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSIONS: There is a trend between the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 and time to stroke onset. Also, age and stroke severity were found to be related to the development of large vessel occlusion.

Certain sC measures were positively associated with the BSI social withdrawal subscale (i.e., area under the curve with respect to the increase, beta = 0.082, p = 0.02; evening sC value: beta = 0.110, p = 0.003; and mean sC value: beta = 0.097; p = 0.01). We found limited support for statistical mediation by social withdrawal (measured using a composite social withdrawal score) on the relationship between evening sC and depression. Thus, although we found no support for a role of basal and diurnal sAA in social withdrawal, HPA-axis activation may partly aggravate social withdrawal in depressive disorders.","output":"Salivary markers of stress system activation and social withdrawal in humans."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical-radiological-pathological characteristics and treatment outcomes of children with suspected exogenous lipoid pneumonia (ELP).

METHODS From November 2013 to December 2016, 24 patients with gastric cancer underwent intracorporeal circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-double-stapling technique (hemi-DST) using the OrVil? in antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the left side of the patient following LTG to prevent twisting of the esophagojejunostomy and lifted jejunum, which might cause intractable stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy. RESULTS In this patient series, no twisting of the esophagojejunostomy and lifted jejunum was encountered intraoperatively or postoperatively. Two stenoses of the esophagojejunostomy occurred. Because neither was involved with twisting and both were localized at the anastomotic plane, endoscopic treatments including balloon dilation and electrocautery incisional therapy were successful in both cases. There were no patients with intractable stenosis in this series. CONCLUSIONS Intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-DST using the OrVil? in antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the left side of the patient can be one option for a circular stapling technique in LTG due to its prevention of intractable stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy that is refractory to endoscopic treatments.","output":"Stenosis after esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-double-stapling technique using the transorally inserted anvil (OrVil?) in Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the patient's left side following laparoscopic total gastrectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2008 the World Health Organization established an international network of biodosimetry laboratories, the BioDoseNet.

A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a stochastic compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settings-Los Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find that the effective reproduction number (RE) dropped below 1 rapidly in all five locations following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020, but that gradually increasing mobility starting around mid-April led to an RE once again above 1 in late May (Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta) or early June (Santa Clara County and Seattle). However, we find that increased social distancing starting in mid-July in response to epidemic resurgence once again dropped RE below 1 in all locations by August 14. We next used the fitted model to ask: how does truncating the individual-level transmission rate distribution (which removes periods of time with especially high individual transmission rates and thus models superspreading events) affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find that interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, \\"chopping off the tail\\" to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","output":"Chopping the tail: How preventing superspreading can help to maintain COVID-19 control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite worldwide initiatives, the exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rate is low.

Here, using an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), PLX5622, and mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV], strain JHMV), we show that depletion of microglia during the time of JHMV clearance resulted in impaired myelin repair and prolonged clinical disease without affecting the kinetics of virus clearance. Microglia were required only during the early stages of remyelination. Notably, large deposits of extracellular vesiculated myelin and cellular debris were detected in the spinal cords of PLX5622-treated and not control mice, which correlated with decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes in demyelinating lesions in drug-treated mice. Furthermore, gene expression analyses demonstrated differential expression of genes involved in myelin debris clearance, lipid and cholesterol recycling, and promotion of oligodendrocyte function. The results also demonstrate that microglial functions affected by depletion could not be compensated by infiltrating macrophages. Together, these results demonstrate that microglia play key roles in debris clearance and in the initiation of remyelination following infection with a neurotropic coronavirus but are not necessary during later stages of remyelination.","output":"Microglia depletion exacerbates demyelination and impairs remyelination in a neurotropic coronavirus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following Standard Operating Procedures and being Social distanced is now the new norm for most of the people worldwide, amidst this pandemic.

BACKGROUND Exposure to radiation from medical imaging has become a public health concern, but whether it causes significant cell damage remains unclear. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study in 67 patients undergoing cardiac CTA between January 2012 and December 2013 in 2 U.S. medical centers. Median blood radiation exposure was estimated using phantom dosimetry. Biomarkers of DNA damage and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, whole genome sequencing, and single cell polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The median dose length product was 1,535.3 mGycm (969.7 to 2,674.0 mGycm). The median radiation dose to the blood was 29.8 mSv (18.8 to 48.8 mSv). Median DNA damage increased 3.39% (1.29% to 8.04%, p < 0.0001) and median apoptosis increased 3.1-fold (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.4- to 5.1-fold, p < 0.0001) post-radiation. Whole genome sequencing revealed changes in the expression of 39 transcription factors involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, and DNA repair. Genes involved in mediating apoptosis and DNA repair were significantly changed post-radiation, including DDB2 (1.9-fold [IQR: 1.5- to 3.0-fold], p < 0.001), XRCC4 (3.0-fold [IQR: 1.1- to 5.4-fold], p = 0.005), and BAX (1.6-fold [IQR: 0.9- to 2.6-fold], p < 0.001). Exposure to radiation was associated with DNA damage (odds ratio [OR]: 1.8 [1.2 to 2.6], p = 0.003).

There are currently no standardized techniques for training residents in this procedure. Cognitive task analysis (CTA) is a method of analyzing and standardizing key steps in a procedure that allows training to be conducted in a validated and reproducible manner. PURPOSE: (1) To design a digital CTA teaching tool for a standardized all-inside meniscal repair. (2) To evaluate whether CTA-trained residents would perform better in a meniscal repair task compared with a control group who underwent traditional apprenticeship methods of training. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Three expert knee surgeons were interviewed using a modified Delphi method to generate a consensus among the ideal technical steps, cognitive decision points, and common errors and solutions for an all-inside meniscal repair. This written information was then combined with visual and audio components and integrated onto a digital platform to create the Imperial College London/University College London Meniscus Repair Cognitive Task Analysis (IUMeRCTA) tool. Eighteen novice residents were randomized into an intervention group (digital CTA tool) and control group (equipment instruction manual). Both groups performed an all-inside meniscal repair on high-fidelity, phantom knee models and were assessed by expert surgeons, blinded to the interventions, using a validated global rating scale (GRS). After a power calculation, median GRS scores were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U test; significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: For the IUMeRCTA tool design, the procedure was divided into 55 steps across 9 phases: (1) preoperative planning, (2) theater and patient setup, (3) portal placement, (4) meniscal examination, (5) tear reduction, (6) suture planning, (7) suture insertion, (8) repair completion, and (9) postoperative care and rehabilitation.

The liberalization of the media market that started in 2000, led to proliferation of media outlets and galloping commercialization of media ownership and content. The next big change came with digitalization that fundamentally altered media habits of Croatian audiences. Television was preceded by online media as the main source of news while the press registers constant decline in readership, trust and advertising revenues. Radio remains the most trusted medium, as opposed to social media that are the least trusted source of information. Nevertheless, the level of trust in social networks in Croatia is considerably higher than the EU average. The data on media freedom and journalistic autonomy indicate that Croatia has made significant progress in this respect in the past thirty years. Although problems related to freedom, autonomy and political pressure persist, the biggest threat to journalism nowadays seems to come from within the profession. Commercialization, coupled with digitalization and merciless struggle for survival, eventually led news media to succumb to tabloid-style journalism and to radically downplay their professional standards. Although the role of the media as a social corrective remains undisputed, such media practices seem to cultivate media fatigue and foster distrust in political institutions.

However, the structure-activity relationship of lipopeptides as TLR2 agonists is still unclear. Here, 23 synthetic lipopeptides with the same lipid moiety but different peptide sequences were synthesized, and their TLR2 activities in vitro and mucosal adjuvant effects to OVA were evaluated. LP1-14, LP1-30, LP1-34 and LP2-2 exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity and stronger TLR2 activity compared with Pam(2)CSK(4), the latter being one of the most potent TLR2 agonists. LP1-34 and LP2-2 assisted OVA to induce more profound specific IgG in sera or sIgA in BALF than Pam(2)CSK(4). Furthermore, the possibility of LP1-34, LP2-2 and Pam(2)CSK(4) as the mucosal adjuvant for the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant RBD (rRBD) was investigated.

Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous graphene-carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal-organic framework (MOF) derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D-ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite-free Zn-metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long-term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D-ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating-stripping stability at an ultra-high current density of 20 mA cm-2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (<65 mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D-ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000 mA g-1 , demonstrating the potential of the 3D-ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

METHODS: We included all individuals who by 16 March 2021 had completed &#8805;14 days of follow up after the receipt of BNT162b2. We calculated incidence rates (IR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI), during days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, 22-28, and >28 days post-vaccination. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) relative to the first 7-day post-vaccination period. RESULTS: We included 199,219 individuals with 6,521,124 person-days of follow up. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 1,877 (0.9%), of which 489 (26.1%) were asymptomatic and 123 (6.6%) required oxygen support. The median time from first vaccination to SARS-CoV-2 confirmation was 11.9 days (IQR 7.7-18.2).

METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant publications, using the terms COVID-19 aerosolisation, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 transmission, COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and endoscopy, Endoscopy for COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 3745 articles were identified, 26 of which were selected to answer the question of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation during upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. All studies suggested high infectivity from contact and droplet spread. No clinical study has yet reported the viral load in the aerosol and therefore the infective dose has not been accurately determined. However, aerosol-generating procedures are potentially risky and full personal protective equipment should be used. CONCLUSIONS: As it is a highly infectious disease, clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 require effective personal protective equipment. The main routes of infection are direct contact and droplets in the air and on surfaces. Aerosolisation carries a substantial risk of infection, so any aerosol-producing procedure, such as endoscopy, should be performed wearing personal protective equipment and with extra caution to protect the endoscopist, staff and patients from cross-infection via the respiratory system.","output":"Extent of infectious SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation as a result of oesophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThere is limited information regarding the role of biomarker levels at predicting mortality in patients with the novel coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19).

Informed by a model of identity leadership (Haslam, Reicher &Platow, 2020), this review argues that leaders ability to do these things is grounded in their ability to represent and advance the shared interests of group members and to create and embed a sense of shared social identity among them (a sense of us-ness). For leaders, then, this sense of us-ness is the key resource that they need to marshal in order to harness the support and energy of citizens. The review discusses examples of the successes and failures of different leaders during the pandemic and organises these around five policy priorities related to the 5Rs of identity leadership: Readying, Reflecting, Representing, Realising and Reinforcing.

Many complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 make patients difficult to recover. Flavonoids, especially formononetin and ononin, have the potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 and improve myocardial injury. However, their poor water solubility, poor oral absorption, high toxicity, and high-cost purification limit industrial practical application. Succinylation modification provides a solution for the above problems. Formononetin-7-O--(6-O-succinyl)-D-glucoside (FMP), a new compound, was succinyl glycosylated from formononetin by the organic solvent tolerant bacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FJ18 in a 10.0% DMSO (v/v) system. The water solubility of the new compound was improved by over 106 times compared with formononetin, which perfectly promoted the application of formononetin and ononin.

Methods Consecutively, prospectively enrolled patients with ELVO presenting within 4 h of onset were entered into a National Acute Stroke Registry of patients undergoing revascularization. Patients treated with bridging were compared to those treated with dEVT. Excellent outcome was defined as having a modified Rankin Scale score 1 at 90 days following stroke. Results Out of 392 patients that underwent thrombectomy, 270 (68%) presented within 4 h and were included. Of those, 159 (59%) underwent bridging and 111 (41%) underwent dEVT. Atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure were more common in the dEVT group (43 vs. 30%, p = 0.04 and 20 vs. 8%, p = 0.009, respectively), but other risk factors, demographics, stroke severity and subtypes as well as baseline vessel patency state and time metrics did not differ.

In response, the American College of Surgeons, U.S. Surgeon General, and other surgical professional specialties have recommended postponing elective surgical procedures and proceeding cautiously with cancer procedures that may require significant hospital resources and expose vulnerable patients to the virus. These challenges are particularly distressing for women with a gynecologic cancer diagnosis and their providers. Currently, circumstances vary greatly by region and by hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. Therefore, COVID-19-related modifications to surgical practice guidelines must be individualized. Special consideration is necessary to evaluate the appropriateness of procedural interventions, recognizing the significant resources and personnel they require. Additionally, the pandemic may occur in waves, with patient demand for surgery ebbing and flowing accordingly. Hospitals, cancer centers and providers must prepare themselves to meet this demand.

National lockdown measures are believed to dramatically have limited the spread of the virus globally, but on the other side, may have had several unknown negative side effects on the planned and acute care for vulnerable groups. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown restrictions on the number of emergency and elective hip joint surgeries due to fractures and osteoarthritis (OA), respectively, and explore whether these procedures are more/less affected by lockdown restrictions than other hospital care. Methods: In 1.344.355 persons aged 35 years in the Norwegian emergency preparedness (BEREDT C19) register, we studied the daily number of persons having 1) electively planned surgeries due to hip OA, and 2) emergency surgeries due to hip fractures before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were implemented nationally on March 13th 2020, for different age and sex groups. We also studied the daily number of all-cause elective- and all-cause emergency hospitalizations (&gt;24 hours). For all our outcomes, we categorized dates in five 2-weeks periods before lockdown (March 13th 2020), and five 2-weeks periods after lockdown, covering a total time period from January 3rd 2020 to May 21st 2020. To observe trends in number of events over time, we compared the incidence rate ratios (IRR) for all the 2-week periods with the base level, which was defined as the two first weeks of January. We also compared IRR in the 10 weeks before and after lockdown restrictions were implemented, using the entire period of 10 weeks before lockdown as base level (Jan 3rd-March 12th). The IRRs reflect the after-lockdown number of events divided by the before-lockdown number events. Results: The IRRs for all the 2-weeks periods, for elective and emergency hip surgeries are presented in the Figure, indicating a large and consistent decrease in hip OA surgeries and a smaller but more age- and sex-dependent decrease in hip fracture surgeries. More specifically, for the two 10-weeks periods before and after lockdown, we observed that the number of after-lockdown elective hip surgeries due to OA were one third of the number of before-lockdown elective hip surgeries due to OA, and the drop was similar for men and women above and below 70 years (IRR 0.3). This drop for hip OA surgeries was greater than the drop seen for all-cause elective hospital care (IRR 0.6, 95% CI=0.6-0.6). In contrast, the number of emergency hip fracture surgeries had a drop of a similar magnitude as that observed for all-cause emergency care (IRR=0.8, 95% CI=0.8-0.8). However, there were age and sex differences in the magnitude of the drop. Men aged 35-69 had close to half the number of surgeries (IRR 0.6, 95% CI=0.6-0.6), whereas women aged 70 had the same number of emergency hip fracture surgeries after lockdown (IRR 1, 95% CI = 1-1). Only women aged 35-69 and men aged 70 had emergency hip fracture surgery rates after lockdown comparable to what may be expected based on analyses of all-cause acute care (IRR 0.8, 95% CI=0.8-0.8). Conclusions: We report a sudden and steep decrease in the daily number of planned hip joint surgeries due to OA, beginning on the day after lockdown restrictions were implemented in Norway on March 13th 2020. This decrease was greater than the decrease in other (all-cause) elective inpatient care for all age and sex groups. Interestingly, we also report a consistent decrease of all-cause emergency inpatient care that only partly was found in age- and sex-specific analyses of emergency hip joint fracture surgeries. We believe these findings are important to report for an improved knowledge foundation allowing for an optimal management of future pandemics of a similar or larger scale.

Data on the prevalence of MS in non-obese patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is scarce. This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of MS in non-obese patients with OSA. METHODOLOGY: All consecutively diagnosed patients with OSA between October 2018 and November 2019 were screened for metabolic syndrome. Patients with OSA and BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (NOOSA) vs BMI > 25 kg/m(2) (obese OSA) were compared. Lean waist NOOSA was defined as BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and WC < 80 cm (32 in.) for women or < 90 cm (36 in.) for men. RESULTS: During the study period, 502 patients were diagnosed with OSA. MS was observed in 35% of patients with NOOSA compared to obese patients with OSA (79%). In the NOOSA group, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia were observed in 65, 48, 14 and 61% respectively and all of these parameters were significantly more common in the obese group (p < 0.001). Parameters of OSA severity (apnea-hypopnea index or AHI, time spent below 90% saturated or T90, and nadir oxygen) were significantly more severe in the obese group with OSA. Approximately 83% of patients in the NOOSA group had at least two metabolic risk factors, compared to the obese OSA group, in which 95% had two or more metabolic risk factors. Sixty-four percent of patients with NOOSA with lean waist had at least two metabolic risk factors. At BMI cut-offs of < 25, < 27 and < 30 kg/m2; 35, 46 and 57% of patients with OSA respectively had metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSION: Metabolic syndrome was observed in approximately one in three patients with OSA and BMI < 25 kg/m(2). Approximately two of every three lean waist non-obese patients with OSA had at least two markers of metabolic syndrome.

We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles to identify further articles and identified articles through social and conventional news media. We found 25 articles. Study of protection for the wearer used healthy volunteers, or used a manikin wearing a mask, with airflow to simulate different breathing rates. Studies of protection of the environment, also known as source control, used convenience samples of healthy volunteers. The design and execution of the studies was generally rigorously described. Many descriptions of cloth lacked the detail required for reproducibility; no study provided all the expected details of material, thread count, weave, and weight. Some of the homemade mask designs were reproducible. Successful masks were made of muslin at 100 threads per inch (TPI) in 3 to 4 layers (4-layer muslin or a muslin-flannel-muslin sandwich), tea towels (also known as dish towels), made using 1 layer (2 layers would be expected to be better), and good-quality cotton T-shirts in 2 layers (with a stitched edge to prevent stretching). In flat-cloth experiments, linen tea towels, 600-TPI cotton in 2 layers, and 600-TPI cotton with 90-TPI flannel performed well but 80-TPI cotton in 2 layers did not. We therefore recommend cotton or flannel at least 100 TPI, at least 2 layers. More layers, 3 or 4, will provide increased filtration but there is a trade-off in that more layers increases the resistance to breathing.

Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic and the prevalence of new onset diabetes among patients with evidence of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A single-center surveillance study included all patients with diabetes admitted to Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University, in Egypt between May to August 2020. Data were collected to evaluate patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as their outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were admitted during the study period. The mean age was 8.4  3.8 years. Patients presented late to the emergency department with a mean delay of 3.05  1.19 days from onset of symptoms. 34/36 patients presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), 50% presenting in severe DKA.

However, data regarding persistence of subclinical myocardial injury after recovery is limited. We aimed to detect these changes with deformation imaging, hypothesizing that left ventricular global longitudinal (GLS) and circumferential strain (GCS) would remain impaired in the chronic phase despite normalization of ventricular function parameters assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. A retrospective, single-institution review of 22 patients with MIS-C was performed. Fractional shortening, GLS, and GCS, along with regional longitudinal (RLS) and circumferential strain (RCS) were compared across the acute, subacute, and chronic timepoints (presentation, 14C42, and > 42 days, respectively). Mean GLS improved from ? 18.4% in the acute phase to ? 20.1% in the chronic phase (p = 0.4). Mean GCS improved from ? 19.4% in the acute phase to ? 23.5% in the chronic phase (p = 0.03). RCS and RLS were impaired in the acute phase and showed a trend towards recovery by the chronic phase, with the exception of the basal anterolateral segment. In our longitudinal study of MIS-C patients, GLS and GCS were lower in the acute phase, corroborating with left ventricular dysfunction by traditional measures. Additionally, as function globally recovers, GLS and GCS also normalize. However, some regional segments continue to have decreased strain values which may be an important subclinical marker for future adverse events.","output":"Longitudinal Assessment of Global and Regional Left Ventricular Strain in Patients with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of drama therapy on mental health recovery remains poorly understood.

METHODS: We conducted a survey of 49 clinical laboratories in medical institutions and referral medical laboratories. A short questionnaire to survey clinical laboratory practices relating to MERS-CoV diagnostic testing was sent by email to the directors and clinical pathologists in charge of the clinical laboratories performing MERS-CoV testing. The survey focused on testing volume, reporting of results, resources, and laboratory safety. RESULTS: A total of 40 clinical laboratories responded to the survey. A total of 27,009 MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) tests were performed. Most of the specimens were sputum (73.5%). The median turnaround time (TAT) was 5.29 hr (first and third quartile, 4.11 and 7.48 hr) in 26 medical institutions. The median TAT of more than a half of the laboratories (57.7%) was less than 6 hr. Many laboratories were able to perform tests throughout the whole week. Laboratory biosafety preparedness included class II biosafety cabinets (100%); separated pre-PCR, PCR, and post-PCR rooms (88.6%); negative pressure pretreatment rooms (48.6%); and negative pressure sputum collection rooms (20.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical laboratories were able to quickly expand their diagnostic capacity in response to the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak.

In the United States, the total number of confirmed reported cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 1.8 million with the total death exceeding 100,000 people. The most common investigational diagnostics of this disease are RT-PCR and serology testing. The objective of this work was to validate two commercial kits for the detection of IgM and IgG using lateral flow immunoassay tests and to study the effect of the combination of both serology kits for better detection of immunoglobulins. A total of 195 patients presenting with respiratory symptoms suggestive of infection with SARS-Cov-2 were subject to serology and molecular testing. Two lateral flow immunochromatographic assay kits were used: the Healgen Scientific for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG and the Raybiotech for SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. Sensitivity and specificity of each kit alone and in combination were determined and compared. The limit of detection, inter and intra test variations, as well interfering substances and cross reactivity were also studied for both kits. The results show sensitivities for IgM detection varying between 58.9 and 66.2% for the kits alone and 87.7% of the combination of both kits. IgG detection was not significantly affected by this combination. Both kits manifested high specificities (99.2C100%).

METHODS In the current multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients aged 2 months and <22 years with cancer or those undergoing allogeneic HCT were randomized 1:1 to once-daily bathing with 2% CHG-impregnated cloths or control cloths for 90 days. The primary outcome was CLABSI. Secondary endpoints included total positive blood cultures, acquisition of resistant organisms, and acquisition of cutaneous staphylococcal isolates with an elevated CHG mean inhibitory concentration. RESULTS The study was stopped early because of poor accrual. Among the 177 enrolled patients, 174 were considered as evaluable (88 were randomized to the CHG group and 86 were randomized to the control group). The rate of CLABSI per 1000 central line days in the CHG group was 5.44 versus 3.10 in the control group (risk difference, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-4.69 [P = .049]).

In order to propose DNN approach provides 97.36% of classification accuracy, 97.65% of sensitivity, and 99.28% of precision. Therefore, we conclude that this proposed approach will allow health professionals to confirm their initial evaluation of patients with COVID-19. ? 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"A Modern Paradigm for Diagnosing Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Using Multilayer Customized CNN via X-ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context With a long duration return mission to Mars on the horizon, we must learn as much about the environment and its influence on the musculoskeletal system as possible to develop countermeasures and mitigate deleterious health effects and maladaptation. Aims To determine the influence of simulated Mars gravity on the activity of four locomotor muscles while walking, in comparison to 1 G, using lower body positive pressure (LBPP). Material and Methods A total of 14 male subjects (mean age: 20.6  2.4 years) performed bouts of walking in both simulated Mars gravity (0.38 G) and Earth gravity (1 G) using an LBPP device. The dependent variables were the muscle activity evoked in the tibialis anterior, vastus lateralis, gluteus maximus and lateral portion of the gastrocnemius, measured using electromyography and expressed as percentages of maximum voluntary isometric contractions, and heart rate (HR). For statistical analysis, a paired t-test was performed. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Results No significant differences in muscle activity were found across conditions for any of the investigated muscles. A significant mean difference in the HR was identified between Earth (105.15  8.1 bpm) and Mars (98.15  10.44 bpm) conditions (P = 0.027), wherein the HR was lower during the Mars trial. Conclusions The Mars environment may not result in any deteriorative implications for the musculoskeletal system. However, if future research should report that stride frequency and thus activation frequency is decreased in the simulated Mars gravity, negative implications may be posed for muscle retention and reconditioning efforts on the Red Planet.","output":"Mars walking simulation: An electromyographic analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adolescents' anxiety and depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak cannot be ignored. In public health crisis events, adolescents are prone to negative psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Hence, this research focuses on the use of reasonable and efficient methods to intervene in adolescents' psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From February to April 2020, we conducted an anonymous online survey on a total of 1,200 adolescents in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi in China. Moreover, we randomly divided a total of 150 middle school students with anxiety scores greater than 50 and volunteered to participate in the intervention experiment into control and intervention groups, with 75 members in each group. On the basis of the proposed routine treatment, we conducted 8 weeks of model 328-based peer education intervention in the intervention group. RESULTS: After the intervention, the self-rating anxiety scale scores (SAS) of the intervention group are better than those of the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, the self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group (P<0.001) than on the control group. Finally, the total Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group than on the control group (P=0.001 and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Model 328-based peer education intervention can significantly reduce the level of anxiety and depression in adolescents and improve their sleep quality.","output":"Peer Education Intervention on Adolescents' Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 illness, has caused millions of infections worldwide. In SARS coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16), in conjunction with nsp10, methylates the 5-end of virally encoded mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction. We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 and nsp10 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate analogue and methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer is captured in the act of 2-O methylation of the ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We observe large conformational changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary state. This induced fit model provides mechanistic insights into the 2-O methylation of the viral mRNA cap. We also discover a distant (25 ?) ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2, which can alternatively be targeted, in addition to RNA cap and SAM pockets, for antiviral development.","output":"Structural basis of RNA cap modification by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climatic resources are vitally important for tourism, driving major intra- and inter-regional travel flows for sun-sand-surf (3S) tourism around the world. The development of climate indices to measure the suitability of climate for major tourism market segments has evolved over three decades. This study provides the first application of the holiday climate index (HCI):Beach specification in the Asia-Pacific tourism region. The HCI is designed from international tourist climate preference studies and is compared with the tourism climate index (TCI), which is widely applied, but not based on tourist climate preferences. The index inter-comparison is conducted at 14 of the most popular beach resort destinations in China, which include four geographic regions of China with four different K?ppen classifications. The results show key differences between the two indices in rating the climatic suitability of the selected beach destinations in China, with the TCI rating beach destinations in the north and south higher during the spring and fall seasons, which is not consistent with beach tourism visits. During the summer months, southern destinations have much higher HCI:Beach rating, reflecting the 3S tourists' desire for higher temperatures. The findings reinforce those from other tourism regions that indicate the TCI is not appropriate for assessing 3S tourism potential and that additional cross-cultural studies of tourist climate indices are needed to better inform market segment climate service development and to understand the potential impacts of future climate change.","output":"A comparison of the holiday climate index:beach and the tourism climate index across coastal destinations in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the prospective association of diabetes and glycaemic control with COVID-19 hospitalisation in a large community-based cohort study.

To tackle concerns and advance conversation, a symposium was convened with subject matter experts to develop a gap analysis and capture insights into professional readiness for value-based care design. METHODS The symposium was convened as a private event for 46 participants over the course of one and a half days in December 2019. Thematic analyses utilized the OHVBC Readiness Framework (DentaQuest Partnership, 2019) to further codify conversations as part of the gap-analysis process. Poll Everywhere, a text messaging application that allows participants to answer questions in real time, was also employed to solicit responses. RESULTS Attendees of the symposium felt that OHVBC would have a large portion of market share within the next 10 years. A qualitative assessment of multiple table discussions determined that the participants developed more consensus around themes for the current state and the future-desired state than the action-planning needed to close the gap between the two. This may relate to individual ideology, and the siloed environment is still prevalent in the oral health realm. In a postsymposium survey, respondent attendees did not perceive that COVID-19 would delay or negatively impact the adoption of OHVBC and may result in accelerating its utilization.

Among these, coronavirus is identified as a prime culprit ranging from its involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) to COVID-19. These infections involved in huge healthcare and economic cost incurred globally. Every time, coronavirus improved its infection ability and surprised the medical practitioners and researchers. Currently, COVID-19 is also causing numerous infections and stalled global activities. Global efforts are underway to identify potential viral targets for management of these outbreaks, but significant progress in prevention of these outbreaks is not yet achieved. We explored host-pathogen protein-protein interactions of MERS, SARS and COVID-19, and identified host targets common among all recent coronavirus outbreaks. Further, we tried to understand their potential for management of coronavirus. The common proteins involved in coronavirus host-pathogen interactions indicate their indispensable role in the pathogenesis and therefore targeting these proteins can give strategies to prevent current and future coronavirus outbreaks. Viral variability necessitates development of new therapeutic modalities for every outbreak, in contrast targeting necessary human proteins required by all coronaviruses can provide us a clue to prevent current and future coronavirus outbreaks. We found that targeting FURIN and TMPRSS2 can provide good results due to their common involvement in current and previous outbreaks. We also listed some known molecules against these two targets for their potential drug repurposing evaluation.

The main reasons for under-vaccination are varied among different segments of the population and include vaccine hesitancy and lack of access. While vaccine hesitancy is a complicated problem that requires long-term solutions, enhancing access can be achieved through evidenced-based delivery strategies that augment traditional approaches. Hospital-based COVID-19 vaccination programs hold particular promise for reaching populations with decreased vaccine access and those at higher risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection. Hospitals have the necessary equipment and storage capabilities to maintain cold chain requirements, a common challenge in the primary care setting, and can serve as a central distribution point for delivering vaccines to patients in diverse hospital locations, including inpatient units, emergency departments, urgent care centers, perioperative areas, and subspecialty clinics. They also have the capacity for mass vaccination programs and other targeted outreach efforts. Hospital-based vaccination programs can leverage existing infrastructure such as electronic health record tools that have been successful approaches for influenza and other routine vaccinations. With the possibility of COVID-19 becoming endemic, much like seasonal influenza, these programs will require flexibility as well as planning for long-term sustainability.

AIM: Here, we aimed to predict the three-dimensional monomer structure of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 from 20 Jordanian nasopharyngeal samples and to determine the percentage of single amino acid variants (SAV) in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The output of the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) found four single amino acid variants in the spike gene. RESULTS: The first variant represented by 5% of samples that showed tyrosine deletion at Y144 located in the N terminal domain. The second and the dominant variant, represented by 62%, showed aspartate a coil amino acid substitution to glycine an extracellular amino acid at D614G located in the spike recognition binding site. The third variant, represented by 5%, showed aspartate substitution to tyrosine at D1139Y, and the fourth variant, represented by 5% glycine substitution to serine at G1167S. CONCLUSION: Our results have shown low mutational sensitivity in all variants except to D614G the one with the most likely neutral mutational sensitivity that all variants might not explicitly affect the function of spike glycoprotein. However, D614G might change the viral conformational plasticity and hence a potential viral fitness gain but one must be cautious about drawing any concrete conclusions about the severity of symptoms and viral transmission from genomic data only.

To address this issue, a new COVID-19 machine-readable dataset known as the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has been released. Based on this, our objective was to build a computable co-occurrence network embeddings to assist association detection among COVID-19-related biomedical entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leveraging a Linked Data version of CORD-19 (ie, CORD-19-on-FHIR), we first utilized SPARQL to extract co-occurrences among chemicals, diseases, genes, and mutations and build a co-occurrence network. We then trained the representation of the derived co-occurrence network using node2vec with 4 edge embeddings operations (L1, L2, Average, and Hadamard). Six algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, na?ve Bayes, and multilayer perceptron) were applied to evaluate performance on link prediction. An unsupervised learning strategy was also developed incorporating the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithms for case studies. RESULTS: The random forest classifier showed the best performance on link prediction across different network embeddings. For edge embeddings generated using the Average operation, random forest achieved the optimal average precision of 0.97 along with a F1 score of 0.90. For unsupervised learning, 63 clusters were formed with silhouette score of 0.128. Significant associations were detected for 5 coronavirus infectious diseases in their corresponding subgroups.

METHODS A preclinical study in 11 normal domestic pigs and the first-in-man study in 10 patients with HFpEF were performed. The major safety events and interatrial shunt performance were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post-procedure in both animals and human patients. The clinical functional status was also assessed in the first-in-man study. RESULTS Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation-based interatrial shunting therapy was performed successfully both in animals and patients. In the animal study, a left-to-right interatrial shunt was created with a mean defect size of 5.52.2 mm without procedure-related safety events. Seven pigs showed the continuous shunting with a mean defect size of 4.11.5 mm at 6 months. In the first-in-man study, a median interatrial defect diameter of 5.0 (4.0-6.0) mm was measured immediately. No major safety events including death and thromboembolism were observed. The continuous shunting with the defect size of 4.0 (3.0-4.0) mm could still be observed in 7 patients at 6 months. The clinical status was significantly improved with NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) reduced by 2149 pg/mL ([95% CI, 204-3301] P=0.028), with 6-minute walk distance increased by 88 m ([95% CI, 50-249] P=0.008) and with New York Heart Association class improved in 8 patients at 6 months.

The COVID-19 outbreak impacted the 2021 IVSR match due to travel restrictions. We sought to better understand pre-pandemic applicant recruitment strategies, logistics of away rotations, and the residency interview process to identify areas for improvement in the application process. METHODS An anonymous survey was sent to matched students in 2020, inquiring about motivations for pursuing VS, logistic of away rotations and interviews, and factors influencing students' rank lists. RESULTS Seventy of the 73 matched students completed the survey (95.9% response rate). The median age was 27 (25-41), 32.9% were female, 91.4% were US medical students, and 77.1% were from institutions with a VS training program. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were interest in open vascular procedures, endovascular procedures, perceived job satisfaction, emerging technologies, and influence of a mentor. The prospect of the job market, future salary, and competitiveness of the application process had the least impact. Of the matched students, 82.9% completed an away rotation (median 2; range 1-4), with 51.7% of students paying a total cost of more than $2500. Fifty percent of students matched either at their home institution or where they had performed an away rotation. Students reported application submissions to a median of 50 programs (range 1-70) and interviewed at 17 (range 1-28), with 40% of students paying a total of more than $4000 for interview costs. The most significant factors affecting students' rank lists included: program culture, open aortic surgical volume, geography, and complex endovascular procedure volume. Tours of facilities, resident salary, and male/female distribution had the least importance. CONCLUSIONS Successfully matched applicants in 2020 prioritized operative case volume and program collegiality when ranking programs.

Chinese medicine therapies have been applied extensively in the treatment of NB, especially in China, and the results are promising but varying. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess the efficacy and safety of various Chinese medicine therapies for NB after SCI. METHODS: A retrieval will be performed in 8 online databases (the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE Database, China Biological Medicine Database, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wan Fang databases, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) from their inception throughout June 2021. Only randomized controlled trials of testing Chinese medicine therapies for NB after SCI will be enrolled. The outcome indicators measured will be overall response rate, urodynamic tests, clinical assessment, and safety assessments. The methodological quality of this Bayesian-based network meta-analysis will be conducted with the Risk of Bias tool. Stata14.0 and WinBUGS 1.4.3 will be used to analyze the data. Furthermore, the assessment of heterogeneity, inconsistency, subgroup, sensitivity, and publication bias will also be taken into consideration with the help of Cochrane Collaboration's tool. RESULTS: The findings of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION: This work will furnish evidence-based recommendations to figure out the optimal Chinese medicine therapy or their combinations for NB induced by SCI, and in turn contribute to further research and public health.","output":"Chinese medicine therapies for neurogenic bladder after spinal cord injury: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quantitative changes of respiratory functions for critically ill COVID-19 patients with mechanical ventilation, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed based on patient-specific three-dimensional airway geometry. METHODS: 37 cases of critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU of Huangshi Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital from February 1st to March 20th, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. 5 patients whose clinical data met the specific criteria were finally cataloged into death group (2 patients) and survival group (3 patients). The patient-specific three-dimensional airways were reconstructed from the central airways down to the 4th-5th bifurcation of the tracheobronchial tree. The volume changes of bronchi were calculated during the disease progression according to the comparison of two CT scans. Additionally, the changes of air flow resistance were analyzed using numerical simulation of CFD. RESULTS: Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that there was negative correlation between the change of volume (&#916;V) and the change of resistance (&#916;R) for all COVID-19 patients (r=-0.7025). For total airway volume, an average decrease of -11.4115.71% was observed in death group compared to an average increase of 1.8610.80% in survival group (p=0.0232). For air flow through airways in lower lobe, the resistance increases for death group by 10.9777.66% and decreases for survival group by -45.4942.04% (p=0.0246). CONCLUSION: The variation of flow resistance in the airway could be used as a non-invasive functional evaluation for the prognosis and outcome of critically ill patients with COVID-19. The 'virtual' pulmonary function test by integrating follow-up CT scans with patient-derived CFD analysis could be a potentially powerful way in improving the efficiency of treatment for critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"Airway resistance variation correlates with prognosis of critically ill COVID-19 patients: A computational fluid dynamics study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Covid-19 pandemic, universities in the UK used social media to raise awareness and provide guidance and advice about the disease to students and staff.

To do so, we identified the date of the first Covid-19 related tweet posted by each university in the country and used survival models to estimate the effect of university-specific characteristics on the timing of these messages. In order to confirm our results, we supplemented our analysis with a study of the introduction of coronavirus-related university webpages. We find that universities with large numbers of students are more likely to use social media and the web to speak about the pandemic sooner than institutions with fewer students. Universities with large financial resources are also more likely to tweet sooner, but they do not introduce Covid-19 webpages faster than other universities. We also find evidence of a strong process of emulation, whereby universities are more likely to post a coronavirus-related tweet or webpage if other universities have already done so.","output":"Variation in the timing of Covid-19 communication across universities in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nearly 60 million people suffer from Computer vision syndrome (CVS) globally, resulting in reduced work productivity.

METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnairethat included a validated CVS questionnaire on university medical staff members. RESULTS CVSprevalence was 81.2%. Dryness, headache, feeling that sight is worsening and difficulty in focusing on near vision were the most experienced symptoms. Asignificantly higher prevalence of CVS was among females (52.3%), having a higher mean work duration (21.65  7.55 years), those who frequently use a smartphone (84.9%), and spend most of the screen time during day and night (87.1%). Visual ergonomics and preventives measures application such as a correct screen level, a regular cleaning of the screen, appropriate illumination, and use of eye drops were significantly associated with negative CVS.

As input, VirusViz imports results of queries extracting variants and metadata from the large database ViruSurf, which integrates information about most SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly deposited worldwide. Moreover, VirusViz accepts sequences of new viral populations as multi-FASTA files plus corresponding metadata in CSV format; a bioinformatic pipeline builds a suitable input for VirusViz by extracting the nucleotide and amino acid variants. Pages of VirusViz provide metadata summarization, variant descriptions, and variant visualization with rich options for zooming, highlighting variants or regions of interest, and switching from nucleotides to amino acids; sequences can be grouped, groups can be comparatively analyzed. For SARS-CoV-2, we manually collect mutations with known or predicted levels of severity/virulence, as indicated in linked research articles; such critical mutations are reported when observed in sequences.

The mechanism of CVD graphene growth is governed by interactions in both the gas phase and at the surface. Here we present a simulation of the CVD graphene growth mechanism which includes thermodynamics, gas phase kinetics and the surface reaction in a sequential manner. The thermodynamic simulation shows that the deposition driving force is the greatest for high carbon to hydrogen ratios and reaches a maximum at around 850 C. No graphene growth is observed below this temperature. The surface kinetic model also shows that below this temperature, the carbon surface concentration is less than the solubility limit, thus no film can grow. The effect of the reaction chamber geometry on the product concentrations was clear from the gas phase decomposition reactions. The gas residence times studied here (around 0.07 s) show that the optimum gas phase composition is far from that expected at thermodynamic equilibrium. The surface kinetics of CH4 reactions on Ni, Cu and Cu-Ni surfaces shows good agreement with the experimental results for different growth pressures (0.1 to 0.7 mbar), temperatures (600 to 1200 C) and different Ni thicknesses (25-500 m). Also, the model works well when substrates with various C solubilities are used. The thermodynamic and kinetic models described here can be used for the design of improved reactors to optimise the production of graphene with differing qualities, either single or multi-layer and sizes. More importantly, the transfer to a continuous process with a moving substrate should also be possible using the model if it is extended from 2D to 3D.","output":"Chemical vapour deposition of graphene on copper-nickel alloys: the simulation of a thermodynamic and kinetic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a pandemic worldwide The value of chest computed tomography (CT) is debatable during the treatment of COVID-19 patients Compared with traditional chest X-ray radiography, quantitative CT may supply more information, but its value on COVID-19 patients was still not proven Methods: An automatic quantitative analysis model based on a deep network called VB-Net for infection region segmentation was developed A quantitative analysis was performed for patients diagnosed as severe COVID 19 The quantitative assessment included volume and density among the infectious area The primary clinical outcome was the existence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) A univariable and multivariable logistic analysis was done to explore the relationship between the quantitative results and ARDS existence Results: The VB-Ne model was sensitive and stable for pulmonary lesion segmentation, and quantitative analysis indicated that the total volume and average density of the lung lesions were not related to ARDS However, lesions with specific density changes showed some influence on the risk of ARDS The proportion of lesion density from -549 to -450 Hounsfield unit (HU) was associated with increased risk of ARDS, while the density was ranging from -149 to -50 HU was related to a lowered risk of ARDS Conclusions: The automatic quantitative model based on VB-Ne can supply useful information for ARDS risk stratification in COVID-19 patients during treatment","output":"Quantitative analysis of chest CT imaging findings with the risk of ARDS in COVID-19 patients: a preliminary study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gerade in Zeiten einer anhaltenden Pandemie C zweifellos auch au?erhalb eines solchen Ausnahmeszenarios C ist es aufgrund einer nachweislich erh?hten Abh?ngigkeit von Informationstechnologie (IT) wichtig, Informationssicherheitsma?nahmen so weit wie m?glich aufrechtzuerhalten, umzusetzen, sie an neue Gegebenheiten anzupassen und kontinuierlich weiterzuentwickeln.

To facilitate monitoring in the humid forests of northeast Central America, we conducted point count surveys for birds across gradients of disturbance in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize, and analyzed the association of bird species with remotely sensed metrics of forest condition and anthropogenic disturbance using indicator species analysis. Twenty species exhibited significant associations with one or more of these metrics. We propose six species as indicators for anthropogenic disturbance based on our criteria of being associated with anthropogenically disturbed sites, or anthropogenically disturbed and riparian sites with no explicit mention in the literature of an obligate association with riparian habitats, or association of remotely sensed metrics that appeared to reflect disturbance: yellow-olive flycatcher, red-legged honeycreeper, dusky antbird, blue ground dove, buff-throated saltator, and brown jay.

Green shrike vireo, collard trogon, rufous-tailed jacamar, and rufous piha were associated with a specific elevational range but not associated with disturbance, so upward shifts in elevation that might indicate response to climate change would not be confounded with habitat disturbance or degradation.

A previous study described the development of TAC for the detection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens; the assay was evaluated against well-characterized analytical materials and a limited collection of human clinical specimens. OBJECTIVES: We wished to compare TAC assay performance against standard individual RT-qPCR assays for respiratory viral detection, focusing on 10 viruses (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 1C4, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus) from a larger collection of human specimens. STUDY DESIGN: We used specimens from 942 children with ARI enrolled systematically in a population-based, ARI surveillance study (New Vaccine Surveillance Network, NVSN). RESULTS: Compared with standard individual RT-qPCR assays, the sensitivity of TAC for the targeted viruses ranged from 54% to 95% (54%, 56%, and 75% for adenovirus, human parainfluenza viruses-1 and -2, respectively, and 82%C95% for the other viruses).

We described the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care metrics, demographic and social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators across race groups. We also described clinical outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality. We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system. PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Of them, 57.8% were female, 58.4% black, 29.5% white, 8.5% Hispanic and 3.6% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the federal poverty line (12.4%) and in more deprived locations (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4% (n=827) of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest rates of ICU admission (53.1%) and mechanical ventilation (21.9%).

The results demonstrated that PEDV infection induces cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in Vero cells, while UV-inactivated PEDV does not cause cell cycle arrest. PEDV infection up-regulates the levels of p21, cdc2, cdk2, cdk4, Cyclin A protein and down-regulates Cyclin E protein.

For example, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the elderly are often preferentially protected. For diseases of plants and animals, certain sub-populations can drive mitigation because they are intrinsically more valuable for ecological, economic, socio-cultural or political reasons. Here, we use optimal control theory to identify strategies to optimally protect a high-value sub-population when there is a limited budget and epidemiological uncertainty. We use protection of the Redwood National Park in California in the face of the large ongoing state-wide epidemic of sudden oak death (caused by Phytophthora ramorum) as a case study. We concentrate on whether control should be focused entirely within the National Park itself, or whether treatment of the growing epidemic in the surrounding buffer region can instead be more profitable. We find that, depending on rates of infection and the size of the ongoing epidemic, focusing control on the high-value region is often optimal. However, priority should sometimes switch from the buffer region to the high-value region only as the local outbreak grows. We characterize how the timing of any switch depends on epidemiological and logistic parameters, and test robustness to systematic misspecification of these factors due to imperfect prior knowledge.","output":"Optimal strategies to protect a sub-population at risk due to an established epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The irreversible inhibition of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 by a Michael acceptor known as N3 has been investigated using multiscale methods.

The formation of the covalent enzymeCinhibitor complex was then simulated using hybrid QM/MM free energy methods. After binding, the reaction mechanism was found to be composed of two steps: (i) the activation of the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) to form an ion pair and (ii) a Michael addition where the attack of the S atom of Cys145 to the C atom of the inhibitor precedes the water-mediated proton transfer from His41 to the C atom. The microscopic description of protease inhibition by N3 obtained from our simulations is strongly supported by the excellent agreement between the estimated activation free energy and the value derived from kinetic experiments. Comparison with the acylation reaction of a peptide substrate suggests that N3-based inhibitors could be improved by adding chemical modifications that could facilitate the formation of the catalytic dyad ion pair.","output":"A microscopic description of SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibition with Michael acceptors.

RESULTS: Among the 133 patients included in the study, 95 (71%) were male patients and median age was 63 years old (interquartile range: 54C71). Overall ICU mortality was 11%. Mode of transport included train (48 patients), ambulance (6 patients), and plane plus helicopter (14 patients). During their ICU stay, 7 (10%) transferred patients and 8 (12%) non-transferred patients died (p = 0.71). Median SAPS II score at admission was 33 (interquartile range: 25C46) for the transferred group and 35 (27C42) for non-transferred patients (p = 0.53).

It addresses the historically-situated concept of a good death and a bad death and suggests why dying alone, whether completely alone or without significant others physically present, may be considered a bad death. Methods: As evidence for collective fears about dying alone, we explored the treatment of these deaths in media using headline examples from the US New York Times and the English Guardian newspaper from the 19th century through Sept. 2020. Results: A search of the New York Times located 39 articles with either lonely dying or lonely death in the headline. The Guardian had 25 articles with use of the term, but unlike the New York Times, no obituaries were included. Although the deaths profiled were deemed unusual, deaths by suicide were only minimally classed as dying alone. The condition of dying alone is represented as a stigmatised death. Themes addressed: 1) dying alone is a nonnormative event; 2) this death matters; and 3) where people die alone, societies should honour the death and learn from it. Discussion and implications: Contemporary dying involves conditions for which we are unprepared as a society. We seldom address our civic obligations to each other. Few people have discussed their wishes about their preferences in dying and whether and how they want to be accompanied at their death, if possible. This is an invisible constraint of modern healthcare. Because of limited discussions and preparation, these deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief for the mourners. Cultural and societal responses to lonely dying are important in easing the emotional burden of dying alone, helping individuals prepare for this possibility and better integrating death with the life course. Recommendations include inclusion of accompaniment/nonaccompaniment at death as part of advance care planning and mitigation if this condition occurs. It is essential for individuals to find their own still point of acceptance within competing societal narratives of privileging the self in dying alone and the value of social connection.","output":"Dying alone and lonely dying: Media discourse and pandemic conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (pLMWH) is currently recommended in COVID-19 to reduce the risk of coagulopathy.

Occasionally, it may arise from benign causes, such as endoscopic intervention, trauma, and prolonged intubation. Case Presentation. A 24-year old previously healthy pregnant female was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and was intubated. Due to non-reassuring fetal status, an emergency cesarean section was performed at the 36th week of gestation;the baby tested negative for COVID-19 and was separated. Throughout her illness, the patient was treated for recurrent bouts of pneumonia, coupled with findings of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum- all of which were attributed to pulmonary fibrosis from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). A chest and neck CT scan (figure 1), however, confirmed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), along with a hyperinflated endotracheal (ET) cuff. A temporizing procedure, involving tracheostomy with an extended length tracheal tube, was performed. The long-term plan was to surgically correct the TEF after nutritional upbuilding and liberation from the ventilator, however the patient succumbed to her infections. Discussion.The findings of a communication between the trachea and the esophagus tie all of these events together: the pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, as well as the recurrent bouts of pneumonia from recurrent aspiration through the fistula. Despite its rarity (0.3-3%), tracheoesophageal fistulas are a very real possibility in patients who require prolonged invasive ventilation. A retrospective study by Fiacchino et al. noted a significant increase in full thickness tracheal lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which may be caused by several factors: the presence of an overinflated endotracheal (ET) cuff, prolonged steroid use, hypoxic injury, as well as possible direct injury of the tracheal mucosa from the Coronavirus itself [1]. This case highlights the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for tracheal injury in patients who experience prolonged periods of intubation. It also underlies the high morbidity and mortality rate associated with TEF, albeit being a rare disease. Lastly, it highlights yet another possible long-term complication of COVID-19.

The majority of studies exploring interventions for improving conception rates also report on pregnancy outcomes. However, there is no efficient way for clinicians, researchers, funding organizations, decision-making bodies or women themselves to easily access and review the evidence for the effect of adjuvant therapies on key pregnancy outcomes in subfertile women. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aim was to summarize all published systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions in the subfertile population, specifically reporting on the pregnancy outcomes of miscarriage and live birth. Furthermore, we aimed to highlight promising interventions and areas that need high-quality evidence. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMed clinical queries SR filter (inception until July 2021) with a list of key words to capture all SRs specifying or reporting any miscarriage outcome. Studies were included if they were SRs of RCTs. The population was subfertile women (pregnant or trying to conceive) and any intervention (versus placebo or no treatment) was included. We adopted Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) for determining the quality of the evidence. Exclusion criteria were overview reviews, reviews that exclusively reported on women conceiving via natural conception, reviews including non-randomized study designs or reviews where miscarriage or live birth outcomes were not specified or reported. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was miscarriage, defined as pregnancy loss <24 weeks of gestation. Data were also extracted for live birth where available. We included 75 published SRs containing 121 251 participants. There were 14 classes of intervention identified: luteal phase, immunotherapy, anticoagulants, hCG, micronutrients, lifestyle, endocrine, surgical, pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-As), laboratory techniques, endometrial injury, ART protocols, other adjuncts/techniques in the ART process and complementary interventions. The interventions with at least moderate-quality evidence of benefit in reducing risk of miscarriage or improving the chance of a live birth are: intrauterine hCG at time of cleavage stage embryo transfer, but not blastocyst transfer, antioxidant therapy in males, dehydroepiandrosterone in women and embryo medium containing high hyaluronic acid. Interventions showing potential increased risk of miscarriage or reduced live birth rate are: embryo culture supernatant injection before embryo transfer in frozen cycles and PGT-A with the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: This review provides an overview of key pregnancy outcomes from published SRs of RCTs in subfertile women. It provides access to concisely summarized information and will help clinicians and policy makers identify knowledge gaps in the field, whilst covering a broad range of topics, to help improve pregnancy outcomes for subfertile couples. Further research is required into the following promising interventions: the dose of progesterone for luteal phase support, peripheral blood mononuclear cells for women with recurrent implantation failure, glucocorticoids in women undergoing IVF, low-molecular-weight heparin for unexplained subfertility, intrauterine hCG at the time of cleavage stage embryo or blastocyst transfer and low oxygen concentrations in embryo culture. In addition, there is a need for high-quality, well-designed RCTs in the field of reproductive surgery. Finally, further research is needed to demonstrate the integrated effects of non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions.","output":"Evaluating interventions and adjuncts to optimize pregnancy outcomes in subfertile women: an overview review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 confers substantial risk for the >400,000 patients who receive methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and methods for safely dispensing large quantities of methadone to patients are lacking. METHODS: This study evaluated the MedMinder Jon, an electronic and cellular-enabled pillbox that provides real-time monitoring to remotely manage take-home doses of methadone using a 12-week, within-subject, Phase II (NCT03254043) trial. We transitioned all participants from liquid to tablet methadone one week prior to randomization. Participants completed both treatment-as-usual and electronic pillbox conditions before choosing a condition in a final choice phase. We assessed feasibility, satisfaction, and safety outcomes during the exit interview. RESULTS: Overall, we randomized 25 participants, 24 (96.0%) completed >1 study session, and 21 (84.0%) completed the exit interview. We dispensed 167.92 g (1,974 doses) of methadone. Participants would use the pillbox again (86.3%) and recommend it to others (95.4%). Overall, 52.4% selected the pillbox in the choice condition and those who did not cited issues related to study requirements. Less than 1% of pillbox alerts were for medication being consumed outside the dosing window and we observed no evidence of actual or attempted methadone diversion. DISCUSSION: We were able to adequately manage patients who would not otherwise qualify for large quantities of take-home methadone when we dispensed methadone tablets via a secure pillbox. The integration of a commercially available pillbox into routine clinic operations increases opportunity for dispensing medication. Our data support remote monitoring of methadone take-home doses and may inform clinic practices related to Covid-19.","output":"Technology-assisted methadone take-home dosing for dispensing methadone to persons with opioid use disorder during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19, within a short period of time, grew into a pandemic. The timely identification of places and populations at great risk of COVID-19 infection would aid disease control. In Nigeria, where a variety of recommended and adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions seem to have limited effectiveness, the number of cases is still increasing. To this end, this paper computed a social vulnerability to COVID-19 index (SoVI) in Nigeria within the local government area (LGA) framework with a view to revealing vulnerable places and populations. The study relied on several data sources and factor analysis for the development of the index. SoVI values ranged from 2.3 (least vulnerable) to 6.8 (most vulnerable). Three percent of the 774 LGAs were extremely vulnerable while 2% of these LGAs were least vulnerable to COVID-19. The predictive power of the index was confirmed to be strong (r = 0.812).

PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on activities causing trauma and the consultation in emergency rooms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive trauma patients consulting the Emergency Department of the Marienhospital Stuttgart (MHS), Germany, during the 6 weeks preceding the lockdown, during and after the lockdown were included. The time and type of consultation, treatment received, Manchester triage score, type of trauma, the anatomical region of the injury as well as demographic data were reported and compared. RESULTS: The study included 551 cases during lockdown, 943 cases before and 783 cases after the lockdown. We observed a reduced caseload during the lockdown of 41.6% compared to before and of 29.7% compared to after (p < 0.001). Patients were on average older in the observation group than in both control groups (before : 51.5 years, lockdown: 56.1 years, after: 51.6 years) (p < 0.001). Injuries to the head and neck were constant (25.0%, 25.4%, 25.5%). We noticed lower limb injuries decreasing (26.1%, 22.3%, 22.7%) and upper limb injuries increasing (25.5%, 31.8%, 30.1%). A decrease in sports injuries (11.1%, 5.1%, 9.1%) and work accidents (16.1%, 10.7%, 12.8%) resulted in more domestic accidents (30.4%, 52.5%, 31.8%). Self-referral decreased (67.7%, 53.2%, 60.3%) while referral via paramedics increased (28.3%, 38.7%, 35.6). Blunt trauma was the most common cause of injury (55.6%, 61.0%, 55.3%).

METHODS: The study was based on a retrospective population cohort of adults in a community setting. Antibiotic prescription ratios from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021 (COVID-19 period) were compared to similar months in previous years. Differences in visit type, infectious disease-related visit and antibiotic prescription ratios during these visits were compared. A logistic regression model was used to identify independent determinants of antibiotic prescription during the study period. RESULTS: The cohort included almost 3 million individuals with over 33 million community medical encounters per year. In the COVID-19 period, antibiotic prescription ratio decreased 45% (from 34.2 prescriptions/100 patients to 19.1/100) compared to the previous year. Visits due to an infectious disease (ID) etiology decreased by 10% and prescriptions per visit decreased by 39% (from 1,034,425 prescriptions/3,764,235 ID visits, to 587,379/3,426,451 respectively). This decrease was observed in both sexes and all age groups. Telemedicine visits were characterized by 10% lower prescription ratio compared to in-person visits. Thus, a threefold increase in telemedicine visits resulted in a further decrease in prescription ratios. The COVID-19 period was independently associated with a decrease in antibiotic prescription, with an odds ratio of 0.852 (95%CI 0.848, 0.857). CONCLUSION: We describe a significant decrease in antibiotic prescription ratios during the COVID-19 periods that was likely related to a decrease in the incidence of certain infectious diseases, in the transfer to telemedicine, and to a change in prescription practices among community-based physicians.","output":"Community antibiotic prescriptions during COVID-19 era: A population-based cohort study among adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although some evidence showed the activation of complement systems in COVID-19 patients, proinflammatory status and lectin pathway remain unclear Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the role of MBL and ficolin-3 in the complement system activation and compared to pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype infection (H1N1pdm09) and control patients A total of 27 lungs formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples (10 from H1N1 group, 6 from the COVID-19 group, and 11 from the control group) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-IL-6, TNF-alfa, CD163, MBL e FCN3 antibodies Genotyping of target polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene was performed by real-time PCR Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha presented higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and control groups The same results were observed for ICAM-1 tissue expression Increased expression of the FCN3 was observed in the COVID-19 group and H1N1 group compared to the control group The MBL tissue expression was higher in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and control groups The genotypes AA for rs180040 (G/A), GG for rs1800451 (G/A) and CC for rs5030737 (T/C) showed a higher prevalence in the COVID-19 group The intense activation of the lectin pathway, with particular emphasis on the MBL pathway, together with endothelial dysfunction and a massive proinflammatory cytokines production, possibly lead to a worse outcome in patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 Moreover, 3 SNPs of our study presented genotypes that might be correlated with high MBL tissue expression in the COVID-19 pulmonary samples","output":"The role of the lectin pathway of the complement system in SARS-CoV-2 lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the ability of treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) improves, the theory and method of diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 need to be further enriched and perfected.

METHODS: Multicentre retrospective cohort study of all individuals with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections diagnosed at 24 COVID-19-designated hospitals in Jiangsu province between the 10th January and 15th March 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected at hospital admission and data on disease severity were collected during follow-up. Patients were categorised as asymptomatic/mild/moderate, and severe/critically ill according to the worst level of COVID-19 recorded during hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 625 patients, 64 (10.2%) were severe/critically ill and 561 (89.8%) were asymptomatic/mild/moderate. All patients were discharged and no patients died.

Purpose of this study was the prospective evaluation of feasibility of a new standardized technique of oriented fixation of the TLM specimen and identification of the added value on tissue processing and margin status reporting. Methods: Patients with suspicious glottic lesions undergoing TLM were included. After resection, the specimen margins were inked in the OR using different colors. Subsequently, the specimens were fixed on a pig liver carrier and sent for further processing, accompanied with photographs of the larynx pre-TLM and of the mounted specimen. Feasibility was assessed by registration of duration of specimen preparation in the OR and the lab and by procedure-specific questionnaires. Objective evaluation included assessment of margin status and proportion of evaluable margins. Chi square tests were used to make comparisons of proportions. Results: One hundred and four consecutive patients were included between May 2016 and September 2019. TLM was performed in a primary and salvage setting in 89.4 and 10.6% of patients, respectively. Mean duration of intraoperative specimen preparation was 5.1 min (SD 2.6 min). No difficulties in orientation nor fixation during intraoperative preparation were reported in 87.5 and 88.2%, respectively. Specimen orientation was judged by the pathologist as very adequate in 89.4%, with the accompanying photographs considered helpful for orientation and processing in 84.6%.

By applying cognitive attention, they apply greater focus onto clinically relevant regions while disregarding unnecessary features. The use of computer vision to automate the classification of medical images is widely studied. However, the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) does not necessarily employ subconscious feature relevancy evaluation techniques similar to the trained medical specialist and evaluates features more generally. Self-attention mechanisms enable CNNs to focus more on semantically important regions or aggregated relevant context with long-range dependencies. By using attention, medical image analysis systems can potentially become more robust by focusing on more important clinical feature regions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of various state-of-the-art self-attention mechanisms across multiple medical image analysis tasks. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations along with a clinical user-centric survey study, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the effects of self-attention in medical computer vision tasks.","output":"Studying the Effects of Self-Attention for Medical Image Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai et al., 2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the \\"entry receptor\\" for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the \\"time delay\\" given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the \\"exposure time\\" to the \\"interaction time\\" (virus-cells). This model can be used both to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. BACKGROUND: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the ?-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. METHODS: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. RESULTS: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, I is concluded that control strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the aid of a theoretical framework.","output":"Forecasting the timeframe of 2019-nCoV and human cells interaction with reverse engineering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The health policy and systems research literature increasingly observes that knowledge translation (KT) practices are difficult to sustain. An important issue is that it remains unclear what sustainability of KT practices means and how it can be improved. The aim of this study was thus to identify and explain those processes, activities, and efforts in the literature that facilitate the sustaining of KT practices in health policy-making processes. METHODS: We used a critical interpretive synthesis (CIS) to review the health policy and systems research and Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature. The STS literature was included as to enrich the review with constructivist social scientific perspectives on sustainability and KT. The CIS methodology allowed for creating new theory by critically combining both literatures. We searched the literature by using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and qualitative sampling. Searches were guided by pre-set eligibility criteria and all entries were iteratively analysed using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: Eighty documents were included. Our synthesis suggests a shift from sustainability as an end-goal towards sustaining as actors' relatively mundane work aimed at making and keeping KT practices productive. This 'sustaining work' is an interplay of three processes: (i) translating, (ii) contexting, and (iii) institutionalising. Translating refers to activities aimed at constructing and extending networks. Contexting emphasises the activities needed to create contexts that support KT practices. Institutionalising addresses how actors create, maintain, and disrupt institutions with the aim of sustaining KT practices. CONCLUSION: The 'sustaining work' perspective of our CIS emphasises KT actors' ongoing work directed at sustaining KT practices. We suggest that this perspective can guide empirical study of sustaining work and that these empirical insights, combined with this CIS, can inform training programmes for KT actors, and thereby improve the sustainability of KT practices.","output":"Sustaining Knowledge Translation Practices: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chemotherapy is a powerful anti-tumor therapeutic strategy; however, resistance to treatment remains a serious concern. To overcome chemoresistance, combination therapy with anticancer drugs is a potential strategy. We developed a novel herbal extract, JI017, with lower toxicity and lesser side effects. JI017 induced programmed cell death and excessive unfolded protein response through the release of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium in breast cancer cells. JI017 treatment increased the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, including p-PERK, p-eIF2, ATF4, and CHOP, via the activation of both exosomal GRP78 and cell lysate GRP78. The ROS inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium and N-acetyl cysteine suppressed apoptosis and excessive ER stress by inhibiting Nox4 in JI017-treated breast cancer cells. Furthermore, in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7R and MDA-MB-231R, a combination of JI017 and paclitaxel overcame paclitaxel resistance by blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes, such as the downregulation of E-cadherin expression and the upregulation of HIF-1, vimentin, Snail, and Slug expression. These findings suggested that JI017 exerts a powerful anti-cancer effect in breast cancer and a combination therapy of JI017 and paclitaxel may be a potential cancer therapy for paclitaxel resistant breast cancer.","output":"The Herbal Formula JI017 Induces ER Stress via Nox4 in Breast Cancer Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information technology has become embedded in almost every area of modern life.

METHODS: This is a descriptive and retrospective study. Screening was carried out in the schools in the three major districts of the metropolitan municipality when face-to-face education was practiced. COVID-19 RT-PCR swab samples were collected from 4,658 students from 46 schools at preschool, primary, secondary, and high school levels by using the stratified sampling method.

To examine this question, levels of T cell subsets were measured at 8 and 18 mo of age in the peripheral blood of mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock, and the mice were then subsequently evaluated for life span and for cause of death. The results indicate that mice whose T cell subset patterns look like those of old mice tend to die at earlier ages, regardless of the specific cause of death. At 18 mo, 39% of the variance within the set of seven measured subsets could be combined statistically into a single number, whose correlation with individual subsets suggested that it could be interpreted as an index of immunological aging. T cell subset pattern, as represented by this index, was a predictor of life span in mice dying of lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, or of all other causes considered together. Even as early as 8 mo of age, T cell subset patterns are significant predictors of all three forms of cancer, although at this age the association is stronger in mated female mice than in virgin mice. These results support two controversial hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive: 1) early immune senescence might predispose to early death from cancer and 2) differences in aging rate, as monitored by tests of immune status, might accelerate or decelerate a wide range of late life neoplastic diseases.","output":"T cell subset patterns that predict resistance to spontaneous lymphoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, and fibrosarcoma in mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT We report on a 3-month old infant male who had a seven-days history of fever and rhinorrhea associated with wheezing prior to his death, during the Covid-19 pandemic Viral testing for Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative but was positive for Coronavirus 229E and RP Human Rhinovirus The pulmonary histological examination showed diffuse alveolar damage along with thrombotic microangiopathy affecting alveolar capillaries Also, thrombotic microangiopathy was evident in the heart, lungs, brain, kidneys and liver Thrombotic microangiopathy is a major pathologic finding in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and in the multiorgan failure This is the first report that illustrates thrombotic microangiopathy occurring in lung, heart, liver, kidney and brain in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome with Coronavirus 229E with Rhinovirus co-infection The clinical presentation and pathological findings in our case share common features with Covid-19","output":"Coronavirus 229E with Rhinovirus co-infection causing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with thrombotic microangiopathy and death during Covid-19 pandemic: lessons to be learnt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The cellular proteins Pat1p, Lsm1p, and Dhh1p are required for the replication of some positive-strand viruses and therefore are potential targets for new antiviral drugs.

Although the effects of other sources of stress on health have been documented, the effects of these unique conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the long-term health and well-being of the health care workforce are not known. OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 Study of Healthcare and Support Personnel (CHAMPS) was designed to document early and longitudinal effects of the pandemic on the mental and physical health of essential workers engaged in health care. We will investigate mediators and moderators of these effects and evaluate the influence of exposure to stress, including morbidity and mortality, over time. We will also examine the effect of protective factors and resilience on health outcomes. METHODS: The study cohort is a convenience sample recruited nationally through communities, professional organizations, networks, social media, and snowball sampling. Recruitment took place for 13 months to obtain an estimated sample of 2762 adults who provided self-reported information administered on the web through structured questionnaires about their work environment, mental and physical health, and psychosocial factors. Follow-up questionnaires will be administered after 6 months and annually thereafter to ascertain changes in health, well-being, and lifestyle. Participants who consented to be recontacted form the longitudinal cohort and the CHAMPS Registry may be contacted to ascertain their interest in ancillary studies for which they may be eligible. RESULTS: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and launched in May 2020, with grants from Travere Therapeutics Inc, McKesson Corporation, anonymous donors, and internal funding from the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing at Villanova University. Recruitment ended in June 2021 after enrolling 2762 participants, 1534 of whom agreed to participate in the longitudinal study and the registry as well as to be contacted about eligibility for future studies.

The Coblation wand was activated over the strawberries for 5 minutes. This was repeated 5 times with 2 surgeons (totalling 10 data sets). The presence of droplet around the surgical field and anatomical subsites on the surgeon was assessed in binary fashion: present or not present. The results were collated as frequency of droplet detection and illustrated as a heatmap; 0 = white, 1-2 = yellow, 3-4 = orange, and 5 = red. RESULTS Fluorescein droplets were detected in all 4 quadrants of the surgical field. The frequency of splatter was greatest in the upper (nearest to surgeon) and lower quadrants. There were detectable splatter droplets on the surgeon; most frequently occurring on the hands followed by the forearm. Droplets were also detected on the visor, neck, and chest albeit less frequently. However, none were detected on the upper arms.

STUDY DESIGN The research investigated the elderly suicide rates of the 232 municipal units in South Korea between 2001 and 2011. METHODS The Gi* score, which is a spatially weighted indicator of area attributes, was used to identify hot spots and the spatiotemporal pattern of elderly suicide in the nation during the last 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix and spatial dynamic panel data model were employed to identify and estimate the diffusion effect. RESULTS The suicide rate among elderly individuals 75 years and older was substantially higher than the rate for those between 65 and 74 years of age; however, the spatial patterns of the suicide clusters were similar between the two groups. From 2001 to 2011, the spatial distribution of elderly suicide hot spots differed each year. For both age cohorts, elderly suicide hot spots developed around the north area of South Korea in 2001 and moved to the mid-east area and the mid-western coastal area over 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix indicates that the change in the suicide rate of one area was affected by the suicide rates of neighbouring areas from the previous year, which suggests that suicide increase in one area inflates a neighbouring area's suicide rate over time. Using a spatial dynamic panel data model, elderly suicide diffusion effects were found to be statistically significant for both age cohorts even after economic and demographic indicators and a time variable are included. For individuals 75 years and older, the diffusion effect appeared to be larger. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that elderly suicide can spread spatially over time in both age cohorts.

The data derive from: NIH R01 grants (17), publicly available datasets that focus on immigrant health (7), and research published in three health journals (14). Using a qualitative content analysis approach, we analyzed these data as evidence concerning the knowledge production cycle, and investigate whether: (a) the role of advantaged groups in generating inequalities is explicitly mentioned;(b) disadvantaged groups are asked about discriminatory actions perpetuated by advantaged groups;(c) health inequalities are placed on the conditions of disadvantaged groups;(d) if white supremacy and intersectionality are explicitly mentioned in grants, publicly available datasets, and research articles. The findings demonstrate the prevalence of diversions in immigrant health research, given an overemphasis on health behaviors and cultural explanations towards explaining immigrant health inequities. There was no mention of white supremacy across the knowledge production cycle. Intersectionality was mentioned once in a research article.

For every 10-mm Hg increase in genetically proxied systolic blood pressure, risk of incident CVD increased by 49% (hazard ratio, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.38C1.61]), with similar estimates obtained for coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.38C1.63]) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.22C1.70]). Genetically proxied blood pressure had a similar relationship with CVD in men and women. These findings provide evidence to support that even for individuals who do not have elevated blood pressure, public health interventions achieving persistent blood pressure reduction will be of considerable benefit in the primary prevention of CVD.","output":"Relationship Between Blood Pressure and Incident Cardiovascular Disease: Linear and Nonlinear Mendelian Randomization Analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged COVID-19 virus caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and instigated a widespread fear, threatening the world's most advanced health security In 2020, chloroquine derivatives are among the drugs tested against the coronavirus pandemic and showed an apparent efficacy In the present work, the chloroquine and the chloroquine phosphate molecules have been proposed as potential antiviral for the treatment of COVID-19 diseases combining DFT and molecular docking calculations Molecular geometries, electronic properties and molecular electrostatic potential were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* method As results, we found a good agreement between the theoretical and the experimental geometrical parameters (bond lengths and bond angles) The frontier orbitals analysis has been calculated at the same level of theory to determine the charge transfer within the molecule In order to perform a better description of the FMOs, the density of states was determined The molecular electrostatic potential maps were calculated to provide information on the chemical reactivity of molecule and also to describe the intermolecular interactions All these studies help us a lot in determining the reactivity of the mentioned compounds Finally, docking calculations were carried out to determine the pharmaceutical activities of the chloroquine derivatives against coronavirus diseases The choice of these ligands was based on their antiviral activities","output":"DFT and molecular docking study of chloroquine derivatives as antiviral to coronavirus COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge and understanding about novel COVID-19 infection and its complications is of paramount importance in decreasing mortality on ongoing pandemic.

Physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia, tachypnea and bilateral respiratory crackles. Laboratory results were concerning for severe hypoxemia and lymphopenia. Bilateral pneumonic infiltrates were identified on imaging. The patient presented rapid clinical deterioration with signs of acute respiratory failure for which rapid sequence intubation protocol was followed. Inflammatory markers including ferritin levels were elevated raising suspicion for severe SARS-CoV-2, which was confirm by positive COVID-19 PCR test. After initial 48 hours with hydroxychloroquine, no clinical improvement was recorded. In view of continued clinical deterioration, the patient was enrolled in a convalescent plasma clinical trial with successful negative PCR test result after 48 hours of infusion. Results also correlated with slight clinical improvement including mechanical ventilation parameters, yet multiple attempts to wean off mechanical support were unsuccessful. Hospitalization was complicated with spontaneous bilateral pneumothorax. Multiple chest tubes were placed with minimal improvement of pneumothorax size. Exploratory bronchoscopy was performed and multiple bilateral sites of air-leak were encountered, explaining the non-resolving pneumothorax. The patient underwent exploratory thoracotomy, during which right lung fistula was corrected. Left lung pleurodesis with doxycycline was performed but unfortunately, pneumothorax persisted.

Out of 68 HFCs comprising the network, 52 participated in the first survey and 55 in the second survey. The median number of patients assessed per week is 10. Changes in engaged personnel were encountered between the two surveys, along with increasing use of advanced echocardiographic techniques (23.1% in 2018 vs. 34.5% in 2020). Drawbacks were encountered, concerning magnetic resonance imaging and ergospirometry use (being available in 14.6% and 29% of HFCs, respectively), exercise rehabilitation programmes (applied only in 5.5%), and telemedicine applications (used in 16.4%).

This difference is highly significant, with a relative risk equal to six. The majority of the inflammatory polyneuropathy (44.4%) was diagnosed four to 12 weeks after the COVID-19 infection, with GBS being the most common type (72.2% of cases). Moreover, the nerve conduction velocity, the distal latency, and the amplitude of the most studied nerves were slower, more prolonged, and lower, respectively, among the COVID-19 groups compared with the non-COVID-19 group. Furthermore, there is an inverse correlation between the nerve conduction velocity in the majority of studied nerves and certain inflammatory biomarkers, such as serum ferritin, interleukin-6, and c-reactive protein.

We conducted a survey to investigate the level of stress and its association with job types, work departments, and medical centers among COVID-19 pandemic frontline medical personnel. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among 307 frontline medical staff who cared for COVID-19 patients in Daegu city. We used a 33-item questionnaire to assess respondents' general characteristics, job stress, personal effects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and their stress level. A general health questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) was included in our questionnaire. Results: Majority (74.3%) of the respondents were in the stress group. The mean GHQ-12 score was 14.31  4.96. More females (67.4%, p < 0.05) and nurses (73.3%, p = 0.001) were in the stress group compared to males and doctors. Medical staff in the general ward considered the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation higher. Nurses perceived work changes (p < 0.05), work burden (p < 0.05), and personal impact (p < 0.05) more serious than doctors. Medical staff in Level 3 emergency department (ED) perceived a lack of real-time information (p = 0.012), a lack of resources, and negative personal impacts associated with the pandemic as more serious than staff in Level 1 and Level 2 EDs.

METHODS: This prospective study included a total of 40 patients with FN and malignancies followed at Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology. The control group (n=76) consisted of age-matched patients with upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) who were admitted to the emergency service due to fever. RESULTS: Viral agents were detected in 16 of 53 FN attacks (30.1%). The most commonly isolated viruses were coronavirus (23.7%, n=9), influenza B (18.4%, n=7), and adenovirus (18.4%, n=7). Of 76 children diagnosed with URTI with fever (52.6%) had viral agents, and only 28 of them had a single agent. The most commonly isolated virus was adenovirus (28.6%, n=14).

Methods Fourth-year medical students self-selected into an in-person or online training designed to teach and evaluate teamwork skills. In-person participants received didactic sessions, team-based medical simulations and facilitated debriefing sessions. The online group received an equivalent online didactic session and participated in an interactive software-based simulation with immediate, personalised performance-based feedback and scripted debriefing. Both trainings used three iterations of a case of septic shock, each with increasing medical complexity. Participants completed a demographic survey, a preintervention/postintervention TeamSTEPPS Benchmarks test and a retrospective preintervention/postintervention TeamSTEPPS teamwork attitudes questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and repeated measures analysis of variance. Results Thirty-one students (18 in-person, 13 online) completed preintervention/postintervention surveys, tests and questionnaires. Gender, age and exposure to interprofessional education, teamwork training and games were similar between groups. There were no statistical differences in preintervention knowledge or teamwork attitude scores between in-person and online groups.

All the CCBs tested showed varying degrees of inhibition, with felodipine and nifedipine strongly limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in epithelial lung cells at concentrations where cell toxicity was minimal. Further studies with pseudotyped particles displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggested that inhibition occurs at the level of virus entry.

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of virtual BSS classroom training compared to both non-interactive video and face-to-face teaching. METHOD: 72 medical students will be randomly assigned to three equal intervention groups based on year group and surgical skill confidence. Interventions will be implemented following an instructional video. Group A will practice independently, Group B will receive face-to-face training, and Group C will attend a virtual classroom. Participants will be recorded placing three interrupted sutures with hand tied knots pre- and post-intervention, and Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) will be blind marked by two experts.

The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-29a-3p in NA. A mouse model of NA was established and these animals were compared to normal controls. Both groups of mice were subjected to lung function tests and histopathological analysis. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) were grown in culture and incubated with secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC) and a miR-29a-3p mimic. The expression of miR-29a-3p, SPARC and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the direct regulatory relationship between miR-29a-3p and SPARC. miR-29a-3p expression was significantly decreased, while SPARC expression was increased in the NA mouse model with a phenotype of EMT. Overexpression of SPARC downregulated the expression of E-cadherin, while it increased the expression of vimentin in 16HBE cells. miR-29a-3p administration reversed the SPARC-induced effects on E-cadherin and vimentin expression. Luciferase assays confirmed that SPARC was the target gene for miR-29a-3p. Furthermore, SPARC overexpression increased the protein expression of phosphorylated (p)-ERK, while transfection with miR-29a-3p mimics significantly inhibited this increase. The data suggested that EMT in the NA mouse model was associated with decreased levels of miR-29a-3p and elevated SPARC. Furthermore, SPARC could induce the formation of EMT in 16HBE cells in vitro and this was directly targeted by miR-29a-3p and mediated by p-ERK, suggesting that miR-29a-3p may participate in the airway remodeling of NA.","output":"miR-29a-3p regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the SPARC/ERK signaling pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There have been increasing concerns about neighbourhoods contextual characteristics and the importance of applying integrated sustainability principles to develop sustainable neighbourhoods.

This study investigates the integration of bipolar exfoliated (BPE) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with 3D C-MEMS microelectrodes for developing PDGF-BB (platelet-derived growth factor-BB) label-free aptasensors. A simple setup has been used for exfoliation, reduction, and deposition of rGO on the 3D C-MEMS microelectrodes based on the principle of bipolar electrochemistry of graphite in deionized water. The electrochemical bipolar exfoliation of rGO resolves the drawbacks of commonly applied methods for synthesis and deposition of rGO, such as requiring complicated and costly processes, excessive use of harsh chemicals, and complex subsequent deposition procedures. The PDGF-BB affinity aptamers were covalently immobilized by binding amino-tag terminated aptamers and rGO surfaces. The turn-off sensing strategy was implemented by measuring the areal capacitance from CV plots. The aptasensor showed a wide linear range of 1 pMC10 nM, high sensitivity of 3.09 mF cm(?2) Logc(?1) (unit of c, pM), and a low detection limit of 0.75 pM.

The stochastic nature of the involved parameters along with their large number and correlations make such scheduling a challenging task. This paper aims at identifying pertinent innovative solutions for reducing the relevant total costs of the on-grid EVs within hybrid microgrids. To optimally scale the EVs, a heuristic greedy approach is considered. Unlike most existing scheduling methodologies in the literature, the proposed greedy scheduler is model-free, training-free, and yet efficient. The proposed approach considers different factors such as the electricity price, on-grid EVs state of arrival and departure, and the total revenue to meet the load demands. The greedy-based approach behaves satisfactorily in terms of fulfilling its objective for the hybrid microgrid system, which is established of photovoltaic, wind turbine, and a local utility grid. Meanwhile, the on-grid EVs are being utilized as an energy storage exchange location. A real time hardware-in-the-loop experimentation is comprehensively conducted to maximize the earned profit. Through different uncertainty scenarios, the ability of the proposed greedy approach to obtain a global optimal solution is assessed. A data simulator was developed for the purposes of generating evaluation datasets, which captures uncertainties in the behaviors of the systems parameters. The greedy-based strategy is considered applicable, scalable, and efficient in terms of total operating expenditures. Furthermore, as EVs penetration became more versatile, total expenses decreased significantly. Using simulated data of an effective operational duration of 500 years, the proposed approach succeeded in cutting down the energy consumption costs by about 50C85%, beating existing state-of-the-arts results.

In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722  1,484/L vs 96  124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 m), 1,339  1,281/L vs 76  104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 m), and 333  209/L vs 17  19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 m) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96%  2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Mitigation of Aerosols Generated During Exercise Testing With a Portable High-Efficiency Particulate Air Filter With Fume Hood"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly identified and serious health condition associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical manifestations vary widely among patients with MIS-C, and the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective surveillance study, patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (younger than 21 years, fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, admitted to hospital, multisystem [2] organ involvement [cardiac, renal, respiratory, haematological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological], no alternative plausible diagnosis, and either laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or known COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks before symptom onset) were reported from state and local health departments to the CDC using standard case-report forms. Factors assessed for potential links to severe outcomes included pre-existing patient factors (sex, age, race or ethnicity, obesity, and MIS-C symptom onset date before June 1, 2020) and clinical findings (signs or symptoms and laboratory markers). Logistic regression models, adjusted for all pre-existing factors, were used to estimate odds ratios between potential explanatory factors and the following outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock, decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, and coronary artery abnormalities. FINDINGS: 1080 patients met the CDC case definition for MIS-C and had symptom onset between March 11 and Oct 10, 2020. ICU admission was more likely in patients aged 6C12 years (adjusted odds ratio 19 [95% CI 14C26) and patients aged 13C20 years (26 [18C38]), compared with patients aged 0C5 years, and more likely in non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with non-Hispanic White patients (16 [10C24]).

However, little is known regarding the risk for those not admitted to hospital. We therefore examined prescription drug and health-care use after SARS-CoV-2 infection not requiring hospital admission. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study using the Danish prescription, patient, and health insurance registries. All individuals with a positive or negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark between Feb 27 and May 31, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Outcomes of interest were delayed acute complications, chronic disease, hospital visits due to persisting symptoms, and prescription drug use. We used data from non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2-positive and matched SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals from 2 weeks to 6 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test to obtain propensity score-weighted risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for initiation of 14 drug groups and 27 hospital diagnoses indicative of potential post-acute effects. We also calculated prior event rate ratio-adjusted rate ratios of overall health-care use. This study is registered in the EU Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EUPAS37658). FINDINGS: 10 498 eligible individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark from Feb 27 to May 31, 2020, of whom 8983 (856%) were alive and not admitted to hospital 2 weeks after their positive test. The matched SARS-CoV-2-negative reference population not admitted to hospital consisted of 80 894 individuals. Compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were not at an increased risk of initiating new drugs (RD <01%) except bronchodilating agents, specifically short-acting ?2-agonists (117 [17%] of 6935 positive individuals vs 743 [13%] of 57 206 negative individuals; RD +04% [95% CI 01-07]; RR 132 [109-160]) and triptans (33 [04%] of 8292 vs 198 [03%] of 72 828; RD +01% [00-03]; RR 155 [107-225]).

Rapidly rising local COVID-19 incidence rates, result in demand for high hospital and intensive care bed capacities on short notice. A detailed up-to-date regional surveillance of the dynamics of the pandemic, precise prediction of required inpatient capacities of care as well as a centralized coordination of the distribution of regional patient fluxes is needed to ensure optimal patient care. In March 2020, the German federal state of Saxony established three COVID-19 coordination centers located at each of its maximum care hospitals, namely the University Hospitals Dresden and Leipzig and the hospital Chemnitz. Each center has coordinated inpatient care facilities for the three regions East, Northwest and Southwest Saxony with 36, 18 and 29 hospital sites, respectively. Fed by daily data flows from local public health authorities capturing the dynamics of the pandemic as well as daily reports on regional inpatient care capacities, we established the information and prognosis tool DISPENSE. It provides a regional overview of the current pandemic situation combined with daily prognoses for up to seven days as well as outlooks for up to 14 days of bed requirements. The prognosis precision varies from 21% and 38% to 12% and 15% relative errors in normal ward and ICU bed demand, respectively, depending on the considered time period. The deployment of DISPENSE has had a major positive impact to stay alert for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to allocate resources as needed. The application of a mathematical model to forecast required bed capacities enabled concerted actions for patient allocation and strategic planning.

We demonstrate that the optimized human intestinal organoids enable better simulation of the native human intestinal epithelium, and that they are significantly more susceptible to EV-A71 than CVA16. Higher replication of EV-A71 than CVA16 in the intestinal organoids triggers a more vigorous cellular response. However, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit distinct dynamics of virus-host interaction; more robust propagation of SARS-CoV triggers minimal cellular response, whereas, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits lower replication capacity but elicits a moderate cellular response.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare perineal defect reconstruction with a fasciocutaneous gluteal flap vs biological mesh regarding healing and occurrence of perineal hernia. DESIGN Retrospective review of medical records comparing surgical methods during 2 consecutive periods. SETTINGS Tertiary care university medical center (Colorectal Section, Surgical Department P, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark). PATIENTS Patients with low rectal cancer who underwent extralevator abdominoperineal excision from December 2005 through October 2008 were included. INTERVENTION The perineum was reconstructed with a fasciocutaneous gluteal flap in the first period and with a biological mesh in the second period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES We assessed rates of perineal wound infection requiring surgical intervention and perineal hernia diagnosed by clinical examination. RESULTS The study comprised 57 patients: 33 patients with gluteal flap and 24 with biological mesh reconstruction. Perineal hernia developed in 7 (21%) patients in the gluteal flap group and in none (0%) of the patients in the mesh group (P < .01). Median follow-up was 3.2 (1.7-4.3) years for gluteal flap and 1.7 (0.4-2.2) years for biologic mesh. All hernias occurred within the first postoperative year (median, 6 months; range, 1-12 months). Infectious complications were seen in 2 patients (6%) with a gluteal flap and in 4 patients (17%) with mesh repair (P = .26). After 3 months, all patients were completely healed except for 1 patient in each group with a persistent perineal sinus. The median (range) hospital stay was 14 (8-23) days in the flap group and 9 days (6-35) in the mesh group (P < .05). LIMITATIONS This was a nonrandomized retrospective observational study comparing 2 methods used in different time periods. CONCLUSION We recommend biological mesh reconstruction of the pelvic floor after extralevator abdominoperineal resection because this method can achieve a high healing rate with an acceptable risk of infection, a low hernia rate, and a shorter hospital stay without donor-site morbidity.","output":"Perineal repair after extralevator abdominoperineal excision for low rectal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: the level five (L5) lockdown was a very stringent social distancing measure taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infections.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 245 children with PBB or mild (cylindrical) BE were included in this prospective cohort study. HAdVs were genotyped (when possible) in those whose BAL had HAdV detected (HAdV(+)).

Although it is known that FYVE binds PI(3)P specifically, it has not previously been described of how FYVE attaches and binds to endosomal membranes. In this study, we employed both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic (AT) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine how FYVE binds to PI(3)P-containing membranes. CG-MD showed that the dominant membrane binding mode resembles the crystal structure of EEA1 FYVE domain in complex with inositol-1,3-diphospate (PDB ID 1JOC). FYVE, which is a homodimer, binds the membrane via a hinge mechanism, where the C-terminus of one monomer first attaches to the membrane, followed by the C-terminus of the other monomer. The estimated total binding energy is ~70 kJ/mol, of which 50C60 kJ/mol stems from specific PI(3)P-interactions. By AT-MD, we could partition the binding mode into two types: (i) adhesion by electrostatic FYVE-PI(3)P interaction, and (ii) insertion of amphipathic loops. The AT simulations also demonstrated flexibility within the FYVE homodimer between the C-terminal heads and coiled-coil stem. This leads to a dynamic model whereby the 200 nm long coiled coil attached to the FYVE domain dimer can amplify local hinge-bending motions such that the Rab5-binding domain at the other end of the coiled coil can explore an area of 0.1 m(2) in the search for a second endosome with which to interact.","output":"Membrane-binding mechanism of the EEA1 FYVE domain revealed by multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the factors that affect anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody production remain unclear.

The stepwise multivariate log-normal analysis revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), and high C-reactive protein levels during the disease course (P < 0.001) were associated with elevated IgG antibodies. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with antibody titers. CONCLUSION: The study found that high values of maximum CRP levels during the acute phase, male sex, and diabetes mellitus were associated with elevated antibody titers. Antibody titers tended to be highest in the first 5 or 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.","output":"Factors associated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody production in patients convalescing from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), necessitating prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A Body Mass Index (BMI) higher than 30 kg/m2 is associated with an increased risk of developing ARDS along with greater morbidity, length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. There is limited data on utilizing ECMO support in the morbidly obese population. Case Report A 51-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and extreme obesity with BMI of 54 kg/m2 presented with a complaint of worsening shortness of breath. She was afebrile with a temperature of 97F, tachypneic with a rate of 32, and hypoxic with oxygen saturation in the 80s. Chest x-ray showed severe bilateral interstitial airspace opacities (figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55-60%. She tested positive for COVID-19 and was promptly started on dexamethasone and remdesivir. Her respiratory status continued to decline and she was intubated on day 6. Despite being on 100% Fio2, her hypoxemia persisted. We proceeded to cannulate veno-venous ECMO via the right internal jugular vein and right femoral vein. Over the next several days, her ARDS status continued to improve drastically along with oxygenation. On Day 13, she was successfully de-cannulated with no complications. The patient recovered well and was discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility. Summary ECMO has several advantages including direct pulmonary artery flow improving oxygenation and ventilation, early mobility once off the ventilator, and survival benefit. The use of veno-arterial ECMO should also be considered in the setting of severe respiratory failure accompanied by severe heart failure or right ventricular dysfunction. This case highlights the importance of considering ECMO as a feasible therapeutic option in the morbidly obese patient population with COVID-19 as it can be life-saving.","output":"Coronavirus 2019 in a Morbidly Obese Patient: ECMO or No ECMO?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HPS) causes severe economic losses in the global poultry industry.

The bacteria L. lactis NZ9000 and E. faecalis MDXEF-1 were, respectively, modified as host strain to deliver truncated Hexon protein (Hexon) or Hexon protein fusing with dendritic cell (DC) targeting peptide (DC-Hexon) on the surface of bacteria. The expression of target protein in L. lactis NZ9000 and E. faecalis MDXEF-1 were detected by western blot. To evaluate the immune responses and protective efficacies provided by the live recombinant bacteria, chickens were immunized with the constructed Hexon-expressing bacteria three times at 2-week intervals, then experimentally challenged with hypervirulent FAdV-4/GX01. The results showed that oral immunizations with the four Hexon-expressing bacteria (NZ9000/Hexon-CWA, NZ9000/DC-Hexon-CWA, MDXEF-1/Hexon-CWA, and MDXEF-1/DC-Hexon-CWA), especially the two bacteria carrying DC-targeting peptide, stimulated higher levels of Hexon-specific sera IgG and secretory IgA (sIgA) in jejunal lavage fluid, higher proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and higher levels of Th1/Th2-type cytokines, along with significantly decreased virus loads in liver and more offered protective efficacies against FAdV infection compared with PBS and empty vector control groups (p < 0.01). For chickens in the group MDXEF-1/DC-Hexon-CWA, the levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in sera, and the virus loads in livers were significantly decreased vs. the other three Hexon-expressing bacteria (p < 0.01). The pathological changes in the hearts, livers, spleens and kidneys of chickens in MDXEF-1/DC-Hexon-CWA group were relatively slight compared to infection control group and other three Hexon-expressing bacteria groups.

It is classified as a benign disease according to its histological features but shows the behavioral characteristics of a malignant tumor. It is easily misdiagnosed and recurrent. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze clinicopathological data of 25 cases of IVL in order to enhance clinicians understanding of this rare disease. PATIENT CONCERNS: We screened and identified 25 cases of IVL at our hospital from October 2013 to January 2020. Five patients had tumors. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis in each case was pathologically confirmed after surgical treatment. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were managed surgically. Although the surgical procedures were different, the surgical approach was geared towards achieving complete excision. Three patients received hormonal therapy with gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists after surgery. OUTCOMES: We retrospectively reviewed all medical records and analyzed the clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes of this disease as well as the correlations between the clinical features and risk of recurrence. Neither the symptoms nor the preoperative imaging results were suggestive of IVL in any of the cases. Except for two patients who were lost to follow-up, twenty-three patients who were followed up are still alive. Three patients experienced a recurrence. LESSONS: The clinical manifestations and ultrasound images of IVL in the early stages are not typical; thus, IVL is easily misdiagnosed as uterine leiomyoma. Radiologists, pathologists, and surgeons should have a thorough understanding of IVL and a high index of vigilance for IVL in clinical practice. Surgery should always be aimed at achieving complete tumor excision. Patients with large lesions (7 cm) and lesions extending to the broad ligament may have an increased risk of recurrence. Early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are very important; once the diagnosis is confirmed, regular follow-ups are crucial.","output":"Clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes of intravenous leiomyomatosis of the uterus: A case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a rare case of meningoradiculitis occurring after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

One human protein recruited by several viral proteins is selenoprotein S, which takes part in the endoplasmic reticulum protein degradation pathway, NFkB signaling, and cytokines secretion. A key interaction was reported with SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein (nsp7), which is essential for virus replication. However, it was unclear whether selenoprotein S and nsp7 interact directly and whether the interaction is possible when nsp7 forms a complex with the other components of the virus's replication machinery. We used biochemical assays to show that selenoprotein S binds nsp7, including when nsp7 is in complex with the coronavirus's RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This places selenoprotein S at the heart of the coronavirus's replication complex and marks it as the first human protein shown to directly interact with the viral replication complex. Cross-linking experiments were employed to map the interactions of selenoprotein S and nsp7 in the replication complex. We show that the hydrophobic segment of selenoprotein S is essential for binding nsp7.

The existing DLBCs allow the delivery of self-expandable stents but do not offer the possibility to deploy flow-diverters. Despite the increasing use and success of flow-diverters, there have been numerous reports of procedural complications such as early in-stent thrombosis or delayed distal embolization. It seems that these complications can be avoided by correct stent positioning and adequate wall apposition, achieved either by manoeuvres with the microguidewire and/or microcatheter or by performing balloon angioplasty following an exchange guidewire manoeuvre.

In this respect, it is crucial to determine the case-increase, case-fatality, and case-recovery rates to control COVID-19. In this study, the case-increase, case-fatality, and case-recovery rates of COVID-19 in 36 European countries were analyzed with the meta-analysis method using data released by the health organizations and WHO. The data were obtained from the website of health organizations of 36 European countries and the website of WHO until 11 May 2020. The analyses were carried out on 1 744 704 COVID-19-diagnosed cases in 36 European countries. The case-increase, case-fatality and case-recovery rates of COVID-19 were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), single-arm meta-analysis, cross-temporal meta-analysis, and meta-regression random-effects model. The standardized case-increase rate of COVID-19 is 5% (95% CI [0.040, 0.063]) and the average case-increase rate in European countries has started to decline by around 3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) weekly. The countries with the highest rate of case increase are Belgium, Sweden, Russia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 patients was 4.5% as of May 11 (95% CI [0.037-0.055]), this rate is 6.3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) in standardized time (6th week).

With the requirement of wire localisation of non-palpable breast cancers/ lesions on the day of surgery and non-availability of mammogram and ultrasound machine in an isolated zone, we embarked on localisation of non-palpable breast lesions using MagseedR markers and SentimagR localisation system. We describe our initial experience in the management of these cancers and diagnostic excision biopsies using Magseed. Materials and Methods: Forty consecutive female patients, median age 61 (range 36-84) years underwent Magseed insertion for diagnostic excision biopsy (n=4) and breast conservation surgery (WLE;n= 36). Check mammograms were performed following Magseed insertion to confirm appropriate localisation. During the initial audit of 16 patients, one Magseed guided WLE and sentinel node biopsy was abandoned due to erratic signal strength on the day of surgery and underwent surgery with wire localisation on a later date. Subsequently all cases had Magseed signals confirmed following insertion in the radiology department along with check mammograms. Results: Thirty-nine patients underwent successful breast surgery (Magseed in intra-operative specimen X-ray) with standard axillary procedures (29 sentinel node biopsy, 2 axillary node clearance). The median time from magseed insertion to surgery was 13 (range 3-38) days. The lesions were invasive neoplasm +/- insitu (DCIS) disease (n= 32), DCIS (n=5), and papilloma (n=3).

Telemedicine solutions for homeless persons might compensate for shortcomings in access to valuable health services in different settings. The main aim of our research was to examine the attitudes and openness of homeless persons regarding telecare on a Hungarian sample. METHODS: Quantitative survey among homeless people (n = 98) was completed in 4 shelters providing mid- and long-term accommodation in Budapest, Hungary. Attitudes regarding healthcare service accessibility and telecare were measured by a self-developed questionnaire of the research team. Telecare attitude comparison was made with data of a Hungarian weighted reference group of non-homeless persons recruited from 2 primary care units (n = 110). RESULTS: A significant fraction of homeless people with mid- or long-term residency in homeless shelters did not oppose the use of telecare via live online video consultation and there was no difference compared to the national reference group (averages of 3.09 vs. 3.15, respectively). Results of the homeless group indicate that those more satisfied with healthcare services, in general, manifest more openness to telecare. It is clearly demonstrated by the multivariate analysis that those participants in the homeless group who had problems getting health care in the last year definitely preferred in-person doctor-patient consultations. CONCLUSION: Digital health technologies offer a potentially important new pathway for the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions among homeless persons. Based on the attitudes towards telecare, initiating an on-site telecare program for mid- and long-term residents of homeless shelters might enable better care continuity.

Although prostaglandins (PGs) are detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with ALI/ARDS, the role of PGF(2) in ALI remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the role of PGF(2)/PGF(2) receptor (FP) signaling in acid-induced ALI using an FP receptor antagonist, AL8810. Intratracheal injection of hydrochloric acid (HCl) increased neutrophil migration into the lungs, leading to respiratory dysfunction. Pre-administration of AL8810 further increased these features. Moreover, pre-treatment with AL8810 enhanced the HCl-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil migratory factors in the lungs. Administration of HCl decreased the gene expression of lung surfactant proteins, which was further reduced by co-administration of AL8810.

Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptors allows the definition of residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S, up to 7 can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S interface. Of note, pigs and dogs, which are not infected or are not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with that from bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV-RaTG13) and pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) strain hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019 revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas Bat-CoV-RaTG13 exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibits seven changes relative to human ACE2, and a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon dogs, and civets, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not be especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide, and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear, and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes, indicating that the species barrier might be low. Exceptions are dogs and especially pigs, which revealed relatively low ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract. Monitoring of animals is necessary to prevent the generation of a new coronavirus reservoir. Finally, our analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not be specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","output":"Comparison of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Spike Protein Binding to ACE2 Receptors from Human, Pets, Farm Animals, and Putative Intermediate Hosts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A purposeful sample of 15 mothers of children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities participated in this hermeneutic phenomenological study through interviews and completion of a diary.

The challenges in quantifying COVID-19 complexities include effectively modeling its process and data uncertainties. The uncertainties are embedded in implicit and high-proportional undocumented infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even more apparent in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the relevant knowledge, case reporting and testing were all limited. Here we introduce a novel hybrid approach Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented infected-Recovered (SUDR) model. First, SUDR (1) characterizes and distinguishes Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections. Second, SUDR characterizes the probabilistic density of infections by capturing exogenous processes. Lastly, SUDR approximates the density likelihood of COVID-19 prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal transmission and social reinforcement during COVID-19 contagion, the transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented infectious cases. By sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with reasonable priors, SUDR handles the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19 observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data. The results demonstrate a deeper quantitative understanding of the above uncertainties, in comparison with classic SIR, time-dependent SIR, and probabilistic SIR models.","output":"Modeling time evolving COVID-19 uncertainties with density dependent asymptomatic infections and social reinforcement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 3 million deaths and infected more than 170 million individuals all over the world. Rapid identification of patients with COVID-19 is the key to control transmission and prevent depletion of hospitals. Several networks have been proposed to assist radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 based on CT scans. However, CTs used in these studies are unavailable for other researchers to do deeper extensions due to privacy concerns. Furthermore, these networks are too heavy-weighted to satisfy the general trend applying on a computationally limited platform. In this paper, we aim to solve these two problems. Firstly, we establish an available dataset COVID-CTx, which contains 828 CT scans positive for COVID-19 across 324 patient cases from three open access data repositories. To our knowledge, it has the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases compared to other public datasets. Secondly, we propose a light-weighted hybrid neural network: Depthwise Separable Dense Convolutional Network with Convolution Block Attention Module (AM-SdenseNet). AM-SdenseNet synergistically integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module with depthwise separable convolutions to learn powerful feature representations while reducing the parameters to overcome the overfitting problem. Through experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed AM-SdenseNet compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The excellent performance of AM-SdenseNet can improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, which is extremely useful to control the spreading of infection.","output":"A depthwise separable dense convolutional network with convolution block attention module for COVID-19 diagnosis on CT scans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Appropriate planning is crucial to avoid morbidity and mortality when difficulty is anticipated with airway management. Many guidelines developed by national societies have focused on management of difficulty encountered in the unconscious patient; however, little guidance appears in the literature on how best to approach the patient with an anticipated difficult airway. METHODS To review this and other subjects, the Canadian Airway Focus Group (CAFG) was re-formed. With representation from anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and critical care, CAFG members were assigned topics for review. As literature reviews were completed, results were presented and discussed during teleconferences and two face-to-face meetings. When appropriate, evidence- or consensus-based recommendations were made, and levels of evidence were assigned. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Previously published predictors of difficult direct laryngoscopy are widely known. More recent studies report predictors of difficult face mask ventilation, video laryngoscopy, use of a supraglottic device, and cricothyrotomy. All are important facets of a complete airway evaluation and must be considered when difficulty is anticipated with airway management. Many studies now document the increasing patient morbidity that occurs with multiple attempts at tracheal intubation. Therefore, when difficulty is anticipated, tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia should be considered only when success with the chosen device(s) can be predicted in a maximum of three attempts. Concomitant predicted difficulty using oxygenation by face mask or supraglottic device ventilation as a fallback makes an awake approach advisable. Contextual issues, such as patient cooperation, availability of additional skilled help, and the clinician's experience, must also be considered in deciding the appropriate strategy. CONCLUSIONS With an appropriate airway evaluation and consideration of relevant contextual issues, a rational decision can be made on whether an awake approach to tracheal intubation will maximize patient safety or if airway management can safely proceed after induction of general anesthesia. With predicted difficulty, close attention should be paid to details of implementing the chosen approach. This should include having a plan in case of the failure of tracheal intubation or patient oxygenation.","output":"The difficult airway with recommendations for management--part 2--the anticipated difficult airway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the suspension of programmed activity in most of the Endoscopy Units in our environment.

This study aims to assess the knowledge, preparedness and attitudes of medical students, physicians and faculty members in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on COVID-19 and their perspective on the roles of educational and healthcare institution towards improving pandemic preparedness and enabling optimal care. METHODOLOGY: An exploratory, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 participants, using a non-probability convenience sampling method. English-speaking participants from the medical field aged 18 and above were included in the study. The validated questionnaire was administered online and distributed across social media platforms from May-July 2020. T-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney-U test were used when appropriate. Responses were analysed and statistical tests applied using IBM SPSS, version 25. RESULTS: The knowledge scores were calculated amongst different ages and professional status, and the mean was 59.08% (SD = 12.848%). Almost half of the participants obtained poor knowledge scores (less than 60%). Most of the participants followed the latest updates on COVID-19 (86.7%). The majority opted to obtain information from the national health authorities (63.4%). The mean preparedness score among the participants was 68.65% (SD = 17.456%). Being in contact with patients significantly increased the preparedness score (p < 0.001). Only 27.9% of the participants believed their college education provided adequate knowledge to deal with epidemics or pandemics. Several barriers affect willingness to work in a pandemic, with 80.6% of participants worried about posing a risk to family members. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of establishing tailored COVID-19 related education programs to improve knowledge levels, especially in medical students.

In this study, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein physically interacts with cell surface GRP78, which promotes the binding to and accumulation in ACE2-expressing cells. GRP78 was highly expressed in adipose tissue and increased in humans and mice with older age, obesity, and diabetes. The overexpression of GRP78 was attributed to hyperinsulinemia in adipocytes, which was in part mediated by the stress-responsive transcription factor XBP-1s. Management of hyperinsulinemia by pharmacological approaches, including metformin, sodiumCglucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, or 3-adrenergic receptor agonist, decreased GRP78 gene expression in adipose tissue. Environmental interventions, including exercise, calorie restriction, fasting, or cold exposure, reduced the gene expression of GRP78 in adipose tissue. This study provides scientific evidence for the role of GRP78 as a binding partner of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2, which might be related to the severe progression and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with older age, obesity, and diabetes.

Two different meshes (PP/ORC and PP/ePTFE) and four fixation devices were evaluated: a 6.4 mm poly(D,L: )-lactide pushpin (tack I), a 6.8 mm poly(D,L: )-lactide with blunt tip (tack II), a 4.1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) (tack III) and one titanium tack (control tack). A first group of animals (n = 12) was euthanized after 2 weeks survival and a second group (n = 12) after 6 months. At euthanasia, a relaparoscopy was performed to assess adhesion formation followed by laparotomy with excision of the entire abdominal wall. Tensile strength of the individual fixation systems was tested with the use of a tensiometer by measuring the force to pull the tack out of the mesh. Additionally, the foreign body reaction to the fixation systems was evaluated histologically as was their potential degradation. RESULTS At 2 weeks the tensile strength was significantly higher for the control tack (31.98 N/cm2) compared to the resorbable devices. Except for tack II, the tensile strength was higher when the devices were fixed in a PP/ePTFE mesh compared to the PP/ORC mesh. After 6 months only tack III was completely resorbed, while tack I (9.292 N/cm2) had the lowest tensile strength. At this time-point similar tensile strength was observed for both tack II (29.56 N/cm2) and the control tack (27.77 N/cm2). Adhesions seem to be more depending on the type of mesh, in favor of PP/ePTFE.

Children are an inherently vulnerable group because they are reliant on their parents and caregivers to make decisions in their best interests and have no political voice. Historically, there has been general acceptance of the need to ration healthcare at a systems level, however there is controversy over whether healthcare professionals should be involved in rationing at the bedside. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that bedside rationing is unavoidable, at least in times of extreme resource scarcity. Internationally, there has been significant ethical analysis and guideline development to guide intensive care rationing decisions in the event that resources are overwhelmed. This paper explores the principles underlying distributive justice in healthcare rationing and discusses how these were operationalized in ethical guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, rationing is unavoidable and occurs constantly in everyday nursing and medical ICU practice, often in mundane and uncontroversial ways. Some argue that these everyday decisions are not true rationing decisions, but resource allocation, or stewardship decisions. We argue there are no clear lines between resource allocation and rationing decisions, rather that they occur on a spectrum. These everyday rationing decisions are particularly susceptible to personal biases that are often implicit. Due to the subtle and constant nature of most everyday rationing decisions, specific guideline development will rarely be practical or appropriate. However, it is possible to develop other processes to improve decision making. There are a variety of strategies we recommend for this including, encouraging reflective practice; developing explicit frameworks that promote collaborative decision making; being transparent about resource allocation and rationing decisions with colleagues, patients, and families; and promoting a workplace culture of speaking up and accessing support in identifying and managing everyday rationing decisions.","output":"Rationing in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit-ethical or unethical?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of different sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on the COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality rates have been studied extensively around the world; however, there is a dearth of data on the impact of different clinical and sociodemographic variables on the COVID-19-related outcomes in Saudi Arabia.

The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress.

On the other hand, low testosterone levels increase the risk of cardiopulmonary complications. Hypogonadism appears to be an important unfavorable prognostic factor for the disease.

CONCLUSION: The study found a decrease in reported cases of suspected child abuse and neglect during the lockdown in March and April 2020 compared to 2019. While the results do not show an increase of total child abuse and neglect, as suspected by many professionals, the decrease in reported cases may be explained by a steep increase in unreported cases due to reduced social control.","output":"Medizinischer Kinderschutz w?hrend des Corona-Lockdowns: Vergleichende Befunde der Kinderschutzf?lle aus Kliniken und Ambulanzen in Deutschland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infects most children by five years of age.

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. RESULTS: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18), and for twice-weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19-compatible illness (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08).

The paper unpacks urban poverty in light of the corona virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 and the lack of any vaccines requires physical distancing as preventative measures to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Governments across the world, including in Anglophone Sub Saharan Africa have implemented lockdown measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is happening within settlements where the majority of the population lives from hand to mouth. In Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanisation and increased urban poverty, COVID-19 scourge has had a huge impact on the urban poor. The COVID-19 is likely to devastate economies and the community. For rapidly growing, densely populated and poorly planned settlements, the situation is tragic for these inhabitants. Nation states lockdown and social and physical distancing in response to the pandemic have escalated their misery. The paper adopts a critical review of literature anchored in case study analysis, document analysis and scanning from reports. Results point to redefining the way humanity has related, functioned and conceptualised realities. There is need to go beyond prevention from infection as majority of urban dwellers are in the informal sector or unemployed. For the urban poor, strategies for social distancing may not be possible or effective. People are being asked to make choices between being hungry and risk of getting infected. The paper recommends planning response at national, regional and local level bearing in mind informal settlements, high densities and forms of overcrowding which have been placed as hotspots for the virus.

Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies offers many advantages such as providing immediate immunity, consequently blunting an early pro-inflammatory pathogenic endogenous antibody response and lack of drug-drug interactions. By providing immediate immunity and inhibiting entry into cells, neutralizing antibody treatment is of interest for patient with COVID-19-induced moderate pneumonia. Convalescent plasma to treat infected patients is therefore a relevant therapeutic option currently under assessment (CORIMUNO-PLASM NCT04324047). However, the difficulties of collecting plasma on the long term are not adapted to a broad use across all populations. New polyclonal humanized anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies (XAV-19) developed by Xenothera and administered intravenous. XAV-19 is a heterologous swine glyco-humanized polyclonal antibody (GH-pAb) raised against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking infection of ACE-2-positive human cells with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have been performed in preclinical models including primates. A first human study with another fully representative GH-pAb from Xenothera is ongoing in recipients of a kidney graft. These studies indicated that 5 consecutive administrations of GH-pAbs can be safely performed in humans. The objectives of this 2-step phase 2 randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled study are to define the safety and the optimal XAV-19 dose to administrate to patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced moderate pneumonia, and to assess the clinical benefits of a selected dose of XAV-19 in this population. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the clinical benefits of XAV-19 when administered to patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced moderate pneumonia. As a prerequisite, a first step of the study will define the safety and the dose of XAV-19 to be used. Such treatment might become a new therapeutic option to provide an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients (possibly in combination with anti-viral and immunotherapies). Further studies could later evaluate such passive immunotherapy as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis.

Ultrasonic scaling generates aerosols and splatters contaminated with microorganisms, increasing the risk of disease transmission in the dental office. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of extraoral suction (EOS) units in aerosol and splatter reduction during ultrasonic scaling. Methods. Ultrasonic scaling was conducted on a dental manikin headset to simulate a scaling procedure. Water containing Lactobacillus acidophilus at a concentration of 10(7) colony-forming units per milliliter and 1% fluorescein solution was used as the water supply of the scaler. The scaling procedure was conducted with a high-volume evacuator (HVE) or the combination of HVE and an EOS unit. de ManCRogosaCSharpe agar plates were placed at different distances surrounding the dental chair. Filter papers were placed at various positions surrounding the oral cavity and on areas of the body. Results. Bioaerosols were detected at every sampling site and could travel as far as 150 cm from the oral cavity. The combination of HVE and EOS significantly reduced the total number of bacterial colonies in the air (P < 0.001). Dissemination of the stain was in the range of 20 cm from the oral cavity. The maximum contaminated surface area was at the 4 oclock position from the oral cavity. The combination of EOS and HVE significantly reduced the contaminated area (P < 0.05).

The guideline recommends cemental augmentation for painful vertebral lesions in patients with malignant diagnosis, either hematological or non-hematological. Fracture of the posterior wall is not a contradiction to cemental augmentation, but care should always be taken while injecting the cement, to decrease the risk of cemental leaks into the spinal canal. CONCLUSION The recommendations are based on low-to-moderate quality of evidence or professional consensus as well as patient preferences and positive and harmful effects of the intervention.

It is considered a promising and safe alternative pain therapy. Different targets have been tested, each having their own particular mechanisms for modulating pain perception. AREAS COVERED We discuss the current state of the art of tDCS to manage pain and future strategies to optimize tDCS' effects. Current strategies include primary motor cortex tDCS, prefrontal tDCS and tDCS combined with behavioral interventions while future strategies, on the other hand, include high intensity tDCS, transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current Stimulation, cerebellar tDCS, home-based tDCS and tDCS with extended number of sessions. EXPERT COMMENTARY It has been shown that the stimulation of the prefrontal and primary motor cortex is efficient for pain reduction while a few other new strategies, such as high intensity tDCS and network-based tDCS, are believed to induce strong neuroplastic effects, although the underlying neural mechanisms still need to be fully uncovered. Hence, conventional tDCS approaches demonstrated promising effects to manage pain and new strategies are under development to enhance tDCS effects and make this approach more easily available by using, for instance, home-based devices.","output":"Methods and strategies of tDCS for the treatment of pain: current status and future directions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a life-threatening ongoing pandemic worldwide. A retrospective study by Chow et al showed aspirin use was associated with decreased intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Recently, the RECOVERY TRIAL showed no associated reductions in the 28-d mortality or the progression to mechanical ventilation of such patients. With these conflicting findings, our study was aimed at evaluating the impact of daily aspirin intake on the outcome of COVID-19 patients. AIM: To study was aimed at evaluating the impact of daily aspirin intake on the outcome of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 125 COVID-19 positive patients. Subgroup analysis to evaluate the association of demographics and comorbidities was undertaken. The impact of chronic aspirin use was assessed on the survival outcomes, need for mechanical ventilation, and progression to ICU. Variables were evaluated using the chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: 125 patients were studied, 30.40% were on daily aspirin, and 69.60% were not. Cross-tabulation of the clinical parameters showed that hypertension (P = 0.004), hyperlipidemia (0.016), and diabetes mellitus (P = 0.022) were significantly associated with aspirin intake. Regression analysis for progression to the ICU, need for mechanical ventilation and survival outcomes against daily aspirin intake showed no statistical significance.

Our objective was to study the association of thrombus CT characteristics with outcome and treatment effect in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS We included 199 patients for whom thin-section NCCT and CTA within 30 minutes from each other were available in the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) study. We assessed the following thrombus characteristics: location, distance from ICA terminus to thrombus, length, volume, absolute and relative density on NCCT, and perviousness. Associations of thrombus characteristics with outcome were estimated with univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression as an OR for a shift toward better outcome on the mRS. Interaction terms were used to investigate treatment-effect modification by thrombus characteristics. RESULTS In univariate analysis, only the distance from the ICA terminus to the thrombus, length of >8 mm, and perviousness were associated with functional outcome. Relative thrombus density on CTA was independently associated with functional outcome with an adjusted common OR of 1.21 per 10% (95% CI, 1.02-1.43; P = .029). There was no treatment-effect modification by any of the thrombus CT characteristics. CONCLUSIONS In our study on patients with large-vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation, CT thrombus characteristics appear useful for predicting functional outcome. However, in our study cohort, the effect of intra-arterial treatment was independent of the thrombus CT characteristics. Therefore, no arguments were provided to select patients for intra-arterial treatment using thrombus CT characteristics.","output":"Value of Thrombus CT Characteristics in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems serve the important function of providing fresh air changes for indoor spaces, they have been shown to distribute aerosolized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across such spaces and potentially exacerbate the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission.

The aim of the present, exploratory study was to qualitatively examine: (1) The impact of COVID-19 on binge eating spectrum disorder symptoms (2) Patient perceptions of tele-therapy, and (3) Ways to address COVID-19 in eating disorder treatment. Data were collected through one-on-one, semi-structured interviews (N = 11), conducted as part of a mid-program assessment for those undergoing individual, outpatient therapy for binge eating spectrum disorders. After thematic analysis, it was identified that patients reported both symptom deterioration and improvement during COVID-19. Factors surrounding social distancing and stay-at-home measures were found to both improve and worsen symptoms for different patients. Further, patients reported positive perceptions of tele-therapy, particularly appreciating the convenience of this modality.

We compared outcomes following open repair of complex AAA (cAAA) using an RP versus a TP approach and evaluated the relative use of these approaches over time. METHODS: We identified all patients undergoing open intact cAAA repair in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) from 2003-2019 and created 1:1-propensity score-matched cohorts based on operative approach (RP vs. TP). The primary outcome was perioperative mortality. Secondary outcomes included perioperative complications and approach usage over time. To create 1:1-propensity score-matched cohorts, patients were matched for demographics, comorbidities and anatomic/intraoperative characteristics including proximal clamp site and renal revascularization. Approach usage over time was determined by plotting the proportion of RP usage over time for the overall open cAAA cohort and subgroups of repairs utilizing a supraceliac cross clamp, repair with concomitant renal revascularization, and repairs in high volume centers (highest quintile: >11 cases/year). RESULTS: Of 4,613 patients, 2,843 (62%) patients underwent open cAAA repair by TP approach and 1,770 (38%) patients by RP approach. In 1,256 matched pairs, RP approach was associated with lower risk of perioperative mortality compared with TP approach (3.9% vs. 6.8%/RR 0.57 [95%CI 0.41-0.80], p=.001). Furthermore, RP approach was associated with lower risk of cardiac complication (7.2% vs. 9.6%/RR 0.75 [95%CI 0.58-0.98]), bowel ischemia (3.1% vs. 5.4%/RR 0.56 [95%CI 0.39-0.84]) and postoperative dialysis (3.3% vs. 5.5%/RR 0.59 [95%CI 0.41-0.87]). Overall, there was a lower proportion of patients who underwent repair via an RP approach over time (-1.0%/year [-1.5 - -0.5], p<.001), and a similar trend in decrease was found within patients undergoing repair with a supraceliac clamp (-2.3%/year [-3.6 - -1.0], p<.001) and in high-volume hospitals (-2.1%/year [-3.4 - -0.8], p=.001), although no statistically significant decrease in RP usage was found in patients undergoing concomitant renal revascularization (-0.9%/year [-2.6 - 0.8], p=.28). CONCLUSION: For open cAAA repair, an RP approach is associated with lower perioperative mortality and complications compared with a TP approach. However, relative usage of the RP approach is decreasing over time. Increased adoption of an RP approach, when appropriate, may lead to improved outcomes following open cAAA repair.","output":"A Retroperitoneal Operative Approach is Associated with Improved Perioperative Outcomes Compared with a Transperitoneal Approach in Open Repair of Complex Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world economy has been struck by Covid-19 the same way people are struck by a lightning, fast and without warning, leaving nations out to dry on little to no reserves on their crucial supply side.

We hypothesised that countries with higher GHSI or JEE scores would have detected their first COVID-19 case earlier, and would experience lower mortality outcome compared to countries with lower scores. We evaluated the effectiveness of GHSI and JEE in predicting countries' COVID-19 detection response times and mortality outcome (deaths/million). We used two different outcomes for the evaluation: (i) detection response time, the duration of time to the first confirmed case detection (from 31st December 2019 to 20th February 2020 when every country's first case was linked to travel from China) and (ii) mortality outcome (deaths/million) until 11th March and 1st July 2020, respectively. We interpreted the detection response time alongside previously published relative risk of the importation of COVID-19 cases from China. We performed multiple linear regression and negative binomial regression analysis to evaluate how these indices predicted the actual outcome. The two indices, GHSI and JEE were strongly correlated (r = 0.82), indicating a good agreement between them. However, both GHSI (r = 0.31) and JEE (r = 0.37) had a poor correlation with countries' COVID-19Crelated mortality outcome. Higher risk of importation of COVID-19 from China for a given country was negatively correlated with the time taken to detect the first case in that country (adjusted R(2) = 0.63C0.66), while the GHSI and JEE had minimal predictive value. In the negative binomial regression model, countries' mortality outcome was strongly predicted by the percentage of the population aged 65 and above (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.10 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01C1.21) while overall GHSI score (IRR: 1.01 (95% CI: 0.98C1.01)) and JEE (IRR: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96C1.02)) were not significant predictors.

Muscle MRI can be a promising candidate to track longitudinal changes and to predict response to the therapy in clinical trials. Objective: Our aim is to apply quantitative muscle MRI in the evaluation of disease progression, focusing on thigh and leg muscles of patients with ALS, and to explore the correlation between radiological and clinical scores. Methods: We enrolled newly diagnosed patients with ALS, longitudinally scored using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), who underwent a 3T muscle MRI protocol including a 6-point Dixon gradient-echo sequence and multi-echo turbo spin echo (TSE) T2-weighted sequence for quantification of fat fraction (FF), cross-sectional area (CSA), and water T2 (wT2). A total of 12 muscles of the thigh and six muscles of the leg were assessed by the manual drawing of 18 regions of interest (ROIs), for each side. A group of 11 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) was enrolled for comparison. Results: 15 patients (M/F 8/7; mean age 62.2 years old, range 29C79) diagnosed with possible (n = 2), probable (n = 12), or definite (n = 1) ALS were enrolled. Eleven patients presented spinal onset, whereas four of them had initial bulbar involvement. All patients performed MRI at T0, nine of them at T1, and seven of them at T2. At baseline, wT2 was significantly elevated in ALS subjects compared to HCs for several muscles of the thigh and mainly for leg muscles. By contrast, FF was elevated in few muscles, and mainly at the level of the thigh. The applied mixed effects model showed that FF increased significantly in the leg muscles over time (mainly in the triceps surae) and that wT2 decreased significantly in line with worsening in the leg subscore of ALSFRS-R, mainly at the leg level and in the anterior and medial compartment of the thigh. Conclusions: Quantitative MRI represents a non-invasive tool that is able to outline the trajectory of pathogenic modifications at the muscle level in ALS. In particular, wT2 was found to be increased early in the clinical history of ALS and also tended to decrease over time, also showing a positive correlation with leg subscore of ALSFRS-R.","output":"Longitudinal Quantitative MRI Evaluation of Muscle Involvement in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Multiplexed molecular rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may allow for rapid and accurate diagnosis of the microbial etiology of pneumonia.

In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neuro-behaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1?, IL-6 and TNF-&#945;) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-??B, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peri-tumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, our results suggested that AVNP2 could have an effect on the peri-tumor environment, obviously restraining the growth progress of gliomas, and eventually improving cognitive levels in C6-bearing rats.","output":"AVNP2 protects against cognitive impairments induced by C6 glioma by suppressing tumour associated inflammation in rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Chronic dissection of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta as sequela of a prior type A or B dissection is a challenging problem that requires close radiographic surveillance and prompt operative intervention in the presence of symptoms or aneurysm formation. Open repair of chronic thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic dissection using deep hypothermia has been our preferred method to treat this complex pathology. The advantages of this technique include organ and spinal cord protection, the flexibility to extend the repair proximally into the arch, and the ability to limit ischemia to all vascular beds. METHODS Open repair of arch by left thoracotomy and descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic pathology using deep hypothermia was performed in 664 patients from 1995 to 2015. A subset of this cohort had chronic thoracoabdominal aortic dissection (n = 196). All nonemergency cases received coronary angiography and echocardiography preoperatively. Significant coronary artery disease or severe aortic insufficiency was addressed before repair of the chronic dissection. In recent years, lumbar drains were placed preoperatively in the most extensive repairs (extents II and III). Important intercostal arteries from T8 to L1 were revascularized with smaller-diameter looped grafts. Multibranched grafts for the visceral segment have been preferred in recent years. RESULTS Mean age of patients was 58  14 years. Men comprised 74% of the cohort. Aortopathy was confirmed in 18% of the cohort. Prior thoracic aortic repair occurred in 57% of patients, and prior abdominal aortic repair occurred in 14% of patients. Prior type A aortic dissection occurred in 44% of patients, and prior type B occurred in 56% of patients. Operative mortality was 3.6%, permanent spinal cord ischemia occurred in 2.6% of patients, permanent hemodialysis occurred in 0% of patients, and permanent stroke occurred in 1% of patients. Reexploration for bleeding was 5.1%, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy occurred in 2.6%. Postoperative length of stay was 11.9  9.7 days. Reintervention for pseudoaneurysm or growth of a distal aneurysm was 6.9%. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year survivals were 93%, 79%, and 57%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Open repair of chronic thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic dissection using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest has low morbidity and mortality. The need for reintervention is low, and long-term survival is excellent.

A clinician task force developed a conceptual framework, followed by annual surveys and a series of interventions. Features of the job demands-resources model were used as the conceptual underpinning to this analysis. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of a clinician-driven conceptual model in understanding burnout and work engagement in the state of Minnesota. METHODOLOGY Four thousand nine hundred ninety clinicians from 94 MHA member hospitals/systems responded to a 2018 survey using a brief instrument adapted, in part, from previously validated measures. RESULTS As hypothesized, job demands were strongly related to burnout, whereas resources were most related to work engagement. Variables from the MHA model explained 40% of variability in burnout and 24% of variability in work engagement. Variables related to burnout with the highest beta weights included having sufficient time for work (-0.266), values alignment with leaders (-0.176), and teamwork efficiency (-0.123), all ps < .001. Variables most associated with engagement included values alignment (0.196), feeling appreciated (0.163), and autonomy (0.093), ps < .001. CONCLUSION Findings support the basic premises of the proposed conceptual model. Remediable work-life conditions, such as having sufficient time to do the job, values alignment with leadership, teamwork efficiency, feeling appreciated, and clinician autonomy, manifested the strongest associations with burnout and work engagement.

Moreover, the markers participated to mitochondrial dynamic, UPRmtand oxidative stress in fundic gland were determined. Results revealed that vacuolar degeneration were observed in the treated groups contrast with control group, and the Cu level was boosted with the increasing intake of Cu. Besides that, the levels of CAT, TRX, H2O2, and G6PDH were reduced in group  and group , the mRNA levels of NRF2, HO-1, SOD-1, CAT, SOD-2, GSR, GPX1, GPX4, and TRX in the treated groups were promoted contrast to control group.

METHODS: BISHOP was a randomized, open-label, single-centre, phase-II controlled trial. Fifty adult patients hospitalized with PCR-positive Covid-19, were randomized 1:1 to receive 300 mg of secukinumab subcutaneously at day-0 plus standard of care (group A) or standard of care alone (group B). A second dose of 300 mg of secukinumab could be administered on day-7, according to staff judgement. The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days at day-28 (VFD-28). Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were also explored. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in VFD-28: 23.7 (95%CI 19.6-27.8) in group A vs. 23.8 (19.9-27.6) in group B, p = .62; There was also no difference in hospitalization time, intensive care unit demand and the incidence of circulatory shock, acute kidney injury, fungal or bacterial co-infections.

As microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a major driver of neurodegeneration, here we interrogated whether SARS-CoV-2 can promote microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation utilising a model of human monocyte-derived microglia. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 isolates can bind and enter microglia, triggering inflammasome activation in the absence of viral replication. Mechanistically, microglial NLRP3 could be both primed and activated with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in a NF-B and ACE2-dependent manner. Notably, virus- and spike protein-mediated inflammasome activation in microglia was significantly enhanced in the presence of -synuclein fibrils, which was entirely ablated by NLRP3-inhibition. These results support a possible mechanism of microglia activation by SARS-CoV-2, which could explain the increased vulnerability to developing neurological symptoms akin to Parkinsons disease in certain COVID-19 infected individuals, and a potential therapeutic avenue for intervention.

In this study, we examined the interaction SARS-CoV-2 with brain immune cells, by using an ex-vivo model of human monocyte-derived microglia. We identified robust activation of the innate immune sensor complex, NLRP3 inflammasome, in cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This was dependent on spike protein-ACE2 receptor interaction and was potentiated in the presence of -synuclein. We therefore identify a possible mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 and increased vulnerability to developing neurological dysfunction. These findings support a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 driven neurological manifestations, through use of NLRP3 inflammasome or ACE2 inhibitors.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human microglia through spike-ACE2 receptor interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients has increased during the course of the pandemic. As uncertainty existed regarding patients outcomes, early guidelines recommended against establishing new ECMO centers. We aimed to explore the epidemiology and outcomes of ECMO for COVID-19 related cardiopulmonary failure in five countries in the Middle East and India and to evaluate the results of ECMO in 5 new centers. METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter international, observational study conducted in 19 ECMO centers in five countries in the Middle East and India from March 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. We included patients with COVID-19 who received ECMO for refractory hypoxemia and severe respiratory acidosis with or without circulatory failure. Data collection included demographic data, ECMO-related specific data, pre-ECMO patient condition, 24 h post-ECMO initiation data, and outcome. The primary outcome was survival to home discharge. Secondary outcomes included mortality during ECMO, survival to decannulation, and outcomes stratified by center type. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven COVID-19 patients received ECMO support during the study period, of whom 78 (25%) were treated in the new ECMO centers. The median age was 45 years (interquartile range IQR 37C52), and 81% were men. New center patients were younger, were less frequently male, had received higher PEEP, more frequently inotropes and prone positioning before ECMO and were less frequently retrieved from a peripheral center on ECMO.

One of the main public health concerns of these emerging viruses is their sustained circulation among populations of immunologically na?ve, susceptible hosts. With every new viral emergence or reemergence, comes the call for rapid vaccine development and the induction of protective immunity through vaccination can be a powerful tool to prevent this concern by conferring protection to the population at risk. Vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention against emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or nonexistent. While the classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the advent of latest technologies in molecular techniques has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and immune responses and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated, and nonreplicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms. Together with a growing understanding in the biology of newly emerging virus diseases, a range of new vaccine strategies, vaccines against new and reemerging viruses may become a possibility.","output":"Recent developments in vaccines strategies against human viral pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present our development of load balancing algorithms to efficiently distribute and parallelize the running of large-scale complex agent-based modeling (ABM) simulators on High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources.

This study summarises periprocedural outcomes, 6-month, and early 2-year follow-up results following its introduction in an interventional neuroradiology centre. MATERIALS/METHODS This prospective, single-arm study assessed 20 aneurysms treated over a 40 month time period from time of procedure to 2 years post-procedure. Data collected included patient demographics, aneurysm features, and intraprocedural, 6-month, and 2-year post-procedural complications and angiographic features. RESULTS The mean age of the cohort was 59+-SD 7.7 years. 16 unruptured aneurysms were treated (pCONUS 2 13/16, pCONUS 2-HPC 3/16) and 4 ruptured aneurysms were treated with pCONUS 2-HPC. Unruptured cases received dual antiplatelet therapy pre- and post-procedure while ruptured cases received single antiplatelet therapy. 9/20 aneurysms were located at the MCA bifurcation and 7/20 at the basilar tip. The remaining 4 aneurysms were at various bifurcations in the anterior circulation. 11/20 were small (<10mm) and 9/20 were large (10-25mm). There was one periprocedural complication: a retroperitoneal bleed. There were no post-procedural intracranial complications or at 6-months follow-up. At 6 months, satisfactory occlusion was achieved in 94% of cases (15/16). There was one delayed death at 2-year follow-up from an unrelated cause.

Currently, the number of infections and deaths is still increasing rapidly. COVID-19 seriously threatens human health, production, life, social functioning and international relations. In the fight against COVID-19, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and big data technologies have played an important role in many aspects, including the rapid aggregation of multi-source big data, rapid visualization of epidemic information, spatial tracking of confirmed cases, prediction of regional transmission, spatial segmentation of the epidemic risk and prevention level, balancing and management of the supply and demand of material resources, and social-emotional guidance and panic elimination, which provided solid spatial information support for decision-making, measures formulation, and effectiveness assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control. GIS has developed and matured relatively quickly and has a complete technological route for data preparation, platform construction, model construction, and map production. However, for the struggle against the widespread epidemic, the main challenge is finding strategies to adjust traditional technical methods and improve speed and accuracy of information provision for social management. At the data level, in the era of big data, data no longer come mainly from the government but are gathered from more diverse enterprises. As a result, the use of GIS faces difficulties in data acquisition and the integration of heterogeneous data, which requires governments, businesses, and academic institutions to jointly promote the formulation of relevant policies. At the technical level, spatial analysis methods for big data are in the ascendancy. Currently and for a long time in the future, the development of GIS should be strengthened to form a data-driven system for rapid knowledge acquisition, which signifies that GIS should be used to reinforce the social operation parameterization of models and methods, especially when providing support for social management.","output":"COVID-19: Challenges to GIS with Big Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on dry-eye symptoms in a community-based population, a cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand.

Several studies defined the EEG with unique features, universality, and natural robustness to be used as a new track to prevent spoofing attacks. The EEG signals are a visual recording of the brain's electrical activities, measured by placing electrodes (channels) in various scalp positions. However, traditional EEG-based systems lead to high complexity with many channels, and some channels have critical information for the identification system while others do not. Several studies have proposed a single objective to address the EEG channel for person identification. Unfortunately, these studies only focused on increasing the accuracy rate without balancing the accuracy and the total number of selected EEG channels. The novelty of this paper is to propose a multiobjective binary version of the cuckoo search algorithm (MOBCS-KNN) to find optimal EEG channel selections for person identification. The proposed method (MOBCS-KNN) used a weighted sum technique to implement a multiobjective approach. In addition, a KNN classifier for EEG-based biometric person identification is used. It is worth mentioning that this is the initial investigation of using a multiobjective technique with EEG channel selection problem. A standard EEG motor imagery dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the MOBCS-KNN. The experiments show that the MOBCS-KNN obtained accuracy of 93.86% using only 24 sensors with AR20 autoregressive coefficients. Another critical point is that the MOBCS-KNN finds channels not too close to each other to capture relevant information from all over the head. In conclusion, the MOBCS-KNN algorithm achieves the best results compared with metaheuristic algorithms. Finally, the recommended approach can draw future directions to be applied to different research areas.","output":"EEG Channel Selection Using Multiobjective Cuckoo Search for Person Identification as Protection System in Healthcare Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 8 November Luis Arce and David Choquehuanca took office as the new president and vice-president of Bolivia, respectively.

The specific spatial structure of the indoor atrium makes the propagation of wireless signals different, which leads to most of the wireless signal-based floor positioning methods not working well in such an environment.

Besides, when using 3 s of test data rolled back, real-time effects could also be achieved, with an accuracy of 98.3%. This method can be used alone for real-time floor positioning, it is suitable for wireless fidelity signals, and it can provide a highly accurate initial floor reference for barometric or inertial methods.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major problem in patients discharged from acute care, but no data are available on the frailty risk in survivors of COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study (STROBE checklist). METHODS: At admission to sub-acute care in 2020, 236 COVID-19 patients (median age 77 years - interquartile range 68-83) were administered BRASS and classified into 3 levels of frailty risk. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also administered to measure physical function and disability. Differences between BRASS levels and associations between BRASS index and clinical parameters were analysed. RESULTS: The median BRASS index was 14.0 (interquartile range 9.0-20.0) denoting intermediate frailty (32.2%, 41.1%, 26.7% of patients exhibited low, intermediate and high frailty, respectively). Significant differences emerged between the BRASS frailty classes regards to sex, comorbidities, history of cognitive deficits, previous mechanical ventilation support and SPPB score.

Herein we assess the impact of implementing a protocol of more rigorous patient education, recovery room assessment for non-ICU admission, earlier mobilization and post-discharge communication for patients undergoing brain tumor surgery. METHODS: A case-control retrospective review was undertaken at a community hospital with a dedicated neurosurgery and otolaryngology team using minimally invasive surgical techniques, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and early post-operative imaging protocols. All patients undergoing craniotomy or endoscopic endonasal removal of a brain, skull base or pituitary tumor were included during two non-overlapping periods: March 2019CJanuary 2020 (pre-pandemic epoch) versus March 2020CJanuary 2021 (pandemic epoch with streamlined care protocol implemented). Data collection included demographics, preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status, tumor pathology, and tumor resection and remission rates. Primary outcomes were ICU utilization and hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were complications, readmissions and reoperations. FINDINGS: Of 295 patients, 163 patients were treated pre-pandemic (58% women, mean age 53.216 years) and 132 were treated during the pandemic (52% women, mean age 52.317 years). From pre-pandemic to pandemic, ICU utilization decreased from 92(54%) to 43(29%) of operations (p<0.001) and hospital LOS1 day increased from 21(12.2%) to 60(41.4%), p<0.001, respectively. For craniotomy cohort, median LOS was 2 days for both epochs; median ICU LOS decreased from 1 to 0 days (p<0.001), ICU use decreased from 73(80%) to 29(33%),(p<0.001). For endonasal cohort, median LOS decreased from 2 to 1 days; median ICU LOS was 0 days for both epochs; (p<0.001). There were no differences pre-pandemic versus pandemic in ASA scores, resection/remission rates, readmissions or reoperations. CONCLUSION: This experience suggests the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity for implementing a brain tumor care protocol to facilitate safely decreasing ICU utilization and accelerating discharge home without an increase in complications, readmission or reoperations. More rigorous patient education, recovery room assessment for non-ICU admission, earlier mobilization and post-discharge communication, layered upon a foundation of minimally invasive surgery, TIVA anesthesia and early post-operative imaging are possible contributors to these favorable trends.","output":"Streamlining brain tumor surgery care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The election microscopic examination of allantoic fluid from embryonated hens' eggs inoculated with tissue homogenates from organs of birds suffering with infectious bronchitis, reveals the presence of coronaviruses as early as the first or the second passage.

However, the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic continues due to the complex dynamics of human mobility. We develop a meta-population network model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The model takes into account the heterogeneity of mitigation strategies in different provinces of Canada, such as the timing of implementing NPIs, the human mobility in retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residences due to work and recreation. To determine which activity is most closely related to the dynamics of COVID-19, we use the cross-correlation analysis to find that the positive correlation is the highest between the mobility data of parks and the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 from February 15 to December 13, 2020. The average effective reproduction numbers in nine Canadian provinces are all greater than one during the time period, and NPIs have little impact on the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics in Ontario and Saskatchewan. After November 20, 2020, the average infection probability in Alberta became the highest since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. We also observe that human activities around residences do not contribute much to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The simulation results indicate that social distancing and constricting human mobility is effective in mitigating COVID-19 transmission in Canada. Our findings can provide guidance for public health authorities in projecting the effectiveness of future NPIs.","output":"Evaluating the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Canada based on mobile network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The present study investigated hospitalization data of patients receiving radiotherapy at Anhui Cancer Hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic and analyzed the impact of the epidemic on the clinical data of radiotherapy patients to provide references for the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy at other medical institutions Methods: The present study performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalization data of patients undergoing radiotherapy at the Radiation Department (from January 5 to March 19, 2020 according to the Chinese lunar calendar), who were defined as the epidemic group Hospitalization data for patients undergoing radiotherapy during the same period in 2019 were used as the control group for comparison with the epidemic group in terms of sex, age, distribution of various cancer types, hospitalization costs, average length of stay, completion rate of radiotherapy, treatment mode, and purpose of radiotherapy Results: A total of 79 and 115 patients received radiotherapy in the epidemic group and control group, respectively The number of patients who received radiotherapy declined 31 3% during the epidemic period The number of head and neck cancer patients who received radiotherapy was 36 (45 57%) in the epidemic group and 32 (27 83%) in the control group, which was a significant difference (chi2 =6 476, P=0 011) The proportions of patients with other types of cancer decreased, with no significant difference between the two groups (P&gt;0 05) No significant differences between the two groups were found in terms of other hospitalization data (P&gt;0 05) Conclusion: The total number of patients who received radiotherapy decreased during the epidemic period, but the proportion of head and neck cancer increased The epidemic had no significant effect on other hospitalization data While strengthening prevention and control measures, we should actively perform radiotherapy to ensure that cancer patients receive timely and safe treatment","output":"Impact of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic on Radiotherapy-Treated Patients with Cancer: A Single-Center Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food security is an important global public health issue, which will not only endanger consumers' life and health, but also cause serious food waste.

The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need for such tools. The inclusion of a statutory stay is a consistent feature in these reforms. This article examines the introduction of a restructuring moratorium in the UK as part of its recent debt restructuring reforms, introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020. Moratoria can be potentially very valuable in promoting the rescue of a company or business, but a balance is required between the benefits to the company and the creditors as a whole on the one hand and the rights of the individual creditors on the other. The success of the UKs restructuring moratorium in achieving a successful balance is assessed. Ultimately it is argued that the necessary balance does not seem to have been achieved and that the constraints and limitations placed on the moratorium, for creditor protection and other reasons, limit the potential value of this mechanism to a significant extent. Many companies will therefore have to continue to look elsewhere for protection from creditors seeking to disrupt their restructurings.","output":"An Assessment of the UK Restructuring Moratorium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Painting from the collection of the Walter Anderson Museum of Art, given by the Family of Walter Anderson in memory of Duncan Moran Songs, scripture, tributes, and remarks from Randall's close kin guided the service under the afternoon sun;the temperature was in the midnineties Doug then explained how the fourth bird represents the soul of the departed, opened that door of the cage, and the last one flew just as fast, joining the other three","output":"Front Porch"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim and Method: This perspective searches presents evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. Results: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.","output":"A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Comme pour les autres virus respiratoires, des cas de transmission intra-hospitalire de SRAS-CoV-2 ont t signals Dans le contexte dun taux dincidence lev du SRAS-CoV-2 dans la communaut, une augmentation significative du taux de transmission nosocomiale est attendue Ce risque pourrait mme tre plus lev dans les pays  faible revenu qui ont des systmes de sant plus fragiles, ceci en raison de facteurs tels que le retard de diagnostic, le manque dinfrastructures, de personnel qualifi, dunits disolement et de programmes de contr?le des infections Une meilleure comprhension des cha?nes de transmission du SRAS-CoV-2 et de limpact des mesures de contr?le dans les units de soins est essentielle pour ma?triser la pandmie Cette tude a pour lobjectif principal destimer la prvalence et lincidence des cas suspects ou confirms dinfection par le SRAS-CoV-2 chez le personnel soignant et les patients dans les h?pitaux participants Matriels et mthodes Il sagit dune tude prospective internationale, observationnelle en milieu hospitalier Il regroupera des patients et des professionnels de sant en France, au Brsil et dans les h?pitaux affilis au rseau GABRIEL, un rseau dinstitutions de recherche principalement situes dans les pays  faible revenu Les donnes dmographiques et cliniques sont collectes  laide de questionnaires con?us spcialement pour le projet Un couvillon nasopharyng est prlev et test pour le SRAS-CoV-2 par RT-PCR Une modlisation multivarie approprie sera utilise pour identifier les dterminants associs  la transmission nosocomiale Rsultats  la date du 12 juin 2020, 1478 patients COVID-19 confirms et 740 professionnels de sant ont t inclus par les 13 centres Fran?ais et 368 patients et professionnels de sant ont t recruts dans les centres internationaux Conclusion Les rsultats de ce projet fourniront des rsultats originaux qui pourraient : C constituer des preuves supplmentaires pour une meilleure comprhension de la dure de lincubation et de la priode contagieuse du SRAS-CoV-2 ;C renforcer les campagnes de prvention de la transmission nosocomiale du virus ;C ouvrir la voie  de nouvelles recommandations en termes de prvention ;C complter les recommandations existantes grace aux donnes supplmentaires concernant la transmission du virus, contribuant ainsi  amliorer les directives de contr?le pour des pidmies virales respiratoires similaires La communication des rsultats aux personnels soignants permettrait de les sensibiliser sur leur r?le dans la prvention de la propagation du virus dans les h?pitaux et dans leur environnement immdiat et pourrait tre utilise pour soutenir la couverture vaccinale si un vaccin devenait disponible","output":"tude multicentrique de la transmission nosocomiale du SRAS-CoV-2 : le projet NOSO-COR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The extent to which Point-of-care of ultrasound (POCUS) is used in different European helicopter EMS (HEMS) is unknown. We aimed to study the availability, perception, and future aspects of POCUS in the European HEMS using an online survey. METHOD: A survey about the use of POCUS in HEMS was conducted by a multinational steering expert committee and was carried out from November 30, 2020 to December 30, 2020 via an online web portal. Invitations for participation were sent via email to the medical directors of the European HEMS organizations including two reminding notes. RESULTS: During the study period, 69 participants from 25 countries and 41 different HEMS providers took part in the survey. 96% (n = 66) completed the survey. POCUS was available in 75% (56% always when needed and 19% occasionally) of the responding HEMS organizations. 17% were planning to establish POCUS in the near future. Responders who provided POCUS used it in approximately 15% of the patients. Participants thought that POCUS is important in both trauma and non-trauma-patients (73%, n = 46). The extended focused assessment sonography for trauma (eFAST) protocol (77%) was the most common protocol used. A POCUS credentialing process including documented examinations was requested in less than one third of the HEMS organizations. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the HEMS organizations in Europe are able to provide different POCUS protocols in their services. The most used POCUS protocols were eFAST, FATE and RUSH. Despite the enthusiasm for POCUS, comprehensive training and clear credentialing processes are not available in about two thirds of the European HEMS organizations.

Another important point is the stress and anxiety burden of COVID-19, which could affect quality of life. Patient education is vital due to the vulnerability of the topic to disinformation. To determine the areas needing improvements in patient education, and coping with stress, the burden of the problem should be pictured. From this point, we aimed to assess the perspectives and fears of cancer patients about COVID-19 with resources of COVID-19 knowledge with a questionnaire. A total of 250 adult cancer patients applied to the outpatient chemotherapy unit of Hacettepe University Cancer Center between May 27, 2020, and June 9, 2020, invited to answer a questionnaire of 13 multiple-choice questions with a return rate of 78% (195/250). Most patients acquired their knowledge about COVID-19 from television (91.9%). Social media were the second most common source of knowledge (43.8%) with a predilection in younger patients, nonsmokers, targeted therapy- or immunotherapy-treated patients, and breast cancer patients (>65 vs. <65 years of age, p = 0.057; nonsmoker vs. ever-smoker, p = 0.036; targeted therapy and immunotherapy vs. chemotherapy, p = 0.004; breast cancer vs. other cancers, p = 0.019). The percentage of patients seeing the information about COVID-19 as adequate (38.9%) or inadequate (35.1%) was similar. More than 90% of the patients had a moderate to severe degree of COVID-19 fear. In addition, 27.6% of patients had false knowledge of glove using as a protective measure for COVID-19. More than half of the patients had another wrong knowledge as the need for the supplements for COVID-19 protection. A significant percentage of patients (84.7%) expected some level of disruption in oncological care with the expectation of a moderate-to-severe disruption was more common in the advanced-stage patients (p = 0.026). In our experience, most cancer patients had a significant degree of fear about both infecting COVID-19 and the disruption of cancer care by COVID-19.

BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance and additionally infers whether causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time-series data of differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2768 genes and 31,945 directed edges (FDR  0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: Overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project. BETS is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/lujonathanh/BETS.","output":"Causal network inference from gene transcriptional time-series response to glucocorticoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cycling is a healthy habit; however, are its benefits outweighing risks when biking in heavily trafficked and air-polluted cities? Research involved studying contamination with traffic-related elements of dust collected from bike paths located in top trafficked cities of Europe in Poland. Human health risk was assessed via inhalation and ingestion pathways for adults and children. Bike path dust was heavily contaminated with Zn, Cd (Geoaccumulation index Igeo 4) and Pb (Igeo 3), sourced predominantly from nonexhaust car emissions. The concentrations of metals in dust decreased in the following descending order: Zn > Mn > Cu > Pb > Cr > Cd. A fractionation study revealed that Zn and Cd are almost entirely bioavailable (Mobility factor MF above 90%), causing hazards to humans and the environment. The highest congested intersections result in more TRAP-contaminated dust deposited on bike paths, which is easily resuspended, posing a health risk for cyclists or pedestrians. Avoiding cycling in proximity to heavily trafficked routes should be considered, when possible, as well as physical removal of dust by wet sweeping to limit dust resuspension.","output":"Adverse health and environmental outcomes of cycling in heavily polluted urban environments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe a hospital outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and summarize its clinical features and therapeutic approaches. METHODS The outbreak started with a SARS patient from the community, and a total of 96 people (76 women and 20 men, mean age (29.5 +/- 10.3) years, 93.8% of whom were health care workers) who had exposure to this source patient became infected in a short time. Clinical data in this cohort were collected prospectively as they were identified. RESULTS (1) The incubation period ranged from 1 to 20 (mean: 5.9 +/- 3.5) days. The duration of hospitalization was (17.2 +/- 8.0) days. (2) The initial temperature was (38.3 +/- 0.6) degrees C, while the highest was (39.2 +/- 0.6) degrees C (P < 0.001), with fever duration of (9.0 +/- 4.2) days. (3) Other most common symptoms included fatigue (93.8%), cough (85.4%), mild sputum production (66.7%), chills (55.2%), headache (39.6%), general malaise (35.4%) and myalgia (21.9%). (4) The radiographic changes were predominantly bilateral in the middle or lower lung zones. The number of affected lung fields was 1.2 +/- 0.8 on presentation, which increased to 2.9 +/- 1.4 after admission (P < 0.001). The interval from the beginning of fever to the onset of abnormal chest radiographs was (3.5 +/- 2.3) days, which increased in size, extent, and severity to the maximum (6.7 +/- 3.5) days later. The time before the lung opacities were basically absorbed was (14.9 +/- 7.8) days. (5) Leukopenia was observed in 67.7% of this cohort. The time between the onset of fever and leukopenia was (4.4 +/- 2.3) days, with the lowest white blood cell count of (2.80 +/- 0.72) x 10(9)/L. (6) The lowest arterial oxygen saturation was (94.8 +/- 3.1)% with supplementary oxygen. (7) Antibiotical therapies included tetracyclines (91.0%), aminoglycosides (83.3%), quinolones (79.2%); 18.8% of the patients received a combination of tetracyclines and aminoglycosides, while 11.5% received a combination of tetracyclines and quinolones, and 63.5% received a combination of tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and quinolones. Vancomycin was used in 13.5% of the patients. (8) 68.8% of the patients were treated with methylprednisolones for a mean interval of (4.9 +/- 2.4) days. The initial dose was (67.3 +/- 28.2) mg/d and the maximal dose was (82.4 +/- 30.5) mg/d. (9) Human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, antiviral drugs (oral ribavirin or oseltamivir) were used respectively in 68.6%, 46.9% and 92.7% of the patients. (10) Ninety-five patients (99.0%) had a complete clinical recovery, and only 1 patient (1.0%) died. CONCLUSIONS SARS appears to be quickly infectious and potentially lethal among health care workers, characterized by acute onset and rapid progression, and mostly bilateral lung involvement on chest radiographs. Proper administration of glucocorticosteroids seems to be of some benefits. Antibiotics, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, and antiviral drugs, although empirically, might be useful to shorten the clinical course.","output":"A hospital outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Guangzhou, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic caused a temporary halt to educational activities around the world.

However, multiple barriers exist to provide and access this therapy. LOCAL PROBLEM A rural Midwestern county struggled with increasing OUD and scant access to B-MAT. A nurse-led, community clinic had the potential to expand access to treatment but no support structure to provide it. METHODS In this quality improvement project, a one-group posttest-only design was used to assess treatment access, care quality, and patient characteristics. INTERVENTIONS An evidence-based, nurse led weekly B-MAT clinic using a low-threshold, chronic-care model for treatment of OUD. RESULTS The B-MAT clinic expanded county-wide access by 34% over seven months. A total of 23 patients were seen with 21 eligible for treatment with B-MAT. All nine patients with at least 90-day continuous treatment were retained in the program. Three quarters of patients had at least 30 days of active buprenorphine-naloxone coverage and 17% of all patients were lost to follow up. There were no induction-related adverse events, no fatalities, and one nonfatal overdose. In a chart review, 85% of patients met at least six of eight quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS This low-barrier approach to OUD expanded access to treatment and demonstrated a model stable enough to continue delivering care throughout the first 5 months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially among doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the mental health of medical professionals with nonmedical professionals in different European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. We also aimed to determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in 8 European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and inquired whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales32 (23.53)-21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors were completed by medical professionals. RESULTS: The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses, and 255 nonmedical professionals. Participants from France and the United Kingdom reported experiencing severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress more often compared to those from the other countries. Nonmedical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals, no significant link was reported between direct contact with patients with COVID-19 at work and anxiety, depression, or stress. \\"Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under control\\" caused the most amount of stress for health care professionals while \\"taking protective measures\\" was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety, and stress. Even though medical professionals exhibited less mental stress than nonmedical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","output":"Mental Health Among Medical Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Eight European Countries: Cross-sectional Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The speed with which biomedical researchers were able to identify and characterise COVID-19 was clearly due to prior research with other coronaviruses.

This article assesses whether academic interest in prior coronavirus research has translated into interest in the primary source material, using Mendeley reader counts for early academic impact evidence. The results confirm that SARS and MERS research 2008-2017 experienced anomalously high increases in Mendeley readers in April-May 2020. Nevertheless, studies learning COVID-19 lessons from SARS and MERS or using them as a benchmark for COVID-19 have generated much more academic interest than primary studies of SARS or MERS.

Effectiveness was measured by: (a) reduction in the number of patients admitted into the MERS-CoV tracking system; (b) identification of positive MERS-CoV cases; (c) containment of cross infectivity; and (d) increased efficiency in ED functioning. METHODS A retrospective chart review was carried out of all ED patients suspected of MERS-CoV during the height of the epidemic (August to October 2013). An algorithm was created on the basis of international guidelines to screen and triage suspected MERS-CoV patients. Once identified, patients were isolated, had a chest roentgenogram [chest radiography (CXR)] taken, and a nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was sent with sputum samples for testing. Patients with normal CXR and mild respiratory symptoms were discharged with home isolation instructions until nasopharyngeal and sputum PCR results were available. Patients with fever and acute respiratory distress, with or without abnormal CXR, were treated in the hospital until tests proved negative for MERS-CoV. RESULTS The protocol successfully reduced the number of patients who needed to be tested for MERS-CoV from 12,563 to 514, identified seven positive cases, and did not lead to apparent cross infectivity that resulted in serious illness or death. The protocol also increased the efficiency of ED and cut the turnaround time for nasopharyngeal swab and sputum results from 3 days to 1 day. CONCLUSION A highly protocolized surveillance system limited the impact of MERS-CoV on ED functioning by identifying and prioritizing high-risk patients.

We compared the baseline characteristics between subjects who were tested positive and negative of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identified risk factors which may be predictive of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 36603 subjects who were tested for COVID-19 infection via molecular assays at Sunway Medical Centre between Oct 1, 2020 and Jan 31, 2021, and consented to participate in this observation study were included for analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize the study cohort, whereas logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Among the reasons listed for COVID-19 screening were those who needed clearance for travelling, clearance to return to work, or clearance prior to hospital admission. They accounted for 67.7% of tested subjects, followed by the self-referred group (27.3%). Most of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic (62.6%), had no travel history (99.6%), and had neither exposure to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases (61.9%) nor exposure to patients under investigation (82.7%) and disease clusters (89.2%). Those who presented with loss of smell or taste (OR: 26.91; 95% CI: 14.81C48.92, p<0.001), fever (OR:3.97; 95% CI: 2.54C6.20, p<0.001), running nose (OR: 1.75; 95% CI:1.10C2.79, p = 0.019) or other symptoms (OR: 5.63; 95% CI:1.68C18.91, p = 0.005) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Coronaviruses were recently found to have little intrinsic disorder compared with many other virus families. Because intrinsically disordered regions have been proposed to be important for rewiring interactions between virus and host, we investigated the conservation of intrinsic disorder and secondary structure in coronaviruses in an evolutionary context. We found that regions of intrinsic disorder are rarely conserved among different coronavirus protein families, with the primary exception of the nucleocapsid. Also, secondary structure predictions are only conserved across 50C80% of sites for most protein families, with the implication that 20C50% of sites do not have conserved secondary structure prediction. Furthermore, nonconserved structure sites are significantly less constrained in sequence divergence than either sites conserved in the secondary structure or sites conserved in loop. Avoiding regions symptomatic of conformational flexibility such as disordered sites and sites with nonconserved secondary structure to identify potential broad-specificity antiviral targets, only one sequence motif (five residues or longer) remains from the >10,000 starting sites across all coronaviruses in this study.

However, to develop safe and effective extracellular vesicles-based therapies, it is crucial to gain fundamental knowledge on key cell biology mechanisms governing the extracellular vesicles-mediated cell-cell exchange of macromolecules. In this review, we present five aspects we believe are worth taking into account before considering extracellular vesicles as candidate vectors of pharmaceutical ingredients in cell-free therapies. ABSTRACT: The use of extracellular vesicles as cell-free therapy is a promising approach currently investigated in several disease models. The intrinsic capacity of extracellular vesicles to encapsulate macromolecules within their lipid bilayer membrane-bound lumen is a characteristic exploited in drug delivery to transport active pharmaceutical ingredients. Besides their role as biological nanocarriers, extracellular vesicles have a specific tropism towards target cells, which is a key aspect in precision medicine. However, the little knowledge of the mechanisms governing the release of a cargo macromolecule in recipient cells and the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) grade scale-up manufacturing of extracellular vesicles are currently slowing their application as drug delivery nanocarriers. In this review, we summarize, from a cell biologists perspective, the main evidence supporting the role of extracellular vesicles as promising carriers in drug delivery, and we report five key considerations that merit further investigation before translating Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) to clinical applications.","output":"Extracellular Vesicles as Promising Carriers in Drug Delivery: Considerations from a Cell Biologists Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose:Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) infection induces a prothrombotic state frequently associated with arterial ischemic strokes.

Our aim was to study the characteristics, treatment response, and outcomes of CVST occurring in association with COVID-19 (COVID-CVST) and the causal relationship with COVID-19.Methods:Data of 34 patients admitted in COVID facility and suffering from CVST and SARS-COV2 infection was studied with respect to their clinic-radiological and lab features, predisposing factors, treatment, and outcome.Observations and Results:15 patients with CVST were detected positive for COVID but remained asymptomatic for the same. 14 patients had CVST along with symptoms of COVID, whereas 5 had CVST after recovery from COVID, at an average of 18 days after COVID-19. 4 patients were on aspirin as prophylaxis against thrombo-embolic events. The number of males exceeded females (22:12), conventional risk factors were seen in only 8 patients (postpartum state-3, alcohol abuse-2 and anemia-3), whereas the majority (26/34) showed none of them.

CVST related to COVID occurs during or after a few weeks of COVID pneumonia and can also be seen in asymptomatic SARS-COV2 infection. COVID-19 can occur independently or in association with traditional thrombotic risk factors which increase the risk and severity of CVST in COVID.

While scholars agree on the consequences of ageism, there are disagreements on whether it is related to the demographics of aging, or societys cultural values. We test both hypotheses across 20 countries. METHOD: To circumvent the sampling limitations of survey studies, we used an 8-billion-word corpus, identified 3 synonyms with the highest prevalenceaged, elderly, old peopleand compiled the top 300 words (collocates) that were used most frequently with these synonyms for each of the 20 countries. The resulting 6,000 collocates were rated on an ageism scale by 2 raters to create an ageism score per country. Cultural dimension scoresPower Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Long-term Orientationwere taken from Hofstede, and demographicssize and speed of population agingcame from the World Development Indicators. RESULTS: Of the 20 countries, UK topped the ageism table, while Sri Lanka had the lowest ageism score.

The structural characterization of the neutralizing antibody (KNIH90-F1) complexed with RBD using X-ray crystallography revealed three critical epitopes (D509, R511, and E513) in the RBD region of the spike protein. Further investigation of MERS-CoV mutants that escaped neutralization by the antibody supported the identification of these epitopes in the RBD region.

Concomitant occurrence of TIO during pregnancy is rarer still. Our objective was to report a young patient with debilitating fractures diagnosed with TIO who became pregnant and subsequently had her tumor localized by gallium-68 (Ga-68) DOTATATE positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI). CASE REPORT: A 28 year-old woman with a 2-year history of stress fractures was found to have the following: (1) alkaline phosphatase level, 220 (reference range, 30-95) U/L; (2) phosphorus level, 2.1 (2.5-5.0) mg/dL; (3) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 level, <8 (18-72) pg/mL; (4) 24-hour urine phosphorus level, 0.5 (0.3-1.3) g; and (5) fibroblast growth factor 23 levels, 1241 (reference range, <180) RU/mL. The patient became pregnant, and at term, a cesarean delivery was performed. Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/MRI showed a 9-mm intracortical mass in the right fibular head and right femoral and bilateral calcaneal stress fractures. The fibular lesion was resected; pathology showed a 1.5-cm lesion with positive fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 staining. DISCUSSION: This patient with TIO had an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. TIO is typically caused by benign mesenchymal tumors. Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/computed tomography has been used for localizing tumors causing TIO, yet MRI has superior contrast resolution over computed tomography. Therefore, it is not surprising that Ga-68 PET/MRI successfully localized this patients tumor to the intracortical space of the fibular head and distinguished it from insufficiency fractures. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of phosphate treatment in a pregnant patient with TIO and the first report of a tumor-inducing TIO being localized by Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/MRI.","output":"Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia Localized and Excised After Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the article, I analyse responses of Polish primary care practitioners to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ecological comparisons were made between the survey years using descriptive statistics. For open-ended questions added to the 2020 survey, content analysis was applied. Demand for technicians increased which might be due to the expansion of their roles into activities that had been reserved for the pharmacist. Pharmacies reportedly would like to hire pharmacists to meet the demand for new services that pharmacists can provide. However, respondents articulated that this is not feasible under current economic pressures. This represents a lost opportunity for transformation in pharmacy that would establish pharmacists roles in the rapidly transforming health care value chain.

Imminently practical areas, such as pathology, have made traditional teaching based on conventional microscopy more flexible through the synergies of computational tools and image digitization, not only to improve teaching-learning but also to offer alternatives to repetitive and exhaustive histopathological analyzes. In this context, machine learning algorithms capable of recognizing histological patterns in kidney biopsy slides have been developed and validated with a view to building computational models capable of accurately identifying renal pathologies. In practice, the use of such algorithms can contribute to the universalization of teaching, allowing quality training even in regions where there is a lack of good nephropathologists. The purpose of this work is to describe and test the functionality of SmartPath&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, a tool to support teaching of glomerulopathies using machine learning. The training for knowledge acquisition was performed automatically by machine learning methods using the J48 algorithm to create a computational model of an appropriate decision tree.

Previous studies have examined structural and personal factors that relate to beliefs in conspiracy theories, yet those beliefs are not necessarily predictive of voting preferences. Our study addresses support for conspiratorial candidates by highlighting the role of anxiety. In particular, we draw attention to the distinction between general anxiety, which results from individual disposition and long-term structural forces;and situational anxiety, which arises from unexpected events that produce sudden shocks. We test the effects of general versus situational anxiety by leveraging the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using two survey experiments, one pre-COVIDand the other during the pandemic, we show that situational anxiety but not general anxiety is related to support for conspiratorial candidates. We also find that the effect of situational anxiety is not limited to conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, but generalizes to other types of conspiracy theory as well. We further find that people who support conspiratorial candidates do not view them as better equipped to solve the problem than non-conspiratorial ones.

Instead, vaccine-specific PCR provides a convenient tool to detect vaccine-like virus from a sample. Here we report the development and validation of a real-time RT-PCR specific for PRRSGard? , a newly available commercial PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine. Analytical specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR were evaluated and compared to a commercial PRRSV screening PCR (reference PCR). PRRSGard and reference PCRs did not cross-react with any of the 27 non-PRRSV swine pathogens. PRRSGard PCR did not cross-react with other PRRSV-2 vaccine viruses and 31 laboratory and field PRRSV-2 isolates representing various genetic lineages of PRRSV-2. PRRSGard and reference PCRs consistently detected up to 10-6 and 10-5 dilutions of PRRSGard vaccine virus, respectively. Based on testing serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, the 95% limit of detection of PRRSGard PCR was 16 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 36 and 7 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 37. Diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR was evaluated using 846 clinical samples (684 serum and 162 oral fluid samples). Compared to the reference screening PCR, diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and agreement of PRRSGard PCR were 95.34%, 98.85%, and 97.52% with cut-off CT value of 36 and 98.14%, 96.56%, and 97.16% with cut-off CT value of 37. In addition, PRRSGard PCR was able to detect PRRSGard vaccine virus in a sample even with the co-presence of another PRRSV strain. In summary, in contrast to a reference screening PCR that detects both vaccine and field PRRSV strains, PRRSGard PCR provides a convenient tool to specifically detect PRRSGard vaccine-like virus and to inform PRRSV vaccination protocols.","output":"Development and validation of a reverse transcription real-time PCR assay for specific detection of PRRSGard vaccine-like virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study describes the identification of one linear B-cell epitope on TMUV NS1 protein with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3G2 by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

In Germany, where I am located we have meanwhile ended the lockdown phase and started reopening. In this Editorial, I will try to describe the different aspects of the changes for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in this second phase of reopening. As numbers are the main basis for decision-making in this pandemic, I will try to give you a bit of background information on them first. As situations differ depending on the country you live in, you as a reader are probably in a different situation than I am right now, but hopefully you will still get some useful information for your daily routine. Although the numbers have improved a lot, the pandemic is still affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is again divided into 4 sections: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family/society member. As of a few days ago in Germany elective surgeries are allowed to be performed again. Although processes in the OR are very similar to what we have been used to, outside the OR a lot has changed. Testing and patients, maintaining distance, wearing face masks the entire day and so on is heavily affecting our practice. Patients are still nervous to visit the doctor and enter the Hospital although a lot of them are in great pain and have restricted mobility. Even testing all of them is not diffusing the anxiety completely. Objective information by the media, the politicians and us is important to overcome this anxiety. The part of interdisciplinary work became a lot smaller in this phase of reopening. Still pathways and regulations need to be developed but now Orthopaedic work is again the centre of our day in the Hospital. In our role as teacher, we are meanwhile used to all those webinars and digital options of education. However, getting used to it does not mean that we dont miss dearly the additional value of face to face discussions. We have further experienced that building up professional relationships and networks is not only based on facts but also on social factors. Something that we still miss. Reopening has improved life in families a lot. Grandchildren can meet their grandparents again and so on. This positive effect cannot be regarded high enough.

To date, Chilean cities have not formally implemented the approach. However, the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), a mandatory policy process, requires the inclusion of environmental issues in Chilean urban planning.

Demographic and clinical findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes were recorded. The patients who died during the ICU stay were compared to the survivors, and factors associated with mortality and LOS in the intensive care were evaluated. RESULTS: We reviewed 2350 files, and 218 patients (58.3% females) were included. The rate of mortality was 81.7%. The factors independently associated with a higher rate of mortality were the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score; the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), or inotropic support; and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). A tracheostomy and a blood transfusion were inversely associated with mortality.

Factors can be extracted using either nonparametric principal components or parametric Kalman filter and smoothing procedures, with the former being computationally simpler and robust against misspecification and the latter coping in a natural way with missing and mixed-frequency data, time-varying parameters, nonlinearities and non-stationarity, among many other stylized facts often observed in real systems of economic variables. This paper analyses the empirical consequences on factor estimation, in-sample predictions and out-of-sample forecasting of using alternative estimators of the DFM under various sources of potential misspecification. In particular, we consider factor extraction when assuming different number of factors and different factor dynamics. The factors are extracted from a popular data base of US macroeconomic variables, widely analyzed in the literature without consensus about the most appropriate model specification. We show that this lack of consensus is only marginally crucial when it comes to factor extraction, but it matters when the objective is out-of-sample forecasting.","output":"Dynamic factor models: Does the specification matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Neurexin-1 (NRXN1) is a membrane protein essential in synapse formation and cell signaling as a cell-adhesion molecule and cell-surface receptor.

The folding energy changes were calculated to estimate the effects of the 29,540 mutations of AlphaFold model on protein stability. The comparative study on the experimental and computationally predicted structures shows that these energy changes are highly correlated, demonstrating the reliability of the AlphaFold structure for the downstream bioinformatics analysis. The energy calculation revealed that some target mutations associated with SCZ and ASD could make the protein unstable. The study can provide helpful information for characterizing the disease-causing mutations and elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which the variations cause SCZ and ASD.

We explore the sensitivity of ongoing optical surveys searching for kNe and propose ways to optimize the choices of filters and survey depth to boost the detection efficiency for these faint and fast-evolving transients. In particular, we use kN models to explore the dependence on ejecta mass, geometry, viewing angle, wavelength coverage and source distance. Considering that the O3 LIGO/Virgo binary neutron star merger candidates were at distances about 5 times further than GW170817, we find that efficient $gri$ counterpart search would require reaching a limiting magnitude $m_{\\\\rm lim}=$ 23 mag, given the model phase-space.

This study was conducted to get insights into the enhanced frequency of COVID-19 infection in this disease. METHODS Using different bioinformatics tools, the expression and methylation patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were analyzed in healthy and malignant tissues, focusing on lung adenocarcinoma and data were correlated to clinical parameters and smoking history. RESULTS ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were heterogeneously expressed across 36 healthy tissues with the highest expression levels in digestive, urinary and reproductive organs, while the overall analysis of 72 paired tissues demonstrated significantly lower expression levels of ACE2 in cancer tissues when compared to normal counterparts. In contrast, ACE2, but not TMPRSS2, was overexpressed in LUAD, which inversely correlated to the promoter methylation. This upregulation of ACE2 was age-dependent in LUAD, but not in normal lung tissues. TMPRSS2 expression in non-neoplastic lung tissues was heterogeneous and dependent on sex and smoking history, while it was downregulated in LUAD of smokers. Cancer progression was associated with a decreased TMPRSS2, but unaltered ACE2. In contrast, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 of lung metastases derived from different cancer subtypes was higher than organ metastases of other sites. TMPRSS2, but not ACE2, was associated with LUAD patients' survival. CONCLUSIONS Comprehensive molecular analyses revealed a heterogeneous and distinct expression and/or methylation profile of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in healthy lung vs. LUAD tissues across sex, age and smoking history and might have implications for COVID-19 disease.","output":"Expression and clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 human targets in neoplastic and non-neoplastic lung tissues."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the widespread of COVID-19, online conferencing turns into the most popular application that connects people all over the world.

At some point after demonstration of substantial efficacy, placebo recipients should be offered the efficacious vaccine from their trial, which will occur before longer-term efficacy and safety are known. The absence of a placebo group could compromise assessment of longer-term vaccine effects. However, by continuing follow-up after vaccination of the placebo group, this study shows that placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy can be mathematically derived by assuming that the benefit of vaccination over time has the same profile for the original vaccine recipients and the original placebo recipients after their vaccination. Although this derivation provides less precise estimates than would be obtained by a standard trial where the placebo group remains unvaccinated, this proposed approach allows estimation of longer-term effect, including durability of vaccine efficacy and whether the vaccine eventually becomes harmful for some. Deferred vaccination, if done open-label, may lead to riskier behavior in the unblinded original vaccine group, confounding estimates of long-term vaccine efficacy. Hence, deferred vaccination via blinded crossover, where the vaccine group receives placebo and vice versa, would be the preferred way to assess vaccine durability and potential delayed harm. Deferred vaccination allows placebo recipients timely access to the vaccine when it would no longer be proper to maintain them on placebo, yet still allows important insights about immunologic and clinical effectiveness over time.","output":"A Deferred-Vaccination Design to Assess Durability of COVID-19 Vaccine Effect After the Placebo Group Is Vaccinated"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19.

Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making.

Although antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination is lower in solid organ transplant recipients, there has been no study assessing the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in OHT recipients. Objective: To assess the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination and associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical outcomes in a large population of adult OHT recipients. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study examined data from a US heart transplant program at a single center for all adult recipients of OHT who were followed up from January 15, 2021, through January 31, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths between vaccinated vs unvaccinated adult recipients of OHT. Results: A total of 436 patients who received OHT were included in the study, of which 106 patients were infected with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 54 (17) years; 303 (69.5%) were men and 133 (30.5%) were women. There were 366 patients in the vaccinated cohort with 72 COVID-19 infections (19.7%), 15 hospitalizations (4.1%), 4 ICU admissions (1.1%), and 3 deaths (0.8%). There were 70 patients in the unvaccinated cohort with 34 COVID-19 infections (48.6%), 10 hospitalizations (14.3%), 3 ICU admissions (4.3%), and 3 deaths (4.3%). COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection (risk ratio [RR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.30-0.56), hospitalization (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.14-0.61), and death (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.82). Among the 366 vaccinated OHT recipients, there was no echocardiographic evidence of graft dysfunction, clinically significant rejection, or allosensitization at 6 months after they received the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with OHT who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at greater risk of severe infection and death compared with immunocompetent individuals. COVID-19 vaccination was associated with fewer COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, with no heart transplant-specific adverse events.

Despite the changes in the aetiologies, injuries remained frequent throughout the pandemic. Evidence from the COVID-19 period suggest a decrease in road traffic crashes, work and leisure injuries and a noteworthy increase in interpersonal violence and self-harm. These different causes and patterns of injury have brought about changes in the clinical characteristics and demand of health services. Hospitals have experienced organisational constraints with redeployment of medical staff in different units and suspension of non-emergency medical activity. At the same time, new priorities have been set for hospital admissions and new protocols have been developed to guide the emergencies' pathways and clinical/health services approach. Non-essential medical treatment has been postponed with increased risk of delayed treatment, late recovery and mortality from causes different than COVID-19, including injury complications. The impact of COVID-19 in the provision and coverage of health services needs to be urgently mitigated, including the treatment and rehabilitation from physical and psychological effects of untreated injuries. This is expected to place additional pressure on the health systems and increase health care costs. Hospital discharge data are a potentially valuable source of information for injury prevention planning yet there is much work to be done on the improvement of hospital and injury data quality. The workshop aims to discuss the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of injuries, as well as the barriers of maintaining (or even improving) data quality during the different phases of the pandemic. The workshop will further discuss hospital demand and will identify the challenges for the health systems in handling the complex needs of vulnerable patients under serious restrictions. The workshop will also highlight the legal and regulatory measures taken and their level of efficacy in promoting free movement of workers within EU but also the right to work guaranteed under ECHR and ILO Conventions and Declaration. The high human and societal costs as well as inequalities of injury mortality and burden will be highlighted based on comparisons with long-term trends. The workshop will contribute to the identification of evidence-informed strategies and will promote effective planning and optimization of health services response for future pandemics. KEY MESSAGES: The new map of injuries resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect health care targets and priorities. Evidence-informed strategies are necessary to capture the magnitude and address the after-COVID effects and the health burden of untreated conditions.","output":"9.L.

Mucormycosis (black fungus) is such a type of opportunistic infection caused by fungi belonging to the Mucorales family. DM is the most prominent risk factor for mucormycosis. Excessive blood sugar and decreased insulin levels lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a devastating complication of DM that can be fatal if left untreated. METHODS: Diabetic ketoacidosis is more common in type 1 diabetic patients, although it can also be fall in type 2 diabetic patients. DKA occurs when the body lacks enough insulin to allow blood sugar to enter the cells and is used for energy. Instead, the liver breaks down fat for fuel producing chemicals known as ketones in the process. RESULTS: When too many ketones are created too quickly, they can reach dangerously high levels in the body. Mucormycosis is a rare but serious infectious disease that requires medication or surgical removal. CONCLUSION: The confluence of diabetes and COVID-19 makes managing mucormycosis a serious and dead issue. Although the effectiveness of prophylactic antifungal therapy has yet to be demonstrated, hyperglycemia control appears to be the most important step in managing mucormycosis in DKA patients.","output":"Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), a Leading Risk Factor for Mucormycosis (Black Fungus), During the Era of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19): An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past two decades, several coronavirus (CoV) infectious clones have been engineered, allowing for the manipulation of their large viral genomes (~30 kb) using unique reverse genetic systems.

PARTICIPANTS: Parents living in the Netherlands with a sick or injured child during the lockdown periods from March to June 2020 and from December 2020 to February 2021 were eligible to participate. OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to analyse family and childrens characteristics, parents response to a sick or injured child, and the perceived impact of the lockdown on childs severity of illness and treatment reported by parents. Analyses were stratified for children with and without chronic conditions. RESULTS: Of the 105 parents who completed the survey, 83% reported they would have sought medical help before lockdown compared with 88% who did seek help during lockdown for the same specific medical problem. Parents reported that changes in health services affected their childs severity of illness (31%) and their treatment (39%), especially for children with chronic conditions. These changes included less availability of healthcare services and long waiting lists, which mostly led to worsening of the childs illness.

Molecular evidence for the transmission of two zoonotic RNA viruses at the human-monkey interface in Rajasthan forests is presented here: a) the apathogenic Simian Foamy Viruses (SFV), and b): Influenza A viruses (IAV)-like virus, etiologic agent for human flu infecting wild Indian rhesus monkeys inhabiting Rajasthan forests. The data provide critical information on ecology and evolution of viruses of Public Health relevance. During replication, viral genomes mutate along the transmission route to adapt to the new hosts, generating new variants that are likely to have properties different from the founder viruses.

In this work we sought to develop a real-time, in vivo, high-throughput assay that would allow for quantification of pathogen growth. To establish such a system, we worked with the broad host-range, highly destructive, soil-borne oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora capsici.

DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSION: The socioeconomic and health aspects help predict fears. Thus, the government should prioritize these variables in implementing policies. The government's credibility and communication systems can also reduce fears of contracting COVID\\\\19. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A pilot focus group of COVID\\\\19Crecuperated individuals and some members of our interest groups were consulted in the design stage of the study; this helped in constructing the survey questions. Additionally, three independent individuals volunteered to read and comment on the draft manuscript.","output":"Factors explaining the fear of being infected with COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Le vieillissement dans la population Tunisienne est un phnomne proccupant et devenu de plus en plus acclr [1] Cette priode de vie est riche en facteurs depressognes Nous rapportons dans ce travail, la frquence de la dpression chez les sujets ags hospitaliss en service de rhumatologie en priode du coronavirus COVID-19 Patients et mthodes Cest une tude transversale, descriptive faite en deux semaines au cours de la priode COVID-19 Ltude a t porte sur 50 patients, ags de plus de 60 ans, hospitaliss dans le service de rhumatologie de lh?pital militaire de Tunis Le score utilis dans ce travail est Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, Zigmond et Snaith, 1983) Cest un autoquestionnaire facile et rapide, utilis dans la littrature internationale Il value ltat anxieux et dpressif des patients suivis pour une pathologie somatique Ce score est fait de 14 items cots de 0  3 Sept questions valuant lanxit et sept autres valuant la dpression, do lobtention de deux scores avec une note maximale de 21 pour chacun Si le score est infrieur  7 : pas de symptomatologie, entre 8 et 10 la symptomatologie est douteuse et suprieur  11 la symptomatologie est certaine Rsultats Cette tude est faite de 50 patients, 36 sont de sexe fminin et 14 de sexe masculin Lage moyen tait de 72 ans avec des extrmes de 60 et 90 ans Trente-neuf patients sont maris, 6 sont veufs, 4 sont divorcs et 1 patient est clibataire Le motif dhospitalisation tait une atteinte articulaire priphrique handicapante dans 58 %, une ostoporose dans 22 % des cas, une lombalgie dans 12 % des cas et une spondylarthrite dans 8 % des cas La dure dhospitalisation tait entre 1 et 15 jours chez 60 % des patients, entre 16 et 30 jours chez 36 % des patients et au-del de 30 jours chez 4 % des malades Les antcdents taient comme suit : hypertension artrielle chez 60 % des cas, un diabte chez 46 % des cas et des antcdents psychiatrique chez 10 % des patients Le score HADS a montr que 44 % des patients ont une symptomatologie dpressive certaine, dans 10 % la symptomatologie tait douteuse et 46 % tait indemne de symptomatologie dpressive Cette dpression tait plus frquente chez les sujets ayant une tranche dage entre 70 et 79 ans Discussion La dpression est aujourdhui un des problmes de sant public le plus frquent chez les sujets ags, souvent mconnu, et insuffisamment trait devant la symptomatologie atypique Dans notre srie, la prvalence dune dpression certaine est de 44 % ce qui rejoint les donnes de la littrature avec une prvalence comprise entre 2 et 61 % [2] La pandmie du COVID-19 constitue une ralit particulire et inhabituelle Celle-ci peut affecter les personnes sur le plan physique, mais galement sur le plan psychologique En effet, dans un tel contexte, de nombreuses personnes vivront des ractions de stress, danxit et de dprime Lassociation de plusieurs facteurs comme le vieillissement, une priode de stresse par un virus inconnu, le COVID-19, et un sjour dans un milieu hospitalier, les pathologies sous-jacentes contribue facilement  une dpression Conclusion La psychogriatrie est de plus en plus dveloppe au cours de la dernire dcennie La prise en charge des troubles mentaux a bnfici du dveloppement dquipes griatriques multidisciplinaires capables davoir une approche globale de la personne age afin dviter les complications","output":"Dpression et COVID-19 chez les sujets ags hospitaliss en rhumatologie : une srie de 50 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokine release and macrophage activation contribute to immunopathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the pandemic on the workers of a hospital located in one of the most affected areas of Madrid (Alcal de Henares) using a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA). METHODS We conducted a seroprevalence survey between June 25th and July 31st, 2020, over hospital workers from our institution. This study population was previously analyzed using a diagnostic approach which consisted of PCR and a serologic rapid test. For the present survey, prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was studied using chemiluminescence. We analyzed the prevalence in healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (nHCW). Information about professional category, use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and previous COVID-19 contacts was collected to determine the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables) and the two-tailed Fisher's exact test (categorical variables). Risk factors for seropositivity were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 2,219 workers were included and 847 of them (38.2%) presented IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, being seroprevalence significantly higher for HCW (39.3%) than for nHCW (30.7%, p=0.006). We found no differences regarding positivity rates compared with the first diagnostic approach for symptomatic and asymptomatic workers, or infected workers per professional category. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of PPE (protective, OR=0.65; 95%CI: 0.48-0.89; p<0.001) and previous contact with COVID-19 patients (risk factor, OR=1.93; 95%CI: 1.37-2.72; p<0.001) were independent factors that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS More than 38% of our workers presented IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. We found no differences in the positivity rates between diagnostic approaches. The use of PPE (protective) and previous contact with COVID-19 patients (risk factor) were associated with infection.","output":"[SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among workers in a hospital in Madrid.]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were discovered only 16 years ago, they have already taken us from heaven to hell as we learned that apart from beneficial trapping of pathogens, they cause, or contribute to, numerous disorders.

This has driven many psychotherapists and other mental health professionals towards telepsychotherapy, relying on online consultations to provide continuity of care. However, the adoption of telepsychotherapy required major adaptations from both mental health professionals and patients. This study set out to explore the predictors of the use of online consultations and the perceived level of comfort using telepsychotherapy in a sample of 73 Lebanese mental health professionals. Data was collected via online dissemination of a survey. Results show that 82% of participants made use of online consultations in the past few days, reflecting the adaptation of Lebanese mental health professionals to the atypical newly imposed situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequent lockdown. Having previous experience in the use of online consultations and perceived level of telepresence were significant predictors of the level of comfort of mental health professionals in the execution online consultations.

We aimed to determine presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO), thrombus length, infarction diameter, and occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation in AIS patients with preceding DOAC as compared to VKA therapy. METHODS Using a prospectively collected cohort of AIS patients, we performed univariate and multivariable regression analyses regarding imaging outcomes. Additionally, we provide a sensitivity analysis for the subgroup of patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation. RESULTS We included AIS in patients with preceding DOAC (N = 75) and VKA (N = 61) therapy, median age 79 (IQR 70-83), 39% female. Presence of any LVO between DOAC and VKA patients (29.3% versus 37.7%, P = 0.361), and target LVO for endovascular therapy (26.7% versus 27.9%, P = 1.0) was equal with a similar occlusion pattern. DOAC as compared to VKA were associated with a similar rate of target LVO for EVT (aOR 0.835, 95% CI 0.368-1.898). The presence of multiple lesions and characteristics of the thrombus were similar in DOAC and VKA patients. Acute ischemic lesion diameter in real world patients was equal in patients taking DOAC as compared to VKA. Lesion diameter in VKA patients (median 13 mm, IQR 6-26 versus median 20 mm, IQR 7-36, P = 0.001), but not DOAC patients was smaller in the setting of confirmed therapeutic VKA. The frequency of radiological hemorrhagic transformation and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in OAC patients was low. Sensitivity analysis considering only patients with confirmed therapeutic anticoagulation did not change any of the results. CONCLUSION Preceding DOAC treatment showed equal rates of LVO and infarct size as compared to VKA in AIS patients. This study adds to the knowledge of imaging findings in AIS patients with preceding anticoagulation.","output":"MRI characteristics in acute ischemic stroke patients with preceding direct oral anticoagulant therapy as compared to vitamin K antagonists."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer prognosis is an essential goal for early diagnosis, biomarker selection, and medical therapy. In the past decade, deep learning has successfully solved a variety of biomedical problems. However, due to the high dimensional limitation of human cancer transcriptome data and the small number of training samples, there is still no mature deep learning-based survival analysis model that can completely solve problems in the training process like overfitting and accurate prognosis. Given these problems, we introduced a novel framework called SAVAE-Cox for survival analysis of high-dimensional transcriptome data. This model adopts a novel attention mechanism and takes full advantage of the adversarial transfer learning strategy. We trained the model on 16 types of TCGA cancer RNA-seq data sets. Experiments show that our module outperformed state-of-the-art survival analysis models such as the Cox proportional hazard model (Cox-ph), Cox-lasso, Cox-ridge, Cox-nnet, and VAECox on the concordance index. In addition, we carry out some feature analysis experiments. Based on the experimental results, we concluded that our model is helpful for revealing cancer-related genes and biological functions.","output":"A Novel Attention-Mechanism Based Cox Survival Model by Exploiting Pan-Cancer Empirical Genomic Information."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sri Lanka diagnosed its first local case of COVID-19 on 11 March 2020. The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of Sri Lanka's health system. METHODS: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R0 values after lifting lockdown restrictions. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population at risk; number of identified and recovered cases; percentage identified; infectious period; R0 or doubling time; percentage critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. RESULTS: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0 = 3.32, 95% CI 1.85-5.41) and from Day 18-30 (R = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.93-1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lifting lockdown restrictions, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days, signaled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15-22) on Day 14 after lifting lockdown restrictions. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lifting lockdown restrictions, transmission should not exceed R = 1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.","output":"An epidemiological model to aid decision-making for COVID-19 control in Sri Lanka"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on the relationship between drugs and targets is the key to precision medicine. Ion channel is a kind of important drug targets. Aiming at the urgent needs of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment and drug development, this paper designed a mixed graph network model to predict the affinity between ion channel targets of COVID-19 and drugs. According to the simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) code of drugs, firstly, the atomic features were extracted to construct the point sets, and edge sets were constructed according to atomic bonds. Then the undirected graph with atomic features was generated by RDKit tool and the graph attention layer was used to extract the drug feature information. Five ion channel target proteins were screened from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of NCBI database, and the protein features were extracted by convolution neural network (CNN). Using attention mechanism and graph convolutional network (GCN), the extracted drug features and target features information were connected. After two full connection layers operation, the drug-target affinity was output, and model was obtained. Kiba dataset was used to train the model and determine the model parameters. Compared with DeepDTA, WideDTA, graph attention network (GAT), GCN and graph isomorphism network (GIN) models, it was proved that the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed model was decreased by 0.055, 0.04, 0.001, 0.046, 0.013 and the consistency index (CI) was increased by 0.028, 0.016, 0.003, 0.03 and 0.01, respectively. It can predict the drug-target affinity more accurately. According to the prediction results of drug-target affinity of SARS-CoV-2 ion channel targets, seven kinds of small molecule drugs acting on five ion channel targets were obtained, namely SCH-47112, Dehydroaltenusin, alternariol 5-o-sulfate, LPA1 antagonist 1, alternariol, butin, and AT-9283.These drugs provide a reference for drug repositioning and precise treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Drug repositioning of COVID-19 based on mixed graph network and ion channel."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) is one of the most distinctive plants, characterized by excellent resistance to various environmental conditions.

Overall, there were 216 cases in the CMPP group and 88 cases in the RMPP group. Venous blood was collected, and serum ferritin (SF), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), neutrophil count/lymphocyte count (NLR), and other indexes were measured. A single factor analysis, an ROC curve analysis, and a logistic regression analysis were used to determine the independent risk factors of RMPP and find combination of initial markers for RMPP. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the RMPP group and the CMPP group in mean SF (529.82 [357.86] vs. 147.22 [122.68] ng/mL), LDH (522.08 [389.08] vs. 286.85 [101.02] U/L), D-dimer (6.65 [5.66] vs. 1.46 [2.45] g/mL), CRP (62.80 [52.15] vs. 19.03 [24.50] mg/L), PCT (0.80 [2.61] vs. 0.16 [0.44]) ng/mL, and NLR (4.14 [2.52] vs. 2.62 [1.55]), with P < 0.05 for each comparison.

DESIGN: A retrospective, qualitative study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We collected 382 596 records of weather data with four meteorological factors, namely, average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and air visibility, and 15 192 records of epidemic data with daily new confirmed case counts (1 587 209 confirmed cases in total) in nearly 500 areas worldwide from 20 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. Epidemic data were modelled against weather data to find a model that could best predict the future outbreak. RESULTS: Significant correlation of the daily new confirmed case count with the weather 3 to 7 days ago were found. SARS-CoV-2 is easy to spread under weather conditions of average temperature at 5 to 15C, relative humidity at 70% to 80%, wind speed at 1.5 to 4.5 m/s and air visibility less than 10 statute miles. A short-term model with these four meteorological variables was derived to predict the daily increase in COVID-19 cases; and a long-term model using temperature to predict the pandemic in the next week to month was derived. Taken China as a discovery dataset, it was well validated with worldwide data. According to this model, there are five viral transmission patterns, 'restricted', 'controlled', 'natural', 'tropical' and 'southern'. This model's prediction performance correlates with actual observations best (over 0.9 correlation coefficient) under natural spread mode of SARS-CoV-2 when there is not much human interference such as epidemic control.

For decades, spatial scientists have researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable, and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a place connectivity index (PCI) based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a multiscale, spatiotemporal-continuous, and easy-to-implement measurement. The proposed PCI, established and demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10% penetration in the US population) and Facebooks social connectedness index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found that PCI has a strong state boundary effect and that it generally follows the distance decay effect, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of a contagious disease (e.g., COVID-19), and 2) modeling hurricane evacuation destination choices. The methodological and contextual knowledge of PCI, together with the launched visualization platform and data sharing capability, is expected to support research fields requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.","output":"Measuring Place Connectivity Using Big Social Media Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-contact infrared thermometers (NCITs) are being widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic as a temperature-measurement tool for screening and isolating patients in healthcare settings, travelers at ports of entry, and the general public. To understand the accuracy of NCITs, a clinical study was conducted with 1113 adult subjects using six different commercially available NCIT models. A total of 60 NCITs were tested with 10 units for each model. The NCIT-measured temperature was compared with the oral temperature obtained using a reference oral thermometer. The mean difference between the reference thermometer and NCIT measurement (clinical bias) was different for each NCIT model. The clinical bias ranged from just under ? 0.9 C (under-reporting) to just over 0.2 C (over-reporting). The individual differences ranged from ? 3 to + 2 C in extreme cases, with the majority of the differences between ? 2 and + 1 C. Depending upon the NCIT model, 48% to 88% of the individual temperature measurements were outside the labeled accuracy stated by the manufacturers. The sensitivity of the NCIT models for detecting subjects temperature above 38 C ranged from 0 to 0.69. Overall, our results indicate that some NCIT devices may not be consistently accurate enough to determine if subjects temperature exceeds a specific threshold of 38 C.

This study aimed to estimate the willingness to be vaccinated and the socio-demographic and motivational correlates among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in French Guiana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 22 to March 26, 2021 among a sample of HCWs in French Guiana. They were asked about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake and vaccines attitudes. Factors associated with willingness to get vaccinated have been analyzed with ordinal logistic regression, using Stata software. Results: A total of 579 HCWs were interviewed, including 220 physicians and 200 nurses most often working in hospital (54%) or in the liberal sector (22%). Overall, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24.3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 11.2% were unsure. HCWs were more willing to get vaccine if they were older, were worried about COVID-19 and were confident in the management of epidemic. Conversely, participants were less likely to have been vaccinated or willing to if they were nurses or of another non-medical profession, born in French Guiana, feared adverse effects, or if they did not trust pharmaceutical companies and management of the epidemic by authorities. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern among HCWs in French Guiana when considering the current active epidemic with Gamma VOC. General vaccine hesitancy and concerns about future side effects in particular represent important barriers. Low confidence in government and science are significant in COVID-19 vaccine refusal among non-medical staffs. Public health messaging with information on vaccine safety should be tailored to address these concerns. The specific challenges of HCWs from French Guiana must be taken into account.","output":"Attitudes towards the COVID-19 Vaccine and Willingness to Get Vaccinated among Healthcare Workers in French Guiana: The Influence of Geographical Origin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented response from the sequencing community. Leveraging the sequence data from more than 140,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we study mutation rates and selective pressures affecting the virus. Understanding the processes and effects of mutation and selection has profound implications for the study of viral evolution, for vaccine design, and for the tracking of viral spread. We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G U and C U, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic). We observe an effect of genomic context on mutation rates, but the effect of the context is overall limited. Although previous studies have suggested selection acting to decrease U content at synonymous sites, we bring forward evidence suggesting the opposite.","output":"Mutation Rates and Selection on Synonymous Mutations in SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides a comparative analysis of laboratory testing data of deceased and surviving patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to evaluate their association with disease outcomes.

In this study we analyse the propensity to stop traveling by public transport during COVID-19 for the holders of 1.8 million smart cards in Stockholm, Sweden, for the spring and autumn of 2020. We suggest two models for explaining the change in travel pattern, linking socioeconomic data per area and travel data with the probability to stop traveling. The first model analyses the impact of the socioeconomic factors: age;income;education level;gender;housing type;population density;country of origin;and employment level. The results show that decreases in public transport use are linked to areas with a population of high socioeconomic status (e.g. income levels, owned houses and high employment levels). The second model groups the investigated areas into five distinct clusters based on the socioeconomic data: Rural, Working Class, Impoverished, Garden Suburbs and Central. During spring, residents in the Rural group were most likely to continue traveling, followed by the Impoverished, Working Class, Garden Suburbs and Central. During fall the differences between the groups diminished, and especially the Impoverished group reduced their public transport use to a similar level as the Garden Suburbs group. The results show that socioeconomic status affect the change in behaviour during the pandemic and that exposure to the virus is determined by citizens socioeconomic class. Furthermore, the results can guide policy into tailoring public transport supply to where the need is, instead of assuming that e.g. crowding is equally distributed within the public transport system in the event of a pandemic.","output":"Who Continued Traveling by Public Transport During COVID-19?

Here, we present a three-dimensional (3D) nanofluidic device for rapid and multiplexed detection of viral antibodies. The device is designed to size-dependently immobilize particles from a multi-particle mixture at predefined positions in nanochannels through capillary forces only, resulting in distinct trapping lines. We show that individual lines can be used as an on-chip fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay for multiplexed detection of serological immunoglobulin antibodies against viral proteins with high sensitivity. Further device versatility is exhibited by on-bead color multiplexing for simultaneous detection of IgG and IgM antibodies in convalescent human serum and by concurrent detection of anti-spike (SARS-CoV-2) and anti-hemagglutinin (Influenza A) antibodies.

However, literature on mental health effects including post-traumatic consequences of the pandemic is scarce. Objective: The current study examined post-traumatic stress (PTS), growth (PTG), and depreciation (PTD) during the pandemic, and explored factors associated with these mental health outcomes in an adult community sample from Turkey. Method: A total of 685 participants responded to an online survey that gathered data on sociodemographic characteristics, financial loss during the pandemic, time spent at home and frequency of social media use, perception of COVID-related risks, stress, and event-related rumination. Data analysis included correlation and regression analyses. Results: Results showed that PTS, PTG, and PTD were positively correlated with each other. Younger age and being single were associated with higher PTS and PTD, and lower education levels predicted all three outcomes. Experiencing financial loss during the pandemic, more frequent social media use to follow COVID-related news and posts, and longer time spent at home during the pandemic were associated with higher PTS. Anticipating financial risks during the pandemic were associated with all outcomes while anticipating health-related risks due to COVID-19 and perceived stress levels predicted PTS and PTD but not PTG. Both intrusive and deliberate rumination were associated with higher levels of PTS and PTD, and PTG was predicted solely by deliberate rumination. Moreover, provisional PTSD was indicated in 47.9% of the participants. Membership to the provisional PTSD group was predicted by age, level of education, time spent on social media, anticipating COVID\\\\19Crelated health risks, perceived stress, and event-related rumination.

The limitation of ICU beds has been one of the major burdens in the management around the world; therefore, clinical strategies to avoid ICU admission are needed. We aimed to describe the influence of tocilizumab on the need of transfer to ICU or death in non-critically ill patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of 171 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that did not qualify as requiring transfer to ICU during the first 24h after admission to a conventional ward, were included. The criteria to receive tocilizumab was radiological impairment, oxygen demand or an increasing of inflammatory parameters, however, the ultimate decision was left to the attending physician judgement. The primary outcome was the need of ICU admission or death whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 77 patients received tocilizumab and 94 did not. The tocilizumab group had less ICU admissions (10.3% vs. 27.6%, P=0.005) and need of invasive ventilation (0 vs 13.8%, P=0.001). In the multivariable analysis, tocilizumab remained as a protective variable (OR: 0.03, CI 95%: 0.007-0.1, P=0.0001) of ICU admission or death. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab in early stages of the inflammatory flare could reduce an important number of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation.

In the context of the public health emergency, historically marginalized communities such as persons with disabilities run the risk of feeling more vulnerable, suffering deprivations, discrimination in screening plans for care, and prejudices and stigmas that influence decision-making in healthcare and exacerbate preexisting inequalities, making this group more susceptible to illness and lack of social protection. Although persons with disabilities have been acknowledged as a risk group for COVID-19, governments have been slow to develop plans to fight COVID-19 for this population.

In rhesus macaques, early initiation of remdesivir therapy prevented pneumonia and lowered viral loads in the lung, but viral loads increased in the nasal passages five days after therapy. We developed mathematical models to explain these results. We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. We also hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung.

Methods: In our study, 652 patients in Wuhan Designated Hospital were recruited, and their clinical and laboratory findings were extracted and analyzed. Results: The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 23 days [interquartile range (IQR), 18 days] from symptom onset. Compared to patients with early viral RNA clearance (&lt;23 days after illness onset), we found that patients with late viral RNA clearance (23 days) had a higher proportion of clinical features, as follows: symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and sputum production;comorbidities, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, uremia, chronic liver disease, anemia, hyperlipidemia, and bilateral lung involvement;complications, such as liver injury;delayed admission to hospital;laboratory parameters at baseline, including higher eosinophils, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lower hemoglobin;and less treatment with arbidol, chloroquine, or any antivirals. After generalized linear regression, prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was independently associated with younger age;delayed admission to hospital;symptoms including fever, shivering, and sputum production;comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, anemia, hyperlipidemia, uremia, and lung involvement;and higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid, and cholesterol levels at baseline.

Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remain unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents, mainly if protracted for long periods. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the most relevant data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the review's methodology and the characteristics and methodological quality of the retrieved studies. METHODS: We searched on 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies have been included; 42 assessed the effect of social distances measure of physical health and 27 on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The 32.4% of the studies has been conducted in the UK, 20.3% in Italy, 12.5% in China, 10.9% in developing countries and 9.4% in the US. 37.5% of the studies were cohort studies, 40.6% cross sectional surveys, 19.7% uncontrolled studies and 1 was a modeling study. 59.6% of the studies has been rated as high quality. The most important weakness of the cross-sectional surveys and uncontrolled studies was the scarce representativeness of the sample while 96% of the cohort studies were judged as high quality. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of acceptable quality studies have been published during the first months of pandemic to assess the impact of school closure and social distances measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths. This highlights the relevance of the topic and the need to assess carefully the balance between harms and benefits of such measures in terms of actual reduction of transmission and youths' psychological and physical harms. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of social distances measures extended over long periods.","output":"[Impact of social distancing for covid-19 on young people: type and quality of the studies found through a systematic review of the literature.]/ Impatto del distanziamento sociale per covid-19 sui giovani: tipologia e qualit degli studi reperiti attraversouna revisione sistematica della letteratura"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Portal Rumah Belajar merupakan aplikasi berbasis internet yang diluncurkan oleh Kemdikbud untuk memfasilitasi terciptanya ruang kelas maya pada praktik pengajaran dalam jaringan (daring).

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was used to compare US in-hospital outcomes related to coiling with and without adjunctive stenting for unruptured aneurysms. METHODS Hospitalizations for coiling of unruptured cerebral aneurysms from 2004 to 2008 were identified in the NIS by extracting ICD-9-CM codes for the diagnosis of unruptured aneurysm (437.3) and intracranial stenting (00.65) with coiling (39.52, 39.79 or 39.72) of cerebral aneurysms. All patients with a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (430) and/or intracerebral hemorrhage (431) were excluded. Mortality and discharge to a long-term facility were compared between stent and non-stent patient groups using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS Patients treated with stent-assisted coiling had an in-hospital mortality rate of 0.08-0.8% compared with a death rate of 0.5% (95% CI 0.3% to 0.7%) for patients who did not receive a stent during coiling (p=0.36). Patients in the stent group had a 3% rate of discharge to a care facility (95% CI 1.5% to 5.8%) compared with 5% (95% CI 4.5% to 5.6%) for those in the non-stent group (p=0.14). Patients treated with a stent had a similar likelihood of in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 2.12 (95% CI 0.32 to 7.11), p=0.34) and a lower likelihood of discharge to a long-term care facility (adjusted OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.24 to 1.16), p=0.16) compared with the non-stent group. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive stenting adds little in-hospital risk to the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. However, the need for dual antiplatelet therapy may predispose to delayed hemorrhagic complications and discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy may lead to delayed thromboembolic complications.","output":"In-hospital outcomes associated with stent-assisted endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in the USA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mental health of the US population is unclear. This study drew on two nationally representative samples to compare the prevalence rate of anxiety in the U.S. before and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2) screening tool was used to detect the proportion of US adults screening positive for high levels of anxiety symptoms. Anxiety symptoms was assessed in 2019 using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N = 30,915) and during the pandemic using biweekly surveys collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS; N=8,022 Obs.=121,768) between March and December 2020. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms increased significantly from 8.1% (95% CI[7.7, 8.5]) in 2019 to 21.4% (95% CI[19.9, 22.9]) at the beginning of April, 2020. The prevalence then declined to 11.4% (95% CI[10.3, 12.5]) in May and remained 3% above 2019 levels until December 2020. This pattern of increasing anxiety between 2019 and April 2020 followed by a rapid decrease in anxiety was identified across all demographic characteristics examined. LIMITATIONS: The NHIS and UAS samples differ in their sampling and mode of administration which may bias comparisons between samples. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety symptoms increased markedly during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced quickly as stay-at-home orders were lifted. These findings highlight the importance of providing mental health supports during future lockdowns and suggest that resilience in mental health may have been a key population-level response to the demands of the pandemic.","output":"Anxiety reported by US adults in 2019 and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic: Population-based evidence from two nationally representative samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses which is a highly communicable There is no effective medical treatment till date for Coronavirus disease hence prevention is the best way to keep disease away Rasayana proved to be highly efficacious and cost effective for the Prevention and Control of viral infections when vaccines and standard therapies are lacking Rasayana Chikitsa is one of the eight branches of Ashtanga Ayurveda which helps to maintain healthy life style Rasayana improves immunity and performs many vital functions of human body Vyadhikshamatva that is immune mechanism of the body is involved in Prevention of the occurrence of a new disease and it also decreases the virulence and progression of an existing disease In COVID-19 the Respiratory system mainly get affected which is evident from its symptoms like cold, cough and breathlessness Here the drugs help in enhancing immune system and strengthening functions of Respiratory system can be useful For this pur-pose, the Rasayana like Chyavanprasha, Agastya Haritaki, Pippali Rasayana, Guduchi, Yashtimadhu, Haridra, Ashwagandha, Tulsi are used Rasayana work-ing on Respiratory system are best for Prevention of Coronavirus and boosting immune system Rasayana Chikitsa can be effective in the Prevention as well as reducing symptoms of COVID-19","output":"Role of rasayana in prevention of COVID-19-a review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Requirement for medication from pathogenic human viruses and cancer diseases are urgently considered, while, numerous reports were focused on investigating easily manufactured and excellently effective therapeutic reagents.

Limited research has been undertaken on possible solutions. Thus, the aim was to explore the coping strategies used or advocated by dentists to protect and support their health and wellbeing. Methods This qualitative study involved a purposive sample of dentists working in England taking account of age, gender, career stage, work sector, geographical area, position and route of entry to registration. Dentists were approached via gatekeepers across England to participate in semi-structured interviews. A topic guide, informed by past research, was used to guide the discourse. Informants' views were audio-recorded and field notes were made. Data were transcribed and analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach to generate theory with the support of the framework methodology. Results Twenty dentists were interviewed from a range of backgrounds. Self-reported coping strategies included a range of strategies for 'taking control', including 'embracing self-care' and 'seeking professional support', while drawing on 'supportive personal and social networks'. Managing professional careers included diversifying through greater 'mixing' of NHS with private work, privatising, specialising, or combining dentistry with another role. Strengthening job security and facilitating diversity of experience remain important for supporting the health and wellbeing of dentists. Selling practices or, in the extreme, completely leaving the profession were considered practical options. At organisational level, building sustainable teams and transforming culture were advocated as important; while at systems level, reforming the NHS and bridging the gap between the profession and regulatory body were considered vital. Additionally, the need for strong professional leadership and wider societal debate was advocated as part of a whole systems approach to enable job satisfaction in delivering high-quality, patient-centred, evidence-based care in future. Conclusion While dentists demonstrated a range of coping mechanisms, multi-level action was advocated to enhance the health, wellbeing and retention of dentists. Systems reform at macro- and meso-levels is urgently advocated to enable fulfilling careers within dentistry, particularly for those at the front line of primary dental care in the public sector. Personal resilience alone will not suffice and recommendations for action are explored to avert a public health catastrophe.

Many of these patients have pre-existing conditions that make them more prone to COVID-19 symptoms, and this susceptibility potentially increases after BoNT-A injections. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 500 patients identified 256 pediatric patients with cerebral palsy who received an intramuscular BoNT-A injection to determine relative doses used for each Gross Motor Functional Classification Score (GMFCS). Data regarding age, weight, GMFCS, BoNT-A total body dosage, and inpatient hospitalizations for 6 months post-injection were collected. Differences between GMFCS levels were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance testing. Inpatient hospitalizations were recorded and assessed using relative risk to determine the population risk of hospitalization in the setting of initiating injections during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Based on GMFCS level, patients who were GMFCS I or II received fewer units of BoNT-A medication per kilogram of body weight compared to GMFCS III-V (p< 0.0005, F= 25.38). There was no statistically significant difference in frequency or time to hospitalization when comparing patients receiving BoNT-A compared to a control group. CONCLUSIONS: Resumption of BoNT-A injections during the time of COVID-19 requires a systematic approach based on risks and potential benefits. Data from this analysis does not show increased risk for patients who received injections historically; however, recommendations for resumption of injections has not previously been proposed in the setting of a pandemic. In this manuscript, a tiered approach to considerations for injections was proposed.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the experience of fellowship applicants in answering radiology questions in an audiovisual format, using their own smartphones after answering radiology questions in a traditional printed text format as part of the application process during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation. RESULTS: The great majority of the applicants (99%) answered positively (agree or strongly agree) that images in digital forms have superior quality than printed in paper. Eighty-two percent of the applicants agreed with the statement that the presentation of the cases in audiovisual format facilitates the understanding of the findings. Also, most of the candidates agreed or strongly agreed that answering digital forms is more practical than conventional paper forms (65%).

However, selection of positive binding clones from synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries has an inherent bias toward clones containing randomly generated amber stop codons, complicating the identification of high affinity binding antibodies. We screened Tomlinson I and J library against receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV2, eight clones which showed positive binding in phage ELISA, contained one or more amber stop codons in their scFv gene sequences. The presence of amber stop codons within the antibody sequence causes the premature termination of soluble form of scFv expression in non-suppressor E.coli strain. In the present study, we have used a novel strategy that allows soluble expression of scFvs having amber stop codon in their gene sequences (without phage PIII protein fusion), in the suppressor strain. This strategy of introduction of Ochre (TAA) codon at the junction of scFv and PIII gene, speeds up the initial screening process which is critical for selecting the right scFvs for further studies. Present strategy leads to the identification of a scFv, B8 that binds specifically with nanomolar affinity towards SARS CoV 2 RBD, which otherwise lost in terms of traditional methodology.

The state governments have chosen different measures to respond to the spread of the virus as there was no clear evidence on what the best way is to respond. In this paper, we gather the evidence of governments stringency measures and couple it with countries socio-economic data (including the amounting of tests that each country performed) to explore how they influenced the COVID-19 spread. We evaluated how well seven different regression models can predict the spread of the virus. The spread of the virus is expressed through the number of positively identified individuals as well as deaths reported due to the virus. For the prediction of the number of new cases, ElasticNet algorithm was the best performing, followed by Linear Regression and LASSO. LASSO algorithms predicted the best number of new deaths. The metrics used to evaluate were: R-squared score, Adjusted R-squared Score, mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The most effective measure was the stay-at-home measure followed by workplace and school closures.

Exposure of zucchini seedlings to Hogland solution containing 0.28 mmol L-1 Ni(NO3)2 reduced plant growth, the content of chlorophyll and carotenoids and the relative water content (RWC) in leaves, increased Ni accumulation that was accompanied to depletion of the essential bivalent cations and induced oxidative stress and proline accumulation in both shoots and roots.

Current treatment options focus either on aneurysm coil retention, supported by a stent-like device positioned in the parent vessel lumen, or intrasaccular devices that disrupt flow within the aneurysm dome. A third alternative, i.e., the use of conventional (intraluminal) flow-diverters to treat such bifurcation aneurysms raises the problem that at least one daughter vessel needs to be jailed in such a deployment. The eCLIPs is a stent-like device that offers the possibility of flow-diversion at the aneurysm neck, without the drawbacks of daughter vessel occlusion or those of intrasaccular deployment. METHODS In this study the eCLIPs device was virtually deployed in five cerebral bifurcation aneurysms and compared with a conventional tubular flow-diverter device. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the aneurysm haemodynamic environment pre- and post-implantation were conducted, and focussed on metrics associated with successful aneurysm occlusion. Absolute and relative reductions in aneurysm inflow rate (Q) and time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) were recorded. RESULTS The eCLIPs device was found to perform in a similar qualitative fashion to tubular flow-diverters, with overall reduction of metrics being somewhat more modest however, when compared to such devices. Aneurysm inflow reduction and TAWSS reduction were typically 10-20% lower for the eCLIPs, when compared to a generic flow diverter (FDBRAIDED) similar to devices currently in clinical use. The eCLIPs was less effective at diffusing inflow jets and at reducing the overall velocity of the flow, when compared to these devices. This result is likely due to the larger device pore size in the eCLIPs. Notably, it was found that the eCLIPs provided approximately equal resistance to flow entering and exiting the aneurysm, which was not true for the FDBRAIDED device, where high-speed concentrations of outflow were seen at the aneurysm neck along with local TAWSS elevation. The clinical implications of such behaviour are not examined in detail here but could be significant. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that the eCLIPs device acts as a flow-diverter for bifurcation aneurysms, with somewhat diminished occlusion properties comparing to tubular flow diverters but without the jailing and diminished flow evident in a daughter vessel associated with use of conventional devices.","output":"A Virtual Comparison of the eCLIPs Device and Conventional Flow-Diverters as Treatment for Cerebral Bifurcation Aneurysms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Las infecciones virales continan siendo una importante causa de morbimortalidad en los pacientes trasplantados.

The authors have recently changed from LA to PRA in suitable patients and audited their outcomes. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for 10 patients who underwent PRA, and a chart review and telephone interviews were conducted with 13 consecutive patients who underwent LA by the same surgeon. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, analgesia use, operative and anesthetic time, length of stay, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Data were collected for 13 LAs and 10 PRAs. Patients' baseline characteristics, including age, BMI, and tumor size, were similar between the 2 groups. There were no conversions to open surgery, transfusions, or deaths. Operative time was similar between the 2 groups. PRA patients required less, inpatient postoperative opioid analgesia compared with LA patients (median 1.25 vs. 23 mg of intravenous morphine equivalent, P=0.003), and had a shorter length of stay (median 1 vs. 2 d, P<0.001). The median total days on opioids were lower for PRA patients compared with LA patients (0.5 vs. 9 d, P<0.001). CONCLUSION Our initial results supports previously published findings that PRA is a safe procedure, with a relatively short learning curve, resulting in reduced postoperative analgesia use, and reduced length of hospital stay when compared with the laparoscopic transperitoneal approach.","output":"Comparison of outcomes after laparoscopic versus posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy: a pilot study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT: The recent spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in a number of mental health issues among healthcare workers and dentists are no exception to this due to their nature of work.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was done to assess the level of PS using perceived stress scale (PSS) and sources of stress among dentists of Chhattisgarh state of India before the onset of COVID-19 in the state and immediately after the nationwide lockdown was announced owing to COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the type of work, the dental practitioners were categorized into three groupsCCdental practitioners (group A), dental academicians (group B), and dentists who are practitioners as well as academicians (group C). Frequency, percentages, and mean values were calculated and compared among different participant characteristics using Students t test, paired t test, and one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: During phase I, mean PSS for dentists was 18.61  6.87 which increased to 20.72  1.95 in phase II. Group C dentists recorded higher mean PSS during phase I, while group A dentists reported higher mean PSS during phase II. No family time due to long working hours (90%) was the major stressor among the three groups of dentists during phase I and concern about getting infected (83.3%) was identified as the most frequent stressor during phase II followed by stress over financial implications.

Similar to other medications, allergic reactions can occur during vaccination. While most reactions are neither frequent nor serious, anaphylactic reactions are potentially life-threatening allergic reactions that are encountered rarely, but can cause serious complications. The allergic responses caused by vaccines can stem from activation of mast cells via Fc receptor-1 type I reaction, mediated by the interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against a particular vaccine, and occur within minutes or up to four hours. The type IV allergic reactions initiate 48 h after vaccination and demonstrate their peak between 72 and 96 h. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation via activation of the complement system and via activation of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 can also induce allergic reactions. Reactions are more often caused by inert substances, called excipients, which are added to vaccines to improve stability and absorption, increase solubility, influence palatability, or create a distinctive appearance, and not by the active vaccine itself. Polyethylene glycol, also known as macrogol, in the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and polysorbate 80, also known as Tween 80, in AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, are excipients mostly incriminated for allergic reactions. This review will summarize the current state of knowledge of immediate and delayed allergic reactions in the currently available vaccines against COVID-19, together with the general and specific therapeutic considerations. These considerations include: The incidence of allergic reactions and deaths under investigation with the available vaccines, application of vaccination in patients with mast cell disease, patients who developed an allergy during the first dose, vasovagal symptoms masquerading as allergic reactions, the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy, deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and questions arising in managing of this current ordeal. Careful vaccine-safety surveillance over time, in conjunction with the elucidation of mechanisms of adverse events across different COVID-19 vaccine platforms, will contribute to the development of a safe vaccine strategy.

Hospitalized individuals without diabetes were enrolled as control subjects. All patients were followed for 90 days, and clinical findings and patients outcomes were reported. Results Over a period of four months, 127 patients with diabetes and 127 individuals without diabetes with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited. The mean age was 65.7012.51 years. Mortality was higher in population with diabetes (22.8% vs. 15.0%; P=0.109), although not significantly. More severe pulmonary involvement (P=0.015), extended hospital stay (P<0.001), and higher need for invasive ventilation (P=0.029) were reported in this population. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that diabetes was not independently associated with mortality (p=0.092).

Thus, it is important to assess FMS so that children needing additional support can be identified in a timely fashion. There is great potential for universal screening of FMS in schools, but research has established that current assessment tools are not fit for purpose. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the psychometric properties of a FMS assessment tool designed specifically to meet the demands of universal screening in schools. METHODS: A working group consisting of academics from developmental psychology, public health and behavioural epidemiology developed an assessment tool (FUNMOVES) based on theory and prior evidence. Over three studies, 814 children aged 4 to 11 years were assessed in school using FUNMOVES. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate structural validity and modifications were then made to FUNMOVES activities after each study based on Rasch results and implementation fidelity. RESULTS: The initial Rasch analysis found numerous psychometric problems including multidimensionality, disordered thresholds, local dependency, and misfitting items. Study 2 showed a unidimensional measure, with acceptable internal consistency and no local dependency, but that did not fit the Rasch model. Performance on a jumping task was misfitting, and there were issues with disordered thresholds (for jumping, hopping and balance tasks). Study 3 revealed a unidimensional assessment tool with good fit to the Rasch model, and no further issues, once jumping and hopping scoring were modified. IMPLICATIONS: The finalised version of FUNMOVES (after three iterations) meets standards for accurate measurement, is free and able to assess a whole class in under an hour using resources available in schools. Thus FUNMOVES has the potential to allow schools to efficiently screen FMS to ensure that targeted support can be provided and disability barriers removed.","output":"Developing and validating a school-based screening tool of Fundamental Movement Skills (FUNMOVES) using Rasch analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To explore the survival benefit of tofacitinib in addition to dexamethasone in hospitalized patients treated for COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients and methods Single center retrospective observational study. All patients hospitalized, at Delta Regional Medical Center, regional hospital in the Mississippi Delta, with a COVID-19 diagnosis and discharged between March 1st and September 30th, 2020 are included. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in relation to receipt of tofacitinib alone or in addition to dexamethasone (designated as the Tofacitinib Group), vs dexamethasone alone (designated as the Dexamethasone Group). Results Of 269 eligible patients, 138 (51.3%) received tofacitinib uniformly and 131 (48.7%) patients received dexamethasone without tofacitinib. A total of 44 patients expired: 14 (31.82%) in the Tofacitinib Group and 30 (68.18%) in the Dexamethasone Group. The proportions of death among the Tofacitinib and Dexamethasone groups were respectively, 10.14% and 22.90%.

We found that adding tofacitinib based anti-inflammatory therapy to a treatment regimen including dexamethasone in COVID-19 pneumonia seems to have potential benefit of improving survival when compared to dexamethasone alone.","output":"Anti-Inflammatory treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with tofacitinib alone or in combination with dexamethasone is safe and possibly superior to dexamethasone as a single agent in a predominantly African American cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected lives and professions worldwide.

Several COVID-19 diagnosis mechanisms currently appear in the scene such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests. The rate of false negatives for a PCR test varies depending on how long the infection has been present in the patient. Studies shows that the false-negative rate was 20% when testing was performed five days after symptoms began, but much higher (up to 100%) in earlier infection stages. Although the PCR test could be considered relatively accurate, it is also quite costly, ranging from 125 to 250 USD. Moreover, it takes the test results a long time to get out. Given the sensitivity of the situation, this delay in results would be quite risky. The aim of this research is to contribute to the discovery and analysis of COVID-19 invariants in order to assist medical diagnosis of the disease and to utilize deep learning for social good by implementing an aiding screening tool for COVID-19 testing that is accurate, cheap, and fast. Cheaper testing options such as X-ray and Computerized Tomography (CT) lung scans and cough audio records have been targeted for examination of promising results. Two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed. One has been pre-trained with 38,000 CT and X-ray lung scans dataset to identify if the CT or X-ray lung scan is of a healthy person, COVID-19, or pneumonia patient. This model achieved an accuracy of 95.9%. Transfer learning has been applied to this model to test its generalizability beyond the given training datasets. For the second CNN model, about 2000 cough audio records have been converted into Mel-spectrograms and used to pre-train the model to identify if the cough audio Mel-spectrogram results are from a COVID-19 patient or not.

In England and Wales, three multi-component programmes have been implemented including: (1) community mobilisation, responsible beverage server (RBS) training and routine law enforcement; (2) community mobilisation and enhanced law enforcement; and, (3) community mobilisation, RBS training and enhanced law enforcement. This study estimates the association between sales of alcohol to pseudo-intoxicated patrons and implementation of three multi-component interventions in four nightlife settings. METHODS: Alcohol test purchases by pseudo-intoxicated actors were implemented at pre (n = 206) and post-intervention (n = 224). Actors/observers recorded venue and test purchase characteristics. Logistic regression assessed service refusal by intervention type, adjusting for venue/test purchase characteristics. RESULTS: Pre-intervention, 20.9% of sales were refused. Post-intervention, 42.1%, 68.8% and 74.0% of sales were refused in areas with intervention 1, 2, and 3 respectively. In adjusted analyses, compared to pre-intervention, the odds of service refusal were higher for all interventions, with the highest odds when the intervention included enhanced law enforcement (adjusted odds ratios, interventions 1, 2, 3: 2.6, 7.1, 14.4; p < 0.01). Service refusal was higher if the test purchase was implemented on a Saturday/Sunday night; and lower if implemented in a nightclub or if age verification was requested at the bar. CONCLUSION: Community-based multi-component interventions were associated with significant increases in service refusal to pseudo-intoxicated actors in nightlife settings in England and Wales.

The aim is to share our experiences and outcomes during the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the strategies recommended and strategies we have implemented. METHODS: Our experience comes from our work at a referral hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Changes to clinical practice have largely been guided by the current evidence and four main principles: (1) patient and health-care worker protection, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) conservation of health-care resources, (4) uninterrupted formation for residents. Based on these principles, changes in the service organization, elective clinical visits, emergency visits, surgical procedures, and inpatient and outpatient care were made. RESULTS: Using the guidance of experts, we were able to help the hospital address the demands of the Covid-19 outbreak. We reduced to a third of our orthopaedics and trauma hospital beds, provided coverage for general emergency services, and five ICUs, all continuing to provide care for our patients, in the form of 102 trauma surgeries, 6413 phone interviews and 520 emergency clinic visits. Also in the third week, we were able to restart morning meetings via telematics, and teaching sessions for our residents. On the other hand, eight of the healthcare personnel on our service (10.8%) became infected with Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: As priorities and resources increasingly shift towards the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain the high standard and quality of care necessary for trauma and orthopaedics patients while the pandemic persists. We must be prepared to organize our healthcare workers in such a way that the needs of both inpatients and outpatients are met. It is still possible to operate on those patients who need it. Unfortunately, some healthcare workers will become infected. It is essential that we protect those most susceptible to severer consequences of Covid-19.

To enter the cells, SARS-CoV-2 S requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many existing vaccines have drawbacks like insufficient system stimulation, in vivo instability, high toxicity, the need for a chilly chain, and multiple administration. A nanotechnology is an efficient tool for addressing these issues. A successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection is predicted to stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses and protects against severe sorts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In Spain, by October 2021, 87.9% of the target population, including IBD patients had received the complete vaccination regimen. In September 2021, an additional dose of vaccine was approved in patients with immunosuppression including IBD patients on biologic agents. We evaluated the vaccination rate and additional dose willingness in this group of-at risk patients. Methods: A single-center, cross-sectional study was performed among IBD patients on biologic agents and elegibles for an additional dose of COVID19 vaccine between 19th October and 12th November 2021. Patients were identified by the list provided by the Pharmacy service. IBD clinical characteristics and type of vaccine and date of administration were checked in medical records. Acceptance and adverse effects of vaccination were evaluated after telephone or face-to-face survey in these IBD patients. Results: Out of a total of 344 patients, 269 patients (46.1% male;mean age 4716 years;crohn's disease n=198/ ulcerative colitis n=66/ indeterminate colitis n=5) received at least one vaccine dose and were included. The patients were on Infliximab (40.9%), Ustekinumab (29.7%), Adalimumab (20%), and Vedolizumab (8.9%). Co-treatment with immunosuppressors was used in 73.2% of patients. Only 15 (5.6%) patients refused the COVID19 vaccine: 26.7% for fear of vaccine's adverse effects, 33.3% for doubts about a new-design vaccine and 40% for conviction (COVID19 pandemic denial). 46.7% of the cases would not change their opinion, but 33.3% would re-consider after discussing with their doctor and/or receiving information on the adverse effects of the vaccine. Previous to the additional dose, COVID19 vaccination was present in 94.4% of patients (n=254) (complete regimen using Pfizer 63%, Astra-Zeneca 15.4%, Moderna 12.2% and Janssen in 9.4% of patients, respectively). 42.7% of patients personally requested the appointment for initial dose of vaccination and 59.1% contacted the IBD Unit to discuss the decision to be vaccinated. Adverse effects occurred in 53.9% of the cases after the standard vaccination regimen, mainly pain in the arm (40%). Up to 94.1% of the patients agreed for an additional dose and 57.2% had already received the additional dose at the time of the assessment. Conclusion: IBD patients on biological agents and at high-risk for COVID19 accept the vaccine as well as an additional dose if recommended. Physicians in charge of IBD units should provide information and confidence in the use of the vaccine in these IBD patients.

In China, three types of facilities for centralized isolation (Fangcang shelter hospitals, refitted non-designated hospitals, and quarantine hotels) underwent retrofitting for the treatment and isolation of confirmed and suspected cases. These facilities mitigated the immediate high demand for space. Moreover, in order to minimize infection risks in these facilities, regulators and governmental agencies implemented new designs, management measures, and precautionary measures to minimize infection risk. Other countries and regions could refer to China's experience in optimally allocating social resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a conclusion, government should allocate social resources and construct centralized isolation and quarantine facilities for an emergency response, health authorities should issue regulations for centralized isolation facilities and pay strict attention to the daily management of these facilities, a multidisciplinary administration team is required to support the daily operation of a centralized isolation facility, in-depth studies and international collaboration on the centralized isolation policy are encouraged.","output":"Facilities for Centralized Isolation and Quarantine for the Observation and Treatment of Patients with COVID-19: Experience from Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every year about one million people die due to diseases transmitted by mosquitoes.

This study aimed to characterize patient-reported concerns about undergoing surgical procedures during the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: We administered a cross-sectional survey to patients who had their general and plastic surgical procedures postponed at the onset of the pandemic, asking about barriers to accessing surgical care. Questions addressed dependent care, transportation, employment and insurance status, as well as perceptions of and concerns about COVID-19. Mixed methods and inductive thematic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-five patients were interviewed. We identified the following patient concerns: contracting COVID-19 in the hospital (46%), being alone during hospitalization (40%), facing financial stressors (29%), organizing transportation (28%), experiencing changes to health insurance coverage (25%), and arranging care for dependents (18%). Non-white participants were 5 and 2.5 times more likely to have concerns about childcare and transportation, respectively. Perceptions of decreased hospital safety and the consequences of possible COVID-19 infection led to delay in rescheduling. Education about safety measures and communication about scheduling partially mitigated concerns about COVID-19. However, uncertainty about timeline for rescheduling and resolution of the pandemic contributed to ongoing concerns. CONCLUSION: Providing effective surgical care during this unprecedented time requires both awareness of societal shifts impacting surgical patients and system-level change to address new barriers to care. Eliciting patients perspectives, adapting processes to address potential barriers, and effectively educating patients about institutional measures to minimize in-hospital transmission of COVID-19 should be integrated into surgical care.","output":"Patient Perceptions on Barriers and Facilitators to Accessing Low-Acuity Surgery During COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Understanding the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development, epidemiological surveillance and disease control strategies. This systematic review critically evaluates and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. METHODS: For this systematic review, keyword-structured literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer. Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: 61 articles were included. 55 (90%) studies used observational designs, 50 (82%) involved hospitalised patients with higher acuity illness, and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity, duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virus-specific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility, respectively, remains unclear. CONCLUSION: A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological limitations and heterogeneity between studies, as well as a striking lack of research in asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic individuals. In contrast to antibody responses, population-level surveillance of the T cell response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term.

OBJECTIVE: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. EXPOSURES: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. RESULTS: Among Veterans aged 54C75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95% Cl 3.795.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95% Cl 1.89C3.46).

One method of ensuring standard patient care within these guidelines is through the implementation of telemedicine. AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and/or rehabilitation period. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in Medline/PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for prospective randomised controlled trials to compare clinical and symptomatic measures for elective patients managed routinely with remote care compared to those managed with standard in-clinic management. To be included for meta-analysis, parameters must be evaluated in &#8805;3 studies. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in the meta-analyses. Both telemedicine and control cohorts were comparable for patient satisfaction (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.07; I2 = 0%; p = 0.52) and patient retention analysis (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.06; p = 0.54; I2 = 0%).

This study was conducted among the health-care workers (HCWs) and community members to find the perceptions regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and understand the influencers and the barriers of vaccine acceptance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted from October 2020 to December 2020 in two primary care settings in an urban area. Eighteen in-depth interviews (IDIs) after taking consent were conducted with the help of IDI guide developed and validated beforehand by the experts. IDIs were done among the ten community members and eight HCWs selected conveniently. Data collection were continued till data saturation when no new information yielded from the interviews. Thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: All the participants were hopeful about availability of the vaccine. The key influencers identified for promoting willingness to accept the vaccine among both the groups were opinion of the health-care providers, colleagues and other people's acceptance of the vaccine, effectiveness of vaccine on other people, and perceived risk of the disease. Fear of adverse reactions was the most important barrier among all the respondents. The prevalent perception was that other preventive practices and vaccine together can only be the best solution to prevent COVID-19 illness. The HCWs perceived that acceptance of vaccine among the community members would be good overall but apprehended some initial difficulties. Mass campaign to promote COVID-19 vaccination and sensitization events are the need of the hour. CONCLUSIONS: Since opinion of health-care personnel emerged as an important influencer of vaccine acceptance, mass campaign and sensitization programs spearheaded by the health-care providers can bring about change by increasing the vaccine acceptance among the beneficiaries at large. Re-enforcement regarding practice of preventive measures should be made among the population irrespective of the vaccination status.","output":"Contributing factors of willingness and hesitancy regarding acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in primary care settings: A qualitative study in an eastern state of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The long-term effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not well understood. This rapid review was aimed at synthesizing evidence on the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection among survivors. We considered both randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies eligible for inclusion in this review. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 database. The reference lists of all the included studies were also searched. Two authors independently screened the search outputs and reviewed full texts of potentially eligible articles. Data extraction was done by one author and checked by a second author. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity among the included studies. Results are presented narratively. Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria. All these studies were conducted in high-income countries. Study findings demonstrate that COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms after recovering from their initial illness, especially among previously hospitalized persons. The majority of symptoms reported were fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and sleep disorders. Mental conditions, such as depression and anxiety disorders, were also reported. In conclusion, this study showed that COVID-19 survivors can experience persistent symptoms after recovering from their initial illness. Therefore, there is a need for a long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients and rehabilitation services for survivors.

It is an important structural property as the active sites of proteins are mostly located on the protein surfaces. The aim of this paper is to provide the clear information on different Amycolatopsis eburnea lipases based on the SASA patterns. This information could help in recognizing the structural stability and conformation as well as precise clustering them for revealing lipase evolution. ABSTRACT: The wealth of biological databases provides a valuable asset to understand evolution at a molecular level. This research presents the machine learning approach, an unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of invariant solvent accessible surface areas and conserved structural features of Amycolatopsis eburnea lipases to exploit the enzyme stability and evolution. Amycolatopsis eburnea lipase sequences were retrieved from biological database. Six structural conserved regions and their residues were identified. Total Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) and structural conserved-SASA with unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical algorithm were clustered lipases in three distinct groups (99/96%). The minimum SASA of nucleus residues was related to Lipase-4. It is clearly shown that the overall side chain of SASA was higher than the backbone in all enzymes. The SASA pattern of conserved regions clearly showed the evolutionary conservation areas that stabilized Amycolatopsis eburnea lipase structures. This research can bring new insight in protein design based on structurally conserved SASA in lipases with the help of a machine learning approach.","output":"Application of Hierarchical Clustering to Analyze Solvent-Accessible Surface Area Patterns in Amycolatopsis lipases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To measure patient flow at our Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) during the Italian lockdown, with particular care in terms of otolaryngological (ENT)-related diagnoses.

This article reviews current and new trends in NORA, trends in anesthesia management in nonoperating room settings, and the evolving debates surrounding these trends. RECENT FINDINGS: National data suggests that NORA cases will continue to rise relative to operating room (OR) anesthesia and there will continue to be a shift towards performing more interventional procedures outside of the OR. These trends have important implications for the safety of interventional procedures as they become increasingly more complex and patients continue to be older and more frail. In order for anesthesia providers and proceduralists to be prepared for this future, rigorous standards must be set for safe anesthetic care outside of the OR.Although the overall association between NORA and patient morbidity and mortality remains unclear, focused studies point toward trends specific to each non-OR procedure type. Given increasing patient and procedure complexity, anesthesiology teams may see a larger role in the interventional suite. However, the ideal setting and placement of anesthesia staff for interventional procedures remain controversial. Also, the impact of COVID-19 on the growth and utilization of non-OR anesthesia remains unclear, and it remains to be seen how the pandemic will influence the delivery of NORA procedures in postpandemic settings. SUMMARY: NORA is a rapidly growing field of anesthesia. Continuing discussions of complication rates and mortality in different subspecialty areas will determine the need for anesthesia care and quality improvement efforts in each setting. As new noninvasive procedures are developed, new data will continue to shape debates surrounding anesthesia care outside of the operating room.","output":"National trends in nonoperating room anesthesia: procedures, facilities, and patient characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, we focus on silent speech recognition in electroencephalography (EEG) data of healthy individuals to advance brainCcomputer interface (BCI) development to include people with neurodegeneration and movement and communication difficulties in society.

To cope with these problems, in this study, we propose a Delphi-based approach to eliciting knowledge from multiple experts.

Five eBC sources were identified using a hybrid environmental receptor model. Results showed that biomass burning, traffic-related emissions, and coal combustion were the dominant contributors to eBC. The generalized additive model indicated that the reduction of traffic-related eBC during the lockdown was entirely attributed to the decrease of emissions. Decreased biomass-burning activities and favorable meteorological factors are both important drivers for the biomass-burning eBC reduction during the lockdown. A radiative transfer model showed that the DRE efficiency of eBC from biomass burning was the strongest, followed by coal combustion and traffic-related emissions. This study highlights that aggressive reduction in the consumption of residential solid fuels would be effective in achieving climate change mitigation.","output":"Changes in Source-Specific Black Carbon Aerosol and the Induced Radiative Effects Due to the COVID-19 Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic brought major changes to virtually all spheres of human life.

Moreover, substitution on the C\\\\7 position of ciprofloxacin enhanced its antiviral activity. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the antiviral activity of 7\\\\(4\\\\(N\\\\substituted\\\\carbamoyl\\\\methyl)piperazin\\\\1yl)\\\\chalcone in comparison with ciprofloxacin against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 main protease (M(pro)). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vero cells were infected with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. After treatment with ciprofloxacin and the chalcone at the concentrations of 1.6, 16, 160 nmol/L for 48 h, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 viral load was detected using real\\\\time qPCR, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infectivity was determined using plaque assay, and the main protease enzyme activity was detected using in vitro 3CL\\\\protease inhibition assay. The activity of the chalcone was justified through molecular docking within SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 M(pro), in comparison with ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: The new chalcone significantly inhibited viral load replication where the EC50 was 3.93 nmol/L, the plaque formation ability of the virus was inhibited to 86.8%  2.47. The chalcone exhibited a significant inhibitory effect against SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 M(pro) in vitro in a dose\\\\dependent manner. The docking study into SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 M(pro) active site justified the importance of adding a substitution to the parent drug.

The AQI data were provided by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Indonesia, from January 2019 to December 2020 at five different locations in Jakarta, with missing data for March and September 2020 due to unknown reasons. These data were grouped into the period before the LSSR from January 2019 to February 2020 and the period during LSSR from April 2020 to December 2020. In order to measure the change in the air quality of Jakarta before and during LSSR, we ran a chi-squared test to the AQI for each location and LSSR phase as well as paired one-sided t-test for the seasonal trend. The result of this study showed that, in general, LSSR improved the air quality of Jakarta. The improvement was mainly contributed by reduced transportation activities that were induced by LSSR. Further analysis on the seasonal pollutants trend showed a variation of AQI improvement in each phase due to their unique characteristics.

Evidence-based recommendations are required for the prevention and treatment of NSCLBP in nurses. OBJECTIVE This meta-analysis aimed to systematically review and quantify the factors of NSCLBP in nurses. METHODS Eleven databases were searched. The odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using meta-analysis, and either a fixed-effect or random-effect model was used based on heterogeneity across included studies. RESULTS Eighteen publications including 11,752 nursing staff were included. Being female (pooled estimate [95% CI], 1.56 [1.24-1.96]; P< 0.001), married (1.89 [1.38-2.60]; P< 0.001), overweight (0.63 [0.43-0.93]; P= 0.02), working at least 10 years (0.65 [0.48-0.89]; P= 0.007), and working night shifts (2.19 [1.16-4.21]; P= 0.02) were positively related to NSCLBP. Junior college education (0.60 [0.47-0.77]; P< 0.001) and job satisfaction (0.58 [0.47-0.73]; P< 0.001) were negatively related. Age (0.80 [0.50-1.27]; P= 0.34) and physical exercise (0.99 [0.39-2.49]; P= 0.98) were not related. CONCLUSIONS This is the first meta-analysis to quantify the risk factors for NSCLBP in nurses. Being female, married, working night shifts, overweight, working at least 10 years and dissatisfied with work are risk factors.

We hypothesized that the degree and severity of reactogenicity after the second injection reflects the magnitude of antibody production against the SARS CoV-2 virus spike protein (spike IgG). METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples were obtained from 67 Japanese healthcare workers three weeks after the first injection and two weeks after the second injection of the BNT162b2 vaccine to measure spike IgG levels. Using questionnaires, we calculated an adverse event (AE) score (0C11) for each participant. The geometric mean of spike IgG titers increased from 1,047 antibody units (AU/mL) (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 855C1282 AU/mL) after the first injection to 17,378 AU/mL (95% CI: 14,622C20,663 AU/mL) after the second injection. The median AE score increased from 2 to 5. Spike IgG levels after the second injection were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with spike IgG after the first injection. AE scores after the second injection were not significantly associated with log-transformed spike IgG after the second injection, when adjusted for age, sex, AE score after the first injection, and log-transformed spike IgG after the first injection.

In Maryland and Washington, DC, United States, more than 2500 cases were reported within 3 weeks of the first COVID-19 detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes COVID-19 - in the region. We analyzed 620 samples collected from the Johns Hopkins Health System during March 11-31, 2020, comprising 28.6% of the total cases in Maryland and Washington, DC. From these samples, we generated 114 complete viral genomes. Analysis of these genomes alongside a subsampling of over 1000 previously published sequences showed that the diversity in this region rivaled global SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity at that time and that the sequences belong to all of the major globally circulating lineages, suggesting multiple introductions into the region. We also analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2 genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and found that clinically severe cases had viral genomes belonging to all major viral lineages. We conclude that efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of introductions into the region early in the epidemic and the interconnectedness of the region as a whole.","output":"Genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during early introduction into the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cholesterol deficiency (CD), a newly identified autosomal recessive genetic defect in Holstein cattle, is associated with clinical signs of diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypocholesterolemia. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective is to describe the clinicopathological phenotype of affected Holstein cattle homozygous for the causative apolipoprotein B gene (APOB) mutation. ANIMALS: Six Holstein cattle, 5 calves with a clinical history of chronic diarrhea, and 1 heifer with erosions in the buccal cavity and neurologic symptoms were admitted to the Clinic for Ruminants. METHODS: This case review included a full clinical examination, a complete blood count, blood chemistry, and measurements of cholesterol and triglycerides. The animals were euthanized and necropsied. A PCR\\\\based direct gene test was applied to determine the APOB genotype. RESULTS: All 6 animals were inbred, could be traced back to the sire Maughlin Storm, and were confirmed homozygous for the APOB mutation. The clinical phenotype included poor development, underweight, and intermittent diarrhea in the calves, and neurologic signs in the heifer included hypermetria and pacing. Hypocholesterolemia and low triglycerides concentrations were present in all animals. The pathological phenotype of all animals was steatorrhea with enterocytes of the small intestine containing intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles. The peripheral nervous system of the heifer displayed degenerative changes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Suspicion of CD in Holstein cattle is based on the presence of chronic diarrhea with no evidence of primary infections.

As data on COVID-19 has grown, it has become clear that older adults have a disproportionately high rate of death from COVID-19. This study describes the early clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with more than 80 years of age. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data from 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 20 and February 20, 2020 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Treatment outcomes among subgroups of patients with non-severe and severe symptoms of COVID-19 were compared. RESULTS: Of the 17 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 88.0 years (interquartile range, 86.6-90.0 years; range, 80.0-100.0 years) and 12 (70.6%) were men. The age distribution of patients was not significantly different between non-severe group and severe group. All patients had chronic pre-existing conditions. Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were the most common chronic conditions in both subgroups. The most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 were fever (n = 13; 76.5%), fatigue (n = 11; 64.7%), and cough (n = 5; 29.4%). Lymphopenia was observed in all patients, and lymphopenia was significantly more severe in the severe group than that in non-severe group (0.4  109/L vs 1.2  109/L, P = 0.014). The level of serum creatinine was higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (99.0 mol/L vs 62.5 mol/L, P = 0.038). The most common features of chest computed tomography images were nodular foci in 10 (58.8%) patients and pleural thickening in 7 (41.2%) patients. All patients received antiviral therapy, while some patients also received intravenous antibiotics therapy (76.5%), Chinese medicinal preparation therapy (Lianhuaqingwen capsule, 64.7%), corticosteroids (35.3%) or immunoglobin (29.4%). Eight patients (47.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit because of complications. Ten patients (58.8%) received intranasal oxygen, while 3 (17.6%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4 (23.5%) received high-flow oxygen. As of June 20, 7 (41.2%) patients had been discharged and 10 (58.8% of this cohort, 77.8% of severe patients) had died. CONCLUSION: The mortality of patients aged 80 years and older with severe COVID-19 symptoms was high. Lymphopenia was a characteristic laboratory result in these patients, and the severity of lymphopenia was indicative of the severity of COVID-19. However, the majority of patients with COVID-19 in this age cohort had atypical symptoms, and early diagnosis depends on prompt use of a viral nucleic acid test.","output":"Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in patients aged 80 years and older"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims at analyzing how the Covid-19 (2020) crisis has been treated by leading Tibetan teachers in the global media.

This study aims to perform a survey of public behavior and best practices related to COVID-19 prevention and control among Indonesian communities. A cross-sectional study was designed to collect information using an online survey. Respondents were gathered from 34 provinces in Indonesia through the Indonesia National Safety and Health Council network and Universities network. Respondents voluntarily submitted their response to a predesigned online questionnaire. The collected data was then analyzed using SPSS 24.0. A total of 771 respondent subjects (male 386;female 385) were recruited. The results show that 96% of participants implement positive behavior of personal hygiene, including wearing a mask when going outside their house, and almost 67.3% of respondents sprayed a disinfectant in their house. The majority of participants hold a door handle (37.2%) and desk (28.1%) at a frequency of more than six times a day. There were 8.2% of participants implementing good personal hygiene, including hand-washing at least once a day and maximum of more than six times after going to the toilet.

However, these actions may be unreasonable. In this study, a fuzzy collaborative intelligence approach that seeks the consensus among experts in a novel way is proposed. Fuzzy collaborative intelligence is the application of biologically inspired fuzzy logic to a group task. The proposed methodology is based on the fact that a decision maker must make a choice even if he/she is uncertain. As a result, the decision makers fuzzy judgment matrix may not be able to represent his/her judgment. To solve such a problem, the fuzzy judgment matrix of each decision maker is decomposed into several fuzzy judgment submatrices. From the fuzzy judgment submatrices of all decision makers, a consensus can be easily identified. The proposed fuzzy collaborative intelligence approach and several existing methods have been applied to the case of the post-COVID-19 transformation of a Japanese restaurant in Taiwan. Because such transformation was beyond the expectation of the Japanese restaurant, the employees lacked consensus if existing methods were applied to identify their consensus. The proposed methodology solved this problem. The optimal transformation plan involved increasing the distance between tables, erecting screens between tables, and improving air circulation. In a fuzzy group decision-making task, an acceptable decision cannot be made without the consensus among decision makers. Ignoring this or forcing decision makers to modify their preferences is unreasonable. Identifying the consensus among experts from another point of view is a viable treatment.","output":"A Fuzzy Collaborative Intelligence Approach to Group Decision-Making: a Case Study of Post-COVID-19 Restaurant Transformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions worldwide have made online learning their primary channel. While the various benefits of e-learning have influenced governments to extend the use of this platform after the pandemic, there is the question of the intention of students toward online learning (i.e., participation and location) after the pandemic. This research aims to examine the intention of undergraduate students to do online learning post-COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors that affect them in Indonesia. To that end, this study distributed an online questionnaire to 906 undergraduate students in mid-2021 in Bandung, Indonesia, and used the Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Multinomial Logistics Regression (MNL) model to explore the factors that influence the intention for e-learning after the pandemic. Teaching quality and time management benefits were found to influence studentsintention to spend more days on e-learning. Lower frequency of e-learning is associated with communication problems, internet problems, and unfavorable conditions at home. While the substitution effect is found in e-learning for students who are able to focus during online class, the neutral effect is found for students who experience internet problems and have a lower monthly allowance. E-learning also modifies trips for students who have higher monthly allowances and experience dizziness from long screen time.

The proportion of vape shops found to be noncompliant with the Governor's executive order (i.e., open) during Stage 1 gradually increased from 54 (61.4%) at Assessment 1 (week of April 1, 2020) to 58 (65.9%) at Assessment 3 (week of April 29, 2020). Moreover, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian communities (vs. those in non-Hispanic White and African American communities) were more likely to stay open both during and after the shutdown at Assessments 1 and 6. More specifically, vape shops located in Hispanic/Latino communities were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 1 (during the shutdown), and vape shops in Hispanic/Latino and Korean/Asian were significantly more likely to offer walk-in service during Assessment 6 (after the re-opening).

At each time, a new order/customer/bid is revealed with a request of some resource(s) and a reward. We consider a stochastic setting where all the orders are i.i.d. sampled from an unknown distribution. Such formulation arises from many classic applications such as the canonical (quantity-based) network revenue management problem and the Adwords problem. While the literature on the topic mainly focuses on regret minimization, our paper considers the \\\\textit{fairness} aspect of the problem. On a high level, we define the fairness in a way that a fair online algorithm should treat similar agents/customers similarly, and the decision made for similar agents/customers should be consistent over time. To achieve this goal, we define the fair offline solution as the analytic center of the offline optimal solution set, and introduce \\\\textit{cumulative unfairness} as the cumulative deviation from the online solutions to the fair offline solution over time. We propose a fair algorithm based on an interior-point LP solver and a mechanism that dynamically detects unfair resource spending. Our algorithm achieves cumulative unfairness on the scale of order $O(\\\\log(T))$, while maintains the regret to be bounded without dependency on $T$.

Personalized coaching may increase adherence to PA recommendations, but it is challenging to deliver personalized coaching in a scalable manner. The objective of our study was to determine whether novel artificially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal allocation to (1) voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous AI coaching delivered by text message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks. Of the 42 randomized participants, 91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 32.9 kg/m2. The majority were breast cancer survivors (85.7%). At the end of 4 weeks follow-up, steps increased in the MyCoach arm by an average of 3618.2 steps/day; the net gain in this arm was significantly greater [net difference = 3568.9 steps/day (95% CI: 1483-5655), P value <0.001] compared to control arm, and [net difference = 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11-4310), P value 0.049] compared to SmartText.

In hospitalized patients, DRPs happen during the whole process of drug use such as during prescription, dispensing, administration, and follow-up of their treatment. Unrecognized and unresolved DRPs lead to significant drug-related morbidity and mortality. Several studies conducted in different hospitals and countries showed a high incidence of DRPs among hospitalized patients. Despite the available gaps, there were scanties of studies conducted on DRPs among patients admitted to medical wards in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study assessed the magnitude of drug-related problems and associated factors among patients admitted to the medical wards of selected Southwestern Ethiopian hospitals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter prospective observational study was conducted at medical wards of Mettu Karl Hospital, Bedele General Hospital and Darimu General Hospital. Adult patients greater than 18 years who were admitted to the non-intensive care unit (ICU) of medical wards and with more than 48 h of length of stay were included. Identified DRPs were recorded and classified using the pharmaceutical care network Europe foundation classification system and adverse drug reaction was assessed using the Naranjo algorithm of adverse drug reaction probability scale. Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale was used to measure medication adherence. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between the dependent variable and independent variables. RESULT: Of the 313 study participants, 178 (56.9%) were males. The prevalence of actual or potential DRPs among study participants taking at least a single drug was 212 (67.7%). About 125 (36.63%) patients had one or more co-morbid disease and the average duration of hospital stay of 7.14  4.731 days. A total of 331 DRPs were identified with an average 1.06 DRP per patient. The three-leading categories of DRPs were unnecessary prescription of drugs 92 (27.79%), non-adherence (17.22%) and dose too high (16.92%). The most common drugs associated with DRPs were ceftriaxone (28.37%), cimetidine (14.88%), and diclofenac (14.42%). The area of residence (AOR = 2.550, 95CI%: 1.238C5.253, p = 0.011), hospital stay more than 7 days (AOR = 9.785, 95CI%: 4.668C20.511, p0.001), poly pharmacy (AOR = 3.229, 95CI%: 1.433C7.278, p = 0.005) were predictors of drug-related problem in multivariable logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of drug therapy problems among patients admitted to the medical wards of study settings was found to be high. Therefore, the clinical pharmacy services should be established in hospitals to tackle the DTPs in this area. Additionally, healthcare providers of hospitals also should create awareness for patients seeking care from health facilities of the importance of rational drug usage.","output":"Magnitude and determinants of drug-related problems among patients admitted to medical wards of southwestern Ethiopian hospitals: A multicenter prospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The concept of diversification is well understood by both academics and investment professionals In forming a mean-variance efficient portfolio, investment managers look for low-correlated assets in order to maximize diversification benefits This article investigates the potential of European and US leveraged loans to serve as diversifiers in a multi-asset portfolio By calculating correlations between leveraged loans and other asset classes over the sample period from 2002 to 2020, the authors are not only able to demonstrate increasing correlations in highly volatile markets (i e , financial crises), but also long-term, crisis-independent positive trends in asset correlations In particular, leveraged loans and their correlations with stocks and high-yield bonds present significantly positive long-term trends and hence diminishing diversification benefits The authors state that instead of short-term market volatility, increasing market integration could be the driving force behind this effect The results also indicate that diversification benefits from leveraged loans are lower in the US than in the European market TOPICS: Fixed income and structured finance, developed markets, portfolio construction, performance measurement Key Findings ?

The precise impact of COVID-19 scare and lockdown on emergency access for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is still subject to debate. METHODS: Data on all patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography at 9 hospitals in the greater area of Rome, Italy, between February 19, 2020 and March 29, 2020, 9, 2020, were retrospectively collected. Incidence of ST-elevation MI (STEMI), and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI), as well as corresponding percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), was compared distinguishing two different 20-day time periods (before vs on or after March 10, 2020). RESULTS: During the study period, 1,068 patients underwent coronary angiography, 142 (13%) with STEMI and 169 (16%) with NSTEMI. The average daily number of STEMI decreased from 4.3 before the lockdown to 2.9 after the lockdown (p=0.021). Similarly, the average daily number of NSTEMI changed from 5.0 to 3.5 (p=0.028). The average daily number of primary PCI changed from 4.2 to 2.9 (p=0.030), while the average daily number of PCI for NSTEMI changed from 3.5 to 2.5 (p=0.087).

The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","output":"The Rapid Development and Early Success of Covid 19 Vaccines Have Raised Hopes for Accelerating the Cancer Treatment Mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) causes up to 40% mortality in humans and is difficult to treat. ARDS is also one of the major triggers of mortality associated with coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19). We used a mouse model of ARDS induced by Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), which triggers 100% mortality, to investigate the mechanisms through which 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) attenuates ARDS. SEB was used to trigger ARDS in C3H mice. These mice were treated with THC and analyzed for survival, ARDS, cytokine storm, and metabolome. Additionally, cells isolated from the lungs were used to perform single-cell RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis. A database analysis of human COVID-19 patients was also performed to compare the signaling pathways with SEB-mediated ARDS. The treatment of SEB-mediated ARDS mice with THC led to a 100% survival, decreased lung inflammation, and the suppression of cytokine storm. This was associated with immune cell apoptosis involving the mitochondrial pathway, as suggested by single-cell RNA sequencing. A transcriptomic analysis of immune cells from the lungs revealed an increase in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes following THC treatment. In addition, metabolomic analysis revealed elevated serum concentrations of amino acids, lysine, n-acetyl methionine, carnitine, and propionyl L-carnitine in THC-treated mice. THC caused the downregulation of miR-185, which correlated with an increase in the pro-apoptotic gene targets. Interestingly, the gene expression datasets from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of human COVID-19 patients showed some similarities between cytokine and apoptotic genes with SEB-induced ARDS. Collectively, this study suggests that the activation of cannabinoid receptors may serve as a therapeutic modality to treat ARDS associated with COVID-19.","output":"9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Prevents Mortality from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome through the Induction of Apoptosis in Immune Cells, Leading to Cytokine Storm Suppression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Students involved in the COVID-19 response reported a similar proportion of COVID-19 symptoms or confirmed diagnoses, but lower levels of anxiety, depression and burnout compared with their non-involved peers.","output":"Physical and psychological health of medical students involved in the coronavirus disease 2019 response in Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 65-year-old woman who presented with a constellation of symptoms, including cough with haemoptysis, fever, chills and hypoxia along with weight loss, was found to have diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

The pandemic could lead to or exacerbate mental health issues, especially in people who are already vulnerable to such effects. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system two populations vulnerable to social and functional disruptions include those who have recently experienced homelessness (recently housed Veterans, RHV) and those who have a psychotic disorder (PSY). Methods and Findings: We conducted phone interviews with PSY (n = 81), RHV (n = 76) and control Veterans (CTL, n = 74) between mid-May C mid-August, 2020 (current) and a retrospective assessment relative to January, 2020 (pre-COVID). We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., family and social functioning, work) at both time periods, and risk and protective factors (e.g., resilience, uncertainty) for the current period. The two vulnerable groups had higher levels of clinical symptoms and poorer community integration relative to CTL, as expected. Regarding the effect of the pandemic, results showed that all three groups experienced worse clinical outcomes (i.e., increased depression, anxiety, loneliness) currently vs. pre-COVID;there were no significant interactions between group and time period indicating all three groups were equally impacted by the pandemic. For community integration, there was a small but significant decrease in social networks in all three groups currently vs. pre-COVID. RHV showed a small but significant increase in independent living relative to pre-COVID ratings. Finally, RHV had greater levels of intolerance of uncertainty compared to PSY and CTL. Conclusions: Our results indicate that vulnerable and non-vulnerable Veterans were equally negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of a disproportionate effect of the pandemic on the vulnerable groups may be due to the availability and utilization of comprehensive VA services available to vulnerable Veterans (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","output":"Clinical and functional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing on Veterans with psychotic disorders and recently-housed Veterans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, requires the rapid development of novel antiviral drugs that would contribute to an effective treatment alongside vaccines. Drug repurposing and development of new molecules targeting numerous viral targets have already led to promising drug candidates. To this end, versatile molecular scaffolds with high functionalization capabilities play a key role. Starting with the clinically used conformationally flexible HIV-1 protease inhibitors that inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and bind major protease 3CL(pro), we designed and synthesized a series of rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octenes fused to N-substituted succinimides to test whether this core scaffold could support the development of non-covalent 3CL(pro) inhibitors. Inhibition assays confirmed that some compounds can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease; the most promising compound 11a inhibited 3CL(pro) in micromolar range (IC(50) = 102.2 M). Molecular simulations of the target-ligand complex in conjunction with dynophore analyses and endpoint free energy calculations provide additional insight and first recommendations for future optimization. The fused bicyclo[2.2.2]octenes can be used as a new potential starting point in the development of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) protease inhibitors and the study also substantiates the potential of this versatile scaffold for the development of biologically active molecules.","output":"Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Fused Bicyclo[2.2.2]octene as a Potential Core Scaffold for the Non-Covalent Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(pro) Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Usage-based accounts of language acquisition suggest that bilingual language proficiency is dynamic and susceptible to changes in language use.

Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 from reported cases is challenging due to heterogeneous testing rates. We estimated the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazil on a national and regional level using digital technology. Methods: We used a web-based application to perform a population-based survey from March 21st to August 29th, 2020 in Brazil. We obtained responses from 243 461 individuals across all federative units, who answered questions on COVID-19-related symptoms, chronic diseases and address of residence. COVID-19 was defined as at least one of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea and nasal flaring, associated with a history of close contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in the previous 14 days. A stratified two-stage weighted survey analysis was performed to estimate the population level prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Results: After calibration weighing, we estimated that 10 339 461 cases of COVID-19 occurred, yielding a 2.75 estimated infection per officially reported case. Estimated/reported ratios varied across Brazilian states and were higher in states with lower human development indexes. Areas with lower income levels displayed higher rates of COVID-19 cases (66 vs 38 cases/1000 people in the lowest and highest income strata respectively, p<0.001), but presented lower rates of COVID-19 testing. Conclusion: In this population-based survey using digital technology in Brazil, we estimated that the COVID-19 case rates were 2.75 times higher than officially reported.

Given the need to rapidly increase testing coverage, we undertook an exercise to explore and quantify interventions to increase the daily real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based testing capacity over the next few months. The objective of this exercise was to prepare a potential plan to scale-up COVID-19 testing in India in the public sector. Methods: Potential increase in daily testing capacity of the existing public laboratories was calculated across the three base scenarios of shifts (9, 16 and 24 h). Additional testing capacity was added for each shift scenario based on interventions ranging from procurement of additional qRT-PCR machines, leveraging spare capacity on available qRT-PCR machines not drafted into COVID-19 testing, to in-laboratory process optimization efforts. Results: Moving to a 24 h working model in the existing approved laboratories can enhance the daily testing capacity to 40,464 tests/day. The capacity can be further bolstered by leveraging qRT-PCR and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-based machines available with the Multidisciplinary Research Units (MRUs), National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP). Using combination/multiplex kits, and provision of automated RNA extraction platforms at all laboratories could also optimize run time and contribute to capacity increase by 1.5-2 times. Interpretation & conclusions: Adopting these interventions could help increase public sector's daily testing capacity to nearly 100,000-120,000 tests/day. It is important to note that utilization of the scaled-up testing capacity will require deployment of additional workforce, procurement of corresponding commodities for testing and scale-up of sample collection and transportation efforts.","output":"Strategic planning to augment the testing capacity for COVID-19 in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have read with interest the article \\"Gender issues during the times of Covid-19 pandemic\\" by Grisold W [1] and we found it significant in the context of the present pandemic.

Current screening and response protocols using rRT-PCR in homeless shelters are expensive, require specialized staff and have delays in returning results and implementing responses. METHODS: We piloted a program to offer frequent, rapid antigen-based tests (BinaxNOW) to residents and staff of congregate-living shelters in San Francisco, California, from January 15(th) to February 19(th), 2021. We used the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the implementation. RESULTS: Reach: We offered testing at ten of twelve eligible shelters. Shelter residents and staff had variable participation across shelters; approximately half of eligible individuals tested at least once; few tested consistently during the study. Effectiveness: 2.2% of participants tested positive. We identified three outbreaks, but none exceeded 5 cases. All BinaxNOW-positive participants were isolated or left the shelters. Adoption: We offered testing to all eligible participants within weeks of the projects initiation. Implementation: Adaptations made to increase reach and improve consistency were promptly implemented. Maintenance: San Francisco Department of Public Health expanded and maintained testing with minimal support after the end of the pilot. CONCLUSION: Rapid and frequent antigen testing for SARS-CoV2 in homeless shelters is a viable alternative to rRT-PCR testing that can lead to immediate isolation of infectious individuals.

The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. To solve this problem, we have opted for the rational design of candidate vaccines in order to study the structure of the three-dimensional (3D) S1 spicule protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass H120, through molecular modeling, using the I-TASSER server, then the COACH, and another Meta server to determine and predict the common immunogenic active sites between these two IBV strains circulating in Morocco. The obtained results showed that the two strains studied had identical spatial conformation of the S1 protein structure with a similarity percentage of 81% and an average stability of the modeled sequences.

Laboratory evaluation revealed leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein; imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis and an acute pulmonary viral infection. Though he lacked diffuse peritonitis on physical examination or a leukocytosis, he was found to have perforated appendicitis in the operating room. Our second patient was another 12-year-old male whose suspected appendicitis was confirmed via ultrasound and surgery. He tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior and he continued to test positive for infection on admission without any associated respiratory symptoms. Our third patient was a 13-year-old patient who also presented with symptomatic acute appendicitis without apparent COVID-19 manifestations. These cases provide further examples of pediatric patients with concomitant acute appendicitis and COVID-19 infection, namely an unusual presentation of perforated appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19-related pulmonary infection and the more common acute appendicitis with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection.","output":"Concurrent COVID-19 infection in children with acute appendicitis: a report of three cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective, but some individuals experience unpleasant reactions to vaccination.

However, these patients often have substantial co-morbidities and it is essential to understand whether cardiac abnormalities represent preexisting disease or are the consequence of COVID-19. Objective To determine the contribution and cardiac impact of co-morbidities in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Methods In a prospective observational study, adult patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited from the Edinburgh Heart Centre between May and November 2020 and compared to healthy and co-morbidity-matched volunteers. Patients underwent gadolinium and manganeseenhanced magnetic resonance imaging and coronary computed tomography angiography. Results Twenty-three patients (5411 years, 20 male) who recovered from COVID-19 were recruited. Half (n=11, 48%) required admission to the intensive care unit and a third (n=7, 31%) received non-invasive or invasive ventilation. Patients had a high prevalence of known cardiovascular disease (n=18, 78%), associated risk factors (n=11, 45%) and coronary artery disease (n=8, 35%). Compared with younger healthy volunteers (n=10), myocardial native T1 values (1202 25 versus 116227 ms, P=0.008, figure 1) and extracellular volume fraction (31.91.7 versus 29.80.5 %, P=0.001, figure 1) were higher with no differences in manganese uptake. Compared to co-morbidity-matched volunteers (n=20), there were no differences in native T1 values (120225 versus 119639 ms, P=0.61, figure 1), extracellular volume fraction (31.91.7 versus 31.00.5 %, P=0.11), presence of late gadolinium enhancement or manganese uptake. These findings remained irrespective of COVID-19 disease severity, presence of concomitant myocardial injury or coronary artery disease. Conclusions Patients who have recovered following hospitalization with COVID-19 have no evidence of a major excess in myocardial injury or dysfunction compared to co-morbiditymatched volunteers. The presence of co-morbidities likely explains many of the previously reported myocardial abnormalities.","output":"Multi-modality imaging in survivors of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand had almost depleted its critical care resources, particularly ICU beds and ventilators. This prompted the necessity to develop a national guideline for resource allocation. This paper describes the development process of a national guideline for critical resource allocation in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The guideline development process consisted of three steps (1) rapid review of existing rationing guidelines and literature;(2) interviews of Thai clinicians experienced in caring for COVID-19 cases;and (3) multi-stakeholder consultations. At steps 1 and 2, data was synthesized and categorized using a thematic and content analysis approach and this guided the formulation of the draft guideline. Within Step 3, the draft Thai critical care allocation guideline was debated and finalized before entering the policy-decision stage. Results: : Three-order prioritization criteria consisting of (1) clinical prognosis using four tools (Charlson Comorbidity Index, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, Frailty Assessment, and Cognitive Impairment Assessment);(2) number of life years saved;and (3) social usefulness, were proposed by the research team based on literature reviews and interviews. At consultations, stakeholders rejected using life years as a criterion due to potential age and gender discrimination, as well as social utility due to a concern it would foster public distrust as this judgment can be arbitrary. It was agreed that attending physician is required to be the decision maker in the Thai medico-legal context while a patient review committee would play an advisory role. Allocation decisions are to be documented for transparency and no appealing mechanism is to be applied.This guideline will be triggered only when demand exceeds supply after the utmost efforts to mobilize surge capacity. Once implemented, it is applicable to all patients, COVID-19 and non-COVID-19, requiring critical care resources prior to ICU admission and during ICU stay. Conclusions: : The guideline development process for the allocation of critical care resources in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand was informed by scientific evidence, medico-legal context, existing norms and societal values to reduce risk of public distrust given the sensitive nature of the issue and ethical dilemmas of the guiding principle though it was conducted at recorded speed. Our lessons can provide an insight for the development of similar prioritization guidelines, especially in other LMICs.","output":"Developing a Thai national critical-care allocation guideline during the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review and stakeholders consultation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA), also known as Parsonage Turner Syndrome is often triggered by mechanical stress or upper respiratory tract viral infections. We reported 2 cases of shoulder weakness and amyotrophy related to spinal accessory nerve (SAN) palsy due to neuralgic amyotrophy occurring after COVID-19 infection. Methods For both patients, clinical history, clinical examination, electrodiagnostic (EDX), and imaging examinations invalidated other diagnoses but confirmed NA diagnosis. Results The NA involved only the SAN in both cases. EDX revealed a characteristic axonal lesion found in NA. SAN conduction study revealed normal latencies and low compound motor action potential amplitude for trapezius muscle when needle examination demonstrated a neurogenic pattern and denervation signs in the trapezius muscle. Both patient's MRI revealed denervation T2 hyper signal in impaired muscles, and hyper signal of the involved roots, trunks, or nerves without any mass, cyst, injury, fibrous band, or tearing signs along SAN course.

However, there has been no discussion of what may induce intravascular coagulation. Platelets are critical in the formation of thrombi and their most potent trigger is platelet activating factor (PAF), first characterized by Demopoulos and colleagues in 1979. PAF is produced by cells involved in host defense and its biological actions bear similarities with COVID-19 disease manifestations. PAF can also stimulate perivascular mast cell activation, leading to inflammation implicated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Mast cells are plentiful in the lungs and are a rich source of PAF and of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and IL-6, which may contribute to COVID-19 and especially SARS. The histamine-1 receptor antagonist rupatadine was developed to have anti-PAF activity, and also inhibits activation of human mast cells in response to PAF. Rupatadine could be repurposed for COVID-19 prophylaxis alone or together with other PAF-inhibitors of natural origin such as the flavonoids quercetin and luteolin, which have antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-PAF actions.","output":"COVID-19, microthromboses, inflammation, and platelet activating factor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden emergence of COVID-19 has brought significant challenges to the care of Veterans. An improved ability to predict a patients clinical course would facilitate optimal care decisions, resource allocation, family counseling, and strategies for safely easing distancing restrictions. The Care Assessment Need (CAN) score is an existing risk assessment tool within the Veterans Health Administration (VA), and produces a score from 0 to 99, with a higher score correlating to a greater risk. The model was originally designed for the nonacute outpatient setting and is automatically calculated from structured data variables in the electronic health record. This multisite retrospective study of 6591 Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020 was designed to assess the utility of repurposing the CAN score as objective and automated risk assessment tool to promptly enhance clinical decision making for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. We performed bivariate analyses on the dichotomized CAN 1-year mortality score (high vs. low risk) and each patient outcome using Chi-square tests of independence. Logistic regression models using the continuous CAN score were fit to assess its predictive power for outcomes of interest. Results demonstrated that a CAN score greater than 50 was significantly associated with the following outcomes after positive COVID-19 test: hospital admission (OR 4.6), prolonged hospital stay (OR 4.5), ICU admission (3.1), prolonged ICU stay (OR 2.9), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.6), and mortality (OR 7.2). Repurposing the CAN score offers an efficient way to risk-stratify COVID-19 Veterans.

To ease some of these concerns, mainstream social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook refined their content moderation systems to support soft moderation interventions. Soft moderation interventions refer to warning labels that are attached to potentially questionable or harmful content with the goal of informing other users about the content and its nature, while the content remains accessible, hence alleviating concerns related to censorship and free speech. In this work, we perform one of the first empirical studies on soft moderation interventions on Twitter. Using a mixed-methods approach, we study the users that are sharing tweets with warning labels on Twitter and their political leaning, the engagement that these tweets receive, and how users interact with tweets that have warning labels. Among other things, we find that 72% of the tweets with warning labels are shared by Republicans, while only 11% are shared by Democrats. By analyzing content engagement, we find that tweets with warning labels tend to receive more engagement. Also, we qualitatively analyze how users interact with content that has warning labels finding that the most popular interactions are related to further debunking false claims, mocking the author or content of the disputed tweet, and further reinforcing or resharing false claims. Finally, we describe concrete examples of inconsistencies such as warning labels that are incorrectly added or warning labels that are not added on tweets despite sharing questionable and potentially harmful information.","output":"\\"I Won the Election!\\": An Empirical Analysis of Soft Moderation Interventions on Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To map the transition process from the perspective of pediatricians and their adolescent patients, and to suggest a transition protocol. METHODS: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted in a pediatric outpatient clinic of a public tertiary hospital. Pediatricians answered a questionnaire about the transition process, and that was evaluated in a descriptive manner. The Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) on health autonomy was answered by the adolescents and the analysis was performed using the (2) and Mann-Whitney tests. p<0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: 31 pediatricians (16 residents, 15 supervisors) were enrolled, with a mean age of 40.1 (16.9), 87% women, with years working in Pediatrics ranging from 2 to 45 years (median of 5 years). Most doctors agreed that there was no transition plan, but they stimulated the patients autonomy and talked to the patient and family members about any existing chronic diseases. A total of 102 adolescent patients participated, with a median age of 15; 56% were female. The TRAQ median was 58, with similar scores between females and males, and higher scores in those older than 16 years of age (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.01). The patients reported ease in face-to-face communication with their doctors, but great difficulty in talking about health issues over the phone. CONCLUSIONS: Even without a transition protocol, adolescents developed several self-care skills as they aged.

Although their pathogenesis is unclear, evidences link them to viral neuroinvasive potential. This study aims at estimating the prevalence of OCMT in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and investigating its clinical correlates. METHODS: In a single-institution retrospective cross-sectional study, we included all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 undergoing head CT scan for any reason. Exclusion criteria were history of recent head trauma or chronic rhinosinusitis; opacification > 2 mm in any sinonasal space other than the olfactory cleft; CT performed during/after invasive ventilation or feeding via nasogastric tube. We recorded the prevalence of OCMT and related it to age, sex, need for invasive ventilation during hospital stay, outcome, length of hospital stay, diffusion of lung SARS-CoV-19 lesions and outcome. RESULTS: 63 eligible patients were identified (39 male, 24 female; median age 77.82  17.77 years). OCMT was identified in 16 patients (25.4%; 95% CI 15.3C37.9%). Patients with OCMT had longer hospital stays (median 16  4 vs. 9  14.5 days, p = .009, MannCWhitney U test) and required invasive ventilation more frequently than patients without mucosal thickening (OR 4.89, 95% CI 0.96C24.89, p = .063, Fishers test).

The impact of demographic, clinical, cognitive, and genetic factors on functioning has been shown individually; however, as a complex phenomenon, a global approach to identify the most relevant as well as possible interactions is needed. METHODS: 102 patients with type I BD in euthymia were invited for evaluation of demographic, clinical, and cognitive characteristics as well as genotype for Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF gene to determine those associated with poor functioning according to the FAST scale cut-off score. Clinical evaluation included assessment of residual affective symptoms and anxiety. Cognitive evaluation included the COBRA scale, verbal memory, and executive functions testing. RESULTS: Residual depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive complaints and being a Met carrier were more frequent in the poor functioning group and were entered in a logistic regression model. Being a Met carrier (OR=4.46, CI=1.19-16.67) and cognitive complaints (OR=1.29, CI= 1.13-1.46) were the most important predictors of poor functioning in type I BD.

AIM: To evaluate the research activity in sleeve gastrectomy over the last two decades, and to visualize the hot spots and emerging trends in this type of bariatric surgery using bibliometric methods. METHODS: The Scopus database was used to search for publications related to sleeve gastrectomy. The retrieved publications were reviewed in terms of year of publication, type of study, country of origin, institutions, journals, and citation patterns by using descriptive analysis. Collaboration network and term co-occurrence analysis were visualized by using VOSviewer software. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded a total of 6508 publications on sleeve gastrectomy from 2001 to 2020. As regards the document type, the majority were articles (n = 5230; 80.36%), followed by reviews (n = 544; 8.36%). The top three countries are the United States, with 1983 publications (30.47%), followed by France (600; 9.22%) and Italy (417; 6.71%). The most cited publication was published in 2012 by Schauer et al in the New England Journal of Medicine (n = 1435 citations). This publication found that weight loss was greater in the sleeve gastrectomy group than in the medical therapy group. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that 12 mo of medical therapy plus bariatric surgery greatly improved glycemic regulation in obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes compared with medical therapy alone. The focus of the current literature on sleeve gastrectomy was directed toward several themes such as morbidity and potential complications, the complexity of the procedure and different surgical approaches, and diabetes and body mass index in correlation to sleeve gastrectomy. CONCLUSION: The number of sleeve gastrectomy publications has gradually grown over the last 20 years.

COVID-19 has amplified population health inequalities, and there is concern that people with SMI will be disproportionately affected. Understanding how health risk behaviours have changed during the pandemic is important when developing strategies to mitigate future increases in health inequalities. METHODS: We sampled from an existing cohort of people with SMI. Researchers contacted participants by phone or post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic had affected them. We asked people about their health risk behaviours and how these had changed during the pandemic. We created an index of changed behaviours, comprising dietary factors, smoking, lack of exercise, and drinking patterns. By creating data linkages, we compared their responses during pandemic restrictions to responses they gave prior to the pandemic. OUTCOMES: 367 people provided health risk data. The mean age of the participants was 50.5 (range = 20 to 86, SD  15.69) with 51.0% male and 77.4% white British. 47.5% of participants reported taking less physical activity during the pandemic and of those who smoke 54.5% reported smoking more heavily.

Despite these differences in processing, the perceptual experience of humans is remarkably stable and continuous across the visual field. Research in the last decade has shown that processing in peripheral and foveal vision is not independent, but is more directly connected than previously thought. We address three core questions on how peripheral and foveal vision interact, and review recent findings on potentially related phenomena that could provide answers to these questions. First, how is the processing of peripheral and foveal signals related during fixation? Peripheral signals seem to be processed in foveal retinotopic areas to facilitate peripheral object recognition, and foveal information seems to be extrapolated toward the periphery to generate a homogeneous representation of the environment. Second, how are peripheral and foveal signals re-calibrated? Transsaccadic changes in object features lead to a reduction in the discrepancy between peripheral and foveal appearance. Third, how is peripheral and foveal information stitched together across saccades? Peripheral and foveal signals are integrated across saccadic eye movements to average percepts and to reduce uncertainty.

This meta-analysis used a random-effects model to estimate the prevalence of PTSS. Subgroup analysis were conducted to analyze the source of heterogeneity. Meta-regression model was used to calculate the proportion of the variance explained by subgroup moderators. RESULTS: Forty eligible studies (n = 15,538) were identified. The results revealed a pooled prevalence of PTSS of 17.0% (95%CI: 13.5%C21.2%), higher than that of previous epidemiological survey, with high between-studies heterogeneity (Q = 1199, I(2) = 96.75%, p < .001).

Using health registry data, we describe the disease profiles of persons who died after a confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the first three months of the pandemic in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR) and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) were linked to information on positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) and on deaths from the National Population Register. The data retrieval included the Norwegian population as of 1 March 2020 with data for confirmed infections, hospitalisations and deaths until 31 May 2020. RESULTS Of 8 412 persons with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, altogether 244 (2.9 %) died, whereof 133 (55 %) were men. Among those with a confirmed infection, the proportion who died varied from 0.2 % (age < 60 years) to 52 % (age  90 years). Altogether 92 (38 %) patients died in hospital. 25 (16 %) of those who died elsewhere had previously been hospitalised for COVID-19.

Dynamical analysis of the system has been performed in context to the equilibria along with local and global stability analysis of the system simultaneously visualizing the effect on capital stabilization. The global stability analysis has been performed using graph-theoretic method. Curve-Fit has been performed for the system using optimization algorithm. The relation between all the parameters and variables involved in the model has been explored by calculating sensitivity indices which gives us the proportion that a relative change in a parameter brings to the relative change in a variable. Our findings reveal that (1) Vaccination instigates economic growth (with evidence of data obtained for 24 countries).

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of underlying diseases and associated comorbidities in COVID-19 patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Major biomedical electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched for all relevant literature published in English from January to July 2020. Cross-sectional and retrospective studies reporting the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as acute cardiac injury, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, shock, acute respiratory disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. After selecting eligible studies, two authors extracted data of each study, independently, and any inconsistency was resolved through discussion with the third reviewer until reaching a consensus. The risk of bias was assessed by two independent research experts using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The variance in the meta-analyses on prevalence was stabilized by double arcsine transformations. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of acute respiratory injury in patients with COVID-19 was estimated as 34% (95% Cl: 10 C 57%). Also, the prevalence of acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and shock were estimated as 10% (95% Cl: 6 - 14%), 19% (95% Cl: 10 - 27%), 23 % (95% Cl: 19 - 27%), and 12 % (95% Cl: 5 C 19 %). CONCLUSION: According to this meta-analysis, comorbidities such as hypertension, acute liver and kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, diabetes, and coronary heart disease seem to be a predisposing factor for symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infection.","output":"The Prevalence of Underlying Diseases and Comorbidities in COVID-19 Patients; an Updated Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beginning a new career as a subject matter expert in Infection Prevention (IP) can be challenging.

Socially isolated breast cancer survivors have a 43% higher risk of recurrence and a 64% higher risk of breast cancer-specific mortality than socially integrated survivors. Since Covid-19 has dramatically increased the incidence of social isolation, it is important to determine if social isolation affects the response to endocrine therapy and/or recurrence after the therapy is completed. Further, since previous studies indicate that social isolation increases circulating inflammatory cytokines, we investigated if an anti-inflammatory herbal mixture Jaeumkanghwa-tang (JEKHT) prevents the adverse effects of social isolation on breast cancer mortality. METHODS: Estrogen receptor positive mammary tumors were initiated with 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. When a rat developed a palpable mammary tumor, it was either socially isolated (SI) by housing it singly or a rat was allowed to remain group-housed (GH). Tamoxifen (340ppm via diet) or tamoxifen + JEKHT (500ppm via drinking water) started when the first mammary tumor was detected. Tamoxifen administration ended when a complete response to this therapy had lasted for 9 weeks (corresponds to 5 years in women). Rats which received JEKHT during tamoxifen therapy continued to take it also after tamoxifen therapy ended. RESULTS: During tamoxifen therapy, social isolation non-significantly reduced the rate of complete responses to 21%, from 31% in GH group (p>0.05). After the therapy was completed, SI significantly increased local mammary tumor recurrence (p<0.001;45% GH vs 75% SI). RNAseq analysis was performed in the mammary glands, since only tamoxifen resistant or recurring mammary tumors were available for analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of transcriptome showed that the increased recurrence risk in socially isolated rats was associated with an enrichment of IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling: this result was confirmed in the tumors. In addition, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway was suppressed: the suppressed genes included those involved in mitochondrial pyruvate transport and conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA as well as genes in the TCA cycle and mediating electron transport in mitochondrial complexes I-IV. Despite the reduction in pyruvate transporting and converting genes, lactate levels or lactate dehydrogenase activity were not increased in socially isolated rats, indicating no changes in Warburg effect. Social isolation also increased the expression of inflammatory receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) (p0.05). Consumption of an anti-inflammatory JEKHT inhibited IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling, upregulated OXPHOS signaling and prevented the increased risk of mammary cancer recurrence in socially isolated animals. The percentage of recurrences in the SI rats dropped from 75% without JEKHT to 22% with JEKHT (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Breast cancer mortality among socially isolated survivors may be most effectively prevented by focusing on the period following endocrine therapy using tools that inhibit IL6/JAK/STAT3 inflammatory cytokine signaling and correct disrupted OXPHOS and mitochondrial dysfunction.","output":"Social isolation promotes mammary cancer recurrence, increases IL6/JAK/STAT3 signaling and causes mitochondrial dysfunction in tamoxifen treated rats, and a traditional herbal mixture reverses all these changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 variants found in several strains from the UK, South Africa and Brazil has been linked to increased transmission.

A random selected line was employed as a control (CTL) comparison group for both CHF and CLF lines of animals. The present study performed Fos immunochemistry to investigate changes in neural activity in different brain structures among CHF and CLF rats when they were exposed to contextual cues that were previously associated with footshock. RESULTS: The study indicated that CHF rats expressed high Fos expression in the locus coeruleus, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and lateral portion of the septal area and low Fos expression in the medial portion of the septal area, dentate gyrus, and prelimbic cortex (PL) compared to CTL animals. CLF rats exhibited a decrease in Fos expression in the PVN, PL, and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and increase in the cingulate and perirhinal cortices compared to CTL animals.

Although regenerating forests recover biomass, biodiversity, and processes with time, the recovery trajectories may be uncertain due to past disturbances. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge to sustain the effectiveness of passive regeneration for the recovery of riparian forests and the adjacent waterbodies in the tropics, which may compromise the outcomes of ongoing and future tropical riparian restoration programs. We evaluated the drivers of riparian forest structural recovery and how this relates to stream conditions in 12 abandoned pasturelands in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. These pasturelands range across regeneration age (pasture (PA) - 0 to 4a?years; young regeneration (YR) - 8 to 12a?years; old regeneration (OR) - 18 to 22a?years) and years of past land-use (PA - 23.25 average years of past land-use, YR - 18.25, OR - 7). We compared the conditions of these sites to 4 reference sites with conserved forests (REF, >100a?years), where there was no recorded pasture use in the past. Short-term responses of forests and streams to passive regeneration indicated high ecosystem resilience after low to intermediate past land-use intensity, reflected in the improvement of stream ecosystems. Such high resilience is possibly attributable to low- to intermediate-intensity pasture-related disturbances, remaining forest matrix, and residual structures (e.g. roots, sprouts, and in-stream wood) observed in the area. Our results suggest a recovery by 12 to 20a?years for riparian forests of this region. However, areas degraded by intensive land-use apparently showed delayed recovery. We conclude that seizing resilience windows (defined here as the period when ecosystems retain high potential resilience) is essential to foster passive recovery of riparian forests and streams more cost-effectively in the tropics.","output":"Seizing resilience windows to foster passive recovery in the forest-water interface in Amazonian lands"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The amplitude of Fourier spectra for natural scenes falls with spatial frequency (f) and is described by the equation, 1/f, where exponent  corresponds to the slope of the spectral drop-off.

Design/methodology/approach: This study compiled 26 COVID-19-related solutions designed for AM spanning three categories: (1) face shields (N = 6), (2) face masks (N = 12) and (3) hands-free door openers (N = 8). These solutions were assessed for (1) DfAM utilization, (2) manufacturing efficiency and (3) creativity. The relationships between these assessments were then computed using generalized linear models to investigate the influence of DfAM utilization on manufacturing efficiency and creativity. Findings: It is observed that (1) unique and original designs scored lower in their AM suitability, (2) solutions with higher complexity scored higher on usefulness and overall creativity and (3) solutions with higher complexity had higher build cost, build time and material usage. These findings highlight the need to account for both opportunistic and restrictive DfAM when evaluating solutions designed for AM. Balancing the two DfAM perspectives can support the development of solutions that are creative and consume fewer build resources. Originality/value: DfAM evaluation tools primarily focus on AM limitations to help designers avoid build failures. This paper proposes the need to assess designs for both, their opportunistic and restrictive DfAM utilization to appropriately assess the manufacturing efficiency of designs and to realize the creative potential of adopting AM. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Maximizing design potential: investigating the effects of utilizing opportunistic and restrictive design for additive manufacturing in rapid response solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has been declared by the World Health Organization as an emerging public health problem of global importance and classified as a pandemic.

Follow-up data was collected post-hospital discharge using self-reported questionnaires. The main outcome measures were self-reported fatigue severity and the prevalence of severe fatigue (severity >7/10) 3 and 12-months post-hospital discharge. Results Covid-19 IMV-patients were significantly younger with less prior comorbidity, and more males, than pre-pandemic IMV-patients.

This study showed that vitamin C supplementation had no consistent effect on the severity of respiratory illness (SMD 0?14, 95% CI -0?02 to 0?30: I2 = 22%, P=0?09). However, our study revealed that vitamin-C group had a considerably shorter duration of respiratory infection (SMD -0?36, 95% CI -0?62 to -0?09, P = 0?01). Interpretation: The benefits of normal vitamin C supplementation for reducing the duration of respiratory tract illness were supported by our meta-analysis findings. Since few trials have examined the effects of therapeutic supplementation, further therapeutic trials are required to examine the role of vitamin C in the treatment of respiratory infection especially COVID-19 infection.

Clinical and epidemiologic evidence supports this association. The application of molecular diagnostic methods has improved understanding of viral epidemiology and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in viral induced acute asthma. This article reviews publications since October 2002 for an update of the role of viruses in exacerbations of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory viruses are present in most patients hospitalized for life-threatening asthma and acute non life-threatening asthma. Rhinovirus is the most common, but coinfection with other viruses may be important. Patients with asthma are not more susceptible to upper respiratory tract rhinovirus infections than healthy people but suffer from more severe consequences of the lower respiratory tract infection. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that viruses provoke asthma attacks by additive or synergistic interactions with allergen exposure or with air pollution. An impaired antiviral immunity to rhinovirus may lead to impaired viral clearance and hence prolonged symptoms. Respiratory viral infections cause asthmatic exacerbations by triggering recruitment of Th2-type cells into the lungs. There is no specific antiviral strategy for prevention of respiratory-triggered asthma exacerbations, although clinical trials of potential antiviral agents are ongoing. Indirect prevention strategies focus on the reduction of overall airway inflammation to reduce the severity of the host response to respiratory viral infections. SUMMARY Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in asthma. There is a lack of specific antiviral strategies in the prevention or reduction of viral-triggered asthma exacerbations. Recent advances in understanding of the epidemiology and immunopathogenesis of respiratory viral infection in asthma provide opportunities or identification of specific targets for antiviral agents and strategies for management and prevention.","output":"Viruses in asthma exacerbations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused drastic changes in healthcare and severe social restrictions. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on the front line against the virus and have been highly exposed to pandemic-related stressors, but there are limited data on their psychological involvement for a large sample in Italy. AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of anxiety, distress and burnout in HCWs of North-West Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to detect potential psychosocial factors associated with their emotional response. METHOD: This cross-sectional, survey-based study enrolled 797 HCWs. Participants completed the Impact of Event Scale C Revised, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory C Form Y and the Maslach Burnout Inventory; demographic, family and work characteristics were also collected. Global psychological outcome, differences among professions and independent factors associated with worst psychological outcome were assessed. RESULTS: Almost a third of the sample had severe state anxiety and distress, high emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, and low personal accomplishment. Distress was higher in women and nurses, whereas depersonalisation was higher in men. Family division, increased workload, job changes and frequent contact with COVID-19 were associated with worst psychological outcome. Trait anxiety was associated with significantly higher risk for developing state anxiety, distress and burnout. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated psychological burden related to the COVID-19 pandemic was observed in HCWs of North-West Italy. The identification of family and work characteristics and a psychological pre-existing condition as factors associated with worst psychological outcome may help provide a tailored, preventive, organisational and psychological approach in counteracting the psychological effects of future pandemics.","output":"COVID-19 pandemic-related anxiety, distress and burnout: prevalence and associated factors in healthcare workers of North-West Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defence against virus infection.

In spite of progress in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 activates antiviral responses, mechanistic studies into wildtype SARS-CoV-2-mediated induction and inhibition of human type I IFN responses are scarce. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a type I IFN response in vitro and in moderate cases of COVID-19. In vitro stimulation of type I IFN expression and signaling in human airway epithelial cells is associated with activation of canonical transcriptions factors, and SARS-CoV-2 is unable to inhibit exogenous induction of these responses. Furthermore, we show that physiological levels of IFN detected in patients with moderate COVID-19 is sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway cells.","output":"Experimental and natural evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced activation of type I interferon responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the effect of school closure on the occurrence of respiratory infection among children ages 6-12 years and its impact on health care services.

The incidence of IRP in women is approximately three times that in men. IRP is mainly treated by surgery, which can be divided into two categories: Abdominal procedures and perineal procedures. This study offers a better procedure for the treatment of IRP. AIM To compare the clinical efficacy of laparoscopic integral pelvic floor/ligament repair (IPFLR) combined with a procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) and the laparoscopic IPFLR alone in the treatment of IRP in women. METHODS This study collected the clinical data of 130 female patients with IRP who underwent surgery from January 2012 to October 2014. The patients were divided into groups A and B. Group A had 63 patients who underwent laparoscopic IPFLR alone, and group B had 67 patients who underwent the laparoscopic IPFLR combined with PPH. The degree of internal rectal prolapse (DIRP), Wexner constipation scale (WCS) score, Wexner incontinence scale (WIS) score, and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) score were compared between groups and within groups before surgery and 6 mo and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS All laparoscopic surgeries were successful. The general information, number of bowel movements before surgery, DIRP, GIQLI score, WIS score, and WCS score before surgery were not significantly different between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The WCS score, WIS score, GIQLI score, and DIRP in each group 6 mo, and 2 years after surgery were significantly better than before surgery (P < 0.001). In group A, the DIRP and WCS score gradually improved from 6 mo to 2 years after surgery (P < 0.001), and the GIQLI score progressively improved from 6 mo to 2 years after surgery (P < 0.05). In group B, the DIRP, WCS score and WIS score significantly improved from 6 mo to 2 years after surgery (P < 0.05), and the GIQLI score 2 years after surgery was significantly higher than that 6 mo after surgery (P < 0.05). The WCS score, WIS score, GIQLI score, and DIRP of group B were significantly better than those of group A 6 mo and 2 years after surgery (all P < 0.001, Bonferroni) except DIRP at 2 years after surgery. There was a significant difference in the recurrence rate of IRP between the two groups 6 mo after surgery (P = 0.011).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic in 2020. Patients with metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are often obese and have additional metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of respiratory diseases and of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the association between MAFLD and COVID-19 severity. Methods 214 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 18 and 75 years from three hospitals in Wenzhou, China were consecutively enrolled. Sixty-six patients with MAFLD were included in the final analysis. COVID-19 was diagnosed as a positive result by high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. COVID-19 severity was assessed during hospitalization and classified as severe and non-severe based on the current management guideline. All patients were screened for fatty liver by computed tomography and subsequently diagnosed as MAFLD according to a recent set of consensus diagnostic criteria. Obesity was defined as BMI >25 kg/m2. Results The presence of obesity in MAFLD patients was associated with a ~ 6-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness (unadjusted-OR 5.77, 95% CI 1.19C27.91, p = .029). Notably, this association with obesity and COVID-19 severity remained significant (adjusted-OR 6.32, 95% CI 1.16C34.54, p = .033) even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.

Evidence indicates that CTs can be effective, but overall impacts are small in magnitude. This paper substantially updates the evidence base on the effectiveness of CTs and moderating factors. METHODS: Building on a prior search done in 2018, we searched articles published between January 2018 and March 2021 using Agris, Econlit, Eldis, IBSS, IDEAS, IFPRI, Google Scholar, PubMed and World Bank databases. We included studies using quantitative impact evaluation methods of CTs with sample sizes over 300, targeted to households with children under 5 years conducted with clear counterfactuals in countries with gross domestic product below US$10 000 at baseline. We performed meta-analysis using random effects models to assess the impact of CT programme on selected child nutrition outcomes. FINDINGS: Out of 1561 articles identified, 55 additional articles were eligible for inclusion for a total of 129 estimates. We find that CTs have significant although modest effects on height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) (0.024, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.044; p<0.02); stunting (?1.35%, 95% CI ?2.35 to ? 0.35; p<0;01); wasting (?1.31%, 95% CI ?2.16% to 0.46%; p<0.01); animal-source foods (6.72%, 95% CI 5.24% to 8.20%; p<0.01); diet diversity (0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.81; p<0.01) and diarrhoea incidence (? 1.74%, 95% CI ?2.79% to ?0.68%; p<0.05). There was no significant effect of CTs on weight-for-height (WHZ) or weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ). Well-targeted behaviour change communication was also effective in improving HAZ and decreasing the prevalence of diarrhoea.

A total of 27 patients underwent surgical resection; these patients demonstrated a longer median OS compared to those who did not (50.8 months vs 5.5 months, P < 0.001). The prognosis of patients with ICC can be stratified by ALBI grade (grade 1: 54.3 months, grade 2a: 8.4 months, grade 2b: 3.9 months, and grade 3: 1.4 months; P < 0.001) and the extent of PVTT (Vp0: 54.3 months, Vp1/2: 8.4 months, Vp3/4: 3.9 months; P = 0.0039). CONCLUSION: Viral hepatitis (25.3%) was found as the background liver disease of ICC. Assessing liver function via ALBI grade is useful for stratifying prognosis of patients with ICC.

The pandemic has led to a devastating loss of life. It has shown us how infectious diseases can cause human existence at stake, and community health is important. The spike protein is the most immunogenic component of the virus. Most vaccine development strategies have focused on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the spike protein because it is the most specific target site that recognizes and interacts with human lung cells. Neutralizing antibodies are generated by the humoral immune system and reduce the viral load by binding to spike protein components. Neutralizing antibodies are the proteins secreted by plasma cells and serve as an important part of the defense mechanism. In the recent Covid-19 infection, neutralizing antibodies can be utilized for both diagnostic such as immune surveillance and therapeutic tools such as plasma therapy. So far, many monoclonal antibodies are in the clinical trial phase, and few of them are already in use. In this review, we have discussed details about neutralizing antibodies and their role in combating Covid-19 disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline CT scans and clinical and laboratory data of 72 patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia (39 men, 46.2  15.9 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline CT findings including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities, consolidation, linear opacities, and lung severity score were evaluated. The outcome event was recovery with hospital discharge. The time from symptom onset to discharge or the end of follow-up (for those remained hospitalized) was recorded. Data were censored in events such as death or discharge without recovery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to explore the association between initial CT, clinical or laboratory findings, and discharge with recovery, whereby hazard ratio (HR) values < 1 indicated a lower rate of discharge at four weeks and longer time until discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients recovered and were discharged during the study period with a median length of admission of 16 days (range, 9 to 25 days), while the rest remained hospitalized at the end of this study (median, 17.5 days; range, 4 to 27 days). None died during the study period. After controlling for age, onset time, lesion characteristics, number of lung lobes affected, and bilateral involvement, the lung severity score on baseline CT (> 4 vs. &#8804; 4 [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.41 [95% confidence interval, CI = 0.18-0.92], p = 0.031) and initial lymphocyte count (reduced vs. normal or elevated [reference]: adjusted HR = 0.14 [95% CI = 0.03-0.60], p = 0.008) were two significant independent factors that influenced recovery and discharge. CONCLUSION: Lung severity score > 4 and reduced lymphocyte count at initial evaluation were independently associated with a significantly lower rate of recovery and discharge and extended hospitalization in patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"Association between Initial Chest CT or Clinical Features and Clinical Course in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RCN has highlighted the double impact COVID-19 and flu infections could have this winter in launching its annual #BeatTheFlu campaign","output":"Campaign warns of double jeopardy winter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among the many aspects that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, two seem particularly challenging to understand: i) the great geographical differences in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality that were found in the different phases of the epidemic progression, and, ii) the potential role of the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that, in the subject-to-subject transfer, SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account, and we compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19 infection.","output":"Does blood type affect the COVID-19 infection pattern?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that the fundamental characteristics of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are respiratory manifestations, multi-organ failure including the kidney has been documented. There are no clear comparisons of COVID-19 cases with and without acute kidney injury (AKI) to show whether there are aspects of acute kidney injury progression path or outcome that are unique to this disease. METHODS: In this work, we analyzed the data of 734 COVID-19 cases admitted to the Ahmad Maher Teaching Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, between June 6 and July 25, 2020. Data on demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, and outcomes were assessed. To assess the incidence rate of AKI in Egyptian COVID-19 patients, comparisons were carried out between home-isolated COVID-19 patients, hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and ICU COVID-19-patients with or without AKI. RESULTS: AKI was more common in hospitalized mild COVID-19 patients than in home-isolated and ICU COVID-19 patients (15.0% versus 10.8% and 14.2%, respectively). The overall occurrence rate of AKI was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (n=91, 14%). Hemodialysis, on the other hand, was required in 76% of the extreme ICU COVID-19 patients who developed AKI (22/29). The absolute number of patients with AKI COVID-19 who required hemodialysis was 34 (37%). This accounted for 5.2% of all COVID-19 patients and 37% of those with AKI. The mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with or without AKI was 15.4% and 4.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: AKI in our COVID-19 patients is associated with a high mortality rate in ICU-COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 patients, particularly ICU COVID-19 patients, should be closely monitored for the development of AKI. Early identification of AKI, as well as prompt intervention, can improve COVID-19 patient outcomes.","output":"Incidence of acute kidney injury among COVID-19 patients in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Health Organization has suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through person-to-person transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces.

A few research studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential transmission of this virus through air. Although some studies have found no evidence of airborne transmission, other more recent work is proving the presence of SARS-CoV-2 even in public places. Also, the past experiences and knowledge about the mechanisms of similar viruses such as SARS-CoV support this hypothesis. It seems that the best decision at the moment is to follow a conservative approach, and accept the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is able to be transmitted through air.

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities. SUMMARY: In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards. Ultimately, the expected rebound in STI/HIV incidence will require an appropriate and timely public health response.

Strong evidence for the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group has not been published in Africa. Therefore, this protocol will be served as a guideline to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa. METHODS: Published and unpublished studies on the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa and written in any language will be included. Databases (PubMed / MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, EMBASE, Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochran Library, Africa Wide Knowledge, and Africa Index Medicus) from March to August 2020 will be searched. Two independent reviewers will select, screen, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. The proportion will be measured using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis will be conducted to manage heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias will be assessed using Eggers test and visual inspection of the funnel plots.

METHODS: This was a population-based, cross-sectional, mixed-methods study (13 May 2020-9 June 2020) of participants aged 60 years. Self-reported KAP about ten COVID-19 symptoms and six government-endorsed preventive measures were evaluated. Multivariable regression models identified sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with knowledge, attitudes and practices in our sample. Associations between knowledge/attitude scores, and practice categories were determined using logistic regression. 78 participants were interviewed qualitatively about practice of additional preventive measures and data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Mean awareness score of the symptoms was 7.2/10. Fever (93.0%) and diarrhoea (33.5%) were the most- and least-known symptoms, respectively. Most knew all six preventive measures (90.4%), perceived them as effective (78.7%), and practiced 'wear a mask' (97.2%). Indians, Malays, and those in smaller housing had poorer mean knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms scores. Older participants had poorer attitudes towards preventive measures. Compared to Chinese, Indians had lower odds of practicing 3/6 recommendations. A one-point increase in knowledge of and attitudes towards preventive measures score had higher odds of always practicing 3/6 and 2/6 measures, respectively. Qualitative interviews revealed use of other preventive measures, e.g. maintaining a healthy lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Elderly Singaporeans displayed high levels of KAP about COVID-19 and related preventive measures, with a positive association between levels of knowledge/attitude, and practice.

In this study, we studied the effect of the amino acid changes in 3CLpro of feline coronavirus from a feline patient who received antiviral treatment for prolonged duration. We generated recombinant 3CLpro containing the identified amino acid changes (N25S, A252S or K260 N) and determined their susceptibility to protease inhibitors in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The assay showed that N25S in 3CLpro confers a small change (up to 1.68-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration) in susceptibility to GC376, but other amino acid changes do not affect susceptibility. Modelling of 3CLpro carrying the amino acid changes was conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings.

Guidelines changed over time. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was unrestricted during phase 1, then restricted by pharmacy outside of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) during phase 2 (excepting those ineligible for RCTs). METHODS: This was a prospective study to assess system-wide adherence to COVID-19 treatment guidelines, and to evaluate patient outcomes. RESULTS: Of 261 patients, median age was 67 years (IQR 56C76); 49% (129/261) were male, and 45% (118/261) required ICU care. Overall, 47% (122/261) were in phase 1; HCQ was offered to 57% (69/122) during this phase. The rate of HCQ prescription in phase 2 decreased significantly to 10% (14/136), (p < 0.001). Adherence to COVID-19 treatment protocol was 97% (135/139) during phase 2. Mortality was similar in both phases (22% vs 28%, p=0.32), as was median length of stay (8 vs 7 days, p=0.3). Overall 66 patients (25%) died in the hospital; neither non-adherence (p=1) to system guidelines nor receipt of HCQ (p=0.17) were risk factors for death. Independent predictors of mortality included: new renal replacement therapy (OR 61, 95%CI 6.7C560, p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (OR 4.9, 95%CI 2.0C11, p < 0.001), abnormal chest X-ray (OR 4.3, 95%CI 1.4C12.6, p =0.009), history of heart failure (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.5C11, p=0.006), lack of fever on admission (OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.7 -7.6, p =0.001), receipt of corticosteroids (OR 2.7 95%CI 1.1C6.6, p=0.026) and increased age (OR 1.07 per year, 95%CI 1.04C1.1, p < 0.001). Bacterial pneumonia occurred in 8% (21/261), more commonly in those who died (p=0.02). Black patients had a higher race-specific death rate (308 vs 197) per 1000 than white patients (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, our health system guidelines and pharmacy restrictions were successful in delivering consistent care across hospitals. Restriction of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment to RCTs reduced its use in phase two. Non-adherence to systemic guidelines was infrequent, and not associated with adverse outcomes.

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course. The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age. Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","output":"A PATH TO RESUME AESTHETIC CARE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF PROJECT AesCert?

COVID-19 related myocarditis is increasingly identified as an underlying problem in COVID-19 patients with low ejection fraction. Early recognition is critical with a low threshold for screening echocardiogram. Utilization of cardiac MRI (CMRI) can be helpful in recognition of early manifestations of COVID-19 myocarditis, with the added benefit of avoidance of invasive testing such as endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Once diagnosis is established, disease-specific treatment can lead to rapid recovery of ventricular systolic function. We present a case series including two similar cases of COVID-19 myocarditis in which we utilized echocardiography as an early diagnostic tool and prompt treatment led to better prognosis.","output":"COVID-19 Myocarditis: Rationale for Early Diagnosis and Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Cognitive training exercises (CTE) are promising and effective interventions to enhance cognitive reserve and slowdown cognitive deterioration in people with subjective memory impairment (SCI) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this pilot study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of CTE among Egyptian adults. METHODS Eighteen participants above forty years-old were recruited. They underwent baseline neuropsychological assessment and functional assessment. However, after receiving a 6 weeks' cognitive training, eight participants (seven with MCI and one was cognitively intact) dropped out from the study. Finally, ten participants (eight participants with MCI, one with SCI and one was cognitively intact) completed twelve weeks of CTE and undergone the post assessment afterwards. CTE included visual, verbal, memory, executive function, visuospatial, attention and psychokinetic exercises through onsite and home-based sessions RESULTS: For the ten participants who completed twelve weeks of CTE, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant change in the scores of MMSE (Z= -2.546, p=.011), semantic fluency test (Z= -2.913, p=.004), SMCQ (Z= -2.913, p=.004), CERAD Word List (1st trial: Z = -2.641, p=.008;Word list recall: Z= -2.825, p=.005), construction abilities (immediate: Z= -2.121, p=.034; delayed recall: Z= -2.414, p=.016), and Digit span test (forward: Z= -2.724, p=.006; backward: Z= -2.724, p=.006).

Design/methodology/approach: Data come from the 2010 Italian wave of Continuing Vocational Training Survey (CVTS). Econometric estimates plug a proxy of labour hoarding into the probability function that firms provide either off-the-job or on-the-job training. A bivariate selectivity probit model is also used for robustness sake. Findings: Results show that labour hoarding should not be considered as an enhancer of training investments when considered as a standing-alone practice in presence of severe and deep economic downturn. However, labour hoarding does not penalize off-the-job training investments if it occurs in an innovative firm or in a firm that perceive specific skill requirements in the workforce during the recessionary period. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the debate on the role of labour hoarding during severe recessions by showing that it cannot be functional to re-oriented firms investments aimed at upskilling their workforce. It is only compatible with new training courses that accompany the workforce across a technological transition. Policy implications deals with the suitability of job retention schemes or state-financed furlough during recessions, as occurred during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. ? 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Do labour hoarding practices stimulate training investments?

We will then review the potential utility of abbreviated, cost-effective CMR protocols to improve cardiac diagnosis and care, the clinical indications of the exam, current evidence and future directions. EXPERT OPINION Rapid CMR protocols, provided that they are utilized in potentially high yield cases, could reduce cost and increase effectiveness. The adoption of these protocols, their integration into care pathways, and prioritizing key treatable diagnoses can potentially improve patient care.

Much remains unknown about 2019-nCoV, especially the additional risks that 2019-nCoV infection may pose for colon cancer patients. Many reports show that angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters host cells, and this is similar to the cell entry mechanism of SARS coronavirus. Previous studies show that ACE2 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon. In patients with colon cancer, ACE2 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to tissues from patients with other types of cancer. One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the serine protease (TMPRSS2) and AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), which also facilitates the passage of viruses into cells. Furthermore, the Database of Gene expression profiling interactive analysis suggests that expression levels for ACE2, TMPRSS2, and AAK1 are positively correlated in colon cells. Therefore, our findings predict that 2019-nCoV will create increased complications for patients with colon cancer.","output":"2019-nCoV may create complications in colon cancer patients with ACE2 expression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Time is a focal point for historical research.

In this contribution we discuss infections by influenza A (H5N1), SARS and Hanta virus. The H5N1 subtype of avian influenza (bird flu) has crossed the species barrier and causes severe illness in humans. So far, 328 humans in twelve countries have contracted the disease and 200 have died. The young are particularly affected. Oseltamivir is the antiviral drug of choice and should be given as early as possible. Patients require supportive care, often including invasive ventilation. If H5N1 develops the ability to transmit efficiently between humans, an influenza pandemic is likely. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first seen in China in 2002. The outbreak was finally contained in 2003, by which time 8098 probable SARS cases had been identified with at least 774 deaths. The virus was identified in 2003 as belonging to the coronaviridae family. SARS is transmitted between humans and clusters have been seen. The mainstay of treatment is supportive. Various antiviral agents and adjunctive therapies were tried but none were conclusively effective. Hanta virus is an emerging cause of viral lung disease. In 1993, a new species of Hanta virus was recognized, after an outbreak of a new rapidly progressive pulmonary syndrome in the US, 465 cases of Sin Nombre virus have now been seen in the US with a mortality rate of 35%.

Considering that a certain proportion of wheezers may show a progression to asthma, the comparison of both groups provides important information regarding clinical and phenotype stratification. Thus, deep nasopharyngeal swab specimens, nasal epithelial spheroid (NAEsp) cultures, and blood samples of acute exacerbated wheezers (WH), asthmatics (AB), and healthy controls (HC) were used for culture (n = 146), 16 S-rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (n = 64), and proteomic and cytokine analyses.

Whole genome bioinformatics analysis suggests that nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) is a 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP), responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing. The gene encoding this protease was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in order to confirm this prediction. The purified protein was crystallized, and the structure was solved at 1.9 ? resolution. In addition, the crystal structure of the Ser118Ala mutant was determined at 2.0 ? resolution. The monomeric enzyme folds into three domains, similar to that of the homologous protease of equine arteritis virus, which, like PRRSV, is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order of Nidovirales. The active site of the PRRSV 3CLSP is located between domains I and II and harbors a canonical catalytic triad comprising Ser118, His39, and Asp64. The structure also shows an atypical oxyanion hole and a partially collapsed S1 specificity pocket. The proteolytic activity of the purified protein was assessed in vitro. Three sites joining nonstructural protein domains in the PRRSV replicative polyprotein are confirmed to be processed by the enzyme. Two of them, the nsp3/nsp4 and nsp11/nsp12 junctions, are shown to be cleaved in trans, while cis cleavage is demonstrated for the nsp4/nsp5 linker. Thus, we provide structural evidence as well as enzymatic proof of the nsp4 protein being a functional 3CLSP.

The concentration of IL-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-18, IL-1RA, galectin-1, ASC, LDH, ferritin, and gasdermin D were analyzed. A novel cell-free caspase-1 plasma assay was developed by inhibitor-based immunoprecipitation followed by Western Blot. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. ResultsThe inflammasome-related biomarkers were in similar concentration in COVID-19 and TBI patients except for galectin-1 being lower in the former. None of the tested markers were related to the outcome, length of stay or development of secondary infections. Patients with SOFA score of >9 at admission who were at high risk of death had significantly higher galectin-1 but lower IL-1RA in comparison to low-risk patients.

METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed on 345 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) admitted to our hospital wards from January 2017 to June 2019. They were divided into three groups, namely MPP with hypoxia, refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP), and general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (GMPP). The clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging, and management were collected and compared in the three groups. RESULTS: The MPP with hypoxia patients (n = 69) had longer disease duration, a higher extra-pulmonary complications rate, and more severe radiological abnormalities (P < 0.05). They also needed more complicated treatments (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the levels of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin (IL)-6, ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen (FG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the percentage of neutrophils in the MPP with hypoxia group were significantly higher than those in the RMPP group and the GMPP group (P < 0.05).

Because of time restraints, the online format may be ideal for providing foundational review material in clinical courses, but the effectiveness of the online format for review purposes in this setting has not been adequately investigated. This project compared student learning and satisfaction delivered by two different methods in a special populations course for third-year doctor of chiropractic students. The two methods of delivery were: 1) a face-to-face lecture (F2FL) on pediatric spinal anatomy, and 2) an online learning module (OLM) covering the same material. Methods This study was approved by the institutional IRB. A cohort comparison, mixed methods study design compared student learning and satisfaction of a pediatric spinal anatomy review delivered through a F2FL (n=22) and OLM (n=18) in two successive 2019 (pre-COVID) course offerings. Previously validated pre- and post-tests for the material were given to the students one week prior and one week following the intervention (either F2FL or week-long availability of the OLM). An instructor not affiliated with the course completed a Similarity of Material Assessment that evaluated the similarity of content in each method of delivery. Identical tests were given to each group. In addition, a survey assessing the method of delivery, comfort with technology, and preference of F2FL vs. OLM of review material, was completed by both groups immediately following administration of the post-test. Differences between pre-and post-test results were assessed using repeated measures ANOVA with F2FL and OLM as groups and pre-and post-test results as repeated measures. Results The content presented to the F2FL and OLM groups was judged to be the same by the independent instructor. Testing results showed an improvement with both groups from preto post-test [F2FL 54.6%, p<0.0001 vs. OLM 48.9%, p<0.0001 (OLM 52.35%, p<0.0001 with one dramatic outlier removed)], with no significant difference between test results between the F2FL and OLM groups [p=0.53 (p=0.82 with outlier removed)]. The survey showed: 83.3% of OLM students felt the online method was effective and 88.9% would prefer the material to be presented online;80% of the F2F group thought the lecture was engaging/effective and 60% would have preferred to have the material presented online. Conclusions The OLM was found to be as effective as the F2FL for the content assessed, and students were highly satisfied with the online method of instruction of the anatomy review material. This strategy could potentially be applied to provide additional review materials fundamental to other clinical courses. The OLM method allows for the material to be developed and given by content experts while also freeing valuable in-class time to be used for more experiential learning in clinical courses.","output":"Comparison of Online to Face-To-Face Instruction for Anatomy Review in a ThirdYear Clinical Course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widely used ice chamber-based cold storage for the transportation and storage of vaccines has several disadvantages, including uncontrolled overall temperature, water accumulation, and frequent ice pack renewal. Therefore, in this work, we numerically studied a novel vaccine storage system by coupling magnetic refrigeration and ice packs developed by conserving the advantages of an ice-based system. A two-dimensional numerical model is developed to analyze the magnetohydrodynamic natural convection in the storage chamber. Gadolinium of 0.08 kg is used to produce a cooling power of 31.514 W and a coefficient of performance of 1.3. With the constant heat leaked of 0.828 W into the system with dimensions of (0.1  0.1) m, the average life of the ice pack of 0.75 kg is 1.03 h. By introducing the magnetocaloric effect, the life of the same ice pack can be infinite with no load. The dynamic mode decomposition analysis reveals that the most dominant fluid interaction occurs between the cooled gadolinium plate and the adjacent fluid, resulting in efficient cooling of the air chamber. The developed vaccine chamber design will significantly improve the existing ice pack system with a nominal increase in cost and system weight.","output":"Transient performance analysis of a novel design of portable magnetic refrigeration system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a pandemic.

Moreover, only few studies have focused on the differences in their mode of travel between to-school and from-school. This study examined the associations of neighborhood built, safety, and social environments with walking to/from school among elementary school-aged children in Chiba, Japan. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with 1545 parents of children aged 6C12 years residing in Chiba between 25 and 27 November 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. A neighborhood was defined as the area of a postcode provided by the participants. Each neighborhood environment was assessed based on the built environment (new town designation, walkability, distance to school, population density), social environment (neighborhood cohesion and connection), and safety (CCTVs, a road section for walking alone, safety volunteers). Neighborhood walkability was measured using subscales of the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (youth and abbreviated versions) including crime safety and traffic safety. Parents perceived influence of COVID-19 on school commuting and after-school activities were also included in the model as covariates. Walking to and from school were separately analyzed using multinomial logistic regressions, where new towns and walkability were computed separately as explanatory variables. RESULTS: Four fifths of children walked to and from school daily. Walking to school was positively associated with crime safety, neighborhood connections, and schools sited in new towns. Walking from school had positive associations with traffic safety, neighborhood cohesion, and CCTVs, but negative associations with safety volunteers and after-school activities. The presence of a section for walking alone and perceived influence of COVID-19 had negative associations with walking to and from school. CONCLUSIONS: Recent social changes such as declining birthrate, decline in public elementary schools, and increasing after-school activities may change parental attitudes toward childrens walking to/from school, and subsequently, their mode of school travel over time. To maintain the high prevalence of walking to/from school in Japan, multidisciplinary approaches involving different stakeholders from education, public health, and urban planning are required to overcome sectionalism and support this behavior in the long term.

Previously described mechanisms include the development of a cytokine storm, missing immunoglobulin class switch, antibody-mediated enhancement, and aberrant antigen presentation. OBJECTIVES: To understand the heterogeneity of immune response in COVID-19, a thorough investigation of histomorphological patterns in regional lymph nodes was performed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lymph nodes from the cervical, mediastinal, and hilar regions were extracted from autopsies of patients with lethal COVID-19 (n = 20). Histomorphological characteristics, SARS-CoV?2 qRT-PCR, and gene expression profiling on common genes involved in immunologic response were analyzed. RESULTS: Lymph nodes displayed moderate to severe capillary stasis and edema, an increased presence of extrafollicular plasmablasts, mild to moderate plasmacytosis, a dominant population of CD8(+) T?cells, and CD11c/CD68(+) histiocytosis with hemophagocytic activity. Out of 20 cases, 18 presented with hypoplastic or missing germinal centers with a decrease of follicular dendritic cells and follicular T?helper cells. A positive viral load was detected by qRT-PCR in 14 of 20 cases, yet immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen revealed positivity in sinus histiocytes of only one case. Gene expression analysis revealed an increased expression of STAT1, CD163, granzyme B, CD8A, MZB1, and PAK1, as well as CXCL9. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings imply a dysregulated immune response in lethal COVID-19. The absence/hypoplasia of germinal centers and increased presence of plasmablasts implies a transient B?cell response, implying an impaired development of long-term immunity against SARS-CoV?2 in such occasions.","output":"Reaktionsmuster der lokoregion?ren Lymphknoten im Abflussgebiet von COVID-19-Lungen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many health conditions can be prevented, managed, or improved through behavioral interventions. As a component of health behavior change interventions, biological feedback is of particular interest given recent advances in wearable biosensing technology, digital health apps, and personalized health and wellness. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of literature to guide the design and implementation of interventions that incorporate biological feedback to motivate health behavior change. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this scoping review is to deeply explore the use of biological feedback as a component of health behavior change interventions that target adults. The objectives of the review include (1) mapping the domains of research that incorporate biological feedback and (2) describing the operational characteristics of using biological feedback in the context of health behavior change. METHODS: A comprehensive list of search terms was developed to capture studies from a wide range of domains. The studies to be included are randomized controlled trials published as primary research articles, theses, or dissertations targeting adults 18 years and older, who use biological feedback to change a health-related behavior. The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCOhost, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global. The screening and data extraction process will be guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis and conducted by trained reviewers. RESULTS: Database searches were completed in June 2021. A total of 50,459 unique records were returned after the removal of 48,634 duplicate records. The scoping review is planned for completion in 2022. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this will be the first scoping review to map the literature that uses biological feedback as a component of health behavior change interventions targeting adults. The findings will be used to develop a framework to guide the design and implementation of future health behavior change interventions that incorporate biological feedback.

We aimed to explore the impact of age and frailty on the acute immune response to COVID-19 illness. Methods We recruited older (aged 65+;n = 33) and younger (aged 20C50;n = 43) participants with acute COVID-19 illness for clinical assessment and detailed immunophenotyping for T-cell, neutrophil, monocyte and inflammatory markers using flow cytometry. We additionally assessed circulating levels of several important pro-inflammatory cytokines. Wilxocon rank-sum, chi-square tests and linear regression were used to examine the impact of age and frailty (Clinical Frailty Score 3C9) on the immune response in COVID-19 illness. Results were compared to age-matched pre-pandemic controls (n = 40). Results COVID-19 illness was associated with a marked pro-inflammatory response (raised CRP, IL-6, IL-2R), lymphopenia and emergency myelopoesis (an expansion of non-classical/intermediate monocytes and immature neutrophils) in both age groups (all P < 0.001). In comparison to younger participants (35.7  8.6 years), older adults (76.7  7.8 years) had a more marked reduction in na?ve CD4+ and CD8+ cells and a more marked expansion of activated CD4+, CD8+ and effector CD8+ T-cells (all P < 0.001). These findings were independent of illness severity (all P < 0.001). In comparison to their younger counterparts, older adults had a reduced number of CD10+ neutrophils/non-classical monocytes and greater CRP, IL-6 and IL-2R (P < 0.05), although results were attenuated on adjusting for COVID-19 severity. Frailty was not associated with any significant difference in immune cell population or pro-inflammatory response in acute COVID-19 illness. Conclusion Increasing age, but not frailty status, was associated with reduced na?ve T-cells and a more marked expansion of activated/effector T-cells in acute COVID-19 illness.

However, elevation measurement is inconsistent, and few state-level measures have been created and critically evaluated to date. To address this gap, the State Moral Elevation Scale (SMES) was developed and tested using an online sample (N = 930) including subsamples of general participants (nonclinical) and those who screened positive for mental health symptoms (clinical). Factor analysis indicated a single factor structure with nine items that demonstrated excellent reliability. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit statistics and strict measurement invariance across clinical and nonclinical subsamples. Lastly, correlational analyses with related constructs provided evidence of construct validity for both subsamples. Thus, the SMES is a psychometrically valid and reliable assessment tool for state-level elevation which can be used in both general and clinical populations.

METHODS: With both assays, we analyzed 3033 serum samples collected from 2496 patients without COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we studied 34 healthcare-workers who received two injections of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer three weeks apart and who had repeatedly determined their antibody response by both assays. RESULTS: In our cohort of patients without COVID-19 vaccination, 62.9% of all determinations were negative with both Roche assays and 31.5% were positive with both assays. In 5.6% of our cohort, however, there were discordant results with both assays (partly because initially discordant results of the two assays became concordantly positive over time). In the healthcare-workers with the COVID-19 vaccination, the results of the Roche anti-nucleocapsid assay remained negative throughout the observation period of 5 weeks after vaccination. The initially negative antibodies against the spike protein became positive with the Roche assay in all samples two weeks after the initial injection, and the serum concentrations of anti-spike antibodies increased constantly until 4-5 weeks after the initial injection. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide information on serological testing with the two Roche assays, which may be important for the application of the two assays in clinical routine.

Understanding what drives relinquishment patterns is essential for informing intervention opportunities to keep animals with their guardians. Whereas, overall reasons for relinquishment in a given shelter system have been well explored, analysis of human and animal predictors of relinquishing for a specific reason has not been previously attempted. We used characteristics of relinquishment including year, population of the relinquishing guardian's region, health status of the dog, breed, age group, weight, and sex to predict reasons for dog relinquishment to British Columbia (BC) Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) shelters across BC between 2008 and 2019 (n = 32,081). Relinquishment trends for puppies and adult dogs were also viewed and described. From 2008C2019, the proportion of dogs relinquished relative to total intake remained consistent (range: 31C35%). Primary reasons reported by guardians were having too many dogs (19%), housing issues (17%), personal issues (15%), financial issues (10%), dog behavior (10%), and guardian health (8%). Over years, an increasing proportion of dogs were relinquished for the reason too many (OR = 1.16, 95% CI, 1.10C1.23, p < 0.001) and behavior (OR = 1.34, 95% CI, 1.26C1.43, p < 0.001), while a decreasing proportion were relinquished due to financial problems (OR = 0.94, 95% CI, 0.88C1.00, p = 0.047). Being a puppy, mixed breed, small, and from a small or medium population center predicted the reason too many. Being a senior, Healthy, or from a medium or large population center predicted the reason housing issues.

Expecting mothers to care for children with little support, while expecting fathers to provide for their families with little support, is, therefore, likely to lead to adverse health consequences for mothers, fathers and children.

Children with T1D who attended the ED between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 were compared with those who attended the ED between March 1, 2019 and May 31, 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 150 and 154 children with T1D attended the EDs during the 3-month study periods in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Among patients with established T1D, DKA rates significantly increased in 2020 compared to 2019 [38/64 (59.3%) vs 31/74 (41.9%); p < 0.043]. There was a non-statistically significant trend toward a higher rate of DKA in patients with newly diagnosed T1D [46/86 (53.4%) vs 31/80 (38.7%); p = 0.063].

The results showed that the physicochemical characteristics of disposable gloves made of different materials were altered to different degrees by UV weathering. Nitrile gloves were more stable than latex and vinyl gloves after being exposed to weathering conditions. Although the chemical structures were not clearly demonstrated through FTIR after weathering, the SEM results showed significant microscopic changes on the surfaces of the gloves. Analysis of the leachate results showed that UV weathered gloves released leachable substances, including microparticles, organic matter, and heavy metals. Latex gloves were more likely to release microparticles and other substances into the water after UV weathering. The release of microparticles from gloves can also be impacted by sand abrasion.

Evolving hypoxia and infiltrates on chest imaging warranted the trial of an investigational antiviral drug - remdesivir. Our patient recovered and was discharged after 2 weeks of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights our patient's clinical course, including diagnostic work-up, medical management, and challenges in defining non-infectivity in a relatively unknown disease.","output":"Flight of the COVID-19 patient: experience with a Wuhan evacuee: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 has emerged in China at the end of 2019. In order to meet the growing demand in laboratories for RT-PCR testing for viral genome detection, rapid tests detecting a SARS-CoV-2 protein (antigenic rapid test) have been developed. In this review, we present for different SARS-CoV-2 antigenic rapid tests authorized in France: legislation, technological principle, and analytical and clinical performances. Data bellow are those provided by the manufacturer/distributor. From the list of tests authorized by the French Ministry of Health, we have selected 25 for which the distributors/manufacturers have provided the technical data essential to their comparative analysis. The kits use immunochromatography technology, with detection of the nucleocapsid protein (n = 24) or the spike protein (n = 1). The matrix used is a nasopharyngeal (n = 23), oropharyngeal (n = 9) or nasal (n = 3) swab. According to the test, the reading of the result is done from 15 to 30 minutes after it is performed. The clinical sensitivity, for the more performant tests is conversely linked to the Ct of RT-PCR, ranging from 80.2% to 98.4%, according to the quantity of virus present in the sample. This percentage is inversely proportional to the Ct obtained using RT-PCR. The limit of detection ranges from 31.55 to 7200 TCID50/mL. The clinical specificity, compared to a negative result of RT-PCR, is between 99.2% and 100%. Analytical specificity evaluated on other microorganisms is 100%, except for 3 kits that show cross-reactivities with SARS-CoV-1 (n = 3) and MERS-CoV (n = 1). Positive and negative predictive values range from 96.3% to 100% and 95% to 99.4%, respectively.","output":"[Rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigenic test: definition, legislation of use, technological principles, analytical and clinical performance comparison]./ Tests rapides antigniques SARS-CoV-2 : dfinition, lgislation d'utilisation, principes technologiques, comparaison des performances analytiques et cliniques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an extremely infectious viral infection of cloven-hoofed animals which is highly challenging to control and can give rise to national animal health crises, especially if there is a lack of pre-existing immunity due to the emergence of new strains or following incursions into disease-free regions. The 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK was on a scale that initially overwhelmed the national veterinary services and was eventually controlled by livestock lockdown and slaughter on an unprecedented scale. In 2020, the rapid emergence of COVID-19 has led to a human pandemic unparalleled in living memory. The enormous logistics of multi-agency control efforts for COVID-19 are reminiscent of the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK, as are the use of movement restrictions, not normally a feature of human disease control. The UK experience is internationally relevant as few countries have experienced national epidemic crises for both diseases. In this review, we reflect on the experiences and lessons learnt from UK and international responses to FMD and COVID-19 with respect to their management, including the challenge of preclinical viral transmission, threat awareness, early detection, different interpretations of scientific information, lockdown, biosecurity behaviour change, shortage of testing capacity and the choices for eradication versus living with infection. A major lesson is that the similarity of issues and critical resources needed to manage large-scale outbreaks demonstrates that there is benefit to a 'One Health' approach to preparedness, with potential for greater cooperation in planning and the consideration of shared critical resources.","output":"Parallels, differences and lessons: a comparison of the management of foot-and-mouth disease and COVID-19 using UK 2001/2020 as points of reference"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tertiary lymphoid tissues are peripheral foci of immune activity that develop in kidneys and other peripheral organs in the context of chronic inflammation.

As evaluation of various disposal alternatives of HCW and selection of the best technique requires considering various tangible and intangible criteria, this can be framed as multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, we propose an assessment framework for the selection of the best HCW disposal technique based on socio-technical and triple bottom line perspectives. We have identified 10 criteria on which the best HCW disposal techniques to be selected based on extant literature review. Next, we use Fuzzy VIKOR method to evaluate 9 HCW disposal alternatives. The effectiveness of the proposed framework has been demonstrated with a real-life case study in Indian context. To check the robustness of the proposed methodology, we have compared the results obtained with Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution). The results help the municipal authorities to establish a methodical approach to choose the best HCW disposal techniques. Our findings indicate that incineration is the best waste disposal technique among the available alternatives. Even if the dataset indicates 'incineration' is the best method, we must not forget about the environmental concerns arising from this method.

However, its efficacy remains to be validated. In this study, we compared the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes. Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used. The demographics, characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatments, and clinical outcome in these patients were retrospectively assessed. A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, underlying diseases, clinical severity, and oxygen-support category at admission. The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, P = 0.74). However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), P = 0.01). Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin.

Health insurance companies play an important role here, as they act as multipliers of relevant information with their communication to insured persons. OBJECTIVES: The core element of this paper is a comparative analysis of the COVID-19 crisis communication of health insurance companies based on findings from crisis communication and health insurance communication research. The aim is to highlight how the website communication of health insurance companies can be optimized with regard to target groups, information needs and textual design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, selected models of crisis communication are presented to contextualize the empirical findings on this basis. The subject of the empirical study is a selection of statutory and private health insurance companies, with a sample of the ten insurers with most members in each sector. The analysis focuses on one of the central mediums of health insurance communication, the websites. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the communication of German health insurance companies could be implemented in a more target-group-specific manner. The linguistic comprehensibility of the information and the structure of the COVID-19 subsites could also be optimized. The analysis also shows that the insurers address prevention and the acute case of COVID-19 disease to varying degrees, but not follow-up care. However, the latter is one of the elements of crisis communication in terms of follow-up and coping with the crisis.","output":"Krankenkassenkommunikation in der COVID-19-Pandemie: eine vergleichende Analyse der Krisenkommunikation auf Websites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to the approval of novel vaccines with different mechanisms of action. Until now, more than 4.7 billion persons have been vaccinated around the world, and adverse effects not observed in pre-authorization trials are being reported at low frequency. METHODS: We report a case of severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) after SARS-CoV-2 immunization and performed a literature search for all reported cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated HLH. RESULTS: A 24-year-old female developed HLH after immunization with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. Diagnosis was made according to HLH-2004 criteria; the HScore was 259 (> 99% HLH probability) with maximum ferritin of 138.244 g/L. The patient was initially treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) and dexamethasone without response. The addition of the human interleukin 1 receptor antagonist Anakinra resulted in full recovery within 6 weeks after vaccination. A literature search revealed 15 additional cases of HLH after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, the majority after immunization with Comirnaty (n = 7) or the viral vector vaccine Vaxzevria (n = 6). Treatment modalities included corticosteroids (n = 13), Anakinra (n = 5), IVIGs (n = 5), and etoposide (n = 2). Eight patients underwent combination treatment. Three of 16 patients died. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines may occasionally trigger HLH, and Anakinra may be an efficacious treatment option for this condition.","output":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The ePlex? SARS-CoV-2 emergency use authorization (EUA) test is a cartridge-based assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens. Since performance data has been previously published on this platform, the manufacturer has modified the workflow design in order to improve assay performance. Evaluation of the new workflow, which eliminated the sample delivery device (SDD), led to a dramatic improvement of assay performance while saving time and making cartridge loading more convenient. METHODS: 145 confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens were used to evaluate the assay analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and overall time-saving for the 2 workflows that is with and without the use of SDD on the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Elimination of the SDD step led to a dramatic increase in accuracy and the overall limit of detection when using 145 previously defined and valid SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens with relatively low, medium, and high cycle thresholds (CT). This simple workflow change led to an overall detection from 94/145 (64.8%) to 131/145 (90.3%), with an additional 37 specimens being detected. CT value ranges revealed that 90% of the specimens in the 33 &#8804; CT < 35.3 CT range were detected, whereas with the SDD workflow, only 30% of positive specimens were detected in this same range. Hands-on time for each specimen also improved and showed overall time savings. CONCLUSION: The simple workflow modification eliminating the SDD led to an overall improvement in the detection of positive specimens and also simplified workflow and reduced hands-on time.","output":"Evaluating the Effect of a Modified Sample Preparation on SARS-CoV-2 Detection in a Cartridge-Based Platform"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical assessment of catatonia includes the use of diagnostic systems, such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), or screening tools such as the Bush Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI)/Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) and the Braunig Catatonia Rating Scale. In this study, we describe the inter-rater reliability (IRR), utilizing the BFCSI, BFCRS, and DSM-5 to screen for catatonia. METHODS: Data from 10 participants recruited as part of a larger prevalence study (of 135 participants) were used to determine the IRR by five assessors after they were trained in the application of the 14-item BFCSI, 23-item BFCRS, and DSM-5 to assess catatonia in new admissions. Krippendorffs  was used to compute the IRR, and Spearmans correlation was used to determine the concordance between screening tools. The study site was a 35-bed acute mental health unit in Dora Nginza Hospital, Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. Participants were mostly involuntary admissions under the Mental Health Care Act of 2002 and between the ages of 13 and 65 years. RESULTS: Of the 135 participants, 16 (11.9%) had catatonia.

In fact, videos on the social media, like Facebook and YouTube, are usually accompanied by comments where users may give opinions about things evoked in the video. The main challenge is how to extract relevant tags from them. To the best of the authors knowledge, this is the first research work to present an approach to extract tags from comments posted about videos on the social media. We do not pretend that comments can be a perfect solution for tagging videos since we rather tried to investigate the reliability of comments to tag videos and we studied how they can serve as a source of tags. The proposed approach is based on filtering the comments to retain only the words that could be possible tags. We relied on the self-organizing map clustering considering that tags of a given video are semantically and contextually close. We tested our approach on the Google YouTube 8M dataset, and the achieved results show that we can rely on comments to extract tags. They could be also used to enrich and refine the existing uploaders tags as a second area of application.

Vascular endotheliitis is regarded as a host immune-inflammatory response of the endothelium forming the inner surface of blood vessels in association with a direct consequence of infectious pathogen invasion. Vascular endotheliitis and consequent endothelial dysfunction can be a principle determinant of microvascular failure, which would favor impaired perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and subsequent organ failure. Emerging evidence suggests the role of vascular endotheliitis in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its related complications. Thus, once initiated, vascular endotheliitis and resultant cytokine storm cause systemic hyperinflammation and a thrombotic phenomenon in COVID-19, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and widespread organ damage. Vascular endotheliitis also appears to be a contributory factor to vasculopathy and coagulopathy in sepsis that is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated response of the host to infection. Therefore, protecting endothelial cells and reversing vascular endotheliitis may be a leading therapeutic goal for these diseases associated with vascular endotheliitis. In this review, we outline the etiological and pathogenic importance of vascular endotheliitis in infection-related inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19, and possible mechanisms leading to vascular endotheliitis.

Using an energy systems model (OSeMOSYS), we analyze scenarios that consider an improvement in the quality of the ethanol (in gCO2eq/MJ) consumed in RJ due to the development of the RenovaBio program, greater uptake of electric vehicles, carbon pricing, and a combination of these policies. We also analyze a scenario with the new RenovaBio targets, which the Brazilian government scaled down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that electric vehicles are the most cost-effective policy to reduce CO2emissions (by 1.9%) when no carbon pricing is considered. When it is, however, CO2emissions are reduced the most (between 47% and 56%), regardless of the vehicle technology being used, but it is the costlier policy (between 5.4% and 15.3%). In scenarios with carbon pricing, flex-fuel vehicles switch to ethanol, an important result for a region where this technology already dominates the vehicle fleet. Greater uptake of electric vehicles leads to lower overall transportation costs (by 2.5%), but when a CO2price is considered, because the electricity system still relies on fossil fuels, the reduction in CO2emissions is compromised. In such a setting, increased ethanol quality reduces carbon emissions more than electric vehicle adoption (by 16%). The RenovaBio targets' reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, jeopardizes this result. Such findings convey important evidence to policymakers and the research community: decarbonization of transportation in a region of a developing country, where economic resources are scarcer, can start before electric vehicles become affordable by increasing and maintaining continued access to lower-carbon fuels. ? 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Given the barriers to accessing care, video telehealth is a means of providing OT. Even within Veterans Health Administration (VHA), a pioneer in telehealth, video telehealth by OT practitioners to serve older adults is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study examines VHA OT practice using video telehealth with older veterans using an implementation framework. METHODS: A web-based national survey of VHA OT practitioners conducted between September and October 2019 contained a mix of mostly closed questions with some open-text options. The questions were developed using the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services model with input from subject matter experts. The questions gathered the extent to which VHA OT practitioners use video telehealth with older veterans; are comfortable with video telehealth to deliver specific OT services; and, for those using video telehealth with older veterans, the barriers, facilitators of change, and perceived benefits of video telehealth. RESULTS: Of approximately 1455 eligible VHA OT practitioners, 305 participated (21.0% response rate). Most were female (196/259, 75.7%) occupational therapists (281/305, 92.1%) with a masters degree (147/259, 56.8%) and 10 years or fewer (165/305, 54.1%) of VHA OT practice. Less than half (125/305, 41.0%) had used video telehealth with older veterans, and users and nonusers of video telehealth were demographically similar. When asked to rate perceived comfort with video telehealth to deliver OT services, participants using video telehealth expressed greater comfort than nonusers, which was significant for 9 of the 13 interventions: activities of daily living (P<.001), instrumental activities of daily living (P=.004), home safety (P<.001), home exercise or therapeutic exercise (P<.001), veteran or caregiver education (P<.001), durable medical equipment (P<.001), assistive technology (P<.001), education and work (P=.04), and wheelchair clinic or seating and positioning (P<.001). More than half (74/125, 59.2%) of those using video telehealth reported at least one barrier, with the most frequently endorsed being Inadequate space, physical locations and related equipment. Most (92/125, 73.6%) respondents using video telehealth reported at least one facilitator, with the most frequently endorsed facilitators reflecting respondent attitudes, including the belief that video telehealth would improve veteran access to care (77/92, 84%) and willingness to try innovative approaches (76/92, 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Most VHA OT survey respondents had not used video telehealth with older veterans. Users and nonusers were demographically similar. Differences in the percentages of respondents feeling comfortable with video telehealth for specific OT interventions suggest that some OT services may be more amenable to video telehealth. This, coupled with the primacy of respondent beliefs versus organizational factors as facilitators, underscores the need to gather clinicians attitudes to understand how they are driving the implementation of video telehealth.","output":"Video Telehealth Occupational Therapy Services for Older Veterans: National Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With recent advances in sequencing technology it has become affordable and practical to sequence genomes to very high depth-of-coverage, allowing researchers to discover low-frequency variants in the genome.

Transmission of the virus is predominantly direct, through exposure to infected respiratory secretions. As far as we know, arthropods play a key role in the transmission and spread of several viruses, and thus their role in the spread of COVID-19 deserves to be studied. The biological transmission of viral agents through insects is very complex. While mechanical transmission is more likely to happen, biological transmission is possible via blood-sucking arthropods, but this requires a high grade of compatibility between the vector and the pathogen. If the biological and mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blood-sucking arthropods is excluded, a mechanical transmission by urban pests could take place. This risk is very low but it could be important in isolated environmental conditions, where other means of transmission are not possible. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-blood-sucking arthropods in infected buildings, like hospitals and retirement homes, should be investigated.","output":"Insects and SARS-CoV-2: Analysis of the Potential Role of Vectors in European Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in December 2019. Accurate, rapid, convenient, and relatively inexpensive diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 infection are important for public health and optimal clinical care. The current gold standard for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RTPCR assays are designed for use in well-equipped laboratories with sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and highly trained technicians, and are unsuitable for use in under-equipped laboratories and in the field. In this study, we report the development of an accurate, rapid, and easy-to-implement isothermal and nonenzymatic signal amplification system (a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) reaction) coupled with a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) strip-based detection method that can detect SARSCoV-2 in oropharyngeal swab samples. Our method avoids RNA isolation, PCR amplification, and elaborate result analysis, which typically takes 6-8 hours. The entire CHA-LFIA detection method, from nasopharyngeal sampling to obtaining test results, takes less than 90 minutes. Such methods are simple and require no expensive equipment, only a simple thermostatically controlled water bath and a fluorescence reader device. We validated our method using synthetic oligonucleotides and clinical samples from 15 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 15 healthy individuals. Our detection method provides a fast, simple, and sensitive (with a limit of detection (LoD) of 2,000 copies/mL) alternative to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, with 100% positive and negative predictive agreements.","output":"Rapid Point-of-Care Testing for SARS-CoV-2 Virus Nucleic Acid Detection by an Isothermal and Nonenzymatic Signal Amplification System Coupled with a Lateral Flow Immunoassay Strip"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most patients infected with the COVID-19 virus experience mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and heal without any special treatment.

In this sense, the need has arisen to wear gloves or to reduce direct contact with objects (such as sensors for capturing fingerprints or palm prints) as a sanitary measure to protect against the virus. In this new reality, it is necessary to have a biometric identification method that allows safe and rapid recognition of people at borders, or in quarantine controls, or in access to places of high biological risk, among others. In this scenario, iris biometric recognition has reached increasing relevance. This biometric modality avoids all the aforementioned inconveniences with proven high efficiency.

This work presents a framework for real time iris detection and segmentation in video as part of a biometric recognition system. Our proposal focuses on the stages of image capture, iris detection and segmentation in RGB video frames under controlled conditions (conditions of border and access controls, where people collaborate in the recognition process). The proposed framework is based on the direct detection of the iris-pupil region using the YOLO network, the evaluation of its quality and the semantic segmentation of iris by a Fully Convolutional Network.

Several studies comparing the lipidome of COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients vs. healthy subjects have already been reported. It is largely unknown, however, whether these differences are specific to this disease. The present study compared the lipidomic signature of hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients with that of healthy subjects, as well as with COVID-19-negative patients hospitalized for other infectious/inflammatory diseases. METHODS: We analyzed the lipidomic signature of 126 COVID-19-positive patients, 45 COVID-19-negative patients hospitalized with other infectious/inflammatory diseases and 50 healthy volunteers. A semi-targeted lipidomics analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Two-hundred and eighty-three lipid species were identified and quantified. Results were interpreted by machine learning tools. RESULTS: We identified acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, arachidonic acid and oxylipins as the most altered species in COVID-19-positive patients compared to healthy volunteers. However, we found similar alterations in COVID-19-negative patients who had other causes of inflammation. Conversely, lysophosphatidylcholine 22:6-sn2, phosphatidylcholine 36:1 and secondary bile acids were the parameters that had the greatest capacity to discriminate between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows that COVID-19 infection shares many lipid alterations with other infectious/inflammatory diseases, and which differentiate them from the healthy population. The most notable alterations were observed in oxylipins, while alterations in bile acids and glycerophospholipis best distinguished between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

METHODS For the study, 36 subjects were randomly allocated into two arms: a traditional arm, providing face-to-face individual and group-based intervention; and a web arm, deploying the in-presence traditional approach with intervention provided through web technologies. The outcomes were the data resulting from the comparison between the subjects' anthropometric and clinical parameters as well as PREDIMED scores at baseline with those at 3 months (T3), 6 months (T6) and at lockdown. RESULTS In the web arm we detected a progressive reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI) from baseline to T6 and a minimal increase of both parameters during the lockdown. Improvement of these parameters compared with baseline was observed in controls during the lockdown. The PREDIMED score improved at T6 compared with baseline in both arms.

Despite the obvious clinical implications associated with the presence of circulating RNA, its pathological effects on endothelial cells and the governing molecular mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. We analyzed the effects of double stranded RNA on primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (hPAECs). The effect of natural and synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) on hPAECs was investigated using trans-endothelial electric resistance, molecule trafficking, calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis, gene expression and proliferation studies. Furthermore, the morphology and mechanical changes of the cells caused by synthetic dsRNA was followed by in-situ atomic force microscopy, by vascular-endothelial cadherin and F-actin staining. Our results indicated that exposure of hPAECs to synthetic dsRNA led to functional deficits. This was reflected by morphological and mechanical changes and an increase in the permeability of the endothelial monolayer. hPAECs treated with synthetic dsRNA accumulated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Additionally, the proliferation rate of the cells in the presence of synthetic dsRNA was significantly decreased. Furthermore, we found that natural and synthetic dsRNA modulated Ca(2+) signaling in hPAECs by inhibiting the sarco-endoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) which is involved in the regulation of the intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and thus cell growth. Even upon synthetic dsRNA stimulation silencing of SERCA3 preserved the endothelial monolayer integrity.

The great impact of EV71 and HCV on public health highlights the need to further our understanding of the biology of these two viruses and develop effective therapeutic antivirals. Here, we evaluated a total of 32 lycorine derivatives and demonstrated that 1-acetyllycorine suppressed the proliferation of multiple strains of EV71 in various cells. The results of the drug resistance analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine targeted a phenylalanine (F76) in EV71 2A protease (2A(pro)) to stabilize the conformation of a unique zinc finger.

Further analysis revealed that 1-acetyllycorine also inhibits HCV with high efficacy, and the mutation on R118 in HCV NS3, which corresponds to F76 in EV71 2A(pro), confers the resistance of HCV to 1-acetyllycorine. These results revealed a conserved mechanism of 1-acetyllycorine against EV71 and HCV through targeting viral proteases. We also documented the significant synergistic anti-EV71 and anti-HCV effects of 1-acetyllycorine with reported inhibitors, supporting potential combination therapy for the treatment of EV71 and HCV infections.","output":"A Conserved Inhibitory Mechanism of a Lycorine Derivative against Enterovirus and Hepatitis C Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019 in children has been linked to various clinical presentation, from paucisymptomatic cutaneous eruptions, to multisystemic inflammatory syndrome.

Clinical data indicate that most patients starting clozapine experience a transient immune response early in treatment and a similar response has been observed in clozapine-treated rats, but the mechanism by which clozapine triggers this transient inflammation remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the role of inflammasome activation during the early immune response to clozapine using in vitro and in vivo models. In both differentiated and nondifferentiated human monocytic THP-1 cells, clozapine, but not its structural analogues fluperlapine and olanzapine, caused inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activation and IL-1 release that was inhibited using the caspase-1 inhibitor yVAD-cmk. In Sprague Dawley rats, a single dose of clozapine caused an increase in circulating neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes within hours of drug administration along with transient spikes in the proinflammatory mediators IL-1, CXCL1, and TNF- in the blood, spleen, and bone marrow. Blockade of inflammasome signaling using the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 or the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra attenuated this inflammatory response. These data indicate that caspase-1-dependent IL-1 production is fundamental for the induction of the early immune response to clozapine and, furthermore, support the general hypothesis that inflammasome activation is a common mechanism by which drugs associated with the risk of idiosyncratic reactions trigger early immune system activation. Ultimately, inhibition of inflammasome signaling may reduce the risk of IDIAG, enabling safer, more frequent use of clozapine in patients.","output":"Clozapine Induces an Acute Proinflammatory Response That Is Attenuated by Inhibition of Inflammasome Signaling: Implications for Idiosyncratic Drug-Induced Agranulocytosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Prisons and jails are high-risk settings for Covid-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality. We evaluate protection conferred by prior infection and vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant within the California state prison system. METHODS We employed a test-negative design to match resident and staff cases during the Omicron wave (December 24, 2021 to April 14, 2022) to controls according to a case's test-week as well as demographic, clinical, and carceral characteristics. We estimated protection against infection using conditional logistic regression, with exposure status defined by vaccination, stratified by number of mRNA doses received, and prior infection, stratified by periods before or during Delta variant predominance. RESULTS We matched 15,783 resident and 8,539 staff cases to 180,169 resident and 90,409 staff controls. Among cases, 29.7% and 2.2% were infected before or during the emergence of the Delta variant, respectively; 30.6% and 36.3% were vaccinated with two or three doses, respectively. Estimated protection from Omicron infection for two and three doses were 14.9% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 12.3 to 19.7%) and 43.2% (42.2 to 47.4%) for those without known prior infections, 47.8% (95% CI, 46.6 to 52.8%) and 61.3% (95% CI, 60.7 to 64.8%) for those infected before the emergence of Delta, and 73.1% (95% CI, 69.8 to 80.1%) and 86.8% (95% CI, 82.1 to 92.7) for those infected during the period of Delta predominance. CONCLUSION A third mRNA dose provided significant, additional protection over two doses, including among individuals with prior infection.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) mandate to work on the interface between intellectual property, innovation and access to medicine has been continually reinforced and extended to include providing support to countries on the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in collaboration with stakeholders. This study analyses the role of intellectual property on access to medicines in the African Region. METHODS: We analyze patent data from the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and Organisation Africaine de la Proprit Intellectuelle (OAPI) to provide a situational analysis of patenting activity and trends. We also review legislation to assess how TRIPS flexibilities are implemented in countries. RESULTS: Patenting was low for African countries. Only South Africa and Cameroon appeared in the list of top ten originator countries for ARIPO and OAPI respectively. Main diseases covered by African patents were HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and tumors. Majority countries have legislation allowing for compulsory licensing and parallel importation of medicines, while the least legislated flexibilities were explicit exemption of pharmaceutical products from patentable subject matter, new or second use of patented pharmaceutical products, imposition of limits to patent term extension and test data protection. Thirty-nine countries have applied TRIPS flexibilities, with the most common being compulsory licensing and least developed country transition provisions.

Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. Conclusion The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis.

One possible explanation is that given previous exposure to angina and ischemia/reperfusion injury these patients, may be already 'naturally preconditioned'. The role of RIPC in a context of isolated valve intervention, both surgical and particularly transcatheter is less clear and remains under investigated, with few high-quality studies. METHODS A systematic literature review identified 8 candidate studies that met the meta-analysis criteria. We analyzed outcomes of 610 subjects (312 RIPC and 298 SHAM) with random effects modeling. Each study was assessed for heterogeneity. The primary outcome was the extent of periprocedural myocardial injury, as reflected by the area under the curve for serum troponin concentration. Secondary endpoints included relevant intra- and post-operative outcomes; sensitivity and high-quality subgroup analysis was also carried out. RESULTS Six and two studies reported the effect of RIPC in surgical and transcatheter valve intervention. There was a significant difference between-group in terms of periprocedural Troponin release (standardized mean difference (SMD: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.52; 0.95], p = 0.02) with no heterogeneity (2 2.40, I2 0%, p = 0.88).

We provide several country examples of how service multiplier methods have been used in respondent-driven sampling surveys and provide guidance on how to maximize this method's use. METHODS Population size estimates were conducted in 4 countries (Mauritius- intravenous drug users [IDU] and female sex workers [FSW]; Papua New Guinea-FSW and men who have sex with men [MSM]; Thailand-IDU; United States-IDU) using adjusted proportions of population members reporting attending a service, project or study listed in a respondent-driven sampling survey, and the estimated total number of population members who visited one of the listed services, projects, or studies collected from the providers. RESULTS The median population size estimates were 8866 for IDU and 667 for FSW in Mauritius. Median point estimates for FSW were 4190 in Port Moresby and 8712 in Goroka, Papua New Guinea, and 2,126 for MSM in Port Moresby and 4200 for IDU in Bangkok, Thailand.

Vascular leakage of plasma results from inflammatory mediator-induced separation of endothelial cells in postcapillary venules belonging to the tracheobronchial circulation. Whereas proposed mediators of asthma induce reversible leakage, several antiasthma drugs exhibit antileakage effects in animals and humans. Potential consequences of plasma exudation are many. Mucosal/submucosal edema might contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness. Plasma exudate in the airway lumen in asthma may contribute to sloughing of epithelium, impairment of mucociliary transport, narrowing of small airways, and mucus plug formation. Exuded plasma may cause airway inflammation and constriction because of its content of powerful mediators, and chemoattractant factors and plasma proteins may condition the inflammatory cells abundant in asthmatic airways to release mediators in response to stimuli that otherwise would be innocuous to the cells. It is concluded that inflammatory stimulus-induced increase in macromolecular permeability of the tracheobronchial microvasculature and mucosa may be a significant pathogenetic mechanism in asthma and that the postcapillary venular endothelium and airway epithelium that regulate leakage of plasma are important effector cells in this disease.","output":"Plasma exudation and asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the deficiencies that characterize the functioning of the Italian national health system. Prisons have always mirrored the most radical expressions of these weaknesses. During the early stages of the pandemic, prison facilities across Italy underwent a series of changes dictated by the need to ensure the safety of the prisoners and staff. The adoption of these rules contributed to a total or partial redefinition of many central facets of life in prison, such as intake procedures for new arrivals and the ways prisoners were allowed to communicate with their families. Objectives: The aim of this qualitative study was to analyze the testimony of penitentiary healthcare workers in prisons throughout Italy to determine the impact of COVID-19 on their professional and personal lives. Participants: Thirty-eight participants were contacted and 20 decided to participate in the interview. The sample was made up of 10 women and 10 men. All the participants were members of the healthcare staff of a penitentiary facility (psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians, and nurses). All were recruited through an Italian association whose mission is the development, promotion, and implementation of social solidarity projects including prisoners' social and health care. This study was facilitated through representatives serving in nine different regions of Italy. The participants were divided according to their professional roles in prisons. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted by telephone or online using telecommunication platforms (e.g., Zoom, WhatsApp, and Skype). The transcribed texts underwent thematic analysis using the Atlas.ti software to identify patterns of meaning across the dataset. Results: Four main themes emerged from the analysis: Interpersonal difficulties, management and operational difficulties, the personal distress and bereavement of healthcare workers, and the distress of inmates. The importance of relationship management skills when interacting with prisoners emerged as a key topic in many interviews, and the participants highlighted the need for adequate training. The increase in prisoners' anxiety made communication more difficult. Conclusions: The findings suggest that healthcare workers in jails need emergency-oriented training. Participants described their feeling of loneliness and quasi-abandonment when carrying out their duties during the pandemic. In particular, they underscored the need for psychological guidance to better manage altered reactions with prisoners and colleagues as a result of heightened death anxiety and isolation.","output":"Hardships in Italian Prisons During the COVID-19 Emergency: The Experience of Healthcare Personnel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 can infect the respiratory tract causing a spectrum of disease varying from mild to fatal pneumonia, and known as COVID-19. Ongoing clinical research is assessing the potential for long-term respiratory sequelae in these patients. We assessed the respiratory function in a cohort of patients after recovering from SARS-Cov-2 infection, stratified according to PaO(2)/FiO(2) (p/F) values. METHOD: Approximately one month after hospital discharge, 86 COVID-19 patients underwent physical examination, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and six-minute walk test (6MWT). Patients were also asked to quantify the severity of dyspnoea and cough before, during, and after hospitalization using a visual analogic scale (VAS). Seventy-six subjects with ABG during hospitalization were stratified in three groups according to their worst p/F values: above 300 (n = 38), between 200 and 300 (n = 30) and below 200 (n = 20). RESULTS: On PFTs, lung volumes were overall preserved yet, mean percent predicted residual volume was slightly reduced (74.8  18.1%). Percent predicted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was also mildly reduced (77.2  16.5%). Patients reported residual breathlessness at the time of the visit (VAS 19.8, p < 0.001). Patients with p/F below 200 during hospitalization had lower percent predicted forced vital capacity (p = 0.005), lower percent predicted total lung capacity (p = 0.012), lower DLCO (p < 0.001) and shorter 6MWT distance (p = 0.004) than patients with higher p/F.

Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS: Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout.

County-level excess mortality during the vaccine campaign are also reported, with weekly rates of vaccination in each county that reported 100 or more all-cause deaths during any week included in the study period. Results: All-cause mortality was not observed after March 2021, by which time over 75% of persons over 65 years of age in Massachusetts had received a vaccination. Fewer deaths than expected (which we term 'deficit mortality') occurred both during the summer of 2020, the spring of 2021 and during the Delta wave (beginning June 13, 2021 when Delta isolates represented >10% of sequenced cases). After the initial wave in the spring of 2020, more Covid-19-attributed deaths were recorded that all-cause excess deaths, implying that Covid-19 was misattributed as the underlying cause, rather than a contributing cause of death in some cases. Conclusion: In a state with high vaccination rates, excess mortality has not been recorded during the Delta period. Deficit mortality has been recorded during this period.","output":"Absence of Excess Mortality in a Highly Vaccinated Population During the Initial Covid-19 Delta Period."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Tax policymakers are currently navigating a path through a delicate dialectic of macro- and micro-level policy responses to the economic dislocation of the COVID-19 pandemic The purpose of this paper is to examine initial tax measures that are aimed at helping taxpayers needing liquidity, solvency and income support Design/methodology/approach: This study undertakes a review of key tax policy responses of six jurisdictions across the globe that have similar tax regimes and virus mitigation strategies (albeit with different outcomes) Key initiatives implemented from February to April 2020 by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and the UK are examined Findings: This study indicates that tax concessions are a crude and mostly ineffective way of assisting individuals and enterprises in difficulty In the longer term, if the crisis prompts desirable reforms such as extending the recognition of tax losses, the income tax system will emerge fairer and more efficient Practical implications: An investigation of the short-term reforms announced relating to asset write-offs, tax deferral, tax losses and goods and services tax/value-added tax rates in light of the liquidity, income support and stimulus objectives shows that in some cases the policies may have been misguided The findings can be used by policymakers as the basis for designing better targeted alternative non-tax responses Originality/value: Jurisdictional responses to tax policy reforms during a modern period of significant economic dislocation have yet to be documented in the literature Specifically, this paper highlights the limitations of tax policy initiatives as a response to financial hardship ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Does tax policy fit in the portfolio of COVID-19 responses?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning was always an essential part of our lives to acquire knowledge and move forward.

Here, we report the characterization of the M(pro) of toroviruses, the fourth main Nidovirus branch. Comparative sequence analysis of polyprotein 1a of equine torovirus (EToV) strain Berne, identified a serine proteinase domain, flanked by hydrophobic regions. Heterologous expression of this domain resulted in autoprocessing at flanking cleavage sites. N-terminal sequence analysis of cleavage products tentatively identified FxxQ downward arrow(S, A) as the substrate consensus sequence. EToV M(pro) combines several traits of its closest relatives. It has a predicted three-domain structure, with two catalytic beta-barrel domains and an additional C-terminal domain of unknown function. With respect to substrate specificity, the EToV M(pro) resembles its coronavirus homologue in its preference for P1-Gln, but its substrate-binding subsite, S1, more closely resembles that of arteri- and ronivirus M(pro)s, which prefer P1-Glu. Surprisingly, in contrast to the M(pro)s of corona- and roniviruses, but like that of arterivirus, the torovirus M(pro) uses serine instead of cysteine as its principal nucleophile. Under the premise that the M(pro)s of corona- and toroviruses are more closely related to each other than to those of arteri- and roniviruses, the transition from serine- to cysteine-based proteolytic catalysis (or vice versa) must have happened more than once in the course of nidovirus evolution.

The extent of immunoparesis is an independent prognostic factor in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Myeloma patients with suppressed uninvolved immunoglobulins at diagnosis have shorter median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). This review article summarizes immunoparesis in myeloma patients, contributing factors, its impact on myeloma progression, general outcomes, and infectious complications. ABSTRACT: Multiple myeloma is a relatively common clonal plasma cell disorder, comprising 17% of hematologic malignancies. One of the hallmark features of this disease is immunoparesis, which is characterized by the suppression of immunoglobulin polyclonality. Though not entirely elucidated, the mechanism behind this process can be attributed to the changes in the tumor microenvironment. All treating clinicians must consider potential complications related to immunoparesis in the management of multiple myeloma. Though not explicitly described in large data series, the increased risk of infection in multiple myeloma is likely, at least in part, due to immunoglobulin suppression. Additionally, the presence of immunoparesis serves as a prognostic factor, conveying poorer survival and a higher risk of relapse. Even in the era of novel agents, these findings are preserved, and immunoglobulin recovery also serves as a sign of improved outcome following autologous HSCT. Though not within the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma, the presence and degree of immunoparesis should be at diagnosis for prognostication, and immunoglobulin recovery should be tracked following myeloablative therapy and autologous HSCT.","output":"Clinical Considerations for Immunoparesis in Multiple Myeloma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents a comprehensive and cross-cutting review of key marine waste issues, taking into account: sources, fate, risks, transport pathways, threats, legislation, current challenges, and knowledge gaps. The growing amount of both human-created waste in seas and oceans and waste reaching marine ecosystems from land is one of today's challenges for the global economy and the European Union. It is predicted that if no decisive steps are taken to limit the amount of this type of waste, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the oceans after 2050. The influence of microplastics and nanoplastics on living organisms remains undiagnosed. Within the international and EU law, solutions are being developed to properly manage waste on board ships and to reduce the impact of processes related to the recycling of the vessels on the environment. Currently, over 80% of ships are dismantled in the countries of South Asia, in conditions that threaten the environment and the safety of workers. After World War 2, large quantities of chemical weapons were deposited in the seas. Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water. For many years, radioactive waste had also been dumped into marine ecosystems, although since 1993 there has been a total ban on such disposal of radionuclides.

Specifically, alongside cancellation and postponements of non-essential surgical services, emergency and essential surgical care delivery may become affected due to the shift of human and material resources towards fighting the pandemic. For surgeries that do get carried through, new difficulties arise in protecting surgical personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2. This scarcity in LMIC surgical ecosystems may result in higher morbidity and mortality, in addition to the COVID-19 toll.

Reducing the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on LMIC emergency and essential surgical services can be achieved through empowering communities with accurate information and knowledge on prevention, optimizing surgical material resources, providing quality training of health care personnel to treat SARS-CoV-2, and ensuring adequate personal protection equipment for workers on the frontline. While LMIC health systems are under larger strain, the experience from previous outbreaks may aid in order to innovate and adapt to the current pandemic. Protecting LMIC surgical ecosystems will be a pivotal process in ensuring that previous health system strengthening efforts are preserved, comprehensive care for populations worldwide are ensured, and to allow for future developments beyond the pandemic.","output":"Emergency and essential surgical healthcare services during COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries: A Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores HacktheCrisis, the Swedish hackathon that was a response to the COVID-19 pandemic to address the challenges that it brought up The main aims of the research were to explore the feasibility of the digital only COVID-19 hackathon as an open innovation method and to uncover the major issues that emerged during the HacktheCrisis hackathon in Sweden The process and outcomes were assessed, leading to the lessons and development of recommendations for future health hackathons as an innovation in health care We have found that conducting the virtual hackathon for COVID-19 resulted in significant growth in the digital health community in Sweden Governments should be as fast as the private actors and citizens to address these challenges and to undertake organizational adaptations Not only the hackathons, but the projects and processes after the hackathons should also be planned Matchmaking between individuals and private and public actors should be facilitated throughout the year Technology companies should provide platforms that facilitate flow of process with nice structures and user-friendly tools Organizations were not ready to utilize the outcomes of these hackathons Compared to public organizations, private organizations were faster to join hackathons ? 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Open innovation via crowdsourcing: A digital only hackathon case study from Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than a quarter of working-age households in the United States do not have sufficient savings to cover their expenditures after a month of unemployment.

This prospective follow-up cohort study included 94 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward at the Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy from February 28th to April 30th, 2020. Patients had COVID-19 related pneumonia with respiratory failure. Ninety-four patients out of 193 survivors accepted to be re-evaluated after discharge, on average after 4 months. In ? of the patients an evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was detected, as indicated by an altered diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO); in 6-7% of patients the alteration was classified as of moderate/severe degree. We also evaluated quality of life thorough a structured questionnaire: 52% of the patients still lamented fatigue, 36% effort dyspnea, 10% anorexia, 14% dysgeusia or anosmia, 31% insomnia and 21% anxiety. Finally, we evaluated three prognostic indices (the Brixia radiologic score, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and the 4C mortality score) in terms of prediction of the clinical consequences of the disease. All of them significantly predicted the extent of short-term lung involvement. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia is associated to relevant short-term clinical consequences, both in terms of persistence of symptoms and in terms of impairment of DLCO (indicator of a possible development of pulmonary fibrosis); some severity indices of the disease may predict short-term clinical outcome.

However, little is known regarding the risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity. We aimed to explore early-stage disease risk factors associated with eventual disease severity. Methods : This study enrolled 486 hospitalized, non-intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted adult patients with COVID-19 (age  18 years) treated at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, who were divided into three groups according to disease severity. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data at admission and clinical outcomes were compared among severity groups, and the risk factors for disease severity were identified by multiple regression analysis. Results : Of 486 patients with COVID-19, 405 (83.33%) were discharged, 33 (6.71%) died outside of the ICU, and 48 (7.20%) were still being treated in the ICU by the time the study period ended.

Rates of depression have increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. One known protective factor for depression is social support, but more work is needed to quantify the extent to which social support could reduce depression risk during a global crisis, and specifically to identify which types of support are most helpful, and who might benefit most. METHODS. Data were obtained from participants in the All of Us Research Program who responded to the COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) survey administered monthly from May 2020 to July 2020 (N=69,066, 66% female). Social support was assessed using 10 items measuring emotional/informational support (e.g., someone to confide in or talk to about yourself or your problems), positive social interaction support (e.g., someone to do things with to help you get your mind off things), and tangible support (e.g., someone to help with daily chores if sick). Elevated depression symptoms were defined based on having a moderate-to-severe (10) score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to test associations across time between overall social support and its subtypes with depression, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. We then assessed interactions between social support and potential effect modifiers: age, sex, pre-pandemic mood disorder, and pandemic-related stressors (e.g., financial insecurity). RESULTS. Approximately 16% of the sample experienced elevated depressive symptoms. Overall social support was associated with significantly reduced odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio, aOR [95% CI]=0.44 [0.42C0.45]). Among subtypes, emotional/informational support (aOR=0.42 [0.41C0.43]) and positive social interactions (aOR=0.43 [0.41C0.44]) showed the largest protective associations with depression, followed by tangible support (aOR=0.63 [0.61C0.65]). Sex, age, and pandemic-related financial stressors were statistically significant modifiers of the association between social support and depression. CONCLUSIONS. Individuals reporting higher levels of social support were at reduced risk of depression during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The perceived availability of emotional support and positive social interactions, more so than tangible support, was key. Individuals more vulnerable to depression (e.g., women, younger individuals, and those experiencing financial stressors) may particularly benefit from enhanced social support, supporting a precision prevention approach.","output":"Effects of social support on depression risk during the COVID-19 pandemic: What support types and for whom?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.","output":"Structural Modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/Human ACE2 Complex Interface can Identify High-Affinity Variants Associated with Increased Transmissibility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The emergence of mobile health (mHealth) solutions, particularly mHealth applications (apps), has shown promise in self-management of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Other potential sources were identified by searching for references in retrieved articles, review articles, consensus statements, and articles written by selected authorities. Results: In evaluating cost-effectiveness analyses of AECB antimicrobial therapy it is critical to (1) use the disease-free interval as an outcome measure, (2) evaluate the sequence of multiple therapies, (3) address the impact of both current and future antibiotic resistance, and (4) measure all appropriate AECB-associated costs, both direct and indirect.

Obtaining data on specific source(s) and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV during nosocomial outbreaks has been challenging. We performed a clinical, epidemiological and phylogenetic investigation of an outbreak of MERS-CoV at a University Hospital in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Clinical, epidemiological and infection control data were obtained from patients and Healthcare workers (HCWs). Full genome sequencing was conducted on nucleic acid extracted directly from MERS-CoV PCR-confirmed clinical samples and phylogenetic analysis performed. Phylogenetic analysis combined with published MERS-CoV genomes was performed. HCWs compliance with infection control practices was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 235 persons investigated, there were 23 laboratory confirmed MERS cases, 10 were inpatients and 13 HCWs. Eight of 10 MERS inpatients died (80% mortality). There were no deaths among HCWs. The primary index case assumed from epidemiological investigation was not substantiated phylogenetically. 17/18 of MERS cases were linked both phylogenetically and epidemiologically. One asymptomatic HCW yielded a MERS-CoV genome not directly linked to any other case in the investigation. Five HCWs with mild symptoms yielded >75% full MERS-CoV genome sequences. HCW compliance with use of gowns was 62.1%, gloves 69.7%, and masks 57.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors and sources, including a HCW MERS-CoV carrier phenomenon, occur during nosocomial MERS-CoV outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses of MERS-CoV linked to clinical and epidemiological information is essential for outbreak investigation. The specific role of apparently healthy HCWs in causing nosocomial outbreaks requires further definition.","output":"Nosocomial outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus: A phylogenetic, epidemiological, clinical and infection control analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In todays time, all the government authorities are fighting day and night to stop the spread of Coronavirus.

One hundred thirty-seven Fusarium isolates were identified based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analysis (EF1-), and Koch's postulates were also assessed. The results identified the isolates as 8 species in the Fusarium genus, including F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. fujikuroi, F. asiaticum, F. equiseti, F. meridionale, F. graminearum and F. oxysporum, with isolation frequencies of 30.00, 22.67, 15.33, 7.33, 6.00, 5.33, 3.33 and 1.33%, respectively. Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum were the dominant and subdominant species, respectively. Two or more Fusarium species such as F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum were simultaneously identified at a mixed infection rate of 14.67% in the present study. The pathogenicity test results showed that F. proliferatum and F. fujikuroi exhibited the highest virulence, with average disease indices of 30.28  2.87 and 28.06  1.96, followed by F. equiseti and F. verticillioides, with disease indices of 21.48  2.14 and 16.21  1.84, respectively.

However, few studies have attempted to narrate, or systematically analyze, the process of their implementation. We performed an observational study of biosensor implementation. The data accuracy provided by the commercially available biosensors was compared to those offered by standard clinical monitoring on patients admitted to the intensive care unit/perioperative unit. Surveys were also conducted to examine the acceptance of technology by patients and medical staff. We demonstrated a significant difference in vital signs between sensors and standard monitoring which was very dependent on the measured variables. Sensors seemed to integrate into the workflow relatively quickly, with almost no reported problems. The acceptance of the biosensors was high by patients and slightly less by nurses directly involved in the patients' care. The staff forecast a broad implementation of biosensors in approximately three to five years, yet are eager to learn more about them. Reliability considerations proved particularly troublesome in our implementation trial.

Annually, Botswana accounts only for a small proportion of cases (<<1%). Despite significantly reduced incidence rate, the country still experiences sporadic outbreaks that hamper the goal of malaria elimination. This review evaluated previous and current biological factors that impact malaria in Botswana, specifically focussing on the vectors, the parasite and the host. This was accomplished via a literature review evaluating these variables in Botswana. Current literature suggests that Anopheles arabiensis is the main malaria vector in the country. Several other potential vectors have been found widely distributed throughout Botswana in high numbers, yet remain largely unstudied with regards to their contribution to the country's malaria burden. We also report the most up to date list of all Anopheles species that have been found in Botswana. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of symptomatic malaria in the country and some drug resistance markers have been documented for this species. Plasmodium vivax has been reported in asymptomatic subjects, even though a large proportion of the Botswana population appears to be Duffy antigen negative. Very little is known about the true distribution of P. vivax and no point of care testing infrastructure for this species exists in Botswana, making it difficult to tailor treatment to address possible recrudescence or relapse. Due to a genetically diverse population with a substantial Khoisan contribution into the Bantu genetic background, several phenotypes that potentially impact prevalence and severity of malaria exist within the country. These include sickle cell trait, Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, and Duffy negativity. This review highlights the information that currently exists on malaria in Botswana.

Thus, we examined the actual and perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life, and the consequences for mental well-being (MWB), and self-rated health (SRH) in German and Swiss employees. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected via an online questionnaire from 2118 German and Swiss employees recruited through an online panel service (18-65 years, working at least 20 h/week, various occupations). The sample provides a good representation of the working population in both countries. Using logistic regression, we analyzed how sociodemographic factors and self-reported changes in work and private life routines were associated with participants' perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life. Moreover, we explored how the perceived impact and self-reported changes were associated with MWB and SRH. RESULTS: About 30% of employees reported that their work and private life had worsened, whereas about 10% reported improvements in work and 13% in private life. Mandatory short-time work was strongly associated with perceived negative impact on work life, while work from home, particularly if experienced for the first time, was strongly associated with a perceived positive impact on work life. Concerning private life, younger age, living alone, reduction in leisure time, and changes in quantity of caring duties were strongly associated with perceived negative impact. In contrast, living with a partner or family, short-time work, and increases in leisure time and caring duties were associated with perceived positive impact on private life. Perceived negative impact of the crisis on work and private life and mandatory short-time work were associated with lower MWB and SRH. Moreover, perceived positive impact on private life and an increase in leisure time were associated with higher MWB.

Fragmentation of emergency supply chain resources motivates us to propose a new vehicle routing and scheduling model equipped with novel features to ensure minimal response time using existing resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data set of medical and fire-related emergencies from January 2018 to May 2018 of Uttarakhand State in India was provided by GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK EMRI) also known as 108 EMSs was used in the study. The proposed model integrates all the available EMS vehicles including partial outsourcing to non-ambulatory vehicles like police vans, taxis, etc., using a novel two-echelon heuristic approach. In the first stage, an offline learning model is developed to yield the deployment strategy for EMS vehicles. Seven well researched machine learning (ML) algorithms were analyzed for parameter prediction namely random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In the second stage, a real-time routing model is proposed for EMS vehicle routing at the time of emergency, considering partial outsourcing. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicate that the RF classifier outperforms the LR, LDA, SVM, CNN, CART and NB classifier in terms of both accuracy as well as F-1 score.

Watson's theory of human caring served as the conceptual framework for the study. RESULTS: Several themes emerged regarding nurses' experiences of communication with patients and families. These include communication challenges and barriers, prioritization, integration of group communication, nurse self-reflection, and acceptance of gratitude. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings underscore the importance of nurses' communication with patients and families under the pandemic's restricted conditions. They demonstrate the value of nurses' ability to innovate in fostering all parties' participation in the plan of care, and highlight the comfort nurses provide to patients who are isolated from loved ones. Strategies that fostered communication were identified, as were areas for further research.","output":"Original Research: Nurses' Experiences of Caring for Patients and Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Communication Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTARCT A novel compound of 1-benzyl-2-(4-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)-4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazole (BMNDPI) are conveniently synthesized and characterized by spectral analysis FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) computations.

It has become more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes, practices of hand hygiene among final-year medical students. It also explored reported hand hygiene behavior before the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for educational strategies to correct the deficiencies. METHODS: A concurrent mixed-method approach was used. In the quantitative strand, a cross-sectional online survey was carried out via a Google form. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-squared test were used for comparisons. In the qualitative strand, twelve participants were interviewed, based on a semi-structured interview guide and audio recorded. Transcribed data were evaluated with thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 225 final-year medical students were studied in the quantitative strand. Most were females. The mean score for knowledge was 3.35  0.795 out of six. Of them, 31.6 % of participants scored below 3 points (< 50 % of the total). Most (78.9 %) had positive attitudes (score of > 80 %). Only 36.4 % reported adequate hand hygiene performance in all eight dimensions of the behavior domain. Noticeably, fewer participants reported to clean their hands after checking blood pressure (55.6 %), and only 66.2 % stated carrying a hand sanitizer in their pocket. Significant correlations were not found between reported behavior and attitudes (p = 0.821) or knowledge (p = 0.794). The qualitative strand with 12 respondents revealed the positive influence of both hierarchical and non-hierarchal role models. Time constraints, skin irritation, and workload pressures were the main barriers. Frequent reminders, supervision, and interactive teaching were suggested as methods to improve hand hygiene compliance. They also stated that increased enthusiasm was noted on hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene. Yet, a considerable gap between attitudes and knowledge and reported hand hygiene behavior was evident. Coupling educational programs that use cognitive and behavioral methods, including role modeling, supervision, and frequent reminders, is recommended to bridge the knowledge-attitude-behavior gap.

Here, we show that zinc chelation leads to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in epithelial cells and addition of zinc restores ROS levels to basal state. Addition of ROS (H2O2) inhibited dengue virus (DENV) infection in a dose-dependent manner indicating that oxidative stress has adverse effects on DENV infection. ROS affects early stages of DENV replication as observed by quantitation of positive and negative strand viral RNA. We observed that addition of ROS specifically affected viral titres of positive strand RNA viruses. We further demonstrate that ROS specifically altered SEC31A expression at the ER suggesting a role for SEC31A-mediated pathways in the life-cycle of positive strand RNA viruses and provides an opportunity to identify drug targets regulating oxidative stress responses for antiviral development.","output":"Oxidative stress specifically inhibits replication of dengue virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies often exhibit autoimmune features, including CD4+ and some CD8+ T lymphocytes that recognize epitopes derived from alpha-synuclein.

Here, we review literature on neuronal antigen presentation and its potential role in PD. Although direct evidence for CD8+ T cell-mediated neuronal death is lacking in PD, neuronal antigen presentation appears central to the pathology of Rasmussen's encephalitis, a pediatric neurological disorder driven by cytotoxic T cell infiltration and neuroinflammation. Emerging data suggest that T cells enter the brain in PD and other synucleinopathies, where the majority of neuromelanin-containing substantia nigra and locus coeruleus neurons express MHC Class I molecules. In cell culture, CD8+ T cell recognition of antigen:MHC Class I complexes on neuronal membranes leads to cytotoxic responses and neuronal cell death. Recent animal models suggest the possibility of T cell autoreactivity to mitochondrial antigens in PD.

To explore and assess the effective strategies for curtailing the epidemic risk from international importation nationwide, we evaluate the Joint Prevention and Control mechanism that China adopted, which was made up of nineteen containment policies including quarantine, nucleic acid testing (NAT), border closure and flight service adjustment.Methods: To illustrate how the multi-pronged policies affect the confirmation of imported COVID-19 cases, the change of diagnosis time of the cases from border arrival to a clinical confirmation were selected as the key variable. Based on 1,314 epidemiological-survey cases from February 29 to May 25, 2020 in China, we applied negative binomial regression models to predict how each policy is associated with the variation of the diagnosis time. We then compared the average means of the marginal effect of each policy before and after its implementation in different port-of-entry cities.Findings: We found that multi-dimensional interventional policies are effective, when they were implemented in a synchronized manner. Strategies, such as centralized quarantine and NAT, flight service adjustment and border closure, were found to facilitate an early identification of infected inbound case. Specifically, from arrival to clinical confirmation, a coordinated implementation of these aforementioned policies is associated with a maximum reduction in diagnosis interval up to 3.38 days, 2.35 days and 2.23 days, respectively.Interpretation: The study suggests that the prevention of a domestic spreading of COVID-19 from importation can be effective when the intervention polices are implemented in a timely, multi-dimensional and synchronized manner.Funding Statement: This research was supported by a research grant from the Sustainability Institute, The Ohio State University.Declaration of Interests: Authors declare no competing interests.","output":"The Effect of the Progressive Multi-Dimensional Policies on Imported COVID-19 Curtailment in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prevalent co-occurrence between parental stress and depression has been established prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry.

Elevated levels of troponin have been noted to predict worse prognosis for COVID-19 patients, regardless the physiology of insult. We report a case of a 65-year old man who was admitted for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 disease that rapidly decompensated and required mechanical ventilation. He responded well with medical treatment and was successfully extubated. Interestingly, his serum troponin T levels remained negative (<0.01 ng/mL) until day 10, when it was noted to be elevated despite him being completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed new left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggestive of reverse Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Unfortunately, he suffered from a pulseless electrical arrest less than 24 hours later and eventually expired. This case shows that a policy of trending troponin levels may be valuable as a screening tool for critically ill COVID-19 patients and may be beneficial for early silent validation of cardiovascular involvement in these patients, who could otherwise be asymptomatic yet presage adverse clinical events. Moreover, using troponin as a screening tool may lead to decreased utilization of echocardiography and reduce the exposure of COVID-19 to healthcare workers.","output":"An Interesting Case of COVID-19 Induced Reversed Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy and Insight on Cardiac Biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigated the association between telework frequency and the presence of non-COVID-19Crelated physical symptoms during the COVID-19 emergency declaration among workers in Japan.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies quickly published guidelines recommending avoiding laparoscopy or to consider open surgery because of the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surgical smoke or aerosol. This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications. RESULTS: Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50. Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy. SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol. CONCLUSION: If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase between December 1, 2019 and November 18, 2020 to identify case reports or series of patients who had COVID-19 diagnosed based on positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing and had CSF testing due to a neurologic symptom. RESULTS: We identified 242 relevant documents which included 430 patients with COVID-19 who had acute neurological symptoms prompting CSF testing. Of those, 321 (75%) patients had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). Of 304 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, there were 17 (6%) whose test was positive, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). The majority (13/17, 76%) of these patients were admitted to the hospital because of neurological symptoms. Of 58 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 7 (12%) had positive antibodies with evidence of intrathecal synthesis, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the CNS. Of 132 patients who had oligoclonal bands evaluated, 3 (2%) had evidence of intrathecal antibody synthesis. Of 77 patients tested for autoimmune antibodies in the CSF, 4 (5%) had positive findings. CONCLUSION: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare.

The transition from cubicles to the home office raised many questions in connection with companies adopting the new working conditions. Our paper provides recent evidence on the extent of this move, its impact on workplace evolution, productivity and the future prevalence of the face-to-display workplace after the easing of the lockdown. It uses data from 154 service employees of an Austrian sports and leisure product company obtained using online surveys on employees' opinions on e-working. By a coincidence, we conducted the first of them shortly prior to the epidemic. We decided to modify our planned research goals and decided to study their opinions during different Covid-19 stages. As a result, our findings do not follow all the academic standards. First, they are almost impossible to replicate due to the specific coincidence. Then, the shift in our aims leads us to minor changes in the content of the questionnaire. There are not only significant differences in the proportion of workers in the office and at home during the different periods of the lockdown. After its end, there was a significant increase in the number of those who had started working at home-more than one half. Compared to the period prior to the lockdown, they have a tolerant attitude to their work from home and believe that their productivity might remain the same. For many of them the change was an unavoidable obligation so they would prefer to return to the traditional workplace. The results suggest that more than one fifth want to continue working from home permanently, about one third more frequently than before, more than a quarter sometimes and just one seventh not at all. We studied the issues related to their productivity and its limits during all three stages. There are three important reasons for the fall in productivity related to e-working: (1) Providing childcare/home schooling, pet sitting and/or care for others while working (>one-fourth);(2) Work-from-home routine (>one-fourth);and (3) Having less work to do (>one-fifth).","output":"Data on an Austrian Company's Productivity in the Pre-Covid-19 Era, During the Lockdown and After Its Easing: To Work Remotely or Not?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T-cell deficiency related to disease, medical treatment, or aging represents a major clinical challenge and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in cancer and bone marrow transplantation recipients. This study describes several innovative and clinically relevant strategies to manipulate thymic function based on an interventional radiology technique for intrathymic injection of cells or drugs. We show that intrathymic injection of multipotent hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells into irradiated syngeneic or allogeneic young or aged recipients resulted in efficient and long-lasting generation of functional donor T cells. Persistence of intrathymic donor cells was associated with intrathymic presence of cells resembling long-term hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting a self-renewal capacity of the intrathymically injected cells. Furthermore, our approach enabled the induction of long-term antigen-specific T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity following intrathymic injection of progenitor cells harboring a transgenic T-cell receptor gene. The intrathymic injection of interleukin-7 prior to irradiation conferred radioprotection. In addition, thymopoiesis of aged mice improved with a single intrathymic administration of low-dose keratinocyte growth factor, an effect that was sustained even in the setting of radiation-induced injury.

The US healthcare system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenged by a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. Restricted use, re-use, and sanitation of PPE have been widely adopted to provide protection for frontline healthcare workers caring for often critically ill and highly contagious patients. This objective of this manuscript is to describe our validated process for N95 respirator sanitation. DESIGN: Process development, validation, and implementation. SETTING: Level-I urban academic medical center. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed a novel evidence-based process for N95 respirator re-processing and sanitation using ultraviolet (UV) light. Dose measurement, structural integrity, moisture content, particle filtration, fit testing, and environmental testing were performed for both quality control and validation of the process. RESULTS: The process achieved UV light dosing for sanitation while maintaining the functional and structural integrity of the N95 respirators, with a daily potential throughput capacity of ??12,000 masks. This process has supported our health system to provide respiratory PPE to all frontline team members.

Databases searched were Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to July 2nd, 2020. Both observational studies and clinical trials were considered, if patients were newly diagnosed and between 20 and 35 years of age and reported on BMD. We critically appraised the identified studies using ROBINS-I and summarized the findings narratively.

In total, 188 patients were included, and the study population consisted primarily of women with an age range between 29 and 37 years old. Compared to healthy controls, our target population had lower BMD. Moreover, a strict GFD may increase BMD during a follow-up period of up to 5 years. Newly diagnosed CD patients aged 20C35 years are at risk of lower BMD. Therefore, it may be crucial to assess BMD at time of diagnosis in young women.

Despite the high diffusion, only a subset of patients developed severe COVID-19: around 25% of them developed acute kidney injury (AKI) and one-third of them died. Elderly patients and patients with high comorbidities were identified as being at higher risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Our prospective observational cohort study includes 392 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Milan (median age 67 years, 75% male). We evaluated the relationship between blood pressure at presentation, presence of AKI at Emergency Department admission and during hospitalization, and total in-hospital mortality (24%). RESULTS: Although 58% of our study patients reported a history of hypertension (HYP) (86% on treatment), 30% presented with low blood pressure levels. Only 5.5% were diagnosed with AKI on admission; 75% of hypertensive patients discontinued therapy during hospitalization (only 20% were on treatment at discharge). Gender and hypertension were strongly associated with AKI at admission (odds ratio 11). Blood pressure was inversely correlated with increased risk of AKI upon admission, regardless of the severity of respiratory distress. Age over 65, history of hypertension, and severity of respiratory distress were the main predictors of AKI, which developed in 34.7% of cases during hospitalization. AKI was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Hypertension and low blood pressure at presentation were the main predictors of in-hospital mortality, together with age over 65, baseline pulmonary involvement, and severity of illness.

Our results showed that astaxanthin suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and lipid peroxidation activities in LPS-induced DCs and LPS-challenged mice. Moreover, the reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and the GSH/GSSG ratio were increased, suggesting that astaxanthin elevated the level of cellular reductive status.

However, little is known about these arrhythmiastheir frequency, the underlying mechanisms, and their impact on mortality. METHODS: We extracted data from a registry (NCT04358029) regarding consecutive inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 who were receiving continuous telemetric ECG monitoring and had a definitive disposition of hospital discharge or death. Between patients who died versus discharged, we compared a primary composite end point of cardiac arrest from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or bradyarrhythmias such as atrioventricular block. RESULTS: Among 800 patients with COVID-19 at Mount Sinai Hospital with definitive dispositions, 140 patients had telemetric monitoring, and either died (52) or were discharged (88). The median (interquartile range) age was 61 years (48C74); 73% men; and ethnicity was White in 34%. Comorbidities included hypertension in 61%, coronary artery disease in 25%, ventricular arrhythmia history in 1.4%, and no significant comorbidities in 16%. Compared with discharged patients, those who died had elevated peak troponin I levels (0.27 versus 0.02 ng/mL) and more primary end point events (17% versus 4%, P=0.01)a difference driven by tachyarrhythmias. Fatal tachyarrhythmias invariably occurred in the presence of severe metabolic imbalance, while atrioventricular block was largely an independent primary event. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who die experience malignant cardiac arrhythmias more often than those surviving to discharge. However, these events represent a minority of cardiovascular deaths, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias are mainly associated with severe metabolic derangement.

The mechanisms of innate immunity, considered as the first line of antiviral defense, is essential towards viruses. A significant role in host defense of the lung, nasal and oral cavities is played by Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) HE4 has been demonstrated to be serum inflammatory biomarker and to show a role in natural immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract with both antimicrobial/antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Several biomarkers like IL-6, presepsin (PSP), procalcitonin (PCT), CRP, D-Dimer have showed a good function as predictor factors for the clinical evolution of COVID-19 patients (mild, severe and critical). The aim of this study was to correlate the blood levels of CRP, IL-6, PSP, PCT, D-Dimer with He4, to identify the predictive values of these biomarkers for the evolution of the disease and to evaluate the possible role of HE4 in the defense mechanisms of innate immunity at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Of 134 patients admitted at COVID hospital of PoliclinicoUniversity of Bari, 86 (58 men age 67.6  12.4 and 28 women age 65.7  15.4) fulfilled the inclusion criteria: in particular, 80 patients (93%) showed prodromal symptoms (smell and/or taste dysfunctions) and other typical clinical manifestations and 19 died (13 men age 73.4  7.7 and 6 women age 74.8  6.7). 48 patients were excluded because 13 finished chemotherapy and 6 radiotherapy recently, 5 presented suspected breast carcinoma, 5 suspected lung carcinoma, 6 suspected ovarian carcinoma or ovary cyst, 1 cystic fibrosis, 3 renal fibrosis and 9 were affected by autoimmune diseases in treatment with monoclonal antibodies. The venous sample was taken for each patient on the admission and during the hospital stay. For each patient, six measurements relating to considered parameters were performed. Significant correlations between He4 and IL-6 levels (r = 0.797), between He4 and PSP (r = 0.621), between He4 and PCT (r = 0.447), between He4 and D-Dimer (r = 0.367), between He4 and RCP (r = 0.327) have been found. ROC curves analysis showed an excellent accuracy for He4 (AUC = 0.92) and IL-6 (AUC = 0.91), a very good accuracy for PSP (AUC = 0.81), a good accuracy for PCT (AUC = 0.701) and D-Dimer (AUC = 0.721) and sufficient accuracy for RCP (AUC = 0.616). These results demonstrated the important correlation between He4, IL6 and PSP, an excellent accuracy of He4 and IL6 and showed a probable role of He4 in the innate immunity in particularly at the level of oral cavity, nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Besides He4 together with IL6 might be involved in the onset of smell and/or taste disorders and it might be used as innovative biomarker to monitor clinical evolution of COVID-19 because He4 could indicate a multi-organ involvement.","output":"New Insights in Laboratory Testing for COVID-19 Patients: Looking for the Role and Predictive Value of Human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) and the Innate Immunity of the Oral Cavity and Respiratory Tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late 2019, communities have been required to rapidly adopt community mitigation strategies rarely used before, or only in limited settings. This study aimed to examine the attitudes and beliefs of Australian adults towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and willingness and capacity to engage with these mitigation measures. In addition, we aimed to explore the psychosocial and demographic factors that are associated with adoption of recommended hygiene-related and avoidance-related behaviors. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey of 1420 Australian adults (18 years and older) was undertaken between the 18 and 24 March 2020. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The survey of 1420 respondents found 50% (710) of respondents felt COVID-19 would somewhat affect their health if infected and 19% perceived their level of risk as high or very high. 84.9% had performed []1 of the three recommended hygiene-related behaviors and 93.4% performed []1 of six avoidance-related behaviors over the last one month. Adopting avoidance behaviors was associated with trust in government/authorities (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI 3-9.0), higher perceived rating of effectiveness of behaviors (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 2.8-6.9) and higher levels of perceived ability to adopt social distancing strategies (aOR: 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). Interpretation: In the last two months, members of the public have been inundated with messages about hygiene and social (physical) distancing. However, our results indicate that a continued focus on supporting community understanding of the rationale for these strategies, as well as instilling community confidence in their ability to adopt or sustain the recommendations is needed.","output":"COVID-19 is rapidly changing: Examining public perceptions and behaviors in response to this evolving pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article investigates the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on electoral participation.

In addition to the simple note that turnout rates decreased to a historically low level, we establish a robust relationship between the depressed turnout rate and the disease. Using various estimation strategies and employing a large number of potential confounding factors, we find that the participation rate decreases with city proximity to COVID-19 clusters. Furthermore, the proximity has conditioned impacts according to the proportion of elderly -who are the most threatened- within the city. Cities with higher population density, where the risk of infection is higher, and cities where only one list ran at the election, which dramatically reduces competitiveness, experienced differentiated effects of distance.","output":"How does COVID-19 affect electoral participation? evidence from the French municipal elections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Implementation of effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures is needed to support global capacity building to limit transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mitigate its impact on health systems.

The survey addressed the presence of COVID-19 guidelines as well as specific IPC preparedness activities in response to the outbreak. Findings In total, 339 IPC professionals spanning 63 countries in all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions, mostly from tertiary care centres participated. Of all participants, 66{middle dot}6% were aware of the existence of national guidelines to prevent COVID-19.

In terms of clinical psychology, nomophobia has been linked consistently to depression and anxiety. Studies also investigated whether it is a dependency, an impulse control problem, an obsession or a phobia; however, no clear clinical representation was confirmed. Although it was proposed to be added as an official diagnosis to DSM-5, these attempts were inconclusive. In this study, nomophobia was examined clinically by SCL-90 factors. A hierarchical regression analysis was performed by controlling anxiety, depression, phobia and obsessions by putting them in the first step. At the next step, paranoid ideation was entered while interpersonal sensitivity was introduced at the last step. The variables were assigned according to the steps according to their connections confirmed by the literature, the correlation coefficients and  weights obtained in the current study. The hierarchical regression analysis confirmed that after controlling anxiety, depression, phobia and obsessions, nomophobia is explained by interpersonal sensitivity. Paranoid ideation is also an important variable in step 2, but it lost its significance in the last step. Nevertheless, it was thought that what makes people sensitive to interpersonal issues is a kind of fear of missing out others experiences (FoMO) which is related to nomophobia. This fear of missing out might prepare people to constantly check on mobile phones thinking paranoid about what they might have been missing or deprived of. Clinical implications and limitations were discussed.","output":"Does interpersonal sensitivity and paranoid ideation predict nomophobia: an analysis with a young adult sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-based acrylic bone cement is commonly used to fix bone and metallic implants in orthopedic procedures. The polymerization initiator tri-n-butylborane (TBB) has been reported to significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of PMMA-based bone cement compared to benzoyl peroxide (BPO). However, it is unknown whether this benefit is temporary or long-lasting, which is important to establish given that bone cement is expected to remain in situ permanently. Here, we compared the biocompatibility of PMMA-TBB and PMMA-BPO bone cements over several days. Rat femur-derived osteoblasts were seeded onto two commercially-available PMMA-BPO bone cements and experimental PMMA-TBB polymerized for one day, three days, or seven days. Significantly more cells attached to PMMA-TBB bone cement during the initial stages of culture than on both PMMA-BPO cements, regardless of the age of the materials. Proliferative activity and differentiation markers including alkaline phosphatase production, calcium deposition, and osteogenic gene expression were consistently and considerably higher in cells grown on PMMA-TBB than on PMMA-BPO, regardless of cement age. Although osteoblastic phenotypes were more favorable on older specimens for all three cement types, biocompatibility increased between three-day-old and seven-day-old PMMA-BPO specimens, and between one-day-old and three-day-old PMMA-TBB specimens. PMMA-BPO materials produced more free radicals than PMMA-TBB regardless of the age of the material. These data suggest that PMMA-TBB maintains superior biocompatibility over PMMA-BPO bone cements over prolonged periods of at least seven days post-polymerization. This superior biocompatibility can be ascribed to both low baseline cytotoxicity and a further rapid reduction in cytotoxicity, representing a new biological advantage of PMMA-TBB as a novel bone cement material.","output":"Prolonged Post-Polymerization Biocompatibility of Polymethylmethacrylate-Tri-n-Butylborane (PMMA-TBB) Bone Cement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 induced restrictions ordered by governments around the world have been an exogenous shock to the music industry, which we divide into two affected groups: 1) live music events and 2) recorded music. While the impact on live music events is rather obvious, it is unclear how the current pandemic is affecting the recorded music market. Hence, we study consumers pre- and post-pandemic shifts in consumer spending (in euros) and music consumption (in hours) across live music events, as well as the digital and physical submarkets of recorded music, in the worlds fourth largest music market, Germany. Relying on an online bi-annual panel capturing five waves between winter 2018/19 and winter 2020/21, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the continuous trend towards digitalization of the music landscape with premium streaming being the biggest beneficiary. However, total monthly consumer spending on music decreased by more than 45% compared to pre-pandemic, with live music events and physical sales being the most severely affected. Surprisingly, music consumption in hours also decreased during the lockdown even though consumers spent more time at home.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on music consumption and music spending"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested the COVID pandemic may have indirectly affected the treatment and outcome of STEMI patients, by avoidance or significant delays in contacting the emergency system. No data have been reported on the impact of diabetes on treatment and outcome of STEMI patients, that was therefore the aim of the current subanalysis conducted in patients included in the International Study on Acute Coronary Syndromes-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (ISACS-STEMI) COVID-19. METHODS: The ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 is a retrospective registry performed in European centers with an annual volume of > 120 primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and assessed STEMI patients, treated with primary PCI during the same periods of the years 2019 versus 2020 (March and April). Main outcomes are the incidences of primary PCI, delayed treatment, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 6609 patients underwent primary PCI in 77 centers, located in 18 countries. Diabetes was observed in a total of 1356 patients (20.5%), with similar proportion between 2019 and 2020. During the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in primary PCI as compared to 2019, similar in both patients with (Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.85, p < 0.0001) and without diabetes (IRR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85, p < 0.0001) (p int = 0.40). We observed a significant heterogeneity among centers in the population with and without diabetes (p < 0.001, respectively). The heterogeneity among centers was not related to the incidence of death due to COVID-19 in both groups of patients. Interaction was observed for Hypertension (p = 0.024) only in absence of diabetes. Furthermore, the pandemic was independently associated with a significant increase in door-to-balloon and total ischemia times only among patients without diabetes, which may have contributed to the higher mortality, during the pandemic, observed in this group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a similar reduction in primary PCI procedures in both patients with and without diabetes. Hypertension had a significant impact on PCI reduction only among patients without diabetes. We observed a significant increase in ischemia time and door-to-balloon time mainly in absence of diabetes, that contributed to explain the increased mortality observed in this group of patients during the pandemic.

Our objective is to evaluate the emotional distress on the cancer population after the second wave and to compare it indirectly with the onset of the pandemic. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional, single-center study of 102 Spanish cancer patients recruited between the months of January and March 2021. Patients of any age, with tumors of any location and in any phase of the disease were included. Socioeconomic, health care and psychological variables have been collected, using the Kessler K-10 scale for the assessment of psychological distress. The association analysis of socio-sanitary variables with emotional variables was carried out using the Chi-square test in SPSS v25. Results: In our cohort, 74% of the cases were between 50 and 74 years old. The most represented tumors were breast (26%) followed by colorectal cancer (18%). 51% were retired people and 19% had temporary work disability, while around 6% were unemployed. 15% reported a change in income and around 19% lived alone without companions. Regarding health variables, 11% had presented symptoms associated with SARS CoV2 infection, 21% reported a longer waiting time for diagnostic test or initiation of oncological treatment, and 17% highlighted a shorter attention time by their medical oncologist. In relation to the emotional impact, a statistically significant relationship (p <0.05) was observed between the female sex and greater nervousness, retired people and less nervousness and despair, as well as the delay in health care and greater feeling of uselessness, despair, restlessness and depression, especially if this occurred more than 1 occasion. Conclusions: the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a worsening of the socioeconomic and health conditions of cancer patients, persisting beyond the second pandemic wave. This is causing a chronification of the psychological impact in this population that could be improved with adequate prevention measures and better health care.

Defibrotide (DF) is a polyanionic compound with fibrinolytic, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties. Research Question What is the safety and tolerability of defibrotide in patients with severe SARS-CoV2 infections? Study Design and Methods We report a prospective, open label, single center safety trial of DF for the management of SARS-CoV2 related ARDS. Eligible subjects were 18 years in age, with clinical and radiographic signs of ARDS, no signs of active bleeding, a serum D-Dimer >2X ULN, and a positive PCR-based assay for SARS-CoV-2. Defibrotide (6.25 mg/kg/dose IV q.6hours) was administered for a planned 7-day course, with serum D-Dimer levels and respiratory function monitored daily during therapy. Results Twelve subjects (median 63 years) were treated, with 10 on mechanical ventilation and six on vasopressor support at study entry. The median D-Dimer was 3.25 mcg/ml (1.33-12.3) at study entry. The median duration of therapy was seven days. No hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications occurred during therapy. No other adverse events attributable to DF were noted. Four subjects met the day 7 pulmonary response parameter, all four having a decrease in serum D-Dimer levels within the initial 72-hours of DF therapy. Three subjects died from progressive pulmonary disease, 11, 17 and 34 days following study entry. Nine subjects (75%) remain alive, 64 to 174 days following initiation of DF. Day 30 all-cause mortality was 17%(95%CI:0-35%). All subjects with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 >125 mmHg survived, whereas the three subjects with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 <125 mmHg died. Interpretation The use of DF for management of SARS-CoV-2-related ARDS proved safe and tolerable. No hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications were reported during therapy, with promising outcomes in a patient population with a historically high mortality rate.","output":"Defibrotide therapy for SARS-CoV2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an urgent global health threat and the worlds deadliest infectious disease despite being largely curable. A critical challenge is to ensure that patients adhere to the full course of treatment to prevent the continued spread of the disease and development of drug-resistant disease. Mobile health interventions hold promise to provide the required adherence support to improve TB treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB treatment support tools (TB-TSTs) intervention on treatment outcomes (success and default) and to assess patient and provider perceptions of the facilitators and barriers to TB-TSTs implementation. METHODS: The TB-TSTs study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel groups in which 400 adult patients newly diagnosed with TB will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus TB-TSTs. Participants will be recruited on a rolling basis from 4 clinical sites in Argentina. The intervention consists of a smartphone progressive web app, a treatment supporter (eg, TB nurse, physician, or social worker), and a direct adherence test strip engineered for home use. Intervention group participants will report treatment progress and interact with a treatment supporter using the app and metabolite urine test strip. The primary outcome will be treatment success. Secondary outcomes will include treatment default rates, self-reported adherence, technology use, and usability. We will assess patients and providers perceptions of barriers to implementation and synthesize lessons learned. We hypothesize that the TB-TSTs intervention will be more effective because it allows patients and TB supporters to monitor and address issues in real time and provide tailored support. We will share the results with stakeholders and policy makers. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2020, with a delayed start due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and complete enrollment is expected by approximately July 2022. Data collection and follow-up are expected to be completed 6 months after the last patient is enrolled. Results from the analyses based on the primary end points are expected to be submitted for publication within a year of data collection completion. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this randomized controlled trial will be the first study to evaluate a patient-centered remote treatment support strategy using a mobile tool and a home-based direct drug metabolite test. The results will provide robust scientific evidence on the effectiveness, implementation, and adoption of mobile health tools. The findings have broader implications not only for TB adherence but also more generally for chronic disease management and will improve our understanding of how to support patients facing challenging treatment regimens.

Studies published to date have investigated the initial months following the onset of the pandemic, despite national and regional restrictions persisting to Summer 2021. Methods: We conducted a descriptive time series analysis utilising data from the Greater Manchester Care Record, which contains de-identified, primary care health records of 2.8 million patients. Counts of incident and all episodes of self-harm recorded between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021 were made for all patients, with stratification by sex, age group, ethnicity, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD) quintile and examination of overall differences by national and regional restriction phases. Findings: Between 1st January 2019 and 31st May 2021, 33,444 episodes of self-harm by 13,148 individuals were recorded. Frequency ratios of incident and all episodes of self-harm were 0.59 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.69) and 0.69 (CI 0.63 to 0.75) respectively in April 2020 compared to February 2020. Between August 2020 and May 2021 frequency ratios were 0.92 (CI 0.88 to 0.96) for incident episodes and 0.86 (CI 0.84 to 0.88) for all episodes compared to the same months in 2019. Reductions were largest among men and people living in the most deprived neighbourhoods. An increase in all-episode self-harm (frequency ratio 1.09, CI 1.03 to 1.16) was observed for adolescents aged 10-17 between August 2020 and May 2021. Interpretation: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a sustained impact on help seeking for self-harm. Reductions in primary care recorded self-harm have implications for clinicians' ability to assess the needs and risks of individuals. Some patients may be experiencing prolonged untreated deterioration in their mental health while other groups are presenting in higher numbers.

Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation.

Ion channels play an important role in the maintenance of vascular tone, the impairment of which is a critical precursor to disease progression. Recent evidence suggests that the dysregulation of ion channel function in dyslipidemia is one of many contributors to the advancement of cardiovascular disease thus bringing to light a novel yet putative therapeutic avenue for preventing the progression of disease mechanisms. Increasing evidence suggests that lipid regulation of ion channels often occurs through direct binding of the lipid with the ion channel thereby creating a potential therapeutic target wherein preventing specific lipid-ion channel interactions, perhaps in combination with established lipid lowering therapies, may restore ion channel function and the proper control of vascular tone. Here we first detail specific examples of lipid-ion channel interactions that promote vascular dysfunction and highlight the benefits of preventing such interactions. We next discuss the putative therapeutic avenues, such as peptides, monoclonal antibodies, and aspects of nanomedicine that may be utilized to prevent pathological lipid-ion channel interactions.

Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the day of admission. APSRAs including IgG and/or IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and anti-2-glycoprotein1 (anti-2GP1) as well as lupus anticoagulant (LAC) were measured. Finding: In this study, 54 severe COVID-19 cases with positive RT-PCR and/or chest CT scan were recruited. Positive APSRAs was found in 7 (12.9%) patients. Positive LAC was more prevalent marker as compared to other tests (11.1%). The prevalence of positive aCL (IgM or IgG) and anti-?2 GPI (IgM or IgG) was 1.8% (in an elderly woman). Lower oxygen saturation was found in positive APSRAs group as opposed to negative APSRAs group (70.39 vs 84.89.7%).

Particularly, the identification of circulating cell-free chemical and biochemical substances, cellular and subcellular entities, and extracellular vesicles has demonstrated promising applications in understanding the physiologic and pathologic conditions of an individual. Traditionally, tissue biopsy has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of many diseases, especially cancer. More recently, liquid biopsy for biomarker detection has emerged as a non-invasive or minimally invasive and less costly method for diagnosis of both cancerous and non-cancerous diseases, while also offering information on the progression or improvement of disease. Unfortunately, the standardization of analytical methods to isolate and quantify circulating cells and extracellular vesicles, as well as their extracted biochemical constituents, is still cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive. To address these limitations, we have developed a prototype of a portable, miniaturized instrument that uses immunoaffinity capillary electrophoresis (IACE) to isolate, concentrate, and analyze cell-free biomarkers and/or tissue or cell extracts present in biological fluids. Isolation and concentration of analytes is accomplished through binding to one or more biorecognition affinity ligands immobilized to a solid support, while separation and analysis are achieved by high-resolution capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to one or more detectors. When compared to other existing methods, the process of this affinity capture, enrichment, release, and separation of one or a panel of biomarkers can be carried out on-line with the advantages of being rapid, automated, and cost-effective. Additionally, it has the potential to demonstrate high analytical sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity. As the potential of liquid biopsy grows, so too does the demand for technical advances. In this review, we therefore discuss applications and limitations of liquid biopsy and hope to introduce the idea that our affinity capture-separation device could be used as a form of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic technology to isolate, concentrate, and analyze circulating cells, extracellular vesicles, and viruses.","output":"A Two-Dimensional Affinity Capture and Separation Mini-Platform for the Isolation, Enrichment, and Quantification of Biomarkers and Its Potential Use for Liquid Biopsy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Web services are used through all disciplines in life sciences and the online landscape is growing by hundreds of novel servers annually.

Furthermore, it can efficiently remove organic pollutants from water such as dyes, tetracycline antibiotics and neonicotinoid pesticides, demonstrating that the adsorption material has a certain universality.

Both severity and disease indices of EAE in OGF- and LDN-treated mice were notably decreased from MOG+Vehicle cohorts.

We found the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV N protein to be an appropriate system to address this issue. Using high resolution PAGE analysis, this protein could be separated into phosphorylated and unphosphorylated isoforms. Mass spectrometric analysis and deletion mapping showed that the major phosphorylation sites were located at the central serine-arginine (SR)-rich motif that contains several glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 substrate consensus sequences. GSK-3-specific inhibitor treatment dephosphorylated the N protein, and this could be recovered by the constitutively active GSK-3 kinase. Immunoprecipitation brought down both N and GSK-3 proteins in the same complex, and the N protein could be phosphorylated directly at its SR-rich motif by GSK-3 using an in vitro kinase assay. Mutation of the two priming sites critical for GSK-3 phosphorylation in the SR-rich motif abolished N protein phosphorylation. Finally, GSK-3 inhibitor was found to reduce N phosphorylation in the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-infected VeroE6 cells and decrease the viral titer and cytopathic effects. The effect of GSK-3 inhibitor was reproduced in another coronavirus, the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus.

METHODS Cross-sectional survey of U.S. and Canadian hospitals with non-cardiac eCPR programs. Variables included hospital and surgical group demographics, eCPR inclusion/exclusion criteria, cannulation approaches, and outcomes (survival to decannulation and survival to discharge). RESULTS Surveys were completed by 40 hospitals in the United States (37) and Canada (3) among an estimated 49 programs (82% response rate). Respondents tended to work in >200 bed free-standing children's hospitals (27, 68%). Pediatric general surgeons respond to activations in 32 (80%) cases, with a median group size of 7 (IQR 5,9.5); 8 (20%) responding institutions take in-house call and 63% have a formal back-up system for eCPR. Dedicated simulation programs were reported by 22 (55%) respondents. Annual eCPR activations average approximately 6/year; approximately 39% of patients survived to decannulation, with 35% surviving to discharge. Cannulations occurred in a variety of settings and were mostly done through the neck at the purview of cannulating surgeon/proceduralist.

We use population representative data to identify key predictors of child stunting in Bangladesh and assess their contributions to linear growth differences observed between urban poor and non-poor children. METHODS: We combined six rounds of Demographic and Health Survey data spanning 2000-2018 and used official poverty rates to classify the urban population into poor and non-poor households. We identified key stunting determinants using stepwise selection method. Regression-decomposition was used to quantify contributions of these key determinants to poverty-based intra-urban differences in child linear growth status. RESULTS: Key stunting determinants identified in our study predicted 84% of the linear growth difference between urban poor and non-poor children. Childs place of birth (27%), household wealth (22%), maternal education (18%), and maternal body mass index (11%) were the largest contributors to the intra-urban child linear growth gap. Difference in average height-for-age z score between urban poor and non-poor children declined by 0.31 standard deviations between 2000 and 2018. About one quarter of this observed decrease was explained by reduced differentials between urban poor and non-poor in levels of maternal education and maternal underweight status. CONCLUSIONS: Although the intra-urban disparity in child linear growth status declined over the 2000-2018 period, socioeconomic gaps remain significant. Increased nutrition-sensitive programs and investments targeting the urban poor to improve girls education, household food security, and maternal and child health services could aid in further narrowing the remaining linear growth gap.

This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. METHOD Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered on-line to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. RESULTS Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores; anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7-fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. CONCLUSION Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout. It is, therefore, of great importance to implement urgently effective psychosocial and organizational interventions in order to protect the mental health of healthcare workers and to prevent burnout.","output":"Burnout in Healthcare Professionals During the Covid-19 Pandemic in a Tertiary Care University Hospital: Evaluation of the Need for Psychological Support."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) binds progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and androgen receptor (AR) to coregulate their transcriptional activity.

Quantification of in situ FKBP51 mRNA and protein levels inpaired myometrial vs. leiomyoma tissues from proliferative and secretory phases were analyzed by qPCR (n = 14), immunoblotting (n = 20), and immunohistochemistry (n = 12). Control (scramble) vs. FKBP5 siRNA-transfected leiomyoma cell cultures were assessed for proliferation, apoptosis, and mRNA levels of genes involved in cell survival and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Significantly higher FKBP5 mRNA levels were detected in leiomyoma vs. paired myometrium (P < 0.001). Immunoblot (P = 0.001) and immunostaining (P  0.001) confirmed increased FKBP51 levels in leiomyoma vs. paired myometrium. Compared to control siRNA transfection, FKBP5-silenced leiomyoma cell cultures displayed significantly decreased cell survival factors and reduced proliferation (P < 0.05). Moreover, qPCR analysis revealed significantly lower mRNA levels of ECM, TIPM1, and TIPM3 proteins in FKBP5-silenced leiomyoma cell cultures (P < 0.05). Increased FKBP51 expression in leiomyoma likely involves dysregulation of steroid signaling by blocking GR and PR action and promoting proliferation and ECM production. Evaluating the effect of FKBP51 inhibition in preclinical studies will clarify its significance as a potential therapeutic approach against leiomyoma.

Furthermore we demonstrate, that by using the proper strain/sensitization regime, subforms of MS such as for instance neuromyelitis optica can be reproducibly induced.

We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development. METHODS Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1-6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development. RESULTS A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding.

FOCUS4-N was set up to explore the impact of oral maintenance therapy in patients who are responding to first-line therapy. METHODS FOCUS4 was a molecularly stratified trial program that registered patients with newly diagnosed mCRC. The FOCUS4-N trial was offered to patients in whom a targeted subtrial was unavailable or biomarker tests failed. Patients were randomly assigned using a 1:1 ratio between maintenance capecitabine and active monitoring (AM). The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) with secondary outcomes including OS toxicity and tolerability. RESULTS Between March 2014 and March 2020, 254 patients were randomly assigned (127 to capecitabine and 127 to AM) across 88 UK sites. Baseline characteristics were balanced. There was strong evidence of efficacy for PFS (hazard ratio = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.75; P < .0001), but no significant improvement in OS (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.27; P = .66) was observed. Compliance with treatment was good, and toxicity from capecitabine versus AM was as expected with grade  2 fatigue (25% v 12%), diarrhea (23% v 13%), and hand-foot syndrome (26% v 3%). Quality of life showed little difference between the groups. CONCLUSION Despite strong evidence of disease control with maintenance therapy, OS remains unaffected and FOCUS4-N provides additional evidence to support the use of treatment breaks as safe management alternatives for patients who are stable or responding to first-line treatment for mCRC. Capecitabine without bevacizumab may be used to extend PFS in the interval after 16 weeks of first-line therapy.","output":"Capecitabine Versus Active Monitoring in Stable or Responding Metastatic Colorectal Cancer After 16 Weeks of First-Line Therapy: Results of the Randomized FOCUS4-N Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) called SARS-CoV-2 (species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae).

People living with dementia have faced service curtailment, increased risk for COVID-19, as well as potential heightened deterioration. This study reports the experiences of people living with dementia and their family carers during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and the impact on them. METHODS: We recruited and remotely interviewed 30 people living with dementia in their own homes and 31 family carers, via video or telephone call in mid-2020. Data were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: People living with dementia often had a basic understanding of COVID-19 restrictions but could have difficulty translating this into personalised risk-appraisal of their own actions. Managing COVID-19 risks facing people living with dementia at home was largely done by family carers, exemplified by changes to living arrangements, which could strain or sustain caring relationships. Well-established familial caring relationships contributed to the wellbeing of the person living with dementia and their carer, as well as keeping to simple routines that included leaving the home for exercise and stimulation. People living with dementia reported some negative psychological and cognitive effects due to the imposed restrictions, such as increased apathy, irritability, or anxiety, which were fuelled by lack of social engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Structuring routine (remote) social interactions where possible could increase social engagement and improve wellbeing for people living with dementia, especially those with limited familial support in a post-COVID-19 context. As some care relationships had been restructured to manage COVID-19 risks, additional carer strain may emerge as a result of the impact on the independence of the person living with dementia and come to the attention of professionals in health and care services. People living with dementia and their carers highlighted the importance of maintaining or adapting routines which may be useful learning for professionals, although additional support may be necessary for those who are impacted by more severe or worsening symptoms of dementia.

However, insufficient data exist on the wider context of infectious diseases in people with NCDs. We aimed to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection before the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Dec 31, 2019). METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank observational cohort study to explore factors associated with infection death. We excluded participants if data were missing for comorbidities, body-mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, and if they were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. Deaths were censored up to Dec 31, 2019. We used Poisson regression models including NCDs present at recruitment to the UK Biobank (obesity [defined by use of body-mass index] and self-reported hypertension, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease), age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic deprivation. Separate models were constructed with individual NCDs replaced by the total number of prevalent NCDs to define associations with multimorbidity. All analyses were repeated with non-infection-related death as an alternate outcome measure to establish differential associations of infection death and non-infection death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) accompanied by 95% CIs. FINDINGS: After exclusion of 9210 (18%) of the 502 505 participants in the UK Biobank cohort, our study sample comprised 493 295 individuals. During 5 273 731 person-years of follow-up (median 109 years [IQR 101C116] per participant), 27 729 deaths occurred, of which 1385 (5%) were related to infection. Advancing age, male sex, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and all studied NCDs were independently associated with the rate of both infection death and non-infection death. Compared with White ethnicity, a pooled Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity group was associated with a reduced risk of infection death (IRR 064, 95% CI 046C087) and non-infection death (080, 075C086). Stronger associations with infection death than with non-infection death were observed for advancing age (age 65 years vs 45 years: 759, 95% CI 592C973, for infection death vs 521, 497C548, for non-infection death), current smoking (vs never smoking: 369, 319C426, vs 252, 244C261), socioeconomic deprivation (most vs least deprived quintile: 213, 178C256, vs 138, 133C143), class 3 obesity (vs non-obese: 221, 174C282, vs 155, 144C166), hypertension (136, 122C153, vs 115, 112C118), respiratory disease (221, 196C250, vs 128, 124C132), chronic kidney disease (504, 428C731, vs 250, 220C284), psychiatric disease (156, 130C186, vs 123, 118C129), and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease (245, 199C302, vs 141, 132C151). Accrual of multimorbidity was also more strongly associated with risk of infection death (five or more comorbidities vs none: 953, 697C1303) than of non-infection death (526, 484C572). INTERPRETATION: Several NCDs are associated with an increased risk of infection death, suggesting that some of the reported associations with COVID-19 mortality might be non-specific. Only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, advancing age, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation, were associated with a greater IRR for infection death than for other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are more strongly associated with infection death, so that more effective preventive strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups.

OBJECTIVE: To determine T-cell reactivity to the Omicron variant in individuals with established (natural and/or vaccine-induced) immunity to SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a cohort study conducted between December 20 and 21, 2021, at the Santa Lucia Foundation Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Rome, Italy, among health care worker and scientist volunteers. Lymphocytes from freshly drawn blood samples were isolated and immediately tested for reactivity to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were the measurement of T-cell reactivity to the mutated regions of the spike protein of the Omicron BA.1 SARS-CoV-2 variant and the assessment of remaining T-cell immunity to the spike protein by stimulation with peptide libraries. RESULTS: A total of 61 volunteers (mean (range) age, 41.62 (21-62) years; 38 women [62%]) with different vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection backgrounds were enrolled. The median (range) frequency of CD4(+) T cells reactive to peptides covering the mutated regions in the Omicron variant was 0.039% (0%-2.356%), a decrease of 64% compared with the frequency of CD4(+) cells specific for the same regions of the ancestral strain (0.109% [0%-2.376%]). Within CD8(+) T cells, a median (range) of 0.02% (0%-0.689%) of cells recognized the mutated spike regions, while 0.039% (0%-3.57%) of cells were reactive to the equivalent unmutated regions, a reduction of 49%. However, overall reactivity to the peptide library of the full-length protein was largely maintained (estimated 87%). No significant differences in loss of immune recognition were identified between groups of participants with different vaccination or infection histories. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of immunized adults in Italy found that despite the mutations in the spike protein, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was recognized by the cellular component of the immune system. It is reasonable to assume that protection from hospitalization and severe disease will be maintained.","output":"Assessment of T-cell Reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant by Immunized Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Bronchoscopic sampling of bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL) should be safe and effective. Current sampling practice risks loss of sample to the attached negative flow, aerosolisation, or spillage, due to repeated circuit breaks, when replacing sample containers. Such concerns were highlighted during the recent coronavirus pandemic. OBJECTIVES Evaluation of an alternative integrated sampling solution, with the Ambu Bronchosampler with aScope 4, by an experienced bronchoscopist in ICU. METHODS An observational study of 20 sequential bronchoscopic diagnostic sampling procedures was performed on mechanically ventilated patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Mixed methods assessment was done. The predefined outcome measures were (1) ease of set up, (2) ease of specimen collection, (3) ease of protecting specimen from loss or spillage, and (4) overall workflow. The duration of the procedure and the % volume of sample retrieved were recorded. RESULTS The mean (standard deviation [SD]) time for collecting 1 sample was 2.5  0.8 min. The mean (SD) specimen yield for instilled miniBAL was 54.2  17.9%. Compared with standard sampling, the set-up was much easier in 18 (90%), or easier in 2 (10%) of procedures, reducing the connection steps. It was much more intuitive to use in 14 (70%), more intuitive in 4 (20%), and no more intuitive to use in 2 (10%). The overall set-up and workflow was much easier in 69% of the 13 intraprocedural connections and easier or as easy in the remaining 31% procedures. All procedures where pre connection was established were much easier (7, 100%). The Ambu Bronchosampler remained upright in all procedures with no loss or spillage of sample. Obtaining a sample was much easier in 60%, easier in 10%, no different in 20%, and worse in 10%. The ability to protect a sample from start to finish compared to standard procedures was much easier in 80%, easier in 15%, and no different in 5% of procedures. Overall workflow was much easier in 14 (70%), easier in 4 (20%), and no different in 2 (10%) of procedures. CONCLUSIONS The Ambu Bronchosampler unit was a reliable, effective, and possibly safer technique for diagnostic sampling in ICU. It may improve safety standards during the coronavirus pandemic.

Cancer cells are known to induce increased CD47 expression. Similar to cancer cells, all immune cells can upregulate their CD47 surface expression during infection. The CD47-SIRPa interaction induces an inhibitory effect on macrophages and dendritic cells (dendritic cells) while CD47-thrombospondin-signaling inhibits T cells. Therefore, the disruption of the CD47 interaction can mediate several biologic functions. Upon the blockade and knockout of CD47 reveals an immunosuppressive effect of CD47 during LCMV, influenza virus, HIV-1, mycobacterium tuberculosis, plasmodium and other bacterial pneumonia infections. In our recent study we shows that the blockade of CD47 using the anti-CD47 antibody increases the activation and effector function of macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells during viral infection. By enhancing both innate and adaptive immunity, CD47 blocking antibody promotes antiviral effect. Due to its broad mode of action, the immune-stimulatory effect derived from this antibody could be applicable in nonresolving and (re)emerging infections.

These individuals represent the majority of patients affected by the disease and are routinely treated at home, facing periods of quarantine. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. All people who tested positive for COVID-19 and classified as mild cases (i.e., no alarm sign/symptom, no need for in-person consultation) during the treatment in the public health system of a Brazilian city with around 160,000 inhabitants were monitored by phone for all the COVID-19 symptoms listed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the active phase of the disease (i.e., no longer experiencing symptoms, up to 14 days in mild cases). After this phase (median = 108 days after intake, IQR = 76-137), we asked these patients who were classified as experiencing mild COVID-19 (n = 993) about last-month substance use in three time-points: pre-COVID, just after COVID-19 acute phase (post-COVID acute phase) and in the period before survey (post-COVID follow-up phase). Results: The number of COVID-19 symptoms was not associated with pre- or post-infection substance use. Pre-COVID alcohol and non-medical benzodiazepine use were associated with specific COVID-19 symptoms. However, sensitivity analyses showed that such associations could be explained by previous psychiatric and medical profiles. Alcohol and tobacco use decreased and non-medical analgesics increased in the post-COVID acute phase. However, just alcohol use remained lower in the post-COVID follow-up period. Higher pre-COVID levels of tobacco and alcohol were associated with post-COVID follow-up cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Non-medical benzodiazepine use had positive and negative bi-directional associations with cannabis and non-medical analgesic use, respectively. Conclusion: We were not able to find specific associations between substance use and COVID-19 symptomatology in the present study. Patients with mild COVID-19 should be monitored for substance use in the post-COVID-19 period, and preventive interventions for non-medical analgesic use should be implemented. Focused preventive interventions increasing the perceived risks of cannabis and non-medical benzodiazepine and analgesic use among people experiencing mild COVID-19 that reported previous substance use could be useful.","output":"Substance Use in Mild-COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Peanuts are Leguminosae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, and peanut allergy is among the most common food allergies and the most common cause of fatal food reactions and anaphylaxis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of the ABO blood group and genetic variations of the ABO gene with COVID-19 severity in a heterogeneous hospital population sample from the United Arab Emirates, with the use of an epidemiological and candidate gene approach from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a total of 646 participants who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited from multiple hospitals and population-based (quarantine camps) recruitment sites from March 2020 to February 2021. The participants were divided into two groups based on the severity of COVID-19: noncritical (n = 453) and critical [intensive care unit (ICU) patients] (n = 193), as per the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) classification. The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the association of ABO blood type as well as circulating anti-A antibodies and anti-B antibodies as well as A and B antigens, in association with critical COVID-19 hospital presentation. A candidate gene analysis approach was conducted from a GWAS where we examined 240 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (position in chr9: 136125788-136150617) in the ABO gene, in association with critical COVID-19 hospital presentation. Results: Patients with blood group O [odds ratio (OR): 0.51 (0.33, 0.79); p = 0.003] were less likely to develop critical COVID-19 symptoms. Eight alleles have been identified to be associated with a protective effect of blood group O in ABO 3'untranslated region (UTR): rs199969472 (p = 0.0052), rs34266669 (p = 0.0052), rs76700116 (p = 0.0052), rs7849280 (p = 0.0052), rs34039247 (p = 0.0104), rs10901251 (p = 0.0165), rs9411475 (p = 0.0377), and rs13291798 (p = 0.0377). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there are novel allelic variants that link genetic variants of the ABO gene and ABO blood groups contributing to the reduced risk of critical COVID-19 disease.

Immunisation experiments in mice demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) coupled to Dps (RBD-S-Dps) shows particular promise as it elicited a higher antibody titre and an enhanced neutralising antibody response compared to the monomeric RBD. Furthermore, we showed that a single immunisation with the multivalent RBD-S-Dps completely protected hACE2-expressing mice from serious illness and led to efficient viral clearance from the lungs upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is evidence suggesting that hematological patients are particularly vulnerable and have a higher risk of developing severe events, with higher mortality rate than general population. However, the available data are limited, and prognostic factors at admission still remain unclear. With this background, our aims were to analyze the impact of hematological diseases and their therapy on the COVID-19 severity and to identify clinical and biological risk factors to predict the outcome in these patients. METHODS We carried out a multicenter retrospective observational study with data collection from 19 Spanish centers. A total of 491 patients with hematological diseases who developed COVID-19 (HEMATOCOVID patients) from March 8th to June 9th were included in the study. Clinical and biological data were collected at the time of emergency room assistance or hospital admission. For statistical analysis, chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to identify differences between groups. The effects of multiple predictor variables on COVID-19 outcomes were assessed by logistic binary regression. RESULTS The geographic distribution of the studied HEMATOCOVID patients was similar to the national geographic spread of the COVID-19 (Figure 1). Most patients (94,3%) were confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a positive result on SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab or serologic testing, and 15% were nosocomial infections. The mean age was 71 years with 57% males, and 70% had at least one associated comorbidity. The most frequent hematological diseases among COVID-19 patients were Lymphoid Malignancies (53,8%), and 51,7% of patients were on active treatment. Most common symptoms were fever (59%), cough (54%) and dyspnea (46%), with associated pneumonia in 70% of cases. Hospital admission was required in 89% of patients and 6,3% were admitted to intensive care units. Mortality rate was about 36%. Non-survival patients were older and had a higher Charlson comorbidity index and ECOG performance status. Furthermore, patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and those with an active or progressive hematological disease at the diagnosis of COVID-19 had higher mortality. Patients who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autologous, allogeneic, and both) had better outcomes. Other factors such as low lymphocyte and platelets counts, or high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin values were also associated with poorer outcomes (Table 1). In addition, COVID-19 therapy had no impact on survival, except for corticosteroids, that correlated with a negative impact (p < 0,001) probably because they were not administrated to patients with less severe COVID-19. Multivariate regression analysis showed the following risk factors for death: age >70 years, ECOG 2, absolute lymphocyte count 0.6109/L, platelet count 40109/L, high LDH (higher than upper normal limit) and CRP >11 mg/dL (Table 2). CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV2 infection causes more severe disease and higher mortality rates in hematological patients, especially those with AML/MDS or active/progression status disease. In addition, advanced age, co-morbidities, poor performance status, low lymphocyte and platelet counts and high LDH and CRP at admission are associated with poorer survival. This worse disease evolution could be explained by the immunosuppression state induced by underlying disease and treatments received. These particular features should be taken into account for a population that is highly exposed to SARS-CoV2 contagion due to high number of hospital visits for treatment.

The accuracy of LFIA largely depends on the quality of the immunoreagents used. Typical LFIAs to reveal the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) employ anti-human immunoglobulin (hIG) antibodies and recombinant viral antigens, which usually are unstable and poorly soluble. Broad selective bacterial proteins, such as Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) and Streptococcal protein G (SpG) can be considered alternatives to anti-hIG to increase versatility and sensitivity of serological LFIAs because of their high binding capacity, interspecies reactivity, and robustness. We developed two colorimetric LFA devices including SpA and SpG linked to gold nanoparticles (GNP) as detectors and explored the use of a specific, stable, and soluble immunodominant fraction of the nucleocapsid protein from SARS-CoV-2 as the capturing agent. The optimal amount of SpA-GNP and SpG-GNP conjugates and the protein-to-GNP ratios were defined through a full factorial experimental design to maximize the diagnostic sensitivity of the LFIAs. The new LFA devices were applied to analyze 105 human serum samples (69 positive and 36 negatives according to reference molecular diagnostic methods). The results showed higher sensitivity (89.9%, 95% CI 82.7C97.0) and selectivity (91.7%, 82.6C100) for the SpA-based compared to the SpG-based LFA. In addition, 18 serum samples from cats and dogs living with COVID-19 patients were analyzed and 14 showed detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, thus illustrating the flexibility of the SpA- and SpG-based LFAs.

In this paper, the clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging examinations and treatment of the first Omicron-infected patient in China were analyzed. This report might provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with Omicron strain across the world. The novel Coronavirus antibody tests were performed on the day of admission: IgM level was normal, novel Coronavirus antibody IgG was 132.666s /CO and IgG was 148.47s /CO on the 7th day of admission. IgG showed an increasing trend, which is consistent with the results of multiple novel Coronavirus non-Omicron strain infections.","output":"Case Report of China/Tianjin's First Novel Coronavirus Variant Omicron"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis for both food safety and especially the economic sustainability of food production in Canada and around the globe are explored.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-C-reactive protein ratio (LCR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) are established inflammation markers reflecting the systemic inflammatory response. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and bacterial co-infections, as well as the correlation with NLR and MPV. Methods: We assessed the role of the NLR and MPV in diagnosing bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the mean NLR and MPV between the diagnostic evaluation moments, while the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare NLR and MPV by sex and age. Results: The NLR was compared three days before the culture and the day of taking the culture, observing significant differences (p=0.020). MPV three days before the culture and the day of the culture were compared, also observing significant differences (p=0.031). NLR and MPV were compared at the different evaluation times according to sex and age group, observing for the age group significant differences for the NLR three days before the culture (p=0.004). Conclusion: In our study, there were significant differences in NLR and MPV between the three days before culture and the day of culture.

Here we investigate sex-based differences in the molecular mechanisms of anticancer immune-response and immune evasion in patients with NSCLC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We analyzed a) transcriptome-data of 2575 early-stage NSCLCs from 7 different datasets; b) 327 tumor-samples extensively characterized at the molecular level from the TRACERx lung study; c) two independent cohorts of respectively 329 and 391 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 drugs. RESULTS As compared with men, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of women was significantly enriched for a number of innate and adaptive immune cell-types, including specific T-cell subpopulations. NSCLCs of men and women exploited different mechanisms of immune evasion. The TME of females was characterized by significantly greater T-cell dysfunction status, higher expression of inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecules and higher abundance of immune-suppressive cells, including Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, MDSCs and Regulatory T-cells. By contrast, the TME of males was significantly enriched for a T-cells excluded phenotype. We reported data supporting impaired neoantigens presentation to immune system in tumors of men, as molecular mechanism explaining the findings observed. Finally, in line with our results, we showed significant sex-based differences in the association between TMB and outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 drugs.

We therefore sought to determine the impact of this on the surgical experience of vascular trainees. METHODS: Surgical case volume, breadth, and the participating trainee post-graduate level from 3 large New York City Hospitals with integrated residency and fellowship programs (Mount Sinai, Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and New York University) were reviewed. Procedures performed between February 26 to March 25, 2020 (pre-pandemic month) and March 26 to April 25, 2020 (peak pandemic period) were compared to those performed during the same time period in 2019. The trainees from these programs were also sent surveys to evaluate their subjective experience during this time. RESULTS: The total number of cases during the month leading into the peak pandemic period was 635 cases in 2019 and 560 cases in 2020 (12% decrease). During the peak pandemic period, case volume decreased from 445 in 2019 to 114 in 2020 (74% reduction). The highest volume procedures during the peak pandemic month in 2020 were amputations and peripheral cases for acute limb ischemia; during the 2019 period, the most common cases were therapeutic endovascular procedures. There was a decrease in case volume for vascular senior residents of 77% and vascular junior and midlevel residents of 75%. There was a 77% survey response rate with 50% of respondents in the senior years of training. Overall, 20% of respondents expressed concern about completing ACGME requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among its potential complications, VA-ECMO may adversely affect lung function through various pathophysiological mechanisms. The interaction of blood components with the biomaterials of the extracorporeal membrane elicits a systemic inflammatory response which may increase pulmonary vascular permeability and promote the sequestration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within the lung parenchyma. Also, VA-ECMO increases the afterload of the left ventricle (LV) through reverse flow within the thoracic aorta, resulting in increased LV filling pressure and pulmonary congestion. Furthermore, VA-ECMO may result in long-standing pulmonary hypoxia, due to partial shunting of the pulmonary circulation and to reduced pulsatile blood flow within the bronchial circulation. Ultimately, these different abnormalities may result in a state of persisting lung inflammation and fibrotic changes with concomitant functional impairment, which may compromise weaning from VA-ECMO and could possibly result in long-term lung dysfunction.

The slot allocation process at these super-congested airports has reached a state of gridlock in which slot mobility is limited and a large block of the available slots is allocated to a small number of airlines. The lack of available capacity has halted the growth of certain airport and/or governmental objectives, such as improving connectivity or minimizing the environmental footprint. As a response to this congestion problem, A.R. Odoni has proposed the implementation of an additional level to the slot allocation process, which would be designed specifically for the saturated airports. This 'Level 4' slot category focuses on introducing a set of measures that stimulate the mobility of the slot allocation process whilst simultaneously improve the role of the airport within the local, national and European community. To highlight the importance of this new concept, this research will propose a scoring methodology that will be able to quantify the effectiveness of 'Level 4' slot allocation. The methodology will focus on scoring a slot on five different parameters which will allow for a better understanding of the added value of that slot. These parameters are based on the objectives an airport and/or its related government might have. The methodology focusses on the generated connectivity of a slot, the slot's impact on the competition levels, the welfare contribution of the slot, the slot's environmental footprint and the capacity offered by the slot. By using the min-max normalization technique, a number of scales are developed that allow for a homogenous scoring method. By using this methodology, the slot allocation process at 'Level 4' airports can be based on the added value of a slot, rather than focusing on uncontrolled growth. This will become even more important in a post-pandemic industry where the super-congested airports will likely be the first to recover and slots will need to be re-allocated. ? 2021 The Authors.

As OHCA outcomes are markedly improved when BLS maneuvers are swiftly applied, a first-responder system was introduced in 2019. When emergency dispatchers identify a possible OHCA, first responders receive an alert message on a specific app (Save-a-Life) installed on their smartphones. Those nearest to the victim and immediately available are sent the exact location of the intervention. First-year medical students only have limited knowledge regarding BLS procedures but might nevertheless need to take care of OHCA victims. Medical students responding to out-of-hospital emergencies are off-duty in half of these situations, and offering junior medical students the opportunity to enlist as first responders might therefore not only improve OHCA outcomes but also foster a greater recognition of the role medical students can hold in our society. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to determine whether providing first-year medical students with a short intervention followed by an interactive e-learning module can motivate them to enlist as first responders. METHODS: After obtaining the approval of the regional ethics committee and of the vice-dean for undergraduate education of the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine (UGFM), 2 senior medical students will present the project to their first-year colleagues at the beginning of a lecture. First-year students will then be provided with a link to an interactive e-learning module which has been designed according to the Swiss Resuscitation Councils first aid guidelines. After answering a first questionnaire and completing the module, students will be able to register for practice sessions. Those attending and successfully completing these sessions will receive a training certificate which will enable them to enlist as first responders. The primary outcome will be the proportion of first-year medical students enlisting as first responders at the end of the study period. Secondary outcomes will be the proportion of first-year medical students electing to register on the platform, to begin the e-learning module, to complete the e-learning module, to register for practice sessions, to attend the practice sessions, and to obtain a certificate. The reasons given by medical students for refusing to participate will be analyzed. We will also assess how comfortable junior medical students would feel to be integrated into the first responders system at the end of the training program and whether it affects the registration rate.

The goals of this study were to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict blueprints for designing universal vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, that contain a sufficiently broad repertoire of T-cell epitopes capable of providing coverage and protection across the global population. To help achieve these aims, we profiled the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome across the most frequent 100 HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR alleles in the human population, using host-infected cell surface antigen presentation and immunogenicity predictors from the NEC Immune Profiler suite of tools, and generated comprehensive epitope maps. We then used these epitope maps as input for a Monte Carlo simulation designed to identify statistically significant epitope hotspot regions in the virus that are most likely to be immunogenic across a broad spectrum of HLA types. We then removed epitope hotspots that shared significant homology with proteins in the human proteome to reduce the chance of inducing off-target autoimmune responses. We also analyzed the antigen presentation and immunogenic landscape of all the nonsynonymous mutations across 3400 different sequences of the virus, to identify a trend whereby SARS-COV-2 mutations are predicted to have reduced potential to be presented by host-infected cells, and consequently detected by the host immune system. A sequence conservation analysis then removed epitope hotspots that occurred in less-conserved regions of the viral proteome. Finally, we used a database of the HLA genotypes of approximately 22 000 individuals to develop a digital twin type simulation to model how effective different combinations of hotspots would work in a diverse human population, and used the approach to identify an optimal constellation of epitopes hotspots that could provide maximum coverage in the global population. By combining the antigen presentation to the infected-host cell surface and immunogenicity predictions of the NEC Immune Profiler with a robust Monte Carlo and digital twin simulation, we have managed to profile the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome and identify a subset of epitope hotspots that could be harnessed in a vaccine formulation to provide a broad coverage across the global population.","output":"Artificial intelligence predicts the immunogenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2: toward universal blueprints for vaccine designs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is the resistance mechanism pattern in bacteria that evolves over some time, thus protecting the bacteria against antibiotics.

To combat AR, vaccination is an effective method, used either therapeutically or prophylactically. In the current study, an in silico approach was applied for the design of multi-epitope-based vaccines against Providencia rettgeri, a major cause of travelers diarrhea. A total of six proteins: fimbrial protein, flagellar hook protein (FlgE), flagellar basal body L-ring protein (FlgH), flagellar hook-basal body complex protein (FliE), flagellar basal body P-ring formation protein (FlgA), and Gram-negative pili assembly chaperone domain proteins, were considered as vaccine targets and were utilized for B- and T-cell epitope prediction. The predicted epitopes were assessed for allergenicity, antigenicity, virulence, toxicity, and solubility. Moreover, filtered epitopes were utilized in multi-epitope vaccine construction. The predicted epitopes were joined with each other through specific GPGPG linkers and were joined with cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant via another EAAAK linker in order to enhance the efficacy of the designed vaccine. Docking studies of the designed vaccine construct were performed with MHC-I (PDB ID: 1I1Y), MHC-II (1KG0), and TLR-4 (4G8A). Findings of the docking study were validated through molecular dynamic simulations, which confirmed that the designed vaccine showed strong interactions with the immune receptors, and that the epitopes were exposed to the host immune system for proper recognition and processing.

Clinical reports from patients suffering from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) reflect a high prevalence of sensory deprivation or loss pertaining to smell (dysosmia/anosmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia/ageusia). Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. Methods. A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. Results. Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. Limitations.

METHODS Qualitative study grounded in Alfred Schtz's social phenomenology in which 20 nurses who work in intensive care units at public and private hospitals were interviewed between July and September 2020. Data were analyzed according to the adopted theoretical-methodological framework and the literature related to the subject. RESULTS The interviewed nurses mentioned demands about working conditions, professional recognition and training, and support to physical and mental health, which proved necessary considering the care intensity experienced by these professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Learning the nurses' experiences evidenced the need to adjust to a new way of providing care that included the physical space, new institutional protocols, continuous use of protective equipment, and patients' demand for special care. This originated the necessity to be around situations that interfered with their health and motivated them to carry out professional projects after the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Experiences of intensive care unit nurses with COVID-19 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Intestinal mucosal barrier injury is one of the important manifestations of sepsis. Interleukin-9 (IL-9) and IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cells were emerging pro-inflammatory mediators with development of intestinal injury. However, it is unclear whether IL-9 is related to the intestinal barrier injury of sepsis. METHODS: To investigate the roles of IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cells and IL-9 in the process of barrier injury in sepsis, serum IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cell percentages, IL-9, and D-lactate levels were measured in septic patients and controls. The markers of barrier function in serum and intestinal tissue were also collected in septic rats. Moreover, the barrier injury degree and survival rate of septic rats were also investigated after increasing or interfering with IL-9 expression. RESULTS: The serum IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cell percentages, IL-9, and D-lactate levels were significantly higher in septic patients or rats than those in controls. IL-9-producing CD4(+) T cells and IL-9 levels were positively correlated with D-lactate levels and had a high predictive value of 28-day mortality in septic patients. The non-survivors had significantly higher serum T cell percentages, IL-9, and D-lactate levels compared with survivors. In septic rats, IL-9 increased the expression levels of D-lactate, whereas that decreased the expression levels of zonula occludens 1. Moreover, the barrier injury was aggravated or alleviated by increasing or interfering with IL-9 expression, respectively. Survival rate analysis also showed that IL-9 decreased the 14-day survival rate of septic rats. CONCLUSION: IL-9 is closely related to intestinal mucosal barrier injury and mortality in sepsis. IL-9 blockade has the potential to improve the barrier injury in sepsis.

There are few preclinical animal models to evaluate these strategies. Here we report on a model to simultaneously evaluate both of these treatment approaches. METHODS Allogeneic clot was injected through the 6 F guide catheter after creating >50% luminal stenosis of the common carotid arteries of New Zealand White rabbits. The stenosis was released after 1 h, allowing sufficient time for clot-vessel wall interaction. Occlusion was confirmed and each vessel was assigned to receive either balloon angioplasty alone, intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, Alteplase, Genentech, San Francisco, California, USA), tPA delivery through prototype balloon infusion wire (NIT Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA), partial stent deployment or partial stent deployment with locally delivered tPA. The negative control received no treatment. RESULTS In vivo revascularization Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score revealed that the balloon infusion wire achieved a stable and higher revascularization score of TICI 2B, with a lower dose of tPA in comparison with other treatment strategies. All treatment strategies resulted in endothelial denudation and exposure of the internal elastic lamina.

A sometimes fatal, often debilitating disease, MS features autoimmune inflammatory attack against the myelin insulation of neurons. Thymus derived (T) cells sensitized against myelin self-antigens secrete tumor necrosis factor, cytokines, prostaglandins, and other inflammatory mediators that strip away the myelin and sometimes destroy the axons. Familial and twin inheritance studies indicate MS is mildly heritable. No single MS locus has been identified, but an HLA haplotype has been implicated. Unique geographic distribution of the disease is best attributed to some combination of vitamin D abnormality and dietary patterns. No pharmaceutical or other therapies exist that confer prolonged remission on MS, and obvious interrelationships between toxic, infectious, and dietary factors make a persuasive case for integrative management. The time-proven MS diet meticulously keeps saturated fats low, includes three fish meals per week, and eliminates allergenic foods. Dietary supplementation for MS minimally requires potent vitamin supplementation, along with the thiol antioxidants, the anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, and adaptogenic phytonutrients. Gut malabsorption and dysbiosis can be corrected using digestive enzymes and probiotics. Long-term hyperbaric oxygen therapy can slow or remit the disease. Transdermal histamine offers promise, and adenosine monophosphate may sometimes benefit.

Individual vaccines are assumed to have no other effect than protection against the targeted pathogen, but vaccines also have nonspecific and interactive effects, the outcomes of which can be beneficial or harmful. To date, no controlled trials and very few observational studies have determined the impact of vaccination schedules on overall health. The balance of the risks and benefits from mass vaccination therefore remains uncertain. Recent studies worryingly suggest links between multiple vaccinations and increased risks of diverse multisystem health problems, including allergies, infections, and neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we propose that, in susceptible persons, multiple vaccinations activate the retinoid cascade and trigger apoptotic hepatitis, leading to cholestatic liver dysfunction, in which stored vitamin A compounds (retinyl esters and retinoic acid) enter the circulation in toxic concentrations; this induces endogenous forms of hypervitaminosis A, with the severity of adverse outcomes being directly proportional to the concentration of circulating retinoids. In very low concentrations, vitamin A and its major metabolite retinoic acid contribute to immune function and to the process of immunization, whereas excess vitamin A increases the risk of adverse events, including common \\"side-effects\\" as well as chronic adverse outcomes. The increasing rates of allergy, ear infections, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in countries with high rates of vaccination could be related to mass vaccination and to its impact on liver function and vitamin A metabolism, collectively representing endogenous manifestations of hypervitaminosis A. Further studies of health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are urgently needed, to increase understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of vaccine injury, to identify the risk factors and screen for vaccine injury, to inform public health policy on potential hazards related to vaccination schedules, and to optimize the safety and benefits of vaccines.","output":"Multiple Vaccinations and the Enigma of Vaccine Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meta-Generalized Gradient Approximations (meta-GGAs) can, in principle, include spatial and temporal nonlocality in time-dependent density functional theory at a much lower computational cost than functionals that use exact exchange.

RESULTS A total of 1,198,421 patients were admitted to a hospital with a diagnosis of CRC and captured by the NIS database. Although the number of hospitalized CRC patients decreased from 2002 to 2012, the observed decrease was predominant in patients older than 65 years (P < 0.01) and in colon cancer compared to rectal cancer patients (P < 0.01). The proportion of patients younger than 65 years increased from 32.8 % in 2002 to 41.1 % in 2012, and the proportion of patients under age 50 increased from 9 to 12 %. In the NSQIP database, the age <50 group also had a significantly higher proportion of advanced disease (stage III/IV) compared to patients age 50 and older (62.3 vs. 47.5 %, P < 0.01). In 2012, it was observed that most patients with rectal cancer were younger than 65 years (55.8 %).

Pakistan ranks fifth among the countries, which are facing, a significantly great number of mortalities and morbidities due to TB. Unfortunately, all previously reported treatments are not successful for the eradication of TB. Here in this study, we report an emerging treatment option for this disease. We have applied immunoinformatics to predict highly conserved B and T-cell epitopes from Mtb, showing significant binding affinities to the frequent HLA alleles in the Pakistani population. A total of ten highly referenced and experimentally validated epitopes were selected from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), followed by their conservancy analysis using weblogos. The consensus sequences and variants derived from these sequences were examined, for their binding affinities, with prevalent HLA alleles of Pakistan. Moreover, the antigenic and allergenic natures of these peptides were also evaluated via Vaxijen and AllerTOP, respectively. Consequently, all potentially allergenic and non-antigenic, peptide fragments, were excluded from the analysis. Among all putative epitopes, three CD8 + T-cell epitopes were selected, as ideal vaccine candidates and, population coverage analysis revealed that the combination of these three peptides was covering, 67.28% Pakistani Asian and 57.15% mixed Pakistani populations. Likewise, eleven linear and six conformational or discontinuous B-cell epitopes were also marked as potential vaccine candidates based on their prediction score, non-allergenic nature, and antigenic properties. These epitopes, however, need the final validation via wet-lab studies. After their approval, these epitopes would be effective candidates for the future designing of epitope-based vaccines against Mtb infections in Pakistan.

The use of innovative or repurposed therapies to treat COVID\\\\19 patients is widespread; however, there are very limited data regarding the patterns of use and safety profile of most of these therapeutics in pregnant women. We assessed the patterns of use of COVID\\\\19 therapeutics during pregnancy using data from the International Registry of Coronavirus in Pregnancy (IRCEP). METHODS: The IRCEP is an international observational cohort study intended to assess the risk of major obstetric and neonatal outcomes among pregnant women with COVID\\\\19. Women enrolled while pregnant or within 6 months after end of pregnancy. Follow\\\\up for women enrolled while pregnant includes monthly online questionnaires throughout the pregnancy and, for live births, through the infant's first 90 days of life. Participants provide information on demographic characteristics, health history, COVID\\\\19 tests and symptoms, medications, and obstetric and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 5780 women with COVID\\\\19 during pregnancy were identified from the IRCEP. Severity of COVID\\\\19 was classified in 372 of them as severe, 3053 moderate, and 2355 mild.

Until recently, testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus focused mainly on healthcare and care home settings. As such, there is far less understanding of community transmission. Protocol: The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) programme is a major programme of home testing for COVID-19 to track progress of the infection in the community. REACT-1 involves cross-sectional surveys of viral detection (virological swab for RT-PCR) tests in repeated samples of 100,000 to 150,000 randomly selected individuals across England. This examines how widely the virus has spread and how many people are currently infected. The age range is 5 years and above. Individuals are sampled from the England NHS patient list. REACT-2 is a series of five sub-studies towards establishing the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in England as an indicator of historical infection. The main study (study 5) uses the same design and sampling approach as REACT-1 using a self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG antibodies in repeated samples of 100,000 to 200,000 adults aged 18 years and above. To inform study 5, studies 1-4 evaluate performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 LFIAs (study 1) and different aspects of feasibility, usability and application of LFIAs for home-based testing in different populations (studies 2-4). Ethics and dissemination: The study has ethical approval. Results are reported using STROBE guidelines and disseminated through reports to public health bodies, presentations at scientific meetings and open access publications. Conclusions: This study provides robust estimates of the prevalence of both virus (RT-PCR, REACT-1) and seroprevalence (antibody, REACT-2) in the general population in England. We also explore acceptability and usability of LFIAs for self-administered testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a home-based setting, not done before at such scale in the general population. ? 2021 Riley S et al.","output":"REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) of SARS-CoV-2 virus: Study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Multimorbidity presents an enormous problem to societal and healthcare utilization under the context of aging population in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Currently, systematic studies on the profile of multimorbidity and its characteristics among Chinese elderly are lacking. We described the temporal and spatial trends in the prevalence of multimorbidity and explored chronological changes of comorbidity patterns in a large elderly population survey. Methods: Data were extracted from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study (CLHLS) conducted between 1998 and 2018 in a random selection of half of the counties and city districts. All the elderly aged 65 and older were included in the survey of eight waves. We used 13 investigated chronic diseases to measure the prevalence of multimorbidity by means of geography, subpopulation, and chronological changes. The patterns of multimorbidity were assessed by computing the value of relative risk (RR indicates the likelihood of certain diseases to be associated with multimorbidity) and the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E indicates the likelihood of the coexistence of a multimorbidity combination). Results: From 1998 to 2018, the prevalence of multimorbidity went from 15.60 to 30.76%, increasing in the fluctuation across the survey of eight waves (p for trend = 0.020). Increasing trends were observed similarly in a different gender group (p male = 0.009; p female = 0.004) and age groups among female participants (p ~80 = 0.009; p 81-90 = 0.004; p 91-100 = 0.035; p 101~ = 0.018). The gap in the prevalence of multimorbidity between the north and the south was getting narrow across the survey of eight waves. Hypertension was the highest prevalent chronic condition while diabetes was most likely to coexist with other chronic conditions in the CLHLS survey. The most frequently occurring clusters were hypertension and heart disease, hypertension and cataract, and hypertension and chronic lung disease. And, the cancer, TB, and Parkinson's disease cluster took the domination of O/E rankings over time, which had a higher probability of coexistence in all the multimorbidity combinations. Conclusions: The prevalence of multimorbidity has been increasing nationwide, and more attention should be paid to a rapid growth in the southern part of China.

Whether therapeutic anticoagulation improves outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation in this population. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label (with blinded adjudication), multicentre, randomised, controlled trial, at 31 sites in Brazil. Patients (aged &#8805;18 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, and who had COVID-19 symptoms for up to 14 days before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation was in-hospital oral rivaroxaban (20 mg or 15 mg daily) for stable patients, or initial subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice per day) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (to achieve a 03-07 IU/mL anti-Xa concentration) for clinically unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban to day 30. Prophylactic anticoagulation was standard in-hospital enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin. The primary efficacy outcome was a hierarchical analysis of time to death, duration of hospitalisation, or duration of supplemental oxygen to day 30, analysed with the win ratio method (a ratio >1 reflects a better outcome in the therapeutic anticoagulation group) in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding through 30 days. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04394377) and is completed. FINDINGS: From June 24, 2020, to Feb 26, 2021, 3331 patients were screened and 615 were randomly allocated (311 [50%] to the therapeutic anticoagulation group and 304 [50%] to the prophylactic anticoagulation group). 576 (94%) were clinically stable and 39 (6%) clinically unstable. One patient, in the therapeutic group, was lost to follow-up because of withdrawal of consent and was not included in the primary analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was not different between patients assigned therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation, with 28a??899 (348%) wins in the therapeutic group and 34a??288 (413%) in the prophylactic group (win ratio 086 [95% CI 059-122], p=040). Consistent results were seen in clinically stable and clinically unstable patients. The primary safety outcome of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 26 (8%) patients assigned therapeutic anticoagulation and seven (2%) assigned prophylactic anticoagulation (relative risk 364 [95% CI 161-827], p=00010). Allergic reaction to the study medication occurred in two (1%) patients in the therapeutic anticoagulation group and three (1%) in the prophylactic anticoagulation group. INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin followed by rivaroxaban to day 30 did not improve clinical outcomes and increased bleeding compared with prophylactic anticoagulation. Therefore, use of therapeutic-dose rivaroxaban, and other direct oral anticoagulants, should be avoided in these patients in the absence of an evidence-based indication for oral anticoagulation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CTLA-4 CT-60 A/G and CTLA-4 1822 C/T gene polymorphism in children with T1DM using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 25 T1DM and 25 controls. The inclusion criteria were patients regularly controlled at the Pediatric Endocrine Outpatient Clinic of Dr. Soetomo Hospital, aged 4C18 years and willing to join this study and the exclusion criteria were T1DM patients hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit. In the control group, the inclusion criteria were healthy children, aged 4C18 years and willing to join this study. The exclusion criteria included children with ongoing infection, history of other autoimmune diseases, allergies, or malignancy. RESULTS: The mean age was 12.48 years old, and the mean of T1DM onset was 9.28 years old.

At present, a problem in gesture recognition is that the researchers did not use the learned knowledge in existing domains to discover and recognize gestures in new domains. For each new domain, it is required to collect and annotate a large amount of data, and the training of the algorithm does not benefit from prior knowledge, leading to redundant calculation workload and excessive time investment. To address this problem, the paper proposes a method that could transfer gesture data in different domains. We use a red-green-blue (RGB) Camera to collect images of the gestures, and use Leap Motion to collect the coordinates of 21 joint points of the human hand. Then, we extract a set of novel feature descriptors from two different distributions of data for the study of transfer learning. This paper compares the effects of three classification algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), broad learning system (BLS) and deep learning (DL). We also compare learning performances with and without using the joint distribution adaptation (JDA) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method could effectively solve the transfer problem between RGB Camera and Leap Motion.

Interestingly, a Spearmans negative association was found between the viral RNA loads quantified by the Quanty COVID-19 assay and the C T values of RT PCRs performed with either the Allplex? 2019CnCoV assay or the Simplexa? COVID-19 Direct assay. However, the strength of this association was higher for the Allplex? 2019CnCoV assay (N gene,  = ?0.92;RdRP gene,  = ?0.91) than for the Simplexa? COVID-19 Direct assay (ORF1ab gene,  = ?0.65;S gene,  = ?0.80). Conclusion: The Allplex? 2019CnCoV and Simplexa? COVID-19 Direct assays yielded comparable results. However, the role these assays might play in future clinical practice warrants larger comparison studies.","output":"Viral RNA load quantification as helpful tool to arbitrate SARSCCoV-2 detection results in respiratory samples"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Applying the dormitory system for thousands of santri (student of Islamic boarding school in Indonesia), Quranic pesantren (Islamic boarding school) has been considered as one of the main culprits in the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Such assumption is created solely from the applicable health protocols and protective measures to avoid COVID-19 transmission in pesantren. As a matter of fact, pesantrens are known to have applied a distinctive way of coping with COVID-19. This study aims to elucidate the theology of health of Quranic pesantren in the face of COVID-19. Research data were generated through observational method on three Quranic pesantrens in Yogyakarta, interviews with caregivers, the COVID-19 task force of the pesantren, santri and documentation related to the handling of COVID-19 in the three pesantrens. The results showed that the Quranic pesantren as a subculture has a distinctive way of dealing with COVID-19 pandemic by integrating modified health protocols in accordance with the actual conditions of the pesantren and by applying rituals of Islamic spirituality by reciting verses of the Quran, salawat (prayers for the Prophet), prayers and hizib (prayer for salvation and rejecting calamities). Three pesantrens chose these methods by drawing on the belief that COVID-19 is Gods creature and, thus, it only works on Gods orders and will stop if God wills. In line with this, this study suggests a method for handling COVID-19 by not only emphasising the health protocols and medical procedures but also taking into account the importance of local wisdom. Contribution statement: This article contributes to the strategy of COVID-19 handling by combining the health protocols of COVID-19 and the applicable local wisdom, such as religious ritual as practiced by numerous pesantren in Indonesia. ? 2021.

Patients apprehension to resort to medical aid and hospitals leads to late admissions and, in our perception, more severe presentations of the underlying pathology, namely, in Chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). Need for testing prior to non-emergent surgery causes larger delays in the referral of patients, and this, added to the reduction of surgical times andlCU availability, potentially results in worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate the type pathology that was treated during the emergency state and to compare the outcome of the surgical procedures with the same period of 2018 and 2019. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the patient charts from patients submitted to surgery in the months of March and April of the year 2020 was conducted and compared to the same period on the previous two years. The primary endpoint was death at 30 days or during hospital stay and the secondary endpoints were pathology classification, grade of ischemia, amputation, amputation level, type of surgery (endovascular, conventional or hybrid), time of hospital stay and reintervention. Results: There were 98 patients submitted to surgery in the COVID period (CP), compared to 286 in the Non-COVID period (NCP). There was no significant difference in the age (70 years (17-98) in the CP vs. 69 (17-92) in the NCP, p=.i3) or sex profile of the patients (76% male (n=74) in the CP vs. 70% (n=i96) in the NCP, p=.26). There was no statistical differ?ence in mortality (5% (n=5) in the CP vs. 5% (n=i3) in the NCP, p=.88). There was a statistically significant decrease in conventional surgery (43% (n=u2) in the CP vs. 57% (n=i6 4) in the NCP, p=.04), but no statistically significant difference in length of hospital stay(io (0-77) days in the CP vs. 7 (0-118) in the NCP, p=.6), and reintervention (18% (n=i8) in the CP vs. 16% (n=45) in the NCP, p=.s8). PAD corresponded to 75% (n=73) of the admissions in the CP vs. 48% (n=i37) in the NCP, p=.02. CLTI corresponded to 99% (n=70) of the PAD population in the CP, vs. 93% (n=n 4) in the NCP, p=.i, with a significant increase in the number of patients presenting with Rutherford Grades 5 and 6 (81% (n=57) in the CP, vs. 68% (n=77) in the NCP, p=.03). There was a non-significant decrease in amputation rate (35% (n-25) vs. 40% (n=49J, P-49) and increase of major limb amputation (52% (0=13) vs. 39% (n=i9), p=.27). The second mostfrequent pathology was aneurysmal aortic and iliac disease, but there was a statistically significant reduction in the number of patients treated (5% (n=s) in the CP vs. 13% (n=36) in the NCP, p=.os). All aortic aneurysms treated in 2020 were ruptured (100% (n=s) vs. 42% (n=is) in the NCP, p=o.2). There was no significant difference in mortality in urgent aortic aneurysm repair between groups (60% (n=3) in the CP vs. 47% (n-7) in the NCP, p-.77). Conclusions: COVID-19 restrictions manifested mainly in the type of pathology treated and the number of patients operated on. The gravity of the underlying pathology, manifested by more serious wounds and advanced CLTI at presentation, did not increase mortality nor was reflected on limb amputations rates. Aortic and iliac aneurismal disease was the second most common pathologytreated but with a significant decrease in total number of cases and no significant difference in mortality.","output":"THE IMPACT of SARS-COV-2 in VASCULAR SURGICAL ACTIVITY in A TERTIARY HOSPITAL"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite data supporting the rapid adoption of telehealth in the delivery of clinical care in North America, the implementation of telehealth visits in clinical research studies has faced critical barriers These challenges include: (1) variations in state licensure requirements for telehealth;(2) disparities in access to telehealth among disadvantaged populations;(3) lack of consistency among individual Investigational Review Boards (IRBs) Each barrier prevents the systematic conversion of research protocols to include telehealth visits The Parkinsons Foundation and members of the Parkinson Study Group submit this Comment to highlight current challenges to implementing telehealth visits for clinical research studies Our objective is to provide a consensus statement emphasizing the urgent need for regulators to standardize adoption of telehealth practices and to propose recommendations to reduce the burden for implementation in existing research study protocols","output":"Expediting telehealth use in clinical research studies: recommendations for overcoming barriers in North America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a third, highly pathogenic coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appearing at end of 2019 led to a pandemic, increased panic and attracted global attention.

Excessive abdominal fat is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction, leading to systemic low-grade inflammation, fat overflow, ectopic lipid deposition, and reduced insulin sensitivity. Physical activity is recommended for primary prevention and treatment of obesity, T2DM, and related disorders. Achieving a stable reduction in body weight with exercise training alone has not shown promising effects on a population level. Because fat has a high energy content, a large amount of exercise training is required to achieve weight loss. However, even when there is no weight loss, exercise training is an effective method of improving body composition (increased muscle mass and reduced fat) as well as increasing insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness. Compared with traditional low-to-moderate-intensity continuous endurance training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) are more time-efficient as exercise regimens and produce comparable results in reducing total fat mass, as well as improving cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity. During high-intensity exercise, carbohydrates are the main source of energy, whereas, with low-intensity exercise, fat becomes the predominant energy source. These observations imply that HIIT and SIT can reduce fat mass during bouts of exercise despite being associated with lower levels of fat oxidation. In this review, we explore the effects of different types of exercise training on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during physical activity, and discuss the potential effects of exercise training on adipose tissue function and body fat distribution.","output":"Effect of Exercise Training on Fat LossEnergetic Perspectives and the Role of Improved Adipose Tissue Function and Body Fat Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lung injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, whether lung ultrasound (LUS) score predicts all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the predictive value of lung ultrasound score for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 who underwent lung ultrasound were prospectively enrolled from three hospitals in Wuhan, China between February 2020 and March 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from digital patient records. Lung ultrasound scores were analyzed offline by two observers. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: Of the 402 patients, 318 (79.1%) had abnormal lung ultrasound. Compared with survivors (n = 360), non-survivors (n = 42) presented with more B2 lines, pleural line abnormalities, pulmonary consolidation, and pleural effusion (all p < 0.05). Moreover, non-survivors had higher global and anterolateral lung ultrasound score than survivors. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, areas under the curve were 0.936 and 0.913 for global and anterolateral lung ultrasound score, respectively. A cutoff value of 15 for global lung ultrasound score had a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 85.3%, and 9 for anterolateral score had a sensitivity of 88.1% and specificity of 83.3% for prediction of death. KaplanCMeier analysis showed that both global and anterolateral scores were strong predictors of death (both p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that global lung ultrasound score was an independent predictor (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01C1.16; p = 0.03) of death together with age, male sex, C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase-myocardial band. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound score as a semiquantitative tool can be easily measured by bedside lung ultrasound.

Both are composed of a closed membrane, which is lined with coat proteins and encases cargo. Transmembrane proteins inserted into the membrane define the target membrane area with which the vesicle or virus is destined to fuse. Here we discuss recent insight into the functioning of enveloped viruses in the framework of the functional module concept. Vesicular transport is an exemplary case of a functional module, as defined as a part of the proteome that assembles to perform a specific autonomous function in a living cell. Cellular vesicles serve to transport cargo between membranous organelles inside the cell, while enveloped viruses can be seen as carriers of the viral genome delivering their cargo from an infected to an uninfected cell. The turnover of both vesicles and viruses involves an analogous series of submodular events. This comprises assembly of elements, budding from the donor compartment, uncoating and/or maturation, docking to and finally fusion with the target membrane to release the cargo. This modular perception enables us to define submodular building blocks so that mechanisms and elements can be directly compared. It will be analyzed where viruses have developed their own specific strategy, where they share functional schemes with vesicles, and also where they even have hijacked complete submodular schemes from the cell. Such a perspective may also include new and more specific approaches to pharmacological interference with virus function, which could avoid some of the most severe side effects.","output":"Viruses as vesicular carriers of the viral genome: A functional module perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Armed Forces veterans (AFVs) are first and foremost citizens of the UK and are therefore-like all UK residents-entitled to universal healthcare, free at the point of need.

In addition, the study assesses the extent to which social factors (socioeconomic status, stress exposure, social support) account for ethnic differences in physical-psychiatric comorbidity (PPC). DESIGN This study uses data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) (N = 12,787). Weighted prevalence rates of physical-psychiatric comorbidity (PPC) - the co-occurrence of physical and psychiatric health problems - are included to examine ethnic group differences among women and men. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine group differences in PPC before and after adjusting for social factors. RESULTS Puerto Rican men have significantly higher risk of PPC in comparison to Non-Latino White men. Among women, Blacks and Cubans were more likely than Non-Latino Whites to experience PPC as opposed to 'Psychiatric Only' health problems. Social factors account for the Puerto Rican/Non-Latino White difference in comorbid health among men, but have little explanatory power for understanding ethnic differences in comorbidity among women.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel.

Method: Initially, the document was translated by two independent translators, before Brazilian experts in health and physical activity evaluated the translations and produced a common initial version. Next, two English native speakers, fluent in Brazilian Portuguese and accustomed to the local culture, back-translated the questionnaire. These back translations were assessed by the organization in charge of the PAR-Q+, then a final Brazilian version was approved. A total of 493 Brazilians between 5 and 93 yr (39.9  25.4 yr), 59% female, with varying levels of health and physical activity, completed the questionnaire twice, in person or online, 1C2 weeks apart. Cronbach's alpha was used to calculate the internal consistency of all items of the questionnaire, and the Kappa statistic was used to assess the individual reproducibility of each item of the document. Additionally, the intraclass correlation coefficient and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to verify the general reproducibility (reliability) of the translated version. Results: The Brazilian version had an excellent internal consistency (0.993), with an almost perfect agreement in 93.8% of the questions, and a substantial agreement in the other 6.2%. The translated version also had a good to excellent total reproducibility (0.901, 95% CI: 0.887C0.914). Conclusion: The results show this translation is a valid and reliable screening tool, which may facilitate a larger number of Brazilians to start or increase physical activity participation in a safe manner.","output":"Translation, Cultural Adaptation, and Reproducibility of the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+): The Brazilian Portuguese Version"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for antiviral treatments that can be deployed rapidly. Drug repurposing represents a promising means of achieving this objective, but repurposing efforts are often unsuccessful. A common hurdle to effective drug repurposing is a failure to achieve a sufficient therapeutic window in the new indication. A clear example is the use of ivermectin in COVID-19, where the approved dose (administered orally) fails to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lungs. Our proposed solution to the problem of ineffective drug repurposing for COVID-19 antivirals is two-fold: to broaden the therapeutic window by reformulating therapeutics for the pulmonary route, and to select drug repurposing candidates based on their model-predicted therapeutic index for inhalation. In this article, we propose a two-stage model-driven screening and validation process for selecting inhaled antiviral drug repurposing candidates. While we have applied this approach in the specific context of COVID-19, this in vitro-in vivo translational methodology is also broadly applicable to repurposing drugs for diseases of the lower respiratory tract.","output":"Using translational in vitro-in vivo modeling to improve drug repurposing outcomes for inhaled COVID-19 therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Data on SARS-CoV-2transmission remains conflicting. Airborne transmission is still debated. However, the hospital risk-control requires a better understanding of the different transmission modes. This work aimed at evaluating the frequency and factors associated with environmental air and surface contamination in the rooms of patients with COVID-19 in the acute phase of the disease. Methods We included 65 consecutive patients and sampled for each patient: seven room surfaces, air at one and three meters, patients mask (inner face) and healthcare workers mask (external face). Environmental contamination was assessed by RT-qPCR (Reverse Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces, air and masks. Then, we performed a viral isolation test on Vero cells for samples having RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) 37. Results SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in respectively 34%, 12%, 50% and 10% of surface, air, patient mask and HCW mask. We isolated an infectious virus in culture from 2 samples among the 85 positive ones with a Ct 37. By multivariate analysis, only the positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR on patients inner face mask was significant factor for surface contamination (OR: 5.79; 95% CI: 1.31-25.67; p = 0.025). Conclusion Surface contamination by SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more frequent comparatively to air or mask contamination. However, viable virus seems to be rarely documented.

Methods: Total expression data from PUD and early-stage GC tissue samples were obtained from GEO and TCGA. Differentially expressed genes were assessed and immunological enrichment analysis was performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and Cytoscape analysis were used together to identify the hub genes. CIBERSORT and COX analysis were used to analyze the differentially infiltrated immune cell landscapes and determine HR scores of the hub genes. Results: Expression data identified 437 DEGs as common to both GC and PUD tissue. Of these, 49 immune-related DEGs were grouped by function, and seven hub genes were identified by PPI analysis.

These proteins are encoded by different genes present on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The expression pattern of these genes in the host cells needs to be assessed. This study was undertaken to understand the transcription pattern of the SARS-CoV-2 genes in the Vero CCL-81 cells during the course of infection. METHODS: Vero CCL-81 cells were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus inoculum having a 0.1 multiplicity of infection. The supernatants and cell pellets were harvested after centrifugation at different time points, post-infection. The 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50)) and cycle threshold (C(t)) values of the E and the RdRp-2 genes were calculated. Next-generation sequencing of the harvested sample was carried out to observe the expression pattern of the virus by mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan HU-1 reference sequence. The expressions were in terms of the reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values. RESULTS: In the inital six hours post-infection, the copy numbers of E and RdRp-2 genes were approximately constant, which raised 10 log-fold and continued to increase till the 12 h post-infection (hpi). The TCID(50) was observed in the supernatant after 7 hpi, indicating the release of the viral progeny. ORF8 and ORF7a, along with the nucleocapsid transcript, were found to express at higher levels. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: This study was a step towards understanding the growth kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. The findings indicated that ORF8 and ORF7b gene transcripts were expressed in higher amounts indicating their essential role in viral replication. Future studies need to be conducted to explore their role in the SARS-CoV-2 replication.","output":"Transcriptome & viral growth analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero CCL-81 cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To create an aerosol containment mask (ACM) for common otolaryngologic endoscopic procedures that also provides nanoparticle-level protection to patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective feasibility study . SETTING: In-person testing with a novel ACM. METHODS: The mask was designed in Solidworks and 3D printed. Measurements were made on 10 healthy volunteers who wore the ACM while reading the Rainbow Passage repeatedly and performing a forced cough or sneeze at 5-second intervals over 1 minute with an endoscope in place. RESULTS: There was a large variation in the number of aerosol particles generated among the volunteers. Only the sneeze task showed a significant increase compared with normal breathing in the 0.3-m particle size when compared with a 1-tailed t test (P = .013). Both the 0.5-m and 2.5-m particle sizes showed significant increases for all tasks, while the 2 largest particle sizes, 5 and 10 m, showed no significant increase (both P < .01). With the suction off, 3 of 30 events (2 sneeze events and 1 cough event) had increases in particle counts, both inside and outside the mask. With the suction on, 2 of 30 events had an increase in particle counts outside the mask without a corresponding increase in particle counts inside the mask. Therefore, these fluctuations in particle counts were determined to be due to random fluctuation in room particle levels. CONCLUSION: ACM will accommodate rigid and flexible endoscopes plus instruments and may prevent the leakage of patient-generated aerosols, thus avoiding contamination of the room and protecting health care workers from airborne contagions.

Such data is common in many domains, including econometrics and healthcare. A canonical example in healthcare is predicting patient outcomes using physiological time-series data, where a population of patients composes a cross-section. Reliable PI estimators in this setting must address two distinct notions of coverage: cross-sectional coverage across a cross-sectional slice, and longitudinal coverage along the temporal dimension for each time series. Recent works have explored adapting Conformal Prediction (CP) to obtain PIs in the time series context. However, none handles both notions of coverage simultaneously. CP methods typically query a pre-specified quantile from the distribution of nonconformity scores on a calibration set. TQA adjusts the quantile to query in CP at each time $t$, accounting for both cross-sectional and longitudinal coverage in a theoretically-grounded manner. The post-hoc nature of TQA facilitates its use as a general wrapper around any time series regression model.

RESULTS: Of the 529 individuals who completed the written survey, 504 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody and 52 people living with HIV were COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig) G positive resulting in a seroprevalence of 10.3%. Among 36 persons with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 52.8% were IgG negative. Inclusion of PCR positive but IgG-negative people living with HIV yields a COVID-19 infection prevalence of 14.1%.

The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. There have been no cases reported in SA, the NT or the ACT in the last four weeks. The numbers of new cases reported from other jurisdictions continue to be very low. Testing rates have been higher across all jurisdictions, with Victoria reporting an 85% testing rate increase and NSW a 40% increase over this period. The positivity rate nationally continues to remain very low at less than 0.1% over the reporting period. Continued high rates of testing are necessary to detect and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the community. Over the past fortnight, 45% of cases acquired their infection overseas. Of cases considered to be locally acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. A small proportion of cases overall have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease in Australia. In addition, the median number of days between symptom onset and diagnostic testing has improved considerably from 7 days in the early phase of the outbreak to 1 day in the latest phase of the epidemic.
