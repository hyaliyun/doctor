Intensive glycemic control is thought to modify the risks for vascular complications, hence the risks for diabetes-related death. We investigated the trend of diabetic vascular complication-related deaths between 2000 and 2016 in the global diabetes landscape. METHODS: We collected 17 years of death certificates data from 108 countries in the World Health Organization mortality database between 2000 and 2016, with coding for diabetic complications. Crude and age-standardized proportions and rates were calculated. Trend analysis was done with annual average percentage change (AAPC) of rates computed by joinpoint regression. RESULTS: From 2000 through 2016, 7,108,145 deaths of diabetes were reported in the 108 countries. Among them, 26.8% (1,904,787 cases) were attributed to vascular complications in damaged organs, including the kidneys (1,355,085 cases, 71.1%), peripheral circulatory (515,293 cases, 27.1%), nerves (28,697 cases, 1.5%) and eyes (5751 cases, 0.3%). Overall, the age-standardized proportion of vascular complication-related mortality was 267.8 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 267.5C268.1] cases per 1000 deaths and the rate was 53.6 (95% CI 53.5C53.7) cases per 100,000 person-years. Throughout the 17-year period, the overall age-standardized proportions of deaths attributable to vascular complications had increased 37.9%, while the overall age-standardized mortality rates related to vascular complications had increased 30.8% (AAPC = 1.9% [1.4C2.4%, p < 0.05]). These increases were predominantly driven by a 159.8% increase in the rate (AAPC = 2.7% [1.2C4.3%, p < 0.05]) from renal complications. Trends in the rates and AAPC of deaths varied by type of diabetes and of complications, as well as by countries, regions and domestic income. CONCLUSION: Diabetic vascular complication-related deaths had increased substantially during 2000C2016, mainly driven by the increased mortality of renal complications.","output":"Global trend of diabetes mortality attributed to vascular complications, 2000C2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cell-free systems are a rapidly expanding platform technology with an important role in the engineering of biological systems. The key advantages that drive their broad adoption are increased efficiency, versatility, and low cost compared to in vivo systems. Traditionally, in vivo platforms have been used to synthesize novel and industrially relevant proteins and serve as a testbed for prototyping numerous biotechnologies such as genetic circuits and biosensors. Although in vivo platforms currently have many applications within biotechnology, they are hindered by time-constraining growth cycles, homeostatic considerations, and limited adaptability in production. Conversely, cell-free platforms are not hindered by constraints for supporting life and are therefore highly adaptable to a broad range of production and testing schemes. The advantages of cell-free platforms are being leveraged more commonly by the biotechnology community, and cell-free applications are expected to grow exponentially in the next decade. In this study, new and emerging applications of cell-free platforms, with a specific focus on cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS), will be examined. The current and near-future role of CFPS within metabolic engineering, prototyping, and biomanufacturing will be investigated as well as how the integration of machine learning is beneficial to these applications.","output":"Biotechnology Applications of Cell-Free Expression Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: Echinacea angustifolia and purpurea have known immunomodulatory effects which boost viral clearance, including HPV infection. However, evidence regarding the improvement due to Echinacea-based supplements of cervical HPV-related pathologies is still lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Echinacea supplementation on the remission of cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (L-SIL). Materials and Methods: A single-blind 1:1:1 parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Colposcopy Unit of a tertiary care referral center. Reproductive-aged women were allocated either to (a) an oral supplement based on Echinacea extracts plus vaginal hyaluronic acid-based soft gel capsules, (b) the Echinacea supplement alone, or (c) vaginal hyaluronic acid-based soft gel capsules alone for 3 months. The primary outcome was the regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-1 for each treatment arm at 3, 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included changes in the epithelialization, pap smear, colposcopic parameters, histological reports, and vaginal health indexes (VHI) in the study groups. Results: 153 women (52 for arm A, 50 for arm B and 51 for arm C) completed the follow-up and were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in both primary and secondary outcomes for the three groups after 3 months. At the 6-month follow-up, the number of persistent CIN-1 diagnoses was significantly lower in arm A (15/51), rather than in arm B (23/48, p = 0.03) and C (27/49, p = 0.03). Similarly, the same effect was seen after 12 months for treatment A (5/51) relative to B (15/48, p = 0.03) and C (14/48, p = 0.03). Colposcopic, histological and vaginal parameters were all significantly improved at 6 and 12 months for arm A relative to B and C, while no beneficial effects were seen after 3 months. Conclusions: Echinacea extracts supplementation in women with L-SIL/CIN-1 significantly boosts HPV lesion clearance, reducing the overall amount of diagnosis, histological, colposcopic and vaginal parameters after 6 and 12 months. However, a limited sample size reduces the quality of evaluated evidence, emphasizing the need for additional studies to validate these findings.","output":"Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea Supplementation Combined with Vaginal Hyaluronic Acid to Boost the Remission of Cervical Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (L-SILs): A Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global effort against the COVID-19 pandemic dictates that routine quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is vital for assessing immunity following periodic revaccination against new viral variants. Here, we report a dual-detection fluorescent immunochromatographic assay (DFIA), with a built-in self-calibration process, that enables rapid quantitative detection of neutralizing antibodies that block binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, this assay is based on the inhibition of binding between ACE2 and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by neutralizing antibodies, and the affinity of anti-human immunoglobulins for these neutralizing antibodies. Our self-calibrating DFIA shows improved precision and sensitivity with a wider dynamic linear range, due to the incorporation of a ratiometric algorithm of two-reverse linkage signals responding to an analyte. This was evident by the fact that no positive results (0/14) were observed in verified negative samples, while 22 positives were detected in 23 samples from verified convalescent plasma. A comparative analysis of the ability to detect neutralizing antibodies in 266 clinical serum samples including those from vaccine recipients, indicated that the overall percent agreement between DFIA and the commercial ELISA kit was 90.98%. Thus, the proposed DFIA provides a more reliable and accurate rapid test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations in the community. Therefore, the DFIA based strategy for detecting biomarkers, which uses a ratiometric algorithm based on affinity and inhibition reactions, may be applied to improve the performance of immunochromatographic assays.","output":"Dual-detection fluorescent immunochromatographic assay for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD-ACE2 blocking neutralizing antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public library makerspaces intend to contribute to the development of children from marginalized communities through the education of digital technology and creativity and by stimulating young people to experience new social roles and develop their identity.

Power generation for transportation and mobility as well as in industry is the main responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions. Indeed, currently, 80% of the energy is still produced by combustion of fossil fuels;thus, great efforts need to be spent to make combustion greener and safer than in the past. For this reason, a review of the most recent gas turbines combustion strategy with a focus on fuels, combustion techniques, and burners is presented here. A new generation of fuels for gas turbines are currently under investigation by the academic community, with a specific concern about production and storage. Among them, biofuels represent a trustworthy and valuable solution in the next decades during the transition to zero carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen and ammonia). Promising combustion techniques explored in the past, and then abandoned due to their technological complexity, are now receiving renewed attention (e.g., MILD, PVC), thanks to their effectiveness in improving the efficiency and reducing emissions of standard gas turbine cycles. Finally, many advances are illustrated in terms of new burners, developed for both aviation and power generation.

This study surveyed clinical trial participants to learn about the prevalence and impact of new technologies and other supportive solutions designed to improve patient engagement and retention. Patient perceptions of these convenience-enhancing solutions and how they have changed since our last study in 2017 were examined. METHODS: Based on 12,451 responses to a global online survey collected in 2019, we conducted an analysis of respondents who used convenience-enhancing solutions during their participation in a clinical trial. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of convenience-enhancing solutions is increasing and that their use correlates with high ratings for clinical trial satisfaction, as well as with high ratings for care and attention received during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of strategies and tactics are needed to reduce barriers to participation and improve retention. The use of convenience-enhancing solutions can help reduce these barriers.

METHODS: A single-centre, cross-sectional prospective study in a busy metropolitan eye casualty between AprilCJune 2020 recording patient demographics, distance travelled to access healthcare, diagnosis and outcome compared to the equivalent period in 2019. A further two-part survey was conducted to explore patient and clinician's perceptions around delays in attendances, views on remote consultation and severity of the condition. RESULTS: There was a 68% decrease in April 2020 compared to previous year's ED attendance. The diagnosis tended towards more visually significant pathology. From 2019 to 2020, there was a significant decrease in average distance travelled to the eye emergency department (eye ED). working-age adults (18-59) and white patients travelling from very far pre-pandemic contributed most to this change. 513 Patient responses (12%) out of 4433 attendances during the study period were received, 89% (456/513) of the completed surveys also had matching clinician surveys. 29% (149/513) patients felt COVID-19 stopped them from attending earlier. Clinicians thought a video consultation would have been suitable for 40% (182/456) of patients compared to only 13% (58/456) of patients preferring a video consultation.

Music has been studied as a support for SMIs for decades, with promising results; however, a lack of synthesized evidence has precluded increased uptake of and access to music-based approaches. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify the types and quantity of research at intersections of music and SMIs, document evidentiary gaps and opportunities, and generate recommendations for improving research and practice. Studies were included if they reported on music's utilization in treating or mitigating symptoms related to five SMIs: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Eight databases were searched; screening resulted in 349 included studies for data extraction. Schizophrenia was the most studied SMI, with bipolar disorder studied the least. Demographics, settings, and activity details were found to be inconsistently and insufficiently reported; however, listening to recorded music emerged as the most common musical activity, and activity details appeared to have been affected by the conditions under study. RCTs were the predominant study design, and 271 unique measures were utilized across 289 primary studies. Over two-thirds of primary studies (68.5%) reported positive results, with 2.8% reporting worse results than the comparator, and 12% producing indeterminate results. A key finding is that evidence synthesis is precluded by insufficient reporting, widely varied outcomes and measures, and intervention complexity; as a result, widespread changes are necessary to reduce heterogeneity (as feasible), increase replicability and transferability, and improve understandings of mechanisms and causal pathways.

Data Sources: The authors independently systematically searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases for English-language observational/naturalistic or randomized controlled polypharmacy trials, using the keywords bipolar and polypharmacy or bipolar and combination treatment and pharmacotherapy. Study Selection: From among 3,566 publications, 49 ultimately met study inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Information was obtained regarding prevalence rates of extensive polypharmacy as well as clinical characteristics and naturalistic outcomes for patients with simple ( 2) or complex ( 3) regimens of psychotropic agents. Results: A weighted mean percentage of 32.7% of bipolar outpatients (4,535/13,863) taking  3 psychotropic medications was identified. Factors associated with complex polypharmacy use include female sex, White race, age > 50 years, history of psychosis, greater burden of depressive illness, subtherapeutic dosing, lower treatment adherence, more extensive psychiatric comorbidity, and a greater history of suicide attempts. Conclusions: Extensive or complex combination pharmacotherapy regimens are common in many patients with bipolar disorder and often reflect greater overall illness severity. Naturalistic studies do not point to better outcomes for patients receiving more complex drug regimens, suggesting likely confounding by indication, high severity, or comorbid conditions.

The beneficial effects of melatonin in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis models have been illustrated, but its role in the oxazolone (Oxa)-induced colitis model (driven by type 2 immune response) remains relatively unknown. We investigated the relationship between melatonin concentration and the severity of UC, revealing a significantly negative correlation. Subsequently, we investigated the effects of melatonin in Oxa-induced colitis mice and the potential underlying mechanisms. Administration of melatonin significantly counteracted body weight loss, colon shortening, and neutrophil infiltration in Oxa-induced colitis mice. Melatonin treatment mitigated Oxa-induced colitis by suppressing type 2 immune response. In addition, melatonin attenuated intestinal permeability by enhancing the expression of ZO-1 and occludin in colitis mice. Interestingly, the protective effect of melatonin was abolished when the mice were co-housed, indicating that the regulation of gut microbiota by melatonin was critical in alleviating Oxa-induced colitis. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to explore the microbiota composition. Decreased richness and diversity of intestinal microbiota at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level resulted from melatonin treatment. Melatonin also elevated the abundance of Bifidobacterium, a well-known probiotic, and reduced proportions of several harmful bacterial genera, such as Desulfovibrio, Peptococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used to explore the role of microbiota in the function of melatonin in Oxa-induced colitis. Microbiota transplantation from melatonin-treated mice alleviated Oxa-induced colitis, suggesting that the microbiome participates in the relief of Oxa-induced colitis by melatonin.

We first validate our code by reproducing previously shown results for Lombardy, Italy. We then focus on the U.S. state of Georgia and on the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, one of the most impacted areas in the world. Our results show good agreement with real-world epidemiological data in both time and space for all regions across major areas and across three different continents, suggesting that the modeling approach is both valid and robust.","output":"Assessing the spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19 via compartmental models with diffusion in Italy, USA, and Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Disease factors and mortality etiologies of free ranging wild cetaceans such as the harbour porpoise (Phoceona phocoena) are difficult to study. However, stranded animals and carcasses can provide invaluable information on the health and biology of this species. Post-mortem examinations performed on 128 stranded harbour porpoises collected over 15 years from Swedish waters examined general health, disease findings and cause of death. The main cause of death was bycatch in fishing gear (31%, confirmed or suspected). Disease, most often pneumonia, was also a frequent cause of death (21%). Porpoise population health may mirror the overall health and stability of marine ecosystems and the effects of human activities on coastal environments. Monitoring health, diseases and causes of death of porpoises allows for identification of threats to these animals, to other animals, to humans and to the environment. ABSTRACT: Harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are useful indicators of the health of their wild populations and marine ecosystems, yet their elusive nature makes studying them in their natural environment challenging. Stranded porpoises provide an excellent source of data to study the health and biology of these animals and identify causes of death, diseases and other threats. The aim of this study was to document pathology, and where possible, cause of death in porpoises from Swedish waters. Post-mortem examinations were performed on 128 stranded porpoises collected from 2006 to 2020. Overall, bycatch including definitive and probable cases was the most common cause of death (31.4%), followed by disease (21.3%), predominantly pneumonia. In adults, infectious disease was the most common cause of death. Bacteria with zoonotic potential such as Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Brucella sp. were documented for the first time in porpoises from Swedish waters, as was the porpoise-adapted group B Salmonella enterica ST416/ST417. Three of four deaths from non-infectious diseases involved parturition complications. Four cases of suspected predation were documented, but further analyses are required to confirm these findings. Our results are consistent with those from other regions in Europe and serve as a reference for future monitoring for changing patterns of health and disease of porpoises and their environments.","output":"Causes of Death and Pathological Findings in Stranded Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) from Swedish Waters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Ankle fracture is one of the most common traumatic fractures among the elderly population. The majority of ankle fractures are stable types with the typically conservative strategy of close contact casting treatment. The continuous use of unventilated standard cast immobilization severely affects patients satisfaction and compliance and markedly increases the rates of various complications. Three-dimensional (3D) printing for casts has advantages of lightweight, ventilated, proper-fit, and esthetic improvements. In this work, this novel 3D-printed cast has been applied to individuals with stable ankle fractures, and its effectiveness can be successfully validated with finite element analysis and a pilot study. A 30% reduction of the volume was chosen as the optimal result in topology optimization. Both 3D-printed casts and conventional casts showed significant ankle function improvement after immobilization for 6 weeks (p = 0.000). The 3D-printed casts were superior to the traditional casts in OlerudCMolander Ankle Scores (OMAS), with the mean difference of 8.3  8.57 OMAS points (95% CI ?10.8 to 27.5; p = 0.354) for 6 weeks, implying that the 3D-printed casts possibly maintain the equal clinical efficacy as the traditional casts.

A chest computed tomography (CT) with intravenous (IV) contrast was performed because of fever and respiratory insufficiency in a period where screening for COVID-19 in suspected patients was important. A solitary PAVM of the left lung was diagnosed. Initial stereotactic burr hole drainage of the abscess was insufficient and resection of the abscess was deemed necessary. Routine workup did not reveal any additional pathology apart from the PAVM. After treatment of the cerebral abscess, the PAVM was treated with embolization using an endovascular plug.

Regarding our first aim, we assert that racial microaggressions are observable events that occur independently of intention (i.e., regardless of whether they are intentional or unintentional) or impact (i.e., regardless of how they are perceived by recipients). Moreover, we assert that racial microaggressions are most validly defined by people of color and can have different meanings on the basis of situational context. The second aim is to propose a refinement and expansion of racial microaggression taxonomies. Sue and colleagues' taxonomy has been invaluable, yet other ways of classifying microaggressions and moving toward dimensional taxonomies are needed to advance scholarship.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased attention has been focused on antiviral treatments. Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and umifenovir (Arbidol) have been touted as potential antiviral treatments for COVID-19. The goal of the current study was to determine whether these potential COVID-19 antivirals produce in vitro antiviral activity against a panel of ocular adenovirus types. METHODS: The 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) of remdesivir (REM), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), ivermectin (IVM), umifenovir (UMF) and cidofovir (CDV) (positive antiviral control) were determined for the human HAdV types HAdV3, HAdV4, HAdV5, HAdV7a, HAdV8, HAdV19/64 and HAdV37 using standard plaque-reduction assays in A549 cells. RESULTS: The range of mean in vitro EC(50) concentrations for each antiviral across the range of HAdV types is as follows: The positive antiviral control, CDV, ranged from 0.47 to 9.62 M; REM ranged from 0.21 to 11.27 M; UMF ranged from 3.72 to 64.8 M; IVR ranged from 2.60 to 201.3 M; and HCQ was >10 M for all Ad types because of toxicity to the A549 cells. REM produced lower EC(50) concentrations than CDV for 6 of 7 HAdV types. Potency increases with lower EC(50) concentrations. CONCLUSION: REM demonstrated anti-adenovirus activity in a range similar to that demonstrated by cidofovir. UMF and IVR demonstrated larger ranges of antiviral activity than CDV and REM across the panel of HAdV types. The anti-adenovirus activity of HCQ could not be determined due to cytotoxicity.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified patients with a single vertebral column metastasis treated with radiation therapy, a pretreatment CT scan, and a follow-up CT scan at least 6 weeks after treatment. Patients with primary spine tumors, preradiation vertebroplasty, preradiation spine surgery, prior radiation to the treatment field, and proton beam treatment modality were excluded. The HU were measured in the vertebral bodies at the level superior to the metastasis, within the tumor and medullary bone of the metastatic level, and at the level inferior to the metastasis. Variables collected included basic demographics, Spine Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), presenting symptoms, bone density treatment, primary tumor pathology, Weinstein-Boriani-Biagini (WBB) classification, Enneking stage, radiation treatment details, chemotherapy regimen, and prophylactic vertebroplasty. RESULTS: One hundred patients with an average age of 63 years and average follow-up of 18 months with radiation treatment dates ranging from 2017 to 2020 were included. Fifty-nine patients were treated with external-beam radiation therapy, with a median total dose of 20 Gy (range 8-40 Gy). Forty-one patients were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy, with a median total dose of 24 Gy (range 18-39 Gy). The most common primary pathologies included lung (n = 22), prostate (n = 21), and breast (n = 14). Multivariable logistic regression analysis (area under the curve 0.89) demonstrated pretreatment HU (p < 0.01), SINS (p = 0.02), involvement of  3 WBB sectors (p < 0.01), primary pathology other than prostate (p = 0.04), and ongoing chemotherapy treatment (p = 0.04) to be independent predictors of postradiation VCF. Patients with pretreatment HU < 145 (n = 32), 145-220 (n = 31), and > 220 (n = 37) had a fracture rate of 59%, 39%, and 11%, respectively. An HU cutoff of 157 was found to maximize sensitivity (71%) and specificity (75%) in predicting postradiation VCF. CONCLUSIONS: Low preradiation HU, higher SINS, involvement of  3 WBB sectors, ongoing chemotherapy, and nonprostate primary pathology were independent predictors of postradiation VCF in patients with metastatic spine disease.

Here, we show the effects of different artificial light sources on multiple aspects of hawkmoth visual ecology, including their perception of floral signals for pollination, the potential for intraspecific sexual signalling, and the effectiveness of their visual defences against avian predators. Light sources fall into three broad categories: some that prevent use of chromatic signals for these behaviours, others that more closely mimic natural lighting conditions, and, finally, types whose effects vary with light intensity and signal colour. We find that Phosphor Converted (PC) amber LED lighting - often suggested to be less harmful to nocturnal insects - falls into this third disruptive group, with unpredictable consequences for insect visual ecology depending on distance from the light source and the colour of the objects viewed. The diversity of impacts of artificial lighting on hawkmoth visual ecology alone argues for a nuanced approach to outdoor lighting in environmentally sensitive areas, employing intensities and spectra designed to limit those effects of most significant concern.","output":"Artificial nighttime lighting impacts visual ecology links between flowers, pollinators and predators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pyrethroids have been considered as potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals and have been shown to be associated with endocrine-related health outcomes.

METHODS: We evaluated the cross-sectional associations in 1235 adults aged 20 years who had been assigned to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014. The urinary concentration of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) was applied as a biomarker of human pyrethroid exposure levels. Information on sex steroid hormones, including total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in serum were measured. Free androgen index (FAI) and the ratio of TT to E2 (TT/E2) were also calculated. The percent changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for a doubling of 3-PBA concentrations in the serum sex hormone levels were estimated using generalized linear regression models. RESULTS: The overall median concentrations of creatinine-adjusted 3-PBA were 0.58 g/g creatinine, and 90.0% of adults had a detectable level of 3-PBA. In females, every two-fold increase in 3-PBA was associated with 4.34% (95% CI: 1.58%, 7.18%) higher levels of TT and 4.05% (95% CI: 7.03%, 1.16%) higher levels of SHBG, respectively.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 98 critical care patients with COVID-19, who had been treated at the University Medical Center Regensburg, Germany, between October 2020 and February 2021. Data collected for each patient included vital signs, dosage of catecholamines, analgosedation, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic medication, diagnostic blood tests, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), intensive care scores, ventilator therapy, and pulmonary gas exchange. Using these data, expected mortality was calculated by means of the originally developed mathematical models, thereby testing the models for their applicability to patients in the second wave. RESULTS: Mortality in the second-wave cohort did not significantly differ from that in the first-wave cohort (41.8% vs. 32.2%, p = 0.151). As in our previous study, individual parameters such as pH of blood or mean arterial pressure (MAP) differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors. In contrast to our previous study, however, survivors and non-survivors in this study showed significant or even highly significant differences in pulmonary gas exchange and ventilator therapy (e.g. mean and minimum values for oxygen saturation and partial pressure of oxygen, mean values for the fraction of inspired oxygen, positive expiratory pressure, tidal volume, and oxygenation ratio). ECMO therapy was more frequently administered than in the first-wave cohort.

BACKGROUND As the prevalence of dementia increases, nurse educators must proactively prepare pre-licensure nursing students to care for people living with dementia. The limited number of physical clinical learning settings, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic, has caused many nursing programs to use alternative experiential learning approaches. DESIGN Systematic Literature Review METHODS: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search for the literature in Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE and ProQuest for relevant peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2021. Using the Boolean operator search approach, the keyword \\"dementia care\\" was combined with \\"AND/OR\\" and other search terms. In addition, a descendent and an ascendent search were conducted to find other relevant studies. RESULTS A total of 17 retrieved articles met the inclusion criteria. Five themes emerged, with the main findings being that face-to-face (in person), virtual and simulated experiential learning approaches increased pre-licensure nursing students' dementia care knowledge. However, the face-to-face experiential learning approach that provides physical contact with people living with dementia and clinical staff had more impact on their skills and attitudes.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. A geriatric hospital-based team acted as a consultant and coordinated the care of older people living in NHs from the hospital. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 630 patients aged 70 and older with Coronavirus Disease 2019 COVID-19 living in 55 NHs. METHODS: A logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors associated with mortality. In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves were applied according to mortality and its associated factors using the log-rank Mantel-Cox test. RESULTS: The diagnosis of COVID-19 was mainly made by clinical compatibility (N = 430). Median age was 87 years, 64.6% were women and 45.9% were transferred to be cared for at the hospital. A total of 282 patients died (44.7%) within the 30 days of first attention by the team. A severe form of COVID-19 occurred in 473 patients, and the most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (n = 332) and altered level of consciousness (n = 301). According to multiple logistic regression, male sex (P = .019), the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS) 6 (P = .004), dementia (P = .012), dyspnea (P < .001), and having a severe form of COVID-19 (P = .001), were associated with mortality, whereas age and care setting were not.

Patients who have died at Usak Training and Research Hospital due to COVID-19 and other diseases in the COVID-19 Intensive Care Units and Internal Medicine Intensive Care Units were recruited into the study. Two groups were compared with each other regarding the most common dermatologic comorbidities. A total of 198 patients including 111 patients with COVID-19 and 87 age and sex-matched patients with other diseases were enrolled in the study. The most common dermatologic comorbidities were pruritus (8.1%), eczema (6.3%), skin infections (3.6%), leukocytoclastic vasculitis (1.8%), and urticaria (0.9%) in the COVID-19 group while they were skin infections (9.2%), eczema (3.4%), pruritus (2.3%), and urticaria (1.1%) in the control group. None of patients in the control group had leukocytoclastic vasculitis. There were no significant differences between COVID-19 and control groups in terms of pruritus, eczema, skin infections, and urticaria (P values were .117, .517, .181, .505, and 1.000, respectively).

AAT contains a reactive methionine residue that is critical for its protease-specific binding capacity, whereby AAT entraps the protease on cleavage of its reactive centre loop, neutralises its activity by key changes in its tertiary structure, and permits removal of the AAT-protease complex from the circulation. Recently, however, the immunomodulatory role of AAT has come increasingly to the fore with several prominent studies focused on lipid or protein-protein interactions that are predominantly mediated through electrostatic, glycan, or hydrophobic potential binding sites. The aim of this review was to investigate the spectrum of AAT molecular interactions, with newer studies supporting a potential therapeutic paradigm for AAT augmentation therapy in disorders in which a chronic immune response is strongly linked.","output":"A Review of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Binding Partners for Immune Regulation and Potential Therapeutic Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human placental tissues have variable rates of SARS-CoV-2 invasion resulting in consistently low rates of fetal transmission suggesting a unique physiologic blockade against SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed as cell surface and soluble forms regulated by a metalloprotease cleavage enzyme, ADAM17. ACE-2 is expressed in the human placenta, but the regulation of placental ACE-2 expression in relation to timing of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated ACE-2 expression, ADAM17 activity and serum ACE-2 abundance in a cohort of matched villous placental and maternal serum samples from Control pregnancies (SARS-CoV-2 negative, n=8) and pregnancies affected by symptomatic maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections in the 2nd trimester (\\"2ndTri COVID\\", n=8) and 3rd trimester (\\"3rdTri COVID\\", n=8). In 3rdTri COVID as compared to control and 2ndTri-COVID villous placental tissues ACE-2 mRNA expression was remarkably elevated, however, ACE-2 protein expression was significantly decreased with a parallel increase in ADAM17 activity. Soluble ACE-2 was also significantly increased in the maternal serum from 3rdTri COVID infections as compared to control and 2ndTri-COVID pregnancies. These data suggest that in acute maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections, decreased placental ACE-2 protein may be the result of ACE-2 shedding.

Healthcare payors acknowledge the need for change but downstream innovation for coverage and reimbursement is only haltingly occurring. Performance uncertainty, high price-tags, payment timing, and actuarial risk issues associated with precision medicines present novel financial challenges for payors. With traditional drug reimbursement frameworks, payment is based on an assumed RCT projection of real world effectiveness, a \\"trial-and-project\\" strategy; the clinical benefit realised for patients is not usually ascertained ex-post by collection of real world data (RWD). To mitigate financial risks resulting from clinical performance uncertainty, manufacturers and payors devised 'track-and-pay' frameworks, i.e. the tracking of a pre-agreed treatment outcome which is linked to financial consequences. While some track-and-pay arangements have been successful, inherent weaknesses include the potential for misalignment of incentives, the risk of channelling of patients, and a failure to use the RWD generated to enable continuous learning about treatments. \\"Precision Reimbursement (PR)\\" intends to overcome inherent weaknesses of simple track-and-pay schemes. In combining the collection of RWD with advanced analytics (e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning) to generate actionable real world evidence, with prospective alignment of incentives across all stakeholders (including providers and patients), and with pre-agreed use and dissemination of information generated, PR becomes a \\"learn-and-predict\\" model of payment for performance.

Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and have been implicated in various age-related diseases in part via expressing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Elimination of SnCs has the potential to delay aging, treat age-related diseases and extend healthspan. However, once cells becoming senescent, they are more resistant to apoptotic stimuli. Senolytics can selectively eliminate SnCs by targeting the SnC anti-apoptotic pathways (SCAPs). They have been developed as a novel pharmacological strategy to treat various age-related diseases. However, the heterogeneity of the SnCs indicates that SnCs depend on different proteins or pathways for their survival. Thus, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms for apoptotic resistance of SnCs will provide new molecular targets for the development of cell-specific or broad-spectrum therapeutics to clear SnCs. In this review, we discussed the latest research progresses and challenge in senolytic development, described the significance of regulation of senescence and apoptosis in aging, and systematically summarized the SCAPs involved in the apoptotic resistance in SnCs.","output":"Why Senescent Cells Are Resistant to Apoptosis: An Insight for Senolytic Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This study compared the strength of incorporation and biocompatibility of 2 porcine-derived grafts (cross-linked and non-cross-linked) in a rat hernia model. METHODS A standardized 2  4 cm(2) fascial defect was created in 30 Wistar rats and repaired with either a cross-linked or a non-cross-linked graft. The rats were killed 3, 6, and 12 months later. The strength of incorporation, vascularization, cellular invasion, foreign body reaction, and capsule formation were evaluated. RESULTS Both graft materials showed cellular ingrowth and neovascularization by 3 months postimplantation. The average level of cellularization was significantly higher in the non-cross-linked grafts than in the cross-linked grafts at 6 months (2 vs 1; P = .029). Vascularization was significantly higher in the non-cross-linked grafts than in the cross-linked grafts at 6 months postimplantation (2 vs 1; P = .029) and insignificant at 3 months (2 vs 1.75; P = .311) and 12 months (1 vs 0.67; P = 1). The maximum load and breaking strength of both biomaterials increased during the study period. Overall, the strength of incorporation of the non-cross-linked grafts increased from 3 months (0.75 MPa) to 12 months (3.06 MPa) postimplantation. The strength of incorporation of the cross-linked grafts also increased from 3 months (0.59 MPa) to 12 months (1.58 MPa) postimplantation.

We sought to capture patients and clinicians experiences of the management of suspected acute COVID-19 and generate wider lessons to inform safer care. SETTING AND SAMPLE: UK primary healthcare. A subset of relevant data was drawn from five linked in-pandemic qualitative studies. The data set, on a total of 87 participants recruited via social media, patient groups and snowballing, comprised free text excerpts from narrative interviews (10 survivors of acute COVID-19), online focus groups (20 patients and 30 clinicians), contributions to a Delphi panel (12 clinicians) and fieldnotes from an online workshop (15 patients, clinicians and stakeholders). METHODS: Data were uploaded onto NVivo. Coding was initially deductive and informed by WHO and Institute of Medicine frameworks of quality and safety. Further inductive analysis refined our theorisation using a wider range of theoriesincluding those of risk, resilience, crisis management and social justice. RESULTS: In the early weeks of the pandemic, patient safety was compromised by the driving logic of stay home and protect the NHS, in which both patients and clinicians were encouraged to act in a way that helped reduce pressure on an overloaded system facing a novel pathogen with insufficient staff, tools, processes and systems. Furthermore, patients and clinicians observed a shift to a more transactional approach characterised by overuse of algorithms and decision support tools, limited empathy and lack of holistic assessment. CONCLUSION: Lessons from the pandemic suggest three key strategies are needed to prevent avoidable deaths and inequalities in the next crisis: (1) strengthen system resilience (including improved resourcing and staffing; support of new tools and processes; and recognising primary cares role as the risk sink of the healthcare system); (2) develop evidence-based triage and scoring systems; and (3) address social vulnerability.","output":"Safety implications of remote assessments for suspected COVID-19: qualitative study in UK primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has emerged as one of the deadliest and most disruptive events in recent human history Drawing from political science and psychological theories, we examine the effects of daily confirmed cases in a country on citizens' support for the political leader through the first 120 d of 2020 Using three unique datasets which comprise daily approval ratings of head of government (n = 1,411,200) across 11 world leaders (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and weekly approval ratings of governors across the 50 states in the United States (n = 912,048), we find a strong and significant positive association between new daily confirmed and total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country and support for the heads of government These analyses show that political leaders received a boost in approval in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic Moreover, these findings suggest that the previously documented \\"rally 'round the flag\\" effect applies beyond just intergroup conflict","output":"The rise of COVID-19 cases is associated with support for world leaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents COVID-Net, an Artificial intelligent system that can detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays based on machine learning.

METHODS: Epidemiological assessment involving parasitological analysis of stool and urine samples were conducted among 432 consenting participants in five communities. Samples were processed using Kato-Katz and urine filtration techniques. Participants data on demography, water contact behavior and access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities were obtained using standardized questionnaires. Data were analysed using SPSS 20.0 and significance level was set at 95%. RESULTS: An overall prevalence of 34.7% was observed, with 150 participants infected with both species of Schistosoma parasite. By communities, prevalence was higher in Birama (57.7%), Barkin Lissa (50.5%) and Shibong (33.3%).

In recent years, virtual reality technology is a tool that has been used to educate people on safety matters. This paper evaluates the effect of education and premonition on the incorrect decision-making of residents under the stressful conditions of an earthquake. For this purpose, a virtual model has been designed and built from a proposed classroom in a school of the city of Tehran. Accordingly, two educational scenarios, presented in reality and the virtual model respectively, were conducted on a statistical sample of 20 students within the range of 20 to 25 years of age. Within the mentioned sample, the first group of 10 students were taught safety measures in a traditional classroom. The second group of 10 students participated in a virtual classroom. Evaluation tests on safety measures against earthquakes were distributed after two weeks. Furthermore, two self-reporting tests of Depression, anxiety, stress test (DASS), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were assigned to the second group to evaluate the effect of foresight under two different scenarios.

Patients and Methods: In this prospective case-control study, 51 patients 18 years who are hospitalized with the diagnosis of Covid-19 and 21 healthy control subjects were included. We divided the patients into two groups according to their medical progress, either into ICU and non-ICU group. Regarding the outcome, patients were again categorized as survivor and non-survivor groups. Blood samples were collected from patients at admission at the time of hospitalization before administration of any treatment for Covid-19. The analyzes of the study were made with the IBM SPSS V22 program. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: : A total of 51 adult patients (F/M: 24/27) (13 ICU and 38 non-ICU) were included in the study cohort. The mean age of the patients was 68.1  14.4 years. The control group consisted of 21 age and sex-matched healthy individuals. All of the patients were hospitalized, in a group of 13 patients, Covid-19 progressed to severe form and were hospitalized at ICU. We found out that the levels of fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), endothelial protein-C receptor (EPCR), D-dimer, soluble E-selectin, soluble P-selectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) were increased;whereas, the levels of soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC), platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP), antithrombin and protein-C were decreased in Covid-19 patients compared to the control group at hospital admission. Tissue plasminogen activator was the only marker that had a significantly different median level between ICU and non-ICU groups (p<0.001). Conclusions: : In accordance with the previous literature, we showed that Covid-19 associated coagulopathy is distinct from sepsis-induced DIC with prominent early endothelial involvement and fibrinolytic shut-down. Reconstruction of endothelial function at early stages of infection may protect patients to progress to ICU hospitalization. We believe that after considering the patients bleeding risk, early administration of LMWH therapy at Covid-19 even in at outpatient setting may be useful both for restoring endothelial function and anticoagulation. The intensity of anticoagulation in non-ICU and ICU Covid-19 patients should be clarified with further studies.","output":"Coagulopathy is Initiated with Endothelial Dysfunction and Disrupted Fibrinolysis in Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To characterize patients with acute ischemic stroke related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and assess the classification performance of clinical and laboratory parameters in predicting in-hospital outcome of these patients. METHODS: In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06C2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05C2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17C5.02). The RF model based on six clinical and laboratory parameters exhibited high cross-validated classification accuracy (0.86) and precision (0.87), good recall (0.72) and F1-score (0.79) in predicting in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients have distinctive risk factor profile and etiology, increased clinical severity and higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 patients. A simple model based on clinical and routine laboratory parameters may be useful in identifying ischemic stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are unlikely to survive the acute phase.

However, the actual associations between specific blood parameters and COVID-19 are not well understood. Here we aimed to assess the correlations between hematological parameters and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We included COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Evercare Hospital Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh, between November 10, 2020, to April 12, 2021, with a confirmed case of RT-PCR test. We recorded demographic information, clinical data, and routine hematological examination results of all COVID-19 patients. We performed statistical analyses and interpretation of data to compare severe COVID-19 patients (SCP) and non-severe COVID-19 patients (NSCP). RESULTS: The age and BMI of the admitted COVID-19 patients were 48.798.53 years and 25.823.75 kg/m(2). This study included a total of 306 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Among them, NSCP and SCP were 198 and 108, respectively. And we recorded 12 deaths from SCP. We observed the alterations of several hematological parameters between SCP and NSCP. Among them, we noticed the increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, and ferritin showed good indicative value to evaluate the severity of COVID-19. Also, there were positive correlations among these parameters. Moreover, we found correlations between the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with patients demographics and comorbid diseases. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, CRP, d-dimer, and ferritin levels at admission to hospitals represent simple assessment factors for COVID-19 severity and the treatment decisions at the hospital setup. These blood parameters could serve as indicators for the prognosis and severity of COVID-19.

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of multiple renal arteries in patients referred for RDN, to propose a classification for anatomical eligibility and to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple arteries and blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients referred for RDN who underwent noninvasive imaging of the renal arteries before treatment were included in present analysis. Eligible patients were treated. Renal function and BP were evaluated 6 months after treatment. RESULTS Hundred and twenty-six patients referred for RDN were included in present analysis. Thirty-four per cent had multiple arteries. Sixty-nine patients underwent RDN. Office BP significantly reduced from 195 ( 26)/106 ( 14) mmHg to 165 ( 24)/95 ( 14) mmHg (P < 0001). BP reduction in patients with multiple arteries which were all treated was comparable to patients with solitary arteries. However, patients with multiple which were not all treated showed a trend towards a less pronounced effect of RDN (: 116, P = 011). The proposed classification appeared useful by identifying eligible anatomy. Renal function at 6 months did not differ from baseline in all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Based on our results and the high prevalence of multiple arteries, it seems reasonable not to exclude patients with multiple renal arteries from RDN. Current analysis suggests that BP reduction may be less pronounced in patients with multiple renal arteries of whom not all arteries were treated.","output":"Renal denervation in multiple renal arteries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Although numerous training options exist for sexual assault nurse examiner certification, most focus on specific certification-related content rather than on creating a holistic preparation for sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) practice.

Vaccination against this infection can prevent the patients from developing severe disease. But vaccine hesitancy in this group can emerge as a hurdle. So there is a need to understand the perception regarding vaccination in AIRD patients. The study is an interview-based survey done in AIRD patients and a control group from the general population. The questionnaire included the subjects demographic details, duration, diagnosis, the activity of AIRD, and questions regarding the perception of the vaccination. The survey included 280 patients with AIRD and 102 control subjects. 54% (152/280) of the patients and 67% (68/102) of the controls were willing to get vaccinated (p = 0.03). Patients > 45-years of age were more willing to vaccinate than those with age  45-years (61.9% vs. 44.8%; p = 0.001). Patients with lower education had more vaccine hesitancy than those with graduation and above (38% vs. 69%; p < 0.001). The common reason for vaccine hesitancy was not-yet-decided, fear related to vaccine side-effects, and disease worsening. 29% (82/280) patients were already vaccinated, out of which 35% (35/82) had mild events (fever/myalgia/headache). AIRD patients had fewer side effects than controls, and disease flare was seen in only one patient. Thus, educating AIRD patients regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, particularly concerning immunological disease, can help us overcome vaccine hesitancy. The message should clearly penetrate that there is a negligible risk of AIRD-flares with the COVID-19 immunization and the side effects are mild and manageable.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease: an interview-based survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) that has created huge trepidation worldwide, has a mortality rate of 0.5-1% which is growing incessantly.

The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for COVID-19 prevalence and deaths in all 6 geopolitical regions and 37 States in Nigeria. METHODS: we analyzed the data retrieved from various sources, including Nigeria CDC, Nigeria National Bureau of Statistics, Unicef-Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington. We examined 4 clinical risk factors (prevalence of TB, HIV, smoking and BCG vaccination coverage) and 5 sociodemographic factors (age 65, population density, literacy rate, unemployment and GDP per capita). Multivariate modeling was conducted using generalized linear model. RESULTS: our analysis showed that the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases differed widely across the 37 States, from 0.09 per 100,000 in Kogi to 83.7 in Lagos. However, more than 70% of confirmed cases were concentrated in just 7 States: Lagos, Abuja, Oyo, Kano, Edo, Rivers and Delta. Case mortality rate (CMR) also varied considerably, with Lagos, Abuja and Edo having CMR above 9 per million population. On bivariate analysis, higher CMR correlated positively with GDP (r=0.53) and to a lesser extent with TB (r=0.36) and population density (r=0.38). On multivariate analysis, which is more definitive, States with higher HIV prevalence and BCG coverage had lower CMR, while high GDP States had a greater CMR.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of patients who presented in 2009 with coexisting H1N1 virus and Legionella infections: a 69-year-old Caucasian man and a 71-year-old Caucasian woman. In our cases all the signs and symptoms, including vomiting, progressive respiratory disease leading to respiratory failure, refractory hypoxemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase and hepatic aminotransferases, were consistent with critical illness due to 2009 H1N1 virus infection. Other infectious disorders may mimic H1N1 viral infection especially Legionnaires' disease. Because the swine flu H1N1 pandemic occurred in Autumn in Italy, Legionnaires disease was to be highly suspected since the peak incidence usually occurs in early fall. We do think that our immediate suspicion of Legionella infection based on clinical history and X-ray abnormalities was fundamental for a successful resolution. CONCLUSION: Our two case reports suggest that patients with H1N1 should be screened for Legionella, which is not currently common practice. This is particularly important since the signs and symptoms of both infections are similar.","output":"Respiratory failure presenting in H1N1 influenza with Legionnaires disease: two case reports"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country.

The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations, and outcomes in this unique patient population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were included. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes (admission to intensive care and/or mortality). FINDINGS: Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (46.3%), of whom 35 later developed symptoms, and 59.7% had no signs of infection. Only 3.6% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7% were dead at the study's cutoff date. On multivariable analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels.

By seeing patients as individuals and integrating their religious and spiritual needs into their medical care, providers can deliver personalized health care. Their needs become even more critical for the frontline providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients want their physicians to address their religious and spiritual needs when it comes to their health (eg, during isolation precautions). Despite increases in educational curricula about this integration, most physicians still do not provide this aspect of patient-centered care. METHODS: In this observational study, we examined how medical students responded to a patient experiencing a religious and spiritual issue by having standardized patients (SPs) rate the students' level of engagement with them. We also asked students to reflect on their own spirituality, in terms of their current and ideal levels of spirituality, the difference of which indicates spiritual dissonance. Medical students (n=232) completed the Spiritual Health and Life-Outcome Measure (SHALOM) questionnaire, and their SPs completed the Princess Margaret Hospital Satisfaction With Doctor Questionnaire (PSQ-MD). RESULTS: Results indicated a significant, positive correlation between disengagement (from PSQ-MD) and transcendent spirituality dissonance (from SHALOM). CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of disconnection from a patient case with a religious and spiritual issue (portrayed by an SP) were associated with higher levels of incongruity in medical students' responses as to their ideal relationship with the transcendent (eg, God, Allah, peace).","output":"Physician Disengagement and Spiritual Dissonance in Medical Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical education is a demanding lifelong learning process, which includes three tightly connected stages: college education, post-graduate education, and continuous education. Residency, the first several years after a college education, is a pivotal time in the development of a qualified doctor. Additionally, residents are the main force that undertakes much of the clinical work in hospitals. Therefore, guaranteeing and improving residents' clinical skills and abilities through the standardized training of resident physicians (STRP) is important. However, compared with other hospitals in the Zhejiang Province, the STRP assessment results of residents in our hospital were not satisfactory in recent years. Therefore, the objective of this study was to find the problems causing the unsatisfactory performance and identify the role of the Plan-Do-Check-Action (PDCA) plan in providing a valuable framework for future training. Methods: Relevant studies of STRP in China and abroad were investigated by the literature review. According to published data by the Health Commision of Zhejiang Province, we collected the STRP assessment rsults of a total number of 12,036 residents. The inclusion cretria of these residents include: (1) 3rd-year residents. (2) taking STRP in the Zhejiang Province during 2016C2018 or 2017C2019. (3) the first time taking the clinical practice ability examination (CPAE) in 2018 or 2019. The results of 634 3rd-year residents from The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (SAHZU) were provided by the Department of Medical Education and were analyzed in depth. Three hundred and eight residents from SAHZU received normal training and took the CPAE in 2018, whereas 326 residets received PDCA and took the CPAE in 2019. PDCA is a program designed to improve the performance of residency in SAHZU. It includes the formulation and implementation of specific training plans, the check of effects, and continuous improvements. There was no change in the STRP assessment in these 2 years and the indicator of performance in the STRP assessment was the first pass rate (FPR). Statistical analyses were performed using Pearson's chi-squared test, Yates-corrected chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test (SPSS Statistics, version 25). A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total number of 6,180 and 5,856 examinees in the Zhejiang Province took the clinical practice ability examination in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2018, a total of 308 residents from 20 departments of the SAHZU took the STRP assessment. In 2019, a total of 326 residents from 22 departments of the SAHZU underwent the PDCA plan and took the STRP assessment. Compared with the results in 2018, the average FPR in the Zhejiang Province increased by 2.92% from 87.87 to 90.79% (P < 0.001). The FPR of the SAHZU increased by 7.88% from 85.06 to 92.94% (P = 0.001). In the SAHZU, the FPRs of the Department of Emergency and Department of Anesthesiology improved 34.51% (P = 0.024) and 20.36% (P = 0.004), respectively. There were no significant differences between the performances in the 2 years of the other 20 departments. There were improved results in the Clinical Thinking and Decision-Making and Operation of Basic Skills assessment stations with increases of 3.01% (P = 0.002) and 3.94% (P = 0.002), respectively. No statistically significant differences in the FPRs of the other six stations were found. The performances in all the stations in the final tests were better than in the stimulation tests (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although our sample size was relatively small, our results showed a small success of the PDCA plan in improving the quality of the STRP, especially for the residents in the Departments of Emergency and Anesthesiology. The PDCA plan also contributed to enhancing residents' abilities in the Clinical Thinking and Decision-Making and Operation of Basic Skills stations. Taken together, the PDCA plan may provide a practical framework for developing future training plans.","output":"The Plan-Do-Check-Action Plan Helps Improve the Quality of the Standardized Training of Resident Physicians: An Analysis of the Results of the First Pass Rate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The marine copepod, Tigriopus californicus, produces the red carotenoid pigment astaxanthin from yellow dietary precursors. This bioconversion of yellow carotenoids to red is hypothesized to be linked to individual condition, possibly through shared metabolic pathways with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Experimental inter-population crosses of lab-reared T. californicus typically produces low-fitness hybrids is due in large part to the disruption of coadapted sets nuclear and mitochondrial genes within the parental populations. These hybrid incompatibilities can increase variability in life history traits and energy production among hybrid lines. Here, we tested if production of astaxanthin was compromised in hybrid copepods and if it was linked to mitochondrial metabolism and offspring development. We observed no clear mitonuclear dysfunction in hybrids fed a limited, carotenoid-deficient diet of nutritional yeast. However, when yellow carotenoids were restored to their diet, hybrid lines produced less astaxanthin than parental lines. We observed that lines fed a yeast diet produced less ATP and had slower offspring development compared to lines fed a more complete diet of algae, suggesting the yeast-only diet may have obscured effects of mitonuclear dysfunction. Astaxanthin production was not significantly associated with development among lines fed a yeast diet but was negatively related to development in early generation hybrids fed an algal diet. In lines fed yeast, astaxanthin was negatively related to ATP synthesis, but in lines fed algae, the relationship was reversed. Although the effects of the yeast diet may have obscured evidence of hybrid dysfunction, these results suggest that astaxanthin bioconversion may still be related to mitochondrial performance and reproductive success.","output":"Evidence for hybrid breakdown in production of red carotenoids in the marine invertebrate Tigriopus californicus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Bovine Rotavirus and Bovine Coronavirus are the most important causes of diarrhea in newborn calves and in some other species such as pigs and sheep.

METHODS In the present study, several prediction programs were used to predict B and T-cells epitopes, secondary and tertiary structures, antigenicity ability and enzymatic degradation sites. Finally, a chimeric antigen was designed using computational techniques. The chimeric VP8-S2 antigen was constructed. It was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+) expression vector. The recombinant pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 vector was transferred into E.oli BL21CodonPlus (DE3) as expression host. The recombinant VP8-S2 protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography column. RESULTS The results of colony PCR, enzyme digestion and sequencing showed that the VP8-S2 chimeric antigen has been successfully cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+).The results showed that E.coli was able to express VP8-S2 protein appropriately. This protein was expressed by induction of IPTG at concentration of 1mM and it was confirmed by Ni-NTA column, dot-blotting analysis and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. CONCLUSION The results of this study showed that E.coli can be used as an appropriate host to produce the recombinant VP8-S2 protein.

Pigs have high-contact rates with humans and other animals, transmit similar pathogens as humans including CoVs, and serve as reservoirs and intermediate hosts for notable human pandemics. Wild and domestic pigs both interface with humans and each other but have unique ecologies that demand different surveillance strategies. Three fundamental questions shape any surveillance program: where, when, and how can surveillance be conducted to optimize the surveillance objective? Using theory of mechanisms of zoonotic spillover and data on risk factors, we propose a framework for determining where surveillance might begin initially to maximize a detection in each host species at their interface. We illustrate the utility of the framework using data from the United States. We then discuss variables to consider in refining when and how to conduct surveillance. Recent advances in accounting for opportunistic sampling designs and in translating serology samples into infection times provide promising directions for extracting spatio-temporal estimates of disease risk from typical surveillance data. Such robust estimates of population-level disease risk allow surveillance plans to be updated in space and time based on new information (adaptive surveillance) thus optimizing allocation of surveillance resources to maximize the quality of risk assessment insight.","output":"A framework for surveillance of emerging pathogens at the human-animal interface: pigs and coronaviruses as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health systems worldwide since 2020. At the frontline of the pandemic, healthcare workers are at high risk of exposure. Compliance with infection prevention and control (IPC) should be encouraged at the frontline. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of dissemination interventions to improve healthcare workers adherence with IPC guidelines for respiratory infectious diseases in the workplace. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs that assessed the effect of any dissemination strategy in any healthcare settings. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. We synthesized data using random-effects model meta-analysis in Stata 14.2. RESULTS: We identified 14 RCTs conducted from 2004 to 2020 with over 65,370 healthcare workers. Adherence to IPC guidelines was assessed by influenza vaccination uptake, hand hygiene compliance, and knowledge on IPC. The most assessed intervention was educational material in combined strategies (plus educational meetings, local opinion leaders, audit and feedback, reminders, tailored interventions, monitoring the performance of the delivery of health care, educational games, and/or patient-mediated interventions). Combined dissemination strategies compared to usual routine improve vaccination uptake (risk ratio [RR] 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54 to 1.81, moderate-certainty evidence), and may improve hand hygiene compliance (RR 1.70; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.83, moderate-certainty). When compared to single strategies, combined dissemination strategies probably had no effect on vaccination uptake (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07, low-certainty), and hand hygiene compliance (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.36, low-certainty). Knowledge of healthcare workers on IPC improved when combined dissemination strategies were compared with usual activities, and the effect was uncertain in comparison to single strategy (very low-certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: Combined dissemination strategies increased workers vaccination uptake, hand hygiene compliance, and knowledge on IPC in comparison to usual activities. The effect was negligible when compared to single dissemination strategies. The adoption of dissemination strategies in a planned and targeted way for healthcare workers may increase adherence to IPC guidelines and thus prevent dissemination of infectious disease in the workplace.

We developed HyDrop, a flexible and open-source droplet microfluidic platform encompassing three protocols. The first protocol involves creating dissolvable hydrogel beads with custom oligos that can be released in the droplets. In the second protocol, we demonstrate the use of these beads for HyDrop-ATAC, a low-cost noncommercial scATAC-seq protocol in droplets. After validating HyDrop-ATAC, we applied it to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 7996 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in a single run. In the third protocol, we adapt both the reaction chemistry and the capture sequence of the barcoded hydrogel bead to capture mRNA, and demonstrate a significant improvement in throughput and sensitivity compared to previous open-source droplet-based scRNA-seq assays (Drop-seq and inDrop).

Using the literature, we explored the concepts attributed to the development of resilience, identifying those that mitigate symptoms of distress caused by adversity and facilitate coping in seven classes of illness: transplants, cancer, mental illness, episodic illness, chronic and painful illness, unexpected events, and illness within a dyadic relationship. We identified protective, compensatory, and challenge-related coping-concept strategies that healthcare workers and patients use during the adversity experience. Healthcare-worker assessment and selection of appropriate coping concepts enable the individual to control their distress, resulting in attainment of equanimity and the state of resilience, permitting the resilient individual to work toward recovery, recalibration, and readjustment.

IL-6 works through an interaction with the complex peptide IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). IL-6 is built with four &#945;-chain nanostructures, while two different chains, IL-6R&#945; (gp80) and gp130/IL6? (gp130), are included in IL-6R. The three-dimensional shapes of the six chains composing the IL-6/IL-6R complex are the basis for the nanomolecular roles of IL-6 signalling. Genes, pseudogenes and competitive endogenous RNAs of IL-6 have been identified. In the present review, the roles played by miRNA in the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-6 expression are evaluated. mRNAs are absorbed via the 'sponge' effect to dynamically balance mRNA levels and this has been assessed with regard to IL-6 transcription efficiency. According to current knowledge on molecular and nanomolecular structures involved in active IL-6 signalling, two different IL-6 models have been proposed. IL-6 mainly has functions in inflammatory processes, as well as in cognitive activities. Furthermore, the abnormal production of IL-6 has been found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; also known as COVID-19). In the present review, both inflammatory and cognitive IL-6 models were analysed by evaluating the cytological and histological locations of IL-6 signalling. The goal of this review was to illustrate the roles of the classic and trans-signalling IL-6 pathways in endocrine glands such as the thyroid and in the central nervous system. Specifically, autoimmune thyroid diseases, disorders of cognitive processes and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection have been examined to determine the contribution of IL-6 to these disease states.","output":"Interleukin-6 signalling as a valuable cornerstone for molecular medicine (Review)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider a random dynamical system, where the deterministic dynamics are driven by a finite-state space Markov chain.

PURPOSE A case of uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management in a pediatric patient with a ventricular assist device awaiting a heart transplant is reported. SUMMARY A 4-month-old male in heart failure was experiencing uncontrolled hypertension. Because of a lack of hemodynamic stability, he was unable to be listed as a heart transplant candidate. He received multiple antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, -blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators) as both intermittent and continuous infusions over the course of several days without achieving normotension. The decision was then made to administer intravenous phentolamine as a continuous infusion to pursue a different mechanism than with traditional antihypertensive agents to achieve hemodynamic stability. Within 8 hours of initiation of the continuous phentolamine infusion, the patient became normotensive and was listed for a heart transplant. The continuous phentolamine infusion was administered over the next 4 days to maintain normotension, and on day 4 the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. CONCLUSION A 4-month-old male in heart failure with a ventricular assist device, experiencing uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management, was successfully treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine.","output":"Phentolamine continuous infusion in a pediatric patient with uncontrolled hypertension."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Mechanical ventilation can increase the rate of free radicals in the systemic circulation due to its effect on the inflammatory system Previous research has suggested that vitamin D has antioxidant properties This study aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and its relationship with ICU patients' outcomes Methods In this prospective randomized clinical trial, 36 ventilated ICU patients were randomly allocated to receive either a single intramuscular vitamin D 300,000 IU or its placebo Serum Vitamin D and TAC were measured before and on day 7 after the intervention clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were measured daily for seven days and on days 14 and 28 Results Thirty patients completed the study The results show that injection of vitamin D leads to a significant increase in the mean changes of vitamin D level on the seventh day of the study (+3 51 3 vs -0 40 2 P=0 00) and TAC levels (3 23 9 vs -2 02 6 P=0 00 ICU length of stay was 18 38 4 and 25 46 6 days in the intervention and placebo arms of the study Twelve patients in the placebo group and 5 in the vitamin D group died within the 28 day study period The duration of mechanical ventilation was 15 7 9 3 vs 22 6 9 1 days in vitamin D and placebo arms, respectively Conclusion : Administration of vitamin D may increase TAC levels and decrease the length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation in ICU patients","output":"High dose vitamin D improves total serum antioxidant capacity and ICU outcome in critically ill patients - A randomized, double-blind clinical trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, Switzerland introduced broad nationwide face mask mandates only by October 2020, later than other Western European countries. This study aims to assess the underlying values and considerations of individuals to wear face masks in the absence of face mask mandates in the COVID-19 pandemic in German-speaking Switzerland. METHODS: As part of the Solidarity in times of a pandemic (SolPan) research commons, we interviewed 31 participants living in the German-speaking part of Switzerland in April 2020 and 25 of them again in October 2020. Qualitative inductive thematic analysis was applied for data analysis and interpretation. Public health ethics principles guided the interpretation and organization of findings. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: Trust and governmental policy; perceived benefits of mask-wearing; perceived risks of mask-wearing; social exclusion and prejudice; and decision-making in the absence of mandates. In light of increasing infection rates in October 2020, many participants started to consider the benefits higher than the risks and were willing to accept face mask mandates in that context, despite earlier reservations. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of face mask mandates underline individual autonomy but may also suppress personal responsibility due to social influence. Face masks are only temporarily acceptable in liberal Western societies and face mask mandates should be enforced only when epidemiologically necessary.

Objective The aim of our study was to observe whether different therapies for PsA [methotrexate, anti-TNF antibodies, soluble TNF receptor (etanercept) or IL-17 inhibitors] have a different impact on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in a homogeneous population of patients. Methods We enrolled 110 PsA patients in remission, assessed with Disease Activity in PSoriatic Arthritis (DAPSA). Of these: 63 were in treatment with anti-TNF- therapy (26 etanercept, 15 certolizumab, 5 golimumab, 17 adalimumab);37 with anti-IL17 secukinumab;10 with methotrexate. All patients underwent vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 with mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Assessment of absolute and percentage lymphocyte subsets and anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgG antibody value 3 weeks after the second vaccine dose were performed. In addition, the serum antibody levels of 96 healthy healthcare workers (HCW) were analyzed. Results The mean disease activity assessed with DAPSA score was 2.96 (SD = 0.60) with no significant differences between patients under different medications (p = 0.779). Median levels of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD were 928.00 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL [IQR 329.25, 1632.0];1068.00 BAU/ml [IQR 475.00, 1632.00] in patients taking MTX, 846.00 BAU/ml [IQR 125.00, 1632.00] in patients taking etanercept, 908.00 BAU/mL [IQR 396.00, 1632.00] in patients taking anti-IL17 and 1148.00 BAU/ml [IQR 327.00, 1632.00] in patients taking TNF- inhibitors, without statistically significant differences between these groups. Mean serum antibody level of HCW group was 1562.00 BAU/ml [IQR 975.00, 1632.00], being significantly higher than in the patient group (p = 0.000816).

A common approach to this problem involves fitting daily transmission rates using a Susceptive Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model (regularizing them to avoid overfitting), and then computing the relationship between the estimated transmission rate and mobility. Unfortunately, there are often several, very different transmission rate trajectories that can fit the reported cases well, meaning that the choice of regularization determines the final solution (and thus the mobility-transmission rate relationship) selected by the SEIR model. Moreover, the classical approaches to regularizationpenalizing the derivative of the transmission rate trajectorydo not correspond to realistic properties of pandemic spread. Consequently, models fit using derivative-based regularization are often biased toward underestimating the current transmission rate and future deaths. In this work, we propose mobility-driven regularization of the SEIR transmission rate trajectory. This method rectifies the artificial regularization problem, produces more accurate and unbiased forecasts of future deaths, and estimates a highly interpretable relationship between mobility and the transmission rate.

MEASUREMENTS: Depressive disorders were classified as Major Depressive disorder (MDD) or Subthreshold Depression (STD) according to DSM-5 criteria. Depressive symptoms were assessed with validated versions of 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). We performed binary logistic regressions to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for frailty in LLD adjusting for multiple confounders. Participants who were frail at baseline were excluded from the analyses according to measures of frailty (FRAIL questionnaire and 36-item Frailty Index, FI-36). We also estimated the risk ratio or relative risk (RR) and the risk difference (RD) for incident frailty. RESULTS: We observed a 2 to 4-fold increased risk for incident frailty among participants with LLD.

One possible side effect is the depletion of implantable pulse generator (IPG) battery and the associated sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms, which can be potentially life-threatening. Delayed or postponed outpatient visits due to COVID -19 may be a risk factor of battery end-of-life consequences. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the clinical outcomes in reported PD and dystonia patients treated with DBS, who, as a result of the sudden depletion of the neurostimulator battery, developed life-threatening symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched using pre-established criteria. RESULTS: A total of 244 articles was found, of which 12 met the adopted criteria. Selected papers presented a total of 17 case reports of DBS-treated patients - 11 with PD, and six with dystonia - who had depleted IPG batteries and due to rapid worsening of PD/dystonia symptoms required urgent hospital admission. IPG battery replacement was the only effective treatment in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: IPG battery depletion can result in fatal outcomes. Sudden recurrence of PD or dystonia symptoms in patients treated by DBS can be potentially life-threatening, so scheduling the replacement of a discharged IPG battery should not be postponed.

Using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), we investigated the 12-month trajectory of cardiac impairment in individuals with Long Covid. Methods534 individuals with Long Covid underwent baseline CMR (T1 and T2 mapping, cardiac mass, volumes, function, and strain) and multi-organ MRI at 6 months (IQR 4.3,7.3) since first post-COVID-19 symptoms and 330 were rescanned at 12.6 (IQR 11.4, 14.2) months if abnormal findings were reported at baseline. Symptoms, standardised questionnaires, and blood samples were collected at both timepoints. Cardiac impairment was defined as one or more of: low left or right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), high left or right ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV and RVEDV), low 3D left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), or elevated native T1 in []3 cardiac segments. A significant change over time was reported by comparison with 92 healthy controls. ResultsThe technical success of this multiorgan assessment in non-acute settings was 99.1% at baseline, and 98.3% at follow up, with 99.6% and 98.8% for CMR respectively. Of individuals with Long Covid, 102/534 [19%] had cardiac impairment at baseline; 71/102 had complete paired data at 12 months. Of those, 58% presented with ongoing cardiac impairment at 12 months. High sensitivity cardiac troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide were not predictive of CMR findings, symptoms, or clinical outcomes. At baseline, low LVEF, high RVEDV and low GLS were associated with cardiac impairment. Low LVEF at baseline was associated with persistent cardiac impairment at 12 months.

In this work, we provide comprehensive analysis of 238 MERS CoV full genomes comprised of human (hMERS) and camel (cMERS) isolates of the virus.

Effective number of codons (ENc) analysis reveals a general slight codon usage bias. Codon adaptation index reveals incomplete adaptation to host environment. MERS CoV showed high ability to resist the innate immune response by showing lower CpG frequencies.

Medical students completed pre- and post-clerkship self-assessments. Faculty and resident participants also completed surveys on their experience with virtual lectures and clinics. Pre- and post-clerkship results were compared using a 2-sided paired t test. An analysis of variance model was used to analyze the clerkship components. RESULTS: Twenty-six medical students, including 4 visiting students, enrolled over 2 clerkship periods (4 weeks). All students completed the pre- and post-clerkship self-assessments and agreed that the clerkship improved their understanding of radiation oncology. Compared with 3 (11.5%) students who agreed that they understood the daily responsibilities of a radiation oncologist before the clerkship, 22 (84.6%) students agreed and 3 (11.5%) strongly agreed that they understood the daily responsibilities of a radiation oncologist after the clerkship (P < .0001). Although 15 students (57.7%) reported an increased interest in radiation oncology because of the clerkship, the mean level of interest in radiation oncology as a career remained the same, with pre- and post-clerkship scores of 3.0 (0.9) and 3.0 (1.1) on a 5-point scale, respectively (P = .7). Students found virtual clinic and didactic lectures to be the most valuable components of the clerkship. Most respondents agreed (30.8%) or strongly agreed (65.4%) to recommend the clerkship to their classmates. CONCLUSIONS: Our virtual clerkship was effective in increasing medical student interest in and knowledge about radiation oncology. These data will help optimize a new paradigm of virtual radiation oncology education for medical students during COVID-19 and beyond.","output":"Virtual Radiation Oncology Clerkship During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, many studies have reported potential associations between cytokine gene polymorphisms and the development, course, and outcome of sepsis, often with apparently conflicting results. The objective of this study was to investigate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the interleukin (IL)-1 C31 T/C, IL-6 C174 G/C, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) C308 G/A, and interferon  (IFN-) +874 A/T genes for their possible association with susceptibility to early onset sepsis (EOS) in Saudi newborn infants. A total of 205 newborn infants aged 1-2 days were consecutively enrolled onto the study having met the inclusion criteria (as per the research protocol). DNA was extracted from filter papers using the Chelex-100 method. The cytokines SNP were genotyping using Taqman 5 nuclease allelic discrimination. For cytokine measurements we used the commercially available Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. Our results show that the circulating IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN- were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated in EOS patients compared to suspected and sepsis-free control groups; and IL-1 C31C, IL-6 C174G, TNF- C308G, and IFN- +874A alleles were associated with EOS in Saudi infants. In conclusion, analysis of cytokines concentrations and SNP for the four tested genes can be used as a predictor of sepsis outcome in newborns.","output":"Neonatal infections in Saudi Arabia: Association with cytokine gene polymorphisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background For the 2019-2020 interview season, the anesthesia residency program at Augusta University offered candidates a choice between in-person (IP) and video conference (VC) interviews to accommodate a greater number of qualified candidates. Methods The same applicant selection criteria were used for both interview types. However, we modified the informal interactions with residents, campus tours, and interview formats for VC interviews. We sought to compare the 2 methods by analyzing the respective costs, benefits, and match results. Results Of 159 candidates interviewed, we ranked 127 and matched with 12. The IP (n = 135) and VC (n = 24) groups were similar in gender distribution but not by the type of medical school, with more international medical graduates interviewing by VC than IP. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 interview types for being ranked (81% of IP, 71% of VC) or matched (6% of IP, 17% of VC). US Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 scores and type of medical school did not affect the likelihood of being ranked or matched. Program costs per candidate were higher for the IP group ($431 for IP, $294 for VC). Conclusion Our single-center study indicates that the interview type did not affect the likelihood of a candidate being ranked by or matched to our program. Further, VC interviews were more cost-effective and time-effective than IP interviews.

Despite this, little is known about healthcare resource utilization internationally. Furthermore, there is no Irish data to inform fundholding decision makers. Omalizumab is an anti IgE monoclonal antibody used in refractory urticaria. It is a comparatively high cost medicine and access to this treatment can be challenging. Recent assessments of omalizumab compared with usual care suggest that omalizumab is a cost-effective treatment for refractory urticaria. We carried out a retrospective review of 47 patients commenced on omalizumab. We evaluated unplanned primary and secondary care attendances and urticaria symptomatology before and after treatment. As expected, patients with refractory disease that were commenced on omalizumab had objective improvements in urticaria symptoms. Importantly, we show that this is reflected in a dramatic reduction in unplanned healthcare interactions at primary care and emergency departments. These data suggest that omalizumab may benefit these patients by reducing disease activity and thereby reducing the need for unplanned healthcare interactions.","output":"Omalizumab Reduces Unplanned Healthcare Interactions in Irish Patients With Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose : Lung transplantation is a potentially lifesaving treatment for severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), when optimized medical treatment fails to accomplish lung recovery. However, since the long-term outcomes remain unknown, concerns related to the use of lung transplantation in critically ill COVID-19 patients persist. In the current study, we evaluated consecutive patients that underwent lung transplantation for severe COVID-19 ARDS at our center and compared their post-transplant outcomes with those undergoing transplantation for non-COVID-19 pathology during the concurrent study period. Methods All consecutive patients undergoing lung transplantation between January 2020 to May 2021 were included. The study included two cohorts of patients that underwent transplantation for non-COVID-19 disease (nC19) or refractory COVID-19 ARDS (C19). For additional analysis, we included consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 that required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Results We found that post-procedure complications and length of stay were significantly greater compared to transplants performed for non-COVID-19 lung diseases during the concurrent study period. Following transplant the COVID-19 cohort demonstrated a more rapid improvement in Karnofsky performance status. At one year, all recipients in COVID-19 cohort were alive with post-transplant survival no different than institutional non-COVID-19 recipients. Furthermore, when compared to propensity-matched recipients from SRTR, post-transplant survival of institutional COVID-19 ARDS patients was non-inferior. There was progressive reduction in the probability of separation from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with time and ECMO support greater than 30 days was associated with a significantly greater risk of death in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. In those who remained unweanable from ECMO after 30 days, lung transplant was an independent predictor of survival. Conclusion We conclude that lung transplantation in selected patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS who remain unweanable from extracorporeal life support can result in post-transplant outcomes comparable to recipients with chronic end-stage lung diseases and non-COVID-19 ARDS.","output":"Long Term Outcomes Following Double Lung Transplantation for Severe COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For several decades, systems thinking has been a defined body of knowledge that has contributed to many areas of science Its value has, critically, resided in (meta- or post-) paradigmatic and participative use of one or several systems approaches to help stakeholders structure and tackle complex problems With renewed and (post-)pandemic interest in interdisciplinary work, this paper argues that to continue securing a future, system thinking requires a wider understanding of the dynamics and intertwining of knowledge unfolding and ethics in society Two different but overlapping scenarios for systems thinking are proposed: (a) One based on inter-(disciplinary, para/professional, group) work and (b) another based on ethical vigilance The first one is not so different from what has been envisaged for systems thinking in the last few years Nevertheless, and following the ideas of the sociologist Andrew Abbott, this scenario proposes the explicit inclusion of the goal of knowledge rediscovery to promote a sense of solidarity, mutual understanding and compassion For the second scenario, Michel Foucaults notion of governmentality is used to problematize pandemic events and practices, and to offer possibilities for individual critical thinking and action, also leading us to consider the importance of (self-other) compassion Features, implications, questions and examples of use are provided for each scenario ? 2020 by the author Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Inter-work and ethical vigilance: Two scenarios for the (post-)pandemic future of systems thinking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine and protease inhibitors were widely used as off-label treatment options for COVID-19 but the safety data of these drugs among the COVID-19 population are largely lacking. Drug-induced QTc prolongation is a known adverse reaction of hydroxychloroquine, especially during chronic treatment. However, when administered concurrently with potential pro-arrhythmic drugs such as protease inhibitors, the risk of QTc prolongation imposed on these patients is not known. We aim to investigate the incidence of QTc prolongation events and potential factors associated with its occurrence in COVID-19 population. METHODS: We included 446 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients taking at least one treatment drug for COVID-19 within a period of one month (March-April 2020). In addition to COVID-19-related treatment (HCQ/PI), concomitant drugs with risks of QTc prolongation were considered. We defined QTc prolongation as QTc interval of &#8805;470 ms in postpubertal males, and &#8805;480 ms in postpubertal females. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: QTc prolongation events occurred in 28/446 (6.3%) patients with an incidence rate of 1 case per 100 person-days. A total of 26/28 (93%) patients who had prolonged QTc intervals received at least two pro-QT drugs. Multivariate analysis showed that HCQ and PI combination therapy had five times higher odds of QTc prolongation as compared to HCQ-only therapy after controlling for age, cardiovascular disease, SIRS and the use of concurrent QTc-prolonging agents besides HCQ and/or PI (OR 5.2; 95% CI, 1.11-24.49; p = 0.036). Independent of drug therapy, presence of SIRS resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 4.3; 95% CI, 1.66-11.06; p = 0.003). In HCQ-PI combination group, having concomitant pro-QT drugs led to four times higher odds of QTc prolongation (OR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.53-9.73; p = 0.004). Four patients who had prolonged QTc intervals died but none were cardiac-related deaths. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In our cohort, hydroxychloroquine monotherapy had low potential to increase QTc intervals. However, when given concurrently with protease inhibitors which have possible or conditional risk, the odds of QTc prolongation increased fivefold. Interestingly, independent of drug therapy, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulted in four times higher odds of QTc prolongation, leading to the postulation that some QTc events seen in COVID-19 patients may be due to the disease itself.

Formulating a regional mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and frequently estimating parameters of this model using streaming surveillance data offers one way to accomplish data-driven decision making. For example, to detect an increase in new SARS-CoV-2 infections due to relaxation of previously implemented mitigation measures one can monitor estimates of the basic and effective reproductive numbers. However, parameter estimation can be imprecise, and sometimes even impossible, because surveillance data are noisy and not informative about all aspects of the mechanistic model, even for reasonably parsimonious epidemic models. To overcome this obstacle, at least partially, we propose a Bayesian modeling framework that integrates multiple surveillance data streams. Our model uses both COVID-19 incidence and mortality time series to estimate our model parameters. Importantly, our data generating model for incidence data takes into account changes in the total number of tests performed. We apply our Bayesian data integration method to COVID-19 surveillance data collected in Orange County, California. Our results suggest that California Department of Public Health stay-at-home order, issued on March 19, 2020, lowered the SARS-CoV-2 effective reproductive number $R_{e}$ in Orange County below 1.0, which means that the order was successful in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections.

It is highly contagious with variable clinical manifestations. The majority of infections are subclinical, but can still significantly influence biological responses, thus interfering with research, mainly in the field of immunology. MHV has been intensively studied from a number of research perspectives and has become the prototype for studying the molecular biology of coronaviruses. MHV contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ranging from 27 to 31 kb, which is divided into seven genes. Virions consist of four to five structural proteins. There are many MHV strains that vary in virulence, organotropism and cell tropism, and are constantly evolving by naturally occurring mutation and recombination. Based on pathogenesis studies MHV strains are usually grouped according to their primary tissue tropism into two biotypes: polytropic and enterotropic. Enterotropic strains of MHV replicate in the intestinal mucosa and only rarely spread to other tissues. No morphological structure of the virion has as yet been identified that is responsible for enterotropism. The course of an MHV infection is dependent on the virus strain and host factors. Generally, MHV causes an acute, self-limiting infection which is inapparent in adult mice. Neonates are highly susceptible to disease and show high mortality. In an enzootically infected colony, however, they are protected by maternally derived passive immunity. Detection of MHV infections depends on serological screening of colonies. MHV is controlled by culling and rederivation of the affected colony using hysterectomy or embryo transfer or by elimination through cessation of breeding.","output":"Enterotropic mouse hepatitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new series of acridine based imidazolium salts was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines by an MTT assay.

This paper aims to provide design recommendations for online collaborative project-based learning exercises based on this research in a software engineering course at the university level. Design/methodology/approach: Through joint work between learning scientists, course instructors and software engineering practitioners, instructional design best practices of alignment between the context of the learners, the learning objectives, the task and the assessment are actualized in the design of collaborative programming projects for supporting learning. The design, first segments a short real-time collaborative exercise into tasks, each with a problem-solving phase where students participate in collaborative programming, and a reflection phase for reflecting on what they learned in the task. Within these phases, a role-assignment paradigm scaffolds collaboration by assigning groups of four students to four complementary roles that rotate after each task. Findings: By aligning each task with granular learning objectives, significant pre- to post-test learning from the exercise as well as each task is observed. Originality/value: The roles used in the paradigm discourage divide-and-conquer tendencies often associated with collaborative projects. By requiring students to discuss conflicting ideas to arrive at a consensus implementation, their ideas are made explicit, thus providing opportunities for clarifying misconceptions through discussion and learning from the collaboration.","output":"Designing for learning during collaborative projects online: tools and takeaways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has increased over the past two decades.

FI is typically associated with cheaper and calorie\\\\dense foods because of the high cost of quality food and financial constraints that hinder food\\\\insecure people from adopting healthier dietary choices. As a result, they have started eating low\\\\quality food such as simple carbohydrates, fats, and processed foods. These poor eating habits can reduce microbial diversity and influence changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. This review also explores the impact of ethnicity on the variation in composition of gut microbiota. In conclusion, the findings of this review may be utilized to develop and implement diet\\\\related intervention programs to ensure that Malaysians get enough nutritious food to maintain a healthy gut microbiota and improve overall health.","output":"Implication of food insecurity on the gut microbiota and its potential relevance to a multi\\\\ethnic population in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"WHO declared Covid 19 /SARS-COV-2 as a global pandemic Till date, there is no medicine for COVID-19 If the Infection arises in the body then the defence mechanism activated against infection A recent study suggests that temporar-ily augmenting the bodys immune system in the early stages of COVID-19 can help patient to avoid severe symptoms as it is rightly said prevention is better than cure Ayurveda approaches to develop physiological reactions to facili-tate immunity Planning of diet is most important to boost immunity As per many researches to provide supplementary food which contains Zinc, Vitamin C,Vitamin D and immunity boosting foodsuch as citrus natural products, custard apple, apple, papaya is among the Fruits Vegetables include broc-coli, onion, garlic and green leafy vegetables Nuts, ginger, turmeric, pep-per, egg yolk, shellfish, mushroom The need of the hour is a quick boost to immune system to keep it fit, fighting One should get the right amount of nutrients from the diet, supplementation regimen to boost immune system In this review, there are few common supplements and super food studies have been included It might be a torch bearer as sample menu and their alterna-tives are given for a normal adult Needy may change contemplated according to age, sex, body mass index and daily physical activities","output":"Immunity boosting diet during COVID 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The association between hope and depression has been studied, leaving the underlying mechanism of how hope might predict depression unexplored. With a cross-sectional design, this study investigated two possible mediating factors in the relationship between hope and depression among Chinese shadow education tutors, who confront a high turnover rate and are at high risk for depression. Altogether, 221 tutors participated in the survey, and reported their dispositional hope, perceived social support (PSS), perceived stress (PS), and depression. Results indicated that both PSS and PS mediated the relationship between hope and depression. Results also supported the hypothesized serial mediating effect. In other words, hope as a positive disposition may promote PSS, which can mitigate PS. The reduced PS, in turn, alleviates depression. This finding not only shed light on the independent and accumulative mediating effects of PSS and PS, but also has implications for preventive interventions among Chinese shadow education tutors experiencing the enormous pressure of instability.

This has resulted in notions that vulnerabilities among smallholders in Africa are the outcomes of inadequate adoption of improved seeds. What these perspectives have neglected is: How politics mediate access to seeds? and Whether and how politics influence farmers' perception of seed security? This study draws upon a case study of Northern Ghanaian Savannahs to examine politics and seed security among smallholders. The logistic analysis shows that the presence of recurring conflicts significantly determines how farmers perceived vulnerability to seed insecurity. Thus, farmers from relatively peaceful villages were 4.705 times more likely to rate themselves as not vulnerable to seed insecurity compared to their counterparts experiencing recurring conflicts. Analysis further shows that smallholder vulnerabilities to seed insecurity are constructed at the intersection of historical ethnic conflicts and neoliberal policies in ways that contest the dominant narratives. Key for achieving seed security is a better understanding of how local and macro politics influence perceptions and mediate access to healthy and desirable seeds.","output":"The political ecology of seed security in the Northern Ghanaian Savannahs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges for timely outcome assessment in randomized clinical trials (RCT). Our aim was to describe our remote neurocognitive testing (NCT) protocol administered by telephone in patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: We studied PD patients with OSA and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score  27 participating in a RCT assessing OSA treatment impact on cognition. Trial outcomes included change in MoCA and specific cognitive domains from baseline to 3 and 6 months. With COVID19 pandemic-related restrictions, 3-month visits were converted from in-person to telephone administration with materials mailed to participants for compatible tests and retrieved by courier the same day. In exploratory analyses, we compared baseline vs. 3-month results in the control arm, which were not expected to change significantly (test-re-test), using a paired t-test and assessed agreement with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Seven participants were approached and agreed to remote NCT at 3-month follow-up. Compared to the in-person NCT control arm group, they were younger (60.6 versus 70.6 years) and had a shorter disease course (3.9 versus 9.2 years). Remote NCT data were complete. The mean test-retest difference in MoCA was similar for in-person and remote NCT control-arm groups (between group difference ? 0.69; 95%CI ? 3.67, 2.29). Agreement was good for MOCA and varied for specific neurocognitive tests. CONCLUSION: Telephone administration of the MoCA and a modified neurocognitive battery is feasible in patients with PD and OSA. Further validation will require a larger sample size.

It documents, more specifically, how shops tried to maintain, re-establish, or even re-invent communication with their customers during this two-month period. Based on pictures of shop windows in a Flemish city, we analyze the (semi-)commercial messages that appeared in this setting during this period. This analysis adopts an interdisciplinary perspective, in which a cognitive linguistic approach is integrated with analyses and practical advices by marketing agencies. Despite their orientation towards distinct, theoretical and practical goals, both approaches share an analytical interest in mapping participants and their mutual relationship as part of a communicative interaction. In the period of economic lockdown, marketers urged shop owners to humanize their business strategy by downplaying content-related issues in favor of maximal social outreach towards customers. Con-sidering this advice, it was hypothesized that under these circumstances participants in commercial transactions would be construed much more prominently, presenting themselves and each other as unprecedented empathetic business personas. Much of our data comply with this expectation, thus providing empirical evidence of a subjectified communicative ground, in which both buyer and seller personas figure with augmented prominence as parts of the object of conceptualization. Messages include, among other things, expressions of empathy, solidarity, combativity, but also creativity and humor thus incorporating a new type of humanized business communication.

During periods of lockdown few weddings could take place, and even afterwards restrictions on how they could be celebrated remained. To investigate the impact of such restrictions, we carried out a survey of those whose plans to marry in England and Wales had been affected by Covid-19. The 1,449 responses we received illustrated that the ease and speed with which couples had been able to marry, and sometimes whether they had been able to marry at all, had depended not merely on the national restrictions in place but on their chosen route into marriage. This highlights the complexity and antiquity of marriage law and reinforces the need for reform. The restrictions on weddings taking place also revealed the extent to which couples valued getting married as opposed to having a wedding. Understanding both the social and the legal dimension of weddings is important in informing recommendations as to how the law should be changed in the future, not merely to deal with similar crises but also to ensure that the general law is fit for purpose in the twenty-first century.","output":"Love in the time of Covid-19: a case-study of the complex laws governing weddings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Particle dispersion and deposition in man-made enclosed environments are closely related to the well-being of occupants. The present study developed a three-dimensional drift-flux model for particle movements in turbulent indoor airflows, and combined it into Eulerian approaches. To account for the process of particle deposition at solid boundaries, a semi-empirical deposition model was adopted in which the size-dependent deposition characteristics were well resolved. After validation against the experimental data in a scaled isothermal chamber and in a full-scale non-isothermal environmental chamber, the drift-flux model was used to investigate the deposition rates and human exposures to particles from two different sources with three typical ventilation systems: mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD). For particles originating from the supply air, a V-shaped curve of the deposition velocity variation as a function of particle size was observed. The minimum deposition appeared at 0.1C 0.5  m . For supermicron particles, the ventilation type and air exchange rate had an ignorable effect on the deposition rate. The movements of submicron particles were like tracer gases while the gravitational settling effect should be taken into account for particles larger than 2.5  m . The temporal increment of human exposure to a step-up particle release in the supply air was determined, among many factors, by the distance between the occupant and air outlet. The larger the particle size, the lower the human exposure. For particles released from an internal heat source, the concentration stratification of small particles (diameter < 10  m ) in the vertical direction appeared with DV and UFAD, and it was found the advantageous principle for gaseous pollutants that a relatively less-polluted occupied zone existed in DV and UFAD was also applicable to small particles.","output":"Modeling particle dispersion and deposition in indoor environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is limited and controverting evidence looking at possible associations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA copies and patient variables in large cohorts of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. METHODS: We studied 2275 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Colombia with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and analyzed the associations between RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value with gender, age, comorbidities, symptomatology, and disease severity. RESULTS: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008). An inverse association was found between RNA copy number and markers of disease severity, namely, respiratory distress (P < 0.0001) and hospitalization requirement (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle thresholds reveal strong associations with a prior medical history, specific symptomatology, and disease severity markers.

INTRODUCTION: During the health emergency in 2020, in order not to interrupt production processes and at the same time to protect the health of citizens and workers, alternative working methods were adopted different from the traditional ones, to which workers were directed without any previous notice or specific training. AIMS: The purpose of the research is to explore the relationships between meaning of work, job crafting and emotional exhaustion during the first month of lockdown in the Italian territory. The study therefore aims to identify possible strengthening factors related to working well-being. METHODS: The different constructs were detected through an online questionnaire from 11 March to 2 April 2020, involving 405 subjects. After verifying the reliability of the constructs, a mediation model was performed using nonparametric structural equations (PLS-SEM). RESULTS: Models constructs show adequate reliabilities.

We show that the resulting C24 LNP has a multistage protonation behavior resulting in greater endosomal protonation and greater translation of an mRNA-encoded luciferase reporter after intramuscular (IM) administration compared to the standard reference MC3 LNP. Off-target expression in liver after IM administration was reduced 6 fold for the C24 LNP compared to MC3. Neutralizing titers in immunogenicity studies delivering a nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding for the diproline stabilized spike protein immunogen were 10 fold higher for the C24 LNP versus MC3, and protection against viral challenge in a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model occurred at a very low 0.25 g prime/boost dose of the same immunogen in the C24 LNP.

In addition, we found the C24 LNP to be entirely stable in bioactivity and mRNA integrity when stored at 4 oC for at least 19 days. Storage at higher temperatures reduced both bioactivity and mRNA integrity, but less so for C24 than MC3, and in a manner consistent with the phosphodiester transesterification reaction mechanism of mRNA cleavage.

The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence successful neonatal resuscitation to inform clinical practice and reduce the incidence of very early neonatal death (death within 24 h of delivery). METHODS: This was a qualitative narrative inquiry study utilizing the 32 consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ). Audio-recorded, semistructured, individual interviews with midwives were conducted. Thematic analysis was applied to identify themes. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of the midwives responses revealed three factors that influence successful resuscitation: 1. Hands-on training (HOT) with clinical support during live emergency neonatal resuscitation events, which decreases fear and enables the transfer of clinical skills; 2. Unequivocal commitment to the Golden Minute? and the mindset of the midwife; and. 3. Strategies that reduce barriers. Immediately after birth, live resuscitation can commence at the mothers bedside, with actively guided clinical instruction. Confidence and mastery of resuscitation competencies are reinforced as the physiological changes in neonates are immediately visible with bag and mask ventilation. The proclivity to perform suction initially delays ventilation, and suction is rarely clinically indicated. Keeping skilled midwives in labor wards is important and impacts clinical practice. The midwives interviewed articulated a mindset of unequivocal commitment to the baby for one Golden Minute?. Heavy workload, frequent staff rotation and lack of clean working equipment were other barriers identified that are worthy of future research. CONCLUSIONS: Training in resuscitation skills in a simulated environment alone is not enough to change clinical practice. Active guidance of HOT real-life emergency resuscitation events builds confidence, as the visible signs of successful resuscitation impact the midwifes beliefs and behaviors. Furthermore, a focused commitment by midwives working together to reduce birth asphyxia-related deaths builds hope and collective self-efficacy.

Their decision-making process and the factors associated with it, are of utmost importance in preserving and supporting their own health and their patient's health. AIMS: Tto explore the factors associated with physicians' decision-making during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel METHODS: Cross- sectional data were collected among 200 physicians at the Israeli health care system between March and May 2020 via an online questionnaire. A multiple hierarchical regression was calculated to assess the contribution of the study variables to the physicians' decision making. RESULTS: Most physicians reported that they complied with hygiene guidelines at work, issued by the Israeli ministry of health (MOH), fully (42%) or very often (31%), and with the MOH COVID-19 behavior guidelines fully (27%), very often (34%), or in general (23%). According to the study RESULTS: trust, positive emotions, perception of COVID-19 threat, and risk perceptions were found significant and positive. In other words, higher trust, more positive emotions, and perceptions of greater threat and risk, were associated with higher compliance with the MOH guidelines and more cautious decision making. CONCLUSIONS: While threat and risk perceptions may be inevitable during the pandemic, trust and positive emotions may act as protective factors, encouraging cautious decision making among physicians. KEY MESSAGES: Physicians' decision making is a complex process affected by their perceptions, emotions, and trust levels. High levels of trust and positive emotions may facilitate carful decision making.","output":"Factors associated with physicians' decision making during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: First dedicated articles about placebo effects have been published in the 1940s, and more than 5,000 articles have been published in scientific organs since. However, the evolution of this research field has rarely been examined. By means of bibliometric analyses we aim to generate research metrics such as the number and types of publications as well as topics, authorship networks, impacts, and future directions. METHODS: Bibliometric methods were applied to the Journal of Interdisciplinary Placebo Studies (JIPS) database. It comprises around 5,000 scientific articles dedicated to researching placebo effects and mechanisms and is expanded continually through individual curation, making it a prime candidate for investigation. Web scraping was used to obtain complete article information from PubMed and Web of Science. The same information was obtained for addiction research as reference field. Analyses include a general characterization of the database as well as focus points concerning publication types (data vs. non-data articles), high-impact publications and more. RESULTS: Analyses show that the JIPS database is a comprehensive collection of placebo publications. The development of the field is comparable to that of the comparator field and scientific publication in general. The most frequently used keywords describe populations or study design topics; the most frequent symptoms were pain, depression and anxiety. Data and non-data (e.g., review) papers are related in proportion of about 6:4 in recent decades, indicating a stable degree of productivity. A network of 26 interconnected researchers was identified who published 25 or more articles. Placebo research contributes comparable numbers of publications to high-impact journals as the comparator field. Several additional analyses are performed, with a focus on visualization of various database parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Bibliometric analyses of the JIPS database can be used to answer questions to the field, for example, to get an impression of blind spots and future directions. However, keywords used in indexing and publications themselves are often general and suggest that placebo research may still be considered a subspecialty of superordinate fields, particularly since there are no journals dedicated to placebo research itself. We invite interested colleagues to use this database for further analyses.","output":"Bibliometric Properties of Placebo Literature From the JIPS Database: A Descriptive Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mental illness is common, and its severity ranges from subclinical to severe, where the condition affects daily social and academic functioning.

Audiometric evaluation revealed normal threshold through 8000 Hz, with mild hearing loss at 16,000 Hz. Conservative measures including masking strategies failed to mitigate symptoms. A trial of gabapentin 300 mg twice per day improved tinnitus with no notable side effects. CONCLUSION: This patient may represent a subpopulation of patients who suffer from severe tinnitus following COVID-19 infection in the setting of largely normal hearing.

Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes and heightened resistance to the unrelated Zika and Dengue viruses.

Although progression from mild to severe COVID-19 has been associated with hypoxia, uncontrolled inflammation and coagulopathy, the mechanisms involved in progression to severity are poorly understood. By analyzing the virome from tracheal aspirates (TA) of 25 COVID-19 patients under IMV, we found higher levels and differential expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) genes compared to nasopharyngeal swabs from mild cases and TA from non-COVID patients. Proteomic analysis and RT-PCR confirmed the presence of HERV-K in these patients. Moreover, increased HERV-K expression was triggered in human primary monocytes from healthy donors after experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In critically ill patients, higher HERV-K levels were associated with early mortality (within 14 days) in the intensive care unit.

COVID-19 has high mortality in older people. This study aimed at evaluating the relationship of pre-infection AF with characteristics and survival of older COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed inpatients aged  60 years enrolled in GeroCovid Observational, a multicenter registry endorsed by the Italian and the Norwegian Societies of Gerontology and Geriatrics. Pre-COVID-19 sociodemographic, functional, and medical data were systematically collected, as well as in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Between March and June 2020, 808 COVID-19 subjects were enrolled (age 79  9 years; men 51.7%). The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. AF patients were older (82  8 vs. 77  9 years, p < 0.001), had a higher CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score (4.1  1.5 vs. 3.2  1.5, p < 0.001) and were more likely to present almost all comorbidities. At multivariable analysis, advanced age, white blood cell count, the presence of heart and peripheral artery diseases were significantly associated with the presence of AF. In-hospital mortality was higher in AF patients (36.9 vs. 27.5%; OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.09C2.20; p = 0.015). A decision tree analysis showed that, in AF subjects, preserved functional status at admission was the most important factor associated with survival. In patients without AF, baseline COVID-19 severity was the most relevant variable related to clinical prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: AF is frequent in older patients with COVID-19, in whom it associates with clinical complexity and high mortality.

Extensive studies suggest that the UPR can also be activated during virus infection. In the present studies, we first evaluated if porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection activated the UPR pathways. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated the morphology changes of ER post-PEDV infection. Western blot and real-time PCR identified the differences of UPR genes in response to PEDV infection. The results suggested that PEDV infection induced UPR in Vero cells. Meanwhile, we silenced the expression of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) by shRNA, we found that the knockdown of PERK increased virus loads in the cells, which was consistent with the result on 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) treatment. We next determined whether 2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), an ER stress inducer, possessed antiviral activity against PEDV infection. Plaque formation assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis suggested that 2-DG might inhibit virus infection by affecting viral protein translation during the early stage of virus infection. Interestingly, we also found that 2-DG treatment could affect virus assembly, which is similar to previous studies on influenza virus. All these results support the therapeutic potential of using 2-DG or glucose/mannose analogs to induce the UPR to block virus replication.","output":"Triggering unfolded protein response by 2-Deoxy-d-glucose inhibits porcine epidemic diarrhea virus propagation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Elite professional football players and staff are a unique group that might give insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany and thus can serve as a model for a geographical distribution and an estimation of undetected infections. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study seroprevalence was determined twice in May and June 2020 in players and staff from German Bundesliga. As screening assays a commercial ELISA (Euroimmun) and a CLIA (Roche) was used and an in-house neutralisation assay (NT) as gold standard. Participants were tested twice weekly using PCR from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Seroprevalence (NT used as confirmation) in 2,164 samples from 1,184 players and staff was rather similar in May (23/1157 (1.99%)) and in June (21/1007 (2.09%)). All participants were PCR negative during the study period. Significant regional differences in seroprevalence were not observed. When comparing seroprevalence with the cumulative incidence of infections derived from the German notification system (subgroup matching to cohort; men, age: 20-69), IgG was found 8-10 times more frequently, pointing to a high rate of undetected infections. ELISA and CLIA correlated only moderately (Kappa 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence with high quality diagnostic in Germany seemed to be around 2%. The number of undetected infections seems to be 8-10 times higher than notification data. Quality of antibody assays is rather variable, thus results should ideally be confirmed at least by a second assay to prove IgG positivity.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in a large prospective cohort study of elite football players in Germany (May-June 2020): implications for a testing protocol in asymptomatic individuals and estimation of the rate of undetected cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an uncommon vascular disease that results in stenosis, dissection or aneurysmal degeneration.

The physical examination showed blood pressure levels of 160/90 mmHg. An abdominopelvic CT evidenced left retroperitoneal haematoma associated with active bleeding and left renal artery stenosis. Given these findings, it was decided to perform an endovascular treatment. Significant stenosis was seen during the arteriography in both renal arteries, suggesting fibromuscular dysplasia and development of a collateral neovascular network responsible for the retroperitoneal haematoma. It was embolised in association with angioplasty of the left renal artery. The patient had a favourable outcome; however, high blood pressure levels persisted. A new bilateral renal angioplasty was performed, which returned blood pressure values to normal. The patient was discharged without needing antihypertensives.

The gravity of the situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a protective range, multifunctional CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. These results are highly encouraging and support further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.

Significance Statement The COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, yet. Therefore, effective vaccine concepts are urgently needed. In search for such a concept, we have analysed a measles virus-based vaccine candidate targeting SARS-CoV-2. Using this well known, safe vaccine backbone, we demonstrate here induction of functional immune responses in both arms of adaptive immunity with the desired immune bias. Therefore, occurrence of immunopathologies such as antibody-dependent enhancement or enhanced respiratory disease is rather unlikely. Moreover, the candidate still induces immunity against the measles, recognized as a looming second menace, when countries are entrapped to stop routine vaccination campaigns in the face of COVID-19. Thus, a bivalent measles-based COVID-19 vaccine could be the solution for two significant public health threats.","output":"A Highly Immunogenic Measles Virus-based Th1-biased COVID-19 Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Parents of children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) often struggle with the all\\\\consuming nature of the demands of caring for a child with substantial physical needs.

Except for vitamin A and Zn, serum levels of other micronutrients were lower than minimum normal. Patients with APACHE score  25 had higher BMI (p= 0.044), body temperature (0.003), ESR (0.008), CRP (0.003), and had lower O(2) saturation (0.005), serum levels of vitamin D (< 0.001) and Zn (< 0.001), compared to patients with APACHE score < 25. We found that the lower serum levels of vitamin D, Mg, and Zn were significantly and independently associated with higher APACHE scores (p= 0.001, 0.028, and < 0.001, respectively) and higher lung involvement (p= 0.002, 0.045, and < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Lower serum levels of vitamin D, Zn, and Mg were involved in severe COVID-19.","output":"The association between serum levels of micronutrients and the severity of disease in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the midst of this pandemic, most Christian Churches in the United States have been required to limit severely if not suspend face-to-face worship. The responses to this challenge when it comes to celebrating the Eucharist have been multiple. Frequent pastoral responses have included the shipping of consecrated elements to folk for their use during live-stream worship and virtual communion, in which worshippers employ elements from their own households as communion elements during the digitized worship. These options are not permitted for Roman Catholics. Instead, it is most common for Roman Catholics to be invited into spiritual communion. This is often considered a diminished, even ternary form of communing, quickly dispensed when quarantines are lifted and herd immunity achieved. On the other hand, there is a rich and thoughtful tradition about spiritual communion that recognizes it as an essential element in communion even when such is experienced face-to-face. This article intends to affirm the values of spiritual communion as a real, mystical and fruitful action that not only sustains people worshipping from afar, but enhances an authentic eucharistic spirituality.","output":"Spiritual Communion in a Digital Age: A Roman Catholic Dilemma and Tradition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"1.

It overloads the healthcare system, causes deaths, and angers some at anti-covid restrictions. This study examines the feasibility of using technical and technological ideas to overcome these effects. The solution is based on new knowledge about the virus, its nature, formation, and activation in the environment. Background The rapid spread of a new coronavirus infection is taking place against the background of a lack of time required to create new treatment scenarios for the disease, development, production, and vaccine safety research. In such a situation, it became necessary to gain this time for organizing and conducting events that could reduce the burden on the healthcare system. Methodology The science that studies the morphology, physiology, genetics, ecology, and evolution of viruses is virology. The modern development of virology is moving towards a more accurate and comprehensive description of the mechanisms of interaction of viruses with the host organism. This contributed to the emergence of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and immunomics. However, in virology, there is no particular discipline that sets itself three fundamental goals: to substantiate a single concept of the emergence of viruses;to study the natural mechanisms of formation of virus molecules in the environment;to describe the natural mechanisms of activation of certain viruses in the environment that cause viral pandemics. As a result, there are many articles among the published scientific articles on viruses dealing with the mechanisms of interaction of viruses with the host organism. However, there are no articles on the natural mechanisms of formation and activation of certain viruses in the environment. In the absence of such specialized articles, we were forced to use the method of systems transdisciplinary generalization of disciplinary knowledge to achieve our articles purpose. Generalization created new knowledge about the nature of viruses, about the mechanisms of their formation and activation in the environment and cells of biological organisms. It is logical to assume that to synchronize the state of biological objects of all functional ensembles on the planet, it is necessary to create and activate appropriate technological tools. We have suggested and proved that RNA viruses play the role of such tools. Piezoelectricity activates viruses. It occurs during the compression and stretching of sedimentary rocks and bases of continental plates in different territories. Contribution The systems transdisciplinary generalization of the knowledge of scientific disciplines made it possible to edit the concept of viruses, to eliminate stereotypes that arose due to the use of unsuccessful analogies. As a result of this generalization, it was possible to prove that viruses are not intracellular parasites. The virus is a technological tool of the planetary organizing component. This tool aims to correct the genetic programs of organisms of all functional ensembles (plants, animals, people), which will maintain the state of organisms and the parameters of their metabolism in changing environmental conditions. Findings The viruses that triggered pandemics in the 20th century and early 21st century are RNA viruses. RNA molecules play the role of technological tools that the planetary organizing component uses to carry out short-term and long-term adjustments and constant support of the genetic programs of biological organisms. Therefore, in such a situation, it is advisable to talk not about the fight against the virus but only about eliminating the negative manifestations of the Covid-19 pandemic: reducing the number of people in need of emergency hos-pitalization, eliminating cases of the acute course of the disease and deaths. It is proposed to use certain technical and technological ideas and solutions to eliminate these negative manifestations. Recommendations for Practitioners Some scientists claim that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus ill be active for a long time. In such circumstances, it is essential to ensure the safety of medical workers who work in covid hospitals, and every day they risk getting sick and dying. Therefore, the proposed technical and technological ideas and solutions can be used, among other things, to solve this problem. Recommendations for Researchers This paper recommends that researchers use new interdisciplinary and transdis ciplinary approaches. They challenge assumptions and conclusions about the nature of viruses, and the mechanisms of their formation and activation in the environment can initiate. Such new research might describe the mechanisms that form and activate viruses in the environment and the bodys cells. They also might provide practical use of this knowledge to eliminate the multiple speculations and fears that arise against the background of reports of the likely appearance of more deadly viruses and viral infections. Impact on Society Viral pandemics negatively affect societys quality of life: economic ties and the established way of life are disrupted. The proposed technical and technological solutions will significantly reduce this influence and eliminate societys discontent by those annoyed with the periodically introduced anti-covid restrictions. Future Research The results of a systems transdisciplinary generalization of disciplinary knowledge about the nature and purpose of viruses are essential for expanding the horizon of the scientific worldview. Future fundamental research on the mechanisms of objective organizing constituents, a general description given in this article, will contribute to a deeper understanding of chemical and biological evolution mechanisms in which modern humanity is involved. In due time, such an understanding will allow a new look at the existing scenarios of the world socio-economic order, explore and describe new principles of sustainable development of society. ? 2022.

Core fucosylation, which is catalyzed by 1,6-fucosyltransferase (Fut8) in mammals, may play a crucial role in PF development. This study aims to assess the effects of inhibiting core fucosylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor on PF rats. METHODS: PF rats (established by 4.25% glucose dialysate) were treated with either an adenovirus-Fut8 short hairpin RNA (Fut8shRNA) or adenovirus-control. Massons staining and net ultrafiltration were performed at week six. Fut8 level and core fucosylation of EGF receptor and collagen I in the peritoneal membrane were assessed, and EGF signaling was detected, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) and their phosphorylation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in peritoneal effluent was examined. RESULTS: Fut8 was upregulated in PF rats but decreased after Fut8shRNA treatment. EGF and EGF receptor expression was upregulated in PF rats, while core fucosylation of EGF receptor decreased after Fut8shRNA treatment. Massons staining results showed an increase in peritoneal thickness in PF rats but a decrease after Fut8shRNA treatment. Fut8shRNA treatment increased net ultrafiltration, reduced the expression of collagen I and MCP-1 compared to PF rats. Fut8shRNA treatment suppressed phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-B in the peritoneal membrane of PF rats. CONCLUSIONS: Fut8shRNA treatment ameliorated the fibrotic changes in PF rats. A potential mechanism may be that Fut8shRNA treatment inactivated EGF signaling pathway by suppressing the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-B.","output":"Blocking core fucosylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor prevents peritoneal fibrosis progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is responsible for over 24 million infections and 800,000 deaths since its emergence in December 2019 There are few therapeutic options and no approved vaccines Here we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a mouse adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA) In vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo activity, and some hu-mAbs were more potent in combination in vivo Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors is essential for optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA The data indicate that hu-mAb protective activity is dependent on intact effector function and that in vivo testing is required to establish optimal hu-mAb combinations for COVID-19 prevention","output":"Antibody potency, effector function and combinations in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiac rehabilitation improves the outcomes of individuals following a cardiac event;however, only 50% of those eligible for cardiac rehabilitation in the UK sign up to a traditional face-to-face programme.

METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through electronic explorations of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Besides, three Chinese databases were searched. A snowballing method searching the bibliographies of the retrieved references was applied to identify potentially relevant articles. Articles published within 1 year prior to April 20th, 2020, were screened with no language restriction imposed. Databases were searched for terms related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and neurological manifestations, using a pre-established protocol registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews database (ID: CRD42020187994). RESULTS: A total of 2441 articles were screened for relevant content, of which 92 full-text publications were included in the analyses of neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Headache, dizziness, taste and smell dysfunctions, and impaired consciousness were the most frequently described neurological symptoms, the latter more often among patients with a severe or critical disease course. To date, only smaller cohort studies or single cases have reported cerebrovascular events, seizures, meningoencephalitis, and immune-mediated neurological diseases, not suitable for quantitative analysis. CONCLUSION: The most frequent neurological symptoms reported in association with COVID-19 are non-specific for the infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to gain direct access to the nervous system, so far, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid in two cases only.

The ease of peptide chemical synthesis combined with emerging engineering principles and potent broad-spectrum activity, including against multidrug-resistant strains, has motivated intense scientific focus on these compounds for the past decade. This global effort has resulted in significant advances in our understanding of peptide antimicrobial activity at the molecular scale. Recent evidence of molecular targets other than the microbial lipid membrane, and efforts towards consensus antimicrobial peptide motifs, have supported the rise of molecular engineering approaches and design tools, including machine learning.

Although the peak sensitivity of RT-PCR can be high, the probability of detecting an infection will vary throughout the course of an infection. The effectiveness of routine asymptomatic testing will therefore depend on testing frequency and how PCR detection varies over time. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian statistical model to a dataset of twice weekly PCR tests of UK healthcare workers performed by self-administered nasopharyngeal swab, regardless of symptoms. We jointly estimated times of infection and the probability of a positive PCR test over time following infection; we then compared asymptomatic testing strategies by calculating the probability that a symptomatic infection is detected before symptom onset and the probability that an asymptomatic infection is detected within 7 days of infection. RESULTS: We estimated that the probability that the PCR test detected infection peaked at 77% (54C88%) 4 days after infection, decreasing to 50% (38C65%) by 10 days after infection. Our results suggest a substantially higher probability of detecting infections 1C3 days after infection than previously published estimates. We estimated that testing every other day would detect 57% (33C76%) of symptomatic cases prior to onset and 94% (75C99%) of asymptomatic cases within 7 days if test results were returned within a day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine asymptomatic testing can enable detection of a high proportion of infected individuals early in their infection, provided that the testing is frequent and the time from testing to notification of results is sufficiently fast.

Patients and Methods This study was conducted with orthopaedic trauma patients in a level 1 trauma center. A convergent mixed-methods design was used. Data on pain experience, pain management strategies used and AEs were collected with self-administered questionnaires at hospital discharge (T1) and at 3 months after injury (T2). Patients' preferences about the pain management strategies used, the required support and AEs were further examined through semi-structured individual interviews at the same time measures. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses were performed. Results Seventy-one patients were recruited and 30 individual interviews were undertaken. Pharmacological pain management strategies used at T1 and T2 were mainly opioids (95.8%; 20.8%) and acetaminophen (91.5%; 37.5%). The most frequently applied non-pharmacological strategies were sleep (95.6%) and physical positioning (89.7%) at T1 and massage (46.3%) and relaxation (32.5%) at T2. Findings from quantitative and qualitative analyses highlighted that non-pharmacological strategies, such as comfort, massage, distraction, and physical therapy, were perceived as the most effective by participants. Most common AEs related to opioids were dry mouth (78.8%) and fatigue (66.1%) at T1 and insomnia (30.0%) and fatigue (20.0%) at T2. Dry mouth (28.6%) and drowsiness (14.3%) were the most reported AEs by patients using recreational cannabis. An important need for information at hospital discharge and for a personalized follow-up was identified by participants during interviews. Conclusion Despite its AEs, we found that opioids are still the leading pain management strategy after an orthopaedic trauma and that more efforts are needed to implement non-pharmacological strategies. Cannabis was taken for recreational purposes but patients also used it for pain relief. Support from health professionals is needed to promote the adequate use of these strategies.","output":"Pain Management Strategies After Orthopaedic Trauma: A Mixed-Methods Study with a View to Optimizing Practices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book offers a comprehensive critique of how the assessment industry and standardized testing adversely impact students, teachers, and society.

The emergence of novel PEDV strains in recent years has decreased the effectiveness of PEDV vaccines. We have developed a live recombinant vaccine, a swinepox virus vector that expresses a truncated S protein (rSPV-St) from a recent PEDV strain, SQ2014, and evaluated its immunogenicity and effectiveness in a swine model. Vaccination of swine with rSPV-St elicited a robust antibody response specific for the homologous PEDV SQ2014. Serum IgA titers in rSPV-St-vaccinated animals were significantly higher than in those immunized with inactivated vaccines. The effectiveness of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine in protection against PEDV was tested in a passive-transfer model in which piglets were challenged with the homologous virus SQ2014 and the heterologous strain CV777. When challenged with the homologous virus, sera from rSPV-St vaccination provided complete protection. However, sera from rSPV-St vaccination did not provide any protection against the heterologous virus challenge. Amino acid sequence differences in the S proteins of the two viruses were identified within neutralizing epitopes, which might have contributed to the divergent clinical results.

Although COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have proven to be highly effective against severe COVID-19 disease, the decrease in vaccine efficacy against emerged Beta and Delta variants emphasizes the need for constant monitoring of new virus lineages and studies on the persistence of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. To analyze the dynamics of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses, we followed 52 health care workers in Finland for 6 months after receiving two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine with a 3-week interval. We demonstrate that, although anti-S1 antibody levels decrease 2.3-fold compared to peak antibody levels, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist for months after BNT162b2 vaccination. Variants D614G, Alpha, and Eta are neutralized by sera of 100% of vaccinees, whereas neutralization of Delta is 3.8-fold reduced and neutralization of Beta is 5.8-fold reduced compared to D614G. Despite this reduction, 85% of sera collected 6 months postvaccination neutralizes Delta variant. IMPORTANCE A decrease in vaccine efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants has increased the importance of assessing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies.

However, little is known about the current information services provided by the websites of large Chinese hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the information services of the websites of large hospitals in China and the United States. We hope that our findings will benefit hospital managers worldwide in providing service information on the web. METHODS: This study adopted a cross-sectional analytical approach to evaluate the websites of large hospitals in China and the United States in 2020. A total of 300 large hospitals were randomly selected, of which half were in China and half were in the United States. Based on the 7Ps marketing mix, we identified 39 items that represent typical hospital website information services, covering the following seven dimensions: product, price, place, propagation, people, process, and physical evidence. RESULTS: Most of the items (34/39, 87%) related to information services offered by hospital websites were less covered in China than in the United States; however, 5 items (appointments by a third-party platform, mobile payment, hospital value, hospital environment display, and physicians profiles) had higher coverage in China. The average scores for hospital websites in China and the United States were 13.25 (SD 2.99) points and 23.16 (SD 2.76) points, respectively. Generally, high scores were given to the south areas of China and north areas of the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital websites in China lagged behind those in the United States with regard to information services offered. We recommend that hospital managers in China place more emphasis on the people, product, and propagation dimensions of the 7Ps marketing mix in the construction of information services on hospital websites. Through the comparison of the websites of large hospitals in China and the United States, our study findings can provide suggestions for forming standard hospital website construction guidelines worldwide.","output":"Comparison of User-Oriented Information Services on the Websites of Large Hospitals in China and the United States: Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: An at home\\\\test for differentiating between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss remains elusive.

In addition to facilitating fusion needed for viral entry, S can also drive cell-cell fusion, a pathogenic effect observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. While several studies have investigated S requirements involved in viral particle entry, examination of S stability and factors involved in S cell-cell fusion remain limited. A furin cleavage site at the border between the S1 and S2 subunits (S1/S2) has been identified, along with putative cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 cleavage sites within S2. We demonstrate that S must be processed at the S1/S2 border in order to mediate cell-cell fusion, and that mutations at potential cleavage sites within the S2 subunit alter S processing at the S1/S2 border, thus preventing cell-cell fusion. We also identify residues within the internal fusion peptide and the cytoplasmic tail that modulate S-mediated cell-cell fusion. Additionally, we examined S stability and protein cleavage kinetics in a variety of mammalian cell lines, including a bat cell line related to the likely reservoir species for SARS-CoV-2, and provide evidence that proteolytic processing alters the stability of the S trimer. This work therefore offers insight into S stability, proteolytic processing, and factors that mediate S cell-cell fusion, all of which help give a more comprehensive understanding of this high profile therapeutic target.","output":"Effect of clinical isolate or cleavage site mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on protein stability, cleavage, and cell-cell fusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the world of education is the implementation of online learning.

Depending on their activity and work environment, employees are required to wear community face coverings, cloth masks with a transparent windows, surgical masks, reusable masks, or respirators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency as source control of these masks, i.e., when worn to protect the environment from the spread of particles emitted by the wearer. An experimental test bench including a dummy head and a breathing simulator associated with a DEHS droplet generator emitting 1 or 3 m particles in the exhaled stream is used.

Three breathing rate conditions were studied: from rest to heavy breathing, with average rates of 13, 27, and 45 L/min. Source control efficiencies vary from one mask to another. Among community face coverings (seven models) the values ranged from 15.6 to 33.8% for a medium intensity breath. The efficiencies of surgical masks (three models) ranged from 17.4 to 28.3% for the same breathing cycle. The community face coverings and the disposable surgical masks present equivalent values of source control efficiency, respectively, 25.9 and 24.1% at 1 m and 31.5 and 23.2% at 3 m.

The statistical analysis of the data shows no effect of the breathing flow rate and an interaction effect between mask type and particle size. No differences in source control were found for the two particle sizes or the different experimental breathing rates for the respirators and the surgical masks. But the community face coverings and the cloth masks with transparent window present a source control efficiency which increases with the particle size. Varying levels of efficiency were measured with higher source control for respirators than for other types of masks. In the context of a respiratory protection programme, they can provide an effective barrier to the spread of the virus. But these results show also that no mask can stop all the particles emitted by its wearer. Regardless of the type of mask, other barrier measures (ventilation, social distancing, and hygiene) are then necessary.","output":"Efficiency of Community Face Coverings and Surgical Masks to Limit the Spread of Aerosol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many businesses around the World are adopting AI with the hope of increasing their top-line and bottom-line numbers.

Twenty-five patients completed the full course of radiographs in the hospital. The initial radiographic features and the distribution of parenchymal, mediastinal, and pleural abnormalities for each patient were evaluated. Follow-up radiographic findings were correlated with clinical outcomes for these patients. RESULTS Initial chest radiographs showed abnormalities in 23 (88%) of 26 subjects. Eighteen patients (69%) had air-space consolidation, two (8%) had ground-glass attenuation, one (4%) had nodules, and two (8%) had mixed consolidation and nodules. Four patients (15%) had pleural effusion. Younger patients and those with normal initial radiographic findings or unifocal lung lesions had better outcomes. CONCLUSION The initial predominant radiographic feature of SARS was air-space consolidation in the lateral and lower lung zones.

The model showed that, although no death of children would result from the reopening of the schools in the three cities analysed, the risk of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and secondary cases among teachers, school staff and relatives of the children is not negligible. Although the epidemic hit different regions with different intensities, our model shows that, for regions where the incidence profile is similar to the cities analysed, the risk of reopening of schools is still too high. This in spite of the fact that incidences in these cities were declining in the period of the time considered. Therefore, although we cannot extend the result to the entire country, the overall conclusion is valid for regions with a declining incidence and it is even more valid for regions where incidence is increasing. We assumed a very conservative level of infection transmissibility of children of just 10% as that of adults. In spite of the very low level of transmissibility is assumed, the number of secondary cases caused by infected children among teachers, school staff and relatives varied from 2 to 85. It is, therefore, too soon to have any degree of confidence that reopening of schools before the advent of a vaccine is the right decision to take.

Hypercoagulability, thrombosis and hyperinflammation occur in COVID-19 and may contribute to severe complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation may improve clinical outcomes through anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral mechanisms. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin prevents mechanical ventilation and/or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to usual care. METHODS: An international, open-label, adaptive randomized controlled trial. Using a Bayesian framework, the trial will declare results as soon as pre-specified posterior probabilities for superiority, futility, or harm are reached. The trial uses response-adaptive randomization to maximize the probability that patients will receive the more beneficial treatment approach, as treatment effect information accumulates within the trial. By leveraging a common data safety monitoring board and pooling data with a second similar international Bayesian adaptive trial (REMAP-COVID anticoagulation domain), treatment efficacy and safety will be evaluated as efficiently as possible. The primary outcome is an ordinal endpoint with three possible outcomes based on the worst status of each patient through day 30: no requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or death. CONCLUSION: Using an adaptive trial design, the Anti-Thrombotic Therapy To Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 trial will establish whether therapeutic anticoagulation can reduce mortality and/or avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

However, the assessment of dietary habits and their determinants is a complex issue that requires innovative approaches and tools, such as those based on the ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Here, we describe the first phases of the HEALTHY-UNICT project, which aimed to develop and validate a web-app for the EMA of dietary data among students from the University of Catania, Italy. The pilot study included 138 students (mean age 24 years, SD = 4.2;75.4% women), who used the web-app for a week before filling out a food frequency questionnaire with validation purposes. Dietary data obtained through the two tools showed moderate correlations, with the lowest value for butter and margarine and the highest for pizza (Spearmans correlation coefficients of 0.202 and 0.699, respectively). According to the cross-classification analysis, the percentage of students classified into the same quartile ranged from 36.9% for vegetable oil to 58.1% for pizza. In line with these findings, the weighted-kappa values ranged from 0.15 for vegetable oil to 0.67 for pizza, and most food categories showed values above 0.4.

We also investigate whether these reductions occurred everywhere in the US, and the local factors (geography, population density, and sources of emission) that drove them. Following state-level emergency declarations, we found evidence of a statistically significant decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) levels in 34 of the 36 states and in fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) levels in 16 of the 48 states that were investigated. The lockdown produced a decrease of up to 3.4 g/m(3) in PM(2.5) (observed in California) with range (? 2.3, 3.4) and up to 11.6 ppb in NO(2) (observed in Nevada) with range (? 0.6, 11.6).

These changes in PM(2.5) and NO(2) represent a substantial fraction of the annual mean National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 12 g/m(3) and 53 ppb, respectively. As expected, we also found evidence that states with a higher percentage of mobile source emissions (obtained from 2014) experienced a greater decline in NO(2) levels after the lockdown. Although the socioeconomic restrictions are not sustainable, our results provide a benchmark to estimate the extent of achievable air pollution reductions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey is to understand oncologists' awareness of and views on virtual management, challenges, and preferences, as well as their priorities regarding the prescribing of anticancer treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We created a self-administrated electronic survey about the virtual management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated its clinical sensibility and pilot tested the instrument. We surveyed practicing oncologists in Gulf and Arab countries using snowball sampling via emails and social media networks. Reminders were sent 1 and 2 weeks later using SurveyMonkey. RESULTS: We received 222 responses from validated oncologists from April 2-22, 2020. An awareness of virtual clinics, virtual multidisciplinary teams, and virtual prescriptions was reported by 182 (82%), 175 (79%), and 166 (75%) respondents, respectively. Reported challenges associated with virtual management were the lack of physical exam (n=134, 60%), patients' awareness and access (n=131, 59%), the lack of physical attendance of patients (n=93, 42%), information technology (IT) support (n=82, 37%), and the safety of virtual management (n=78, 35%). Overall, 111 (50%) and 107 (48%) oncologists did not prefer the virtual prescription of chemotherapy and novel immunotherapy, respectively. However, 188 (85%), 165 (74%), and 127 (57%) oncologists preferred the virtual prescription of hormonal therapy, bone modifying agents, and targeted therapy, respectively. In total, 184 (83%), 183 (83%), and 176 (80%) oncologists preferred to continue neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and perioperative treatments, respectively. Overall, 118 (53%) respondents preferred to continue first-line palliative treatment, in contrast to 68 (30%) and 47 (21%) respondents indicating a preference to interrupt second- and third-line palliative treatment, respectively. For administration of virtual prescriptions, all respondents preferred the oral route and 118 (53%) preferred the subcutaneous route. In contrast, 193 (87%) did not prefer the intravenous route for virtual prescriptions. Overall, 102 (46%) oncologists responded that they would \\"definitely\\" prefer to manage patients with cancer virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Oncologists have a high level of awareness of virtual management.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods Genome wide screening was used to establish intra-viral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-kappa-B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients.

This research proposes an improved STL-LSTM model (ISTL-LSTM), which combines seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on locally weighted regression (STL), multiple features, and three long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Specifically, the proposed ISTL-LSTM method consists of four procedures. Firstly, the original time series is decomposed into trend series, seasonality series, and residual series through implementing STL. Then, each sub-series is concatenated with new features. In addition, each fused sub-series is predicted by different LSTM models separately. Lastly, predicting values generated from LSTM models are combined in a final prediction value. In the case study, the prediction of daily bus passenger flow in Beijing during the pandemic is selected as the research object.

ES is a rare situation that represents up to 7% of AIHA and around 2% of ITP. When AIHA and ITP occurred concomitantly, the diagnosis procedure must rule out differential diagnoses such as thrombotic microangiopathies, anaemia due to bleedings complicating ITP, vitamin deficiencies, myelodysplastic syndromes, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, or specific conditions like HELLP when occurring during pregnancy.

Indeed, the association of ES with other diseases such as haematological malignancies, systemic lupus erythematosus, infections, or primary immune deficiencies can interfere with its management or alter its prognosis. Due to the rarity of the disease, the treatment of ES is mostly extrapolated from what is recommended for isolated AIC and mostly relies on corticosteroids, rituximab, splenectomy, and supportive therapies.

Out of the 725 women, 83% preferred self-sampling HPV testing over healthcare personnel sampling HPV testing and Pap test. Women with higher household income and full-time employment status were more likely to prefer self-sampling. Those who had not undergone Pap test also expressed preference for self-sampling HPV testing. Convenience and women's confidence in performing a vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing were the independent key factors that influenced the preference for self-sampling method. Vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing is highly acceptable among Malaysian women. It is the preferred choice as a primary cervical screening method and serves as an alternative to healthcare acquired sample for Pap test.","output":"The acceptability and preference of vaginal self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing among a multi-ethnic Asian female population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs among parents can reduce vaccination intentions. Parents beliefs in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories are also related to their perceptions of other parents conspiracy beliefs. Further, research has shown that parents hold misperceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy belief norms: UK parents over-estimate the anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs of other parents. The present study tested the effectiveness of a Social Norms Approach intervention, which corrects misperceptions using normative feedback, to reduce UK parents anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and increase vaccination intentions. At baseline, 202 UK parents of young children reported their personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, future intentions to vaccinate, and their perceptions of other UK parents beliefs and intentions. Participants were then randomly assigned to a normative feedback condition (n = 89) or an assessment-only control condition (n = 113). The normative feedback compared participants personal anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs and perceptions of other UK parents beliefs with actual normative belief levels. Parents receiving the normative feedback showed significantly reduced personal belief in anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs at immediate post-test. As hypothesised, changes in normative perceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs mediated the effect of the intervention. The intervention, did not directly increase vaccination intentions, however mediation analysis showed that the normative feedback increased perceptions of other parents vaccination intentions, which in turn increased personal vaccination intentions. No significant effects remained after a six-week follow-up. The current research demonstrates the potential utility of Social Norms Approach interventions for correcting misperceptions and reducing anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs among UK parents. Further research could explore utilising a top-up intervention to maintain the efficacy.","output":"A social norms approach intervention to address misperceptions of anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs amongst UK parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resiliency in athletes is related to effective coping strategies. Expectedly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, this attribute was highlighted in collegiate football players. To date, the relations among locus of control (LOC), strength of religious beliefs (i.e., religiosity), and resiliency in collegiate football players have not been explored in the literature. Exploring the relation of LOC and religious beliefs to resiliency may shed light on avenues to foster resiliency in football players, which in turn can determine players behaviors, performance, and actions during adverse times. The purpose of this study was to gain a more in-depth understanding of the relations among LOC, religiosity, and resiliency in NCAA Division II football players at a public university located in the southwestern United States. A structured online survey containing the Rotters Locus of Control Scale (Rotter in Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 80(1), 1C28, 1966), the Santa Clara Strength of Religious Faith Questionnaire (Plante & Boccaccini in Pastoral Psychology, 45(6), 429C437, 1997), and the Conner Davidson Resilience Scale (Connor & Davidson in Depression and Anxiety, 18(2), 76C82, 2003) was completed by 91 Division II football players. Statistically significant correlations were found between LOC and resiliency (r = ?.42) as well as religiosity and resiliency (r = .26).

Therefore, it is yet unclear whether cancer patients show differential responses to SARS CoV-2 natural infection and vaccination with current mRNA vaccines. Immune profiling was performed in three cohorts of healthy donors and oncologic patients: infected with SARS CoV-2, BNT162b2-vaccinated, and vaccinated with previous SARS CoV-2 infection. Vaccine was found to be a poor inductor of S-specific T cell responses compared to natural infection, which acted as a potent adjuvant for vaccination in antibody and T cell responses. Antibodies towards the M protein were a biomarker of disease severity, while the major targets for T cell responses in natural infection were the M and S protein, but not the N protein. T cell responses quickly decayed after 6 months post-vaccination. T cell profiling showed that vaccination expands effector T cells rather than memory T cell subsets unless the subjects had previous COVID-19 disease. Cancer patients with previous COVID-19 and subsequently vaccinated exhibited exacerbated CD8 responses, with elevated IL17 CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets, and neutrophils. Concluding, a previous COVID-19 infection has potent adjuvant effects for vaccination leading to memory T cell differentiation, but with enhanced inflammatory responses in cancer patients.

Despite decades of research, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV, and many therapeutic drugs are still under development. Detailed understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the RSV infection pathology can accelerate the development of efficacious treatment. Current studies on the RSV pathogenesis are based on the analysis of biopsies from the infected patients; however deeper understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the RSV pathology could be achieved using animal models. Mice are the most often used model for RSV infection because they exhibit manifestations similar to those observed in humans (bronchial obstruction, mucous hypersecretion, and pulmonary inflammation mediated by lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils). Additionally, the use of mice is economically feasible, and many molecular tools are available for studying RSV infection pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels. This review summarizes new data on the pathogenesis of RSV infection obtained in mouse models, which demonstrated the role of T cells in both the antiviral defense and the development of lung immunopathology. T cells not only eliminate the infected cells, but also produce significant amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IFN. Recently, a new subset of tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM)) was identified that provide a strong antiviral defense without induction of lung immunopathology. These cells accumulate in the lungs after local rather than systemic administration of RSV antigens, which suggests new approaches to vaccination. The studies in mouse models have revealed a minor role of interferons in the anti-RSV protection, as RSV possesses mechanisms to escape the antiviral action of type I and III interferons, which may explain the low efficacy of interferon-containing drugs. Using knockout mice, a significant breakthrough has been achieved in understanding the role of many pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung immunopathology. It was found that in addition to TNF and IFN, the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-33, and TSLP mediate the major manifestations of the RSV pathogenesis, such as bronchial obstruction, mucus hyperproduction, and lung infiltration by pro-inflammatory cells, while IL-6, IL-10, and IL-27 exhibit the anti-inflammatory effect.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been shown to detect anti-PF4 in patients with VITT, but chemiluminesence assays do not reliably detect them. ELISA assays are not widely available in diagnostic laboratories, and, globally, very few laboratories perform platelet activation assays. Assays which are commercially available in the United Kingdom were evaluated for their ability to identify anti-PF4 antibodies in samples from patients with suspected VITT. Four IgG-specific ELISAs, two polyspecific ELISAs and four rapid assays were performed on samples from 43 patients with suspected VITT from across the UK. Cases were identified after referral to the UK Expert Haematology Panel multi-disciplinary team and categorised into unlikely, possible or probable VITT.

METHODS: It was a cross-sectional descriptive study. Questionnaires were distributed to orthodontic patients via Google forms. The questionnaire assessed participants knowledge, attitude, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic treatment, and willingness to carry out infection control precautionary measures in the orthodontic clinic. RESULTS: A total of 304 responses were obtained; 83 males (27.3%), 221 females (72.7%) with a mean age of 35.6 years. Subjects demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 infection (94.7%). Most respondents (95%) considered the infection as dangerous and believed the orthodontic patient was at risk of contracting the disease but were willing regardless to carry on with their orthodontic treatment during the pandemic. Fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus during orthodontic appointments and missed orthodontic appointments (74%), and increased treatment time (50%) were the immediate and long-term concerns, respectively. A high acceptance rate of compliance to precautionary measures to mitigate virus spread in the clinic was observed.

It is shown that the daily rate is monotonically decreasing, after a short initial period, in all countries, and that the pattern is similar in all countries.

Before such objectives can be successfully pursued, however, it is necessary to carefully consider to what degree the conditions present in a particular area are conducive to the development of tourism there, including its tourism resources and the existing state of development. This study analyzes the attractiveness of the seven communes making up Brzeski County (Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Poland) for tourism and recreation. The potential of the communes in this largely rural county was characterized using Go?embskis index, based on multivariate comparative analysis, assessing the natural and man-made features and the degree of development of each of the communes. This analysis was further complemented using Wejcherts impression curve, assessing visual attractiveness along selected routes in two of the communes. Of the seven communes analyzed, the Commune of Brzesko was found to have the most extensively developed services, hotel and food-service infrastructure, to be home to many historic buildings and to have a relatively high municipal budget. The Commune of Iwkowa, in turn, which scored lowest in terms of Go?embskis index (mainly due to its underdeveloped infrastructure, few historic buildings and the fact that it is crossed by a major transit route), was nevertheless found to score significantly higher than Brzesko in terms of Wejcherts impression curve. These findings confirm that the beauty of the landscape is not always well correlated with tourism development potential.

SARS and related coronaviruses and astroviruses all possess a motif at the 3 end of their RNA genomes, called the s2m, whose pathogenic importance is inferred from its rigorous sequence conservation in an otherwise rapidly mutable RNA genome. We find that this extreme conservation is clearly explained by the requirement to form a highly structured RNA whose unique tertiary structure includes a sharp 90 kink of the helix axis and several novel longer-range tertiary interactions. The tertiary base interactions create a tunnel that runs perpendicular to the main helical axis whose interior is negatively charged and binds two magnesium ions. These unusual features likely form interaction surfaces with conserved host cell components or other reactive sites required for virus function. Based on its conservation in viral pathogen genomes and its absence in the human genome, we suggest that these unusual structural features in the s2m RNA element are attractive targets for the design of anti-viral therapeutic agents. Structural genomics has sought to deduce protein function based on three-dimensional homology. Here we have extended this approach to RNA by proposing potential functions for a rigorously conserved set of RNA tertiary structural interactions that occur within the SARS RNA genome itself. Based on tertiary structural comparisons, we propose the s2m RNA binds one or more proteins possessing an oligomer-binding-like fold, and we suggest a possible mechanism for SARS viral RNA hijacking of host protein synthesis, both based upon observed s2m RNA macromolecular mimicry of a relevant ribosomal RNA fold.","output":"The Structure of a Rigorously Conserved RNA Element within the SARS Virus Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019.

OBJECTIVES To describe the foramen epiploicum mesh closure (FEMC) technique through a ventral midline laparotomy in horses under general anaesthesia and its outcome. STUDY DESIGN Terminal surgical experiment and in vivo study. METHODS In a pilot study, a standard ventral midline laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia in 10 experimental horses and a three-dimensional expandable diabolo-shaped mesh construct was manually introduced through the EF into the omental vestibule. The laparotomy incision was routinely closed after which the horses were subjected to euthanasia. Subsequently, the cadavers were extensively manipulated and finally mesh position was verified during necropsy. Thereafter, a ventral midline laparotomy, with simulation of abdominal manipulations during colic surgery was performed on six experimental horses. A three-dimensional expandable diabolo-shaped mesh with a radiological marker was introduced as in the pilot study. Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded during the post-operative period. Four weeks after the intervention, abdominal radiography and laparoscopy were performed in all six horses. RESULTS Insertion of all 16 diabolo-shaped mesh constructs during laparotomy was uneventful. The 10 mesh constructs of the pilot study were positioned correctly at necropsy. No post-operative clinical or laboratory parameter alterations were noticed in the other six horses, apart from a transient leucocytosis and an increase in serum amyloid A. Abdominal radiography at 4 weeks revealed consistent positioning of the mesh marker. Laparoscopy confirmed that all six EFs were closed, without intestinal adhesions.

Compared with the RT-PCR+ cohort, patients with serological proven infection alone, were more likely to be receiving tacrolimus monotherapy, p<0.01 and less likely to have a diagnosis of diabetes, p=0.012.17/113 (15.0%) of all patients with infection (RT-PCR and/or Ab+) died. Risk factors associated with survival were older age, OR:1.07 (1.00-1.13), p=0.041; receiving prednisolone, OR:5.98 (1.65-21.60), p<0.01 and the absence of diabetes, OR:0.27 (0.07-0.99), p=0.047.

Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).

METHODS: We used the 2019 and 2020 databases of the Mortality Information System (SIM) to analyze deaths occurring between March and December of each year that had cancer or CVD as the underlying cause or comorbidity. Deaths from covid-19 in 2020 were also analyzed. To estimate the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) and the excess of deaths, 2019 data were considered as standard. RESULTS: Between March and December 2020, there were 181,377 deaths from cancer and 291,375 deaths from cardiovascular diseases in Brazil, indicating reduction rates of 9.7% and 8.8%, respectively, compared to the same period of the previous year. The pattern was maintained in the five Brazilian regions, with lower variation for cancer (-8.4% in the South to -10.9% in the Midwest). For CVD, the variation was greater, from -2.2% in the North to -10.5 in the Southeast and South. In the same period of 2020, these diseases were classified as comorbidities in 18,133 deaths from cancer and 188,204 deaths from cardiovascular diseases, indicating a proportional excess compared to data from 2019, of 82.1% and 77.9%, respectively. This excess was most significant in the Northern Region, with a ratio of 2.5 between observed and expected deaths for the two conditions studied.

We aimed to define the prevalence and clinical characteristics of these two groups within a large multi-state healthcare system and develop a simpler means to assist clinicians in identifying VHR patients using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients in a 28-hospital US healthcare system in 2018. ICD-10 codes were used to define the ASCVD population. Per the AHA/ACC Guideline, VHR status was defined by 2 major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and 2 high-risk conditions. CART analysis was performed on training and validation datasets. A random forest model was used to verify results. RESULTS: Of 180,669 ASCVD patients identified, 58% were VHR. Among patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 99% and 96% were classified as VHR, respectively. Both CART and random forest models identified recent ACS, ischemic stroke, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, history of MI, and age as the most important predictors of VHR status. Using five rules identified by CART analysis, fewer than 50% of risk factors were required to assign VHR status. CONCLUSION: CART analysis helped to streamline the identification of VHR patients based on a limited number of rules and risk factors.

However, it is unclear which hygiene and infection control measures are effective and useful for pediatric hospitals. Here, we report infection control measures implemented at a tertiary care childrens hospital. We evaluated frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection in admitted patients, in-hospital transmission and infection related findings. Furthermore, we aimed to capture perspectives of health-care workers and caregivers on effectiveness and burden of infection control measures. Knowledge gained can inform management of the ongoing and future pandemics. METHODS: We designed a retrospective observational study and survey at a pediatric tertiary care referral center. Local infection control measures and respective guidelines regarding COVID-19 were reviewed. Three thousand seven hundred sixteen children under 18 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the University Childrens Hospital Tuebingen and data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission were retrieved from internal records. Two surveys were conducted among 219 staff members and 229 caregivers. RESULTS: Local infection control measures comprised the formation of a task force, triage, protective hygiene measures and an adaptable SARS-CoV-2 test strategy. Between January 2020 and March 2021, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 37 children presenting to our hospital, 21 of these were admitted. One hospital-acquired infection occurred. About 90% of health-care staff perceived the majority of measures as effective and appropriate. However, visitor restrictions and cancellation of scheduled treatments were perceived least effective by hospital staff and as a particular burden for patients and their caregivers. Visits at the pediatric emergency department significantly decreased during the pandemic. We drafted a pandemic action plan by ranking infection control measures according to local transmission stages. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection control measures implemented in our tertiary care childrens hospital were evaluated by health-care workers as mostly effective and appropriate. In particular, good communication, transparency of decision-making as well as universal masking and infection screening were assessed as successful measures of infection control management. Visitor restrictions and cancellation of routine appointments, in contrast, were perceived as a particular burden on patient care and should be avoided. An established pandemic action plan may guide childrens hospitals in the future.

Travel, especially air transportation, plays a significant role in the spread of such diseases. Analysis of air traffic data and its interaction with the disease outbreak is one of the applied and research topics. Flights from infected areas to less infected regions increase the outbreak. On the other hand, by following warnings and policies, air travel declines in such periods. The effects are reflected in the collected data with a time gap that requires efficient methods for rich analysis. This aspect is overlooked in existing research. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for spatio-temporal analysis that is based on granular computing and fuses the air traffic data with COVID-19 statistics. Data in diverse sources may be at different levels of granularity. Therefore, analyzing the interaction of two phenomena extracted from different sources is a challenging issue. Moreover, there may not be an exact match in other data sources for some data items, but applying a fuzzy inference system and constructing enriched data granules by using geographical knowledge bases eliminates this shortcoming.

A drop shape analysis method with a written computer algorithm monitoring the image brightness was proposed to precisely estimate the sliding angle. A hydrophobic surface coated with silanized silicon dioxide or polytetrafluoroethylene was selected as a known sample for the method validation. Average pixel brightness in an 8-bit grayscale unit rapidly increased after a water drop rolled off the surface, thus removing its black pixels. The resulting sliding angle was then determined as the tilt angle of the sample stage related to the sliding time at the brightness leap. The optimized angular speed of the rotor at 0.1 degrees per frame was chosen to avoid an overestimation of the sliding angle due to the deceleration. The proposed method yielded accurate sliding angles with an error of less than 0.2 degrees. It was then applied to study the fluid resistance of commercial face masks including disposable surgical masks and reusable fabric masks. It was found that the outermost layer of the single-use surgical masks can moderately repel a water drop with a sliding angle of 49.4 degrees. Meanwhile, the pre-coated fabric masks retained high protection efficiency at a sliding angle of less than 45 degrees after about 20 wash cycles. In addition, a raw muslin fabric coated with a commercial water-repellent spray could be a promising and affordable alternative to the surgical mask during the pandemic with high water repellency even after a few washes. The results suggested that, besides the hydrophobicity indicated by the typical contact angle, the precise sliding angle estimated by the proposed alternative method could additionally provide crucial information that might lead to a detailed discussion of the fluid repellency of rough materials.","output":"A Simple and Precise Estimation of Water Sliding Angle by Monitoring Image Brightness: A Case Study of the Fluid Repellency of Commercial Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a common, treatable chronic disease that can be effectively managed in primary care settings.

METHODS Prospective cohort study of 656 participants aged 17+ years presenting to Level 1 trauma centers within 24 hours of mTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] 13-15) and 156 demographically similar healthy controls enrolled in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in TBI (TRACK-TBI) study. Poor 1-year cognitive outcome was defined as cognitive impairment (<9th percentile of normative data on 2 cognitive tests, cognitive decline (change score [1-year score minus best 2-week or 6-month score] exceeding the 90% reliable change index on 2 cognitive tests), or both. Associations of poor 1-year cognitive outcome with 1-year neurobehavioral outcomes were performed to establish concurrent validity. Baseline characteristics were compared across cognitive outcome groups and backward elimination logistic regression was used to build a prediction model. RESULTS Mean age of mTBI participants was 40.2 years, 36.6% were female, 76.6% were white. Poor 1-year cognitive outcome was associated with worse 1-year functional outcome, more neurobehavioral symptoms, greater psychological distress, and lower satisfaction with life (all-p<0.05), establishing concurrent validity. At 1-year, 13.5% of participants with mTBI had a poor cognitive outcome versus 4.5% of controls, p=0.003. In univariable analyses, poor 1-year cognitive outcome was associated with non-white race, lower education, lower income, lack of health insurance, hyperglycemia, pre-injury depression, and greater injury severity (all-p<0.05). The final multivariable prediction model included education, health insurance, pre-injury depression, hyperglycemia, and Rotterdam CT Score>3 and achieved an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI=0.62-0.75) for the prediction of a poor 1-year cognitive outcome, with each variable associated with >2-fold increased odds of poor 1-year cognitive outcome.

There were 4 adults with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations using MR-LUND PROTOCOL: Single-shot Fast Spin Echo (SSFSE), LAVA 3D and IDEAL 3D, Echo-planar imaging (EPI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and Fast Spin Echo (FSE) T2 weighted imaging (T2WI). On T2WI changes were identified in 9 (60,0%) patients, on DWI - in 5 (33,3%) patients. In 5 (33,3%) patients lesions of the parenchyma were visualized on T2WI and DWI simultaneously.

A successful cannulation outcome when an AVF or arteriovenous graft (AVG) is used for the first time can be influenced by many factors, including access maturity, staff skill, and patient factors. This study examined AVF/AVG outcomes at initiation of HD across two major metropolitan public hospitals. METHODS Electronic medical records were reviewed to collect data retrospectively for a cohort of all newly commencing ESRD HD starts during 2018 to identify cannulation outcomes in the first 6 weeks. RESULTS Of the 117 patients included, AVG use was low (5%). Twenty-four percent of patients required a surgical intervention to salvage a poorly functioning AVF prior to commencing HD. About 32.5% of the cohort had an uneventful start with all successful cannulations. For the remainder of the cohort the number of treatments with unsuccessful cannulation ranged from 1 to 4 or more. About 36% required a surgical intervention for a poorly functioning AVF after commencing HD. Commencing HD with a CVC is associated with a lower likelihood of subsequent successful cannulation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Even in experienced centres, a subset of patients experienced complicated cannulation in the first 6 weeks of HD.

PE usually begins after 20 weeks' gestation and, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications and lifelong disabilities-even death-in both the mother and the infant. As delivery is the only cure for the disease, treatment is primarily focused on the management of blood pressure and other clinical symptoms. The pathogenesis of PE is still not clear. Abnormal spiral artery remodeling, placental ischemia and a resulting increase in the circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), also called soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), are believed to be among the primary pathologies associated with PE. sFlt-1 is produced mainly in the placenta during pregnancy and acts as a decoy receptor, binding to free VEGF (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF), resulting in the decreased bioavailability of each to target cells. Despite the pathogenic effects of increased sFlt-1 on the maternal vasculature, recent studies from our laboratory and others have strongly indicated that the increase in sFlt-1 in PE may fulfill critical protective functions in preeclamptic pregnancies. Thus, further studies on the roles of sFlt-1 in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies are warranted for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF signaling for the treatment of PE. Another impediment to the treatment of PE is the lack of suitable methods for delivery of cargo to placental cells, as PE is believed to be of placental origin and most available therapies for PE adversely impact both the mother and the fetus.

A common symptom of mTBIs is cognitive dysfunction. Health care professionals use neuropsychological assessments as part of a multidisciplinary and best practice approach for mTBI management. Such assessments support clinical diagnosis, symptom management, rehabilitation, and return-to-duty planning. Military health care organizations currently use computerized neurocognitive assessment tools (NCATs). NCATs and more traditional neuropsychological assessments present unique challenges in both clinical and military settings. Many research gaps remain regarding psychometric properties, usability, acceptance, feasibility, effectiveness, sensitivity, and utility of both types of assessments in military environments. OBJECTIVE The aims of this study were to explore evidence regarding the use of NCATs among military personnel who have sustained mTBIs; evaluate the psychometric properties of the most commonly tested NCATs for this population; and synthesize the data to explore the range and extent of NCATs among this population, clinical recommendations for use, and knowledge gaps requiring future research. METHODS Studies were identified using MEDLINE, Embase, American Psychological Association PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Psych Article, Scopus, and Military & Government Collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, thematic analysis, and the Randolph Criteria. Narrative synthesis and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guided the reporting of findings. The psychometric properties of NCATs were evaluated with specific criteria and summarized. RESULTS Of the 104 papers, 33 met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. Thematic analysis and NCAT psychometrics were reported and summarized. CONCLUSIONS When considering the psychometric properties of the most commonly used NCATs in military populations, these assessments have yet to demonstrate adequate validity, reliability, sensitivity, and clinical utility among military personnel with mTBIs. Additional research is needed to further validate NCATs within military populations, especially for those living outside of the United States and individuals experiencing other conditions known to adversely affect cognitive processing.

Crucially, our assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from viral particles suspended in transport media that was directly added to the PCR master mix, suggesting that RNA extraction can be skipped entirely without any degradation of test performance. Since Sanger sequencing instruments are widespread in clinical laboratories and commonly have built-in liquid handling automation to support up to 3840 samples per instrument per day, the widespread adoption of qSanger COVID-19 diagnostics can unlock more than 1,000,000 tests per day in the US.","output":"A Highly Scalable and Rapidly Deployable RNA Extraction-Free COVID-19 Assay by Quantitative Sanger Sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We evaluated the use of baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital because of COVID-19. Methods: This randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), is assessing multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care alone (usual care group) or usual care plus baricitinib 4 mg once daily by mouth for 10 days or until discharge if sooner (baricitinib group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A meta-analysis was conducted that included the results from the RECOVERY trial and all previous randomised controlled trials of baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Findings: Between 2 February 2021 and 29 December 2021, 8156 patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus baricitinib versus usual care alone. At randomisation, 95% of patients were receiving corticosteroids and 23% receiving tocilizumab (with planned use within the next 24 hours recorded for a further 9%). Overall, 513 (12%) of 4148 patients allocated to baricitinib versus 546 (14%) of 4008 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (age-adjusted rate ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98; p=0.026). This 13% proportional reduction in mortality was somewhat smaller than that seen in a meta-analysis of 8 previous trials of a JAK inhibitor (involving 3732 patients and 425 deaths) in which allocation to a JAK inhibitor was associated with a 43% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.57; 95% CI 0.45-0.72). Including the results from RECOVERY into an updated meta-analysis of all 9 completed trials (involving 11,888 randomised patients and 1484 deaths) allocation to baricitinib or other JAK inhibitor was associated with a 20% proportional reduction in mortality (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.71-0.89; p<0.001). In RECOVERY, there was no significant excess in death or infection due to non-COVID-19 causes and no excess of thrombosis, or other safety outcomes. Interpretation: In patients hospitalised for COVID-19, baricitinib significantly reduced the risk of death but the size of benefit was somewhat smaller than that suggested by previous trials. The total randomised evidence to date suggests that JAK inhibitors (chiefly baricitinib) reduce mortality in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 by about one-fifth.","output":"Baricitinib in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial and updated meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented surge in food insecurity and demand for free food In response, Foodshare, the regional food bank serving Greater Hartford, Connecticut, created a drive-through distribution program to meet the immediate food needs of residents Our team at Foodshare's Institute for Hunger Research & Solutions conducted two surveys of people receiving food at the drive-through distribution to help inform Foodshare's programming and response to the pandemic Results show that 70% of households receiving food had never gone to a food pantry or other program to receive free food prior to COVID-19, and 67% said they come at least once a week Additionally, 86% of guests are not going elsewhere to receive free food and only 37% know of other places to get free food The majority of people receiving food at the drive-through distribution were people of color, who are those most affected by COVID-19 from both health and financial perspectives From April to August 2020, Foodshare served an average of 1,500 households each day and more than 150,000 cars total at the drive-through distribution alone Despite serving an immediate need for food, the drive-through model presents challenges, particularly during the New England winter with snow and freezing temperatures, and is an expensive endeavor Foodshare and other food banks will need to pivot again from short-term pandemic assistance to longer-term approaches to create dignified, convenient, and sustainable access to healthy food for additional people struggling with food insecurity Food banks can also leverage their extensive platforms of volunteers and donors to advocate for policy changes that will ensure economic stability and food security","output":"Food bank drive-through distribution during COVID-19: A reflective essay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study sought to understand the experience of buying misoprostol online for pregnancy termination in Indonesia.

The influenza virus, with a constantly mutating genome, is becoming resistant to existing antiviral drugs and vaccines. For that reason, there is an urgent need for developing new therapeutics and therapies. Despite the fact that a new generation of universal vaccines or anti-influenza drugs are being developed, the perfect remedy has still not been found. In this review, various strategies for using nanoparticles (NPs) to defeat influenza virus infections are presented. Several categories of NP applications are highlighted: NPs as immuno-inducing vaccines, NPs used in gene silencing approaches, bare NPs influencing influenza virus life cycle and the use of NPs for drug delivery. This rapidly growing field of anti-influenza methods based on nanotechnology is very promising. Although profound research must be conducted to fully understand and control the potential side effects of the new generation of antivirals, the presented and discussed studies show that nanotechnology methods can effectively induce the immune responses or inhibit influenza virus activity both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, with its variety of modification possibilities, nanotechnology has great potential for applications and may be helpful not only in anti-influenza but also in the general antiviral approaches.","output":"Anti-Influenza Strategies Based on Nanoparticle Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SYNOPSIS: Early identification of the emergence of an outbreak of a novel infectious disease is critical to generating a timely response.

Quantifying the impact of these restrictions on energy consumption offers a new direction towards intelligent energy services in a post coronavirus (post-COVID-19) world, especially for commercial buildings. Thus, utilising actual power consumption data, the study evaluates how energy usage in commercial buildings can change in a post-COVID-19 world, whilst examining the impact of digitalisation to identifying potential new opportunities. The paper analyses the changes in energy demand with occupancy rate based on data from 126 commercial businesses with varied classes across Manchester, United Kingdom. The results show that the reduction in energy demand is not proportionate to the occupancy level, resulting in high energy costs. For instance, an average footfall for February 2021 is 10% of 2020, while the costs of electricity only fall to 80% of 2020. Although most of the energy demand is from appliances, the absence of energy efficiency increases energy consumption, highlighting the urgent need for optimised energy efficiency measures to include the time of use and scheduled use of energy across people and processes.

Psychological sequalae of this pandemic may pose a greater conundrum than its clinical aspects. It is currently unknown that how pregnant women cope with this global pandemic and its ramifications. The aims of the study are to understand the attitudes and precaution practices of non-infected pregnant women towards the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey of COVID-19 awareness among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Singapore was conducted. An internet link was provided to complete an online electronic survey on Google platform using a quick response (QR) code on mobile devices. The online survey consists of 34 questions that were categorized into 4 main sections, namely 1) social demographics 2) attitude on safe distancing measures 3) precaution practices and 4) perceptions of COVID-19. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine womens precaution practices among six independent socio-demographic variables, including age, ethnicity , education , front-line jobs, history of miscarriage and type of antenatal clinic (general , high risk). Results: A total of 167 survey responses were obtained over eight weeks from April to June 2020. The majority of women were aged 35 years (76%, n=127), were of Chinese ethnicity (55%, n=91), attained tertiary education (62%, n=104) and were not working as frontline staff (70%). Using multiple linear regression models, Malay ethnicity (vs. Chinese,  0.24;95% CI 0.04, 0.44) was associated with higher frequency of practicing social distancing. Malay women ( 0.48;95% CI 0.16, 0.80) and those who worked as frontline staff ( 0.28;95% CI 0.01, 0.56) sanitized their hands at higher frequencies. Age of 36 years (vs. 30 years,  0.24;95% CI 0.01, 0.46), Malay (vs. Chinese,  0.27;95% CI 0.06, 0.48) and Indian ethnicity (vs. Chinese,  0.41;95% CI 0.02, 0.80), and attendance at high-risk clinic (vs. general clinic,  0.20;95% CI 0.01, 0.39) were associated with higher frequency of staying-at-home. Conclusion: Social demographical factors including age > 36 years old, Malay ethnicity, employment in front line jobs and attendance at high-risk clinics are likely to influence the attitudes and precaution practices among pregnant women towards COVID-19 in Singapore. Knowledge gained from our cross-sectional online survey can better guide clinicians to communicate better with pregnant women. Hence, it is important for clinicians to render appropriate counselling and focused clarification on the effect of COVID-19 among pregnant women for psychological support and mental wellbeing.","output":"Attitudes and precaution practices towards COVID-19 among pregnant women in Singapore: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The current undergraduate radiology education predominantly integrates radiology with other disciplines during preclerkship years and is often taught by nonradiologists. Early exposure to radiology and profound understanding of scientific fundamentals of imaging modalities and techniques are essential for a better understanding and interest in the specialty. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic-related impact on in-person medical education aggravated the need for alternative virtual teaching initiatives to provide essential knowledge to medical students. METHODS: The authors designed an online 7-session course on the principles of imaging modalities for medical students and fresh graduates in the United States and abroad. The course was delivered online and taught by radiologists from different US institutions. Pretests and posttests were delivered before and after each session, respectively, to assess change in knowledge. At the end of the course, a survey was distributed among students to collect their assessment and feedback. RESULTS: A total of 162 students and interns initially enrolled in the program by completing a sign-up interest form. An average of 65 participants attended each live session, with the highest attendance being 93 live attendees. An average of 44 attendees completed both the pretest and posttest for each session. There was a statistically significant increase in posttest scores compared with pretest scores (P < 0.01) for each session; on average, the posttest scores were 48% higher than the pretest scores. A total of 84 participants answered the end-of-course survey. A total of 11% of the respondents described themselves as first year, 17% as second year, 18% as third year, 21% as fourth year, and 33% as \\"other.\\" Attendees were enrolled in medical schools across 21 different countries with 35% of the respondents studying medicine in the United States. More than 76% of the respondents stated that they \\"strongly agree\\" that the program increased their understanding of radiology, increased their interest in radiology, and would be useful in their clinical practice in the future. Eighty-three percent of the respondents stated that they \\"strongly agree\\" that \\"this course was a worthwhile experience.\\" Particularly, more than 84% of the respondents stated that among the most important components in enhancing their understanding of radiology were \\"the interpretation of normal imaging\\" and \\"interpretation of clinical cases.\\" Ninety-two percent of the respondents stated that \\"the amount of effort to complete the requirements for this program was just right.\\" Participants were also asked to rate each of the 8 sessions using the following scale: poor = 1 point, fair = 2, good = 3, and excellent = 4. The average rating for all 8 sessions was 3.61 points (SD = 0.55), which translates to 96% of the sessions being rated good or excellent. Eighty percent of the participants reported that the topics presented in the program were \\"excellent and clinically important to learn,\\" and 20% of the participants reported that the topics presented were \\"good and somewhat important to learn.\\" The participants were asked to evaluate their confidence regarding basic radiology skills before and after the program using the following scale: not confident at all = 1 point, somewhat confident = 2, moderately confident = 3, and very confident = 4.

Increasing evidence suggests that the flexibility of the genetic code decoding could provide an evolutionary advantage in extreme conditions, therefore, the identification and study of interrupted genes in extremophilic Archaea could be important from an astrobiological point of view, providing new information on the origin and evolution of the genetic code and on the limits of life on Earth. In order to shed some light on the mechanism of programmed ?1 frameshifting in Archaea, here we report, for the first time, on the analysis of the transcription of this recoded archaeal -l-fucosidase and of its full-length mutant in different growth conditions in vivo. We found that only the wild type mRNA significantly increased in S. solfataricus after cold shock and in cells grown in minimal medium containing hydrolyzed xyloglucan as carbon source.

By using Random Forest regression models based on 636 field trials at 105 globally georeferenced sites, we identified the key drivers of effects of non-continuous flooding practices and mapped maximum GHGs or IRR reduction benefits under optimal non-continuous flooding strategies. The results show that variation in effects of non-continuous flooding practices are primarily explained by the UnFlooded days Ratio (UFR, that is the ratio of the number of days without standing water in the field to total days of the growing period). Non-continuous flooding practices could be feasible to be adopted in 76% of global rice harvested areas. This would reduce the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 and N2 O combined from rice production by 47% or the total GWP by 7% and alleviate irrigation water use by 25%, while maintaining yield levels.

Its function is not restricted to clot formation, however, as it partakes in a complex interplay between thrombin, soluble plasma fibrinogen, and deposited fibrin matrices. Fibrinogen, like thrombin, participates predominantly in hemostasis to maintain vascular integrity, but executes some important pleiotropic effects: firstly, as observed in thrombin generation experiments, fibrin removes thrombin from free solution by adsorption. The adsorbed thrombin is protected from antithrombins, notably 2-macroglobulin, and remains physiologically active as it can activate factors V, VIII, and platelets. Secondly, immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin matrices activate monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils via Mac-1 interactions. Immobilized fibrin(ogen) thereby elicits a pro-inflammatory response with a reciprocal stimulating effect of the immune system on coagulation. In contrast, soluble fibrinogen prohibits recruitment of these immune cells. Thus, while fibrin matrices elicit a procoagulant response, both directly by protecting thrombin and indirectly through the immune system, high soluble fibrinogen levels might protect patients due to its immune diminutive function. The in vivo influence of the protective plasma fibrinogen versus the pro-thrombotic fibrin matrices on thrombosis should be explored in future research.","output":"ThrombinCFibrin(ogen) Interactions, Host Defense and Risk of Thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Insufficient blood levels of the neurohormone vitamin D are associated with increased risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality Despite the global rollout of vaccinations and promising preliminary results, the focus remains on additional preventive measures to manage COVID-19 Results conflict on vitamin Ds plausible role in preventing and treating COVID-19 We examined the relation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality among the multiethnic population of the United Arab Emirates Our observational study used data for 522 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at one of the main hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai Only 464 of those patients were included for data analysis Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed Serum samples immediately drawn at the first hospital visit were used to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations through automated electrochemiluminescence Levels &lt;12 ng/mL were significantly associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection and of death Age was the only other independent risk factor, whereas comorbidities and smoking did not contribute to the outcomes upon adjustment Sex of patients was not an important predictor for severity or death Our study is the first conducted in the UAE to measure 25(OH)D levels in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and confirm the association of levels &lt;12 ng/mL with COVID-19 severity and mortality","output":"COVID-19 Disease Severity and Death in Relation to Vitamin D Status among SARS-CoV-2-Positive UAE Residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first analyses of the various consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic show that the risk to nurses psychological well-being is particularly high. As the pandemic and the demands imposed on nurses are not yet fully understood, there is a need to seek buffering factors to protect nurses psychological health. In line with the earliest evidence, we hypothesize pandemic-related increases in perceived stress and decreases in the frequency of flow experiences, likewise in satisfaction with work, life, work performance, and well-being. As protective factors while dealing with pandemic-related stress, we suggest an individuals sense of humor and perceived appreciation. METHODS: In June/July 2020 C during the first lockdown in Germany C participants completed an online-survey in which they were asked to rate their situation before the pandemic (retrospectively) and during the pandemic. Our sample consisted of 174 registered nurses (161 females, 13 males, M(age) = 40.52), of whom 85 worked as public health nurses and 89 as geriatric nurses. RESULTS: During the pandemic, nurses felt more stressed, had fewer flow experiences, and were less satisfied with their work, life, work-performance, and well-being than before the pandemic. In addition, nurses felt more appreciation from society but less from their patients. Sense of humor and the perceived appreciation of society and patients were confirmed as buffers of negative pandemic-related effects.

AIM: We aimed to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction of females and males in Egypt and to evaluate possible predictive factors. METHODS: Married men and females in Egypt were invited to respond to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed medical history, socioeconomic status, sexual performance satisfaction before and during the lockdown in addition to validated Arabic questionnaires for depression, sexual function in males and females, and sexual satisfaction (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function-5, Index of Sexual Satisfaction, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures were frequency of depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and sexual satisfaction in males and females during COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 479 females and 217 males completed the questionnaire. Sexual satisfaction was significantly higher before (91.2%, 73.5%) than during lockdown (70.5%, 56.2%) in both males and females, respectively. During lockdown, significantly more males (70.5%) reported being satisfied with their sexual performance than females (56.2%) (P < .001). More than half of the male subjects (68.2%) had no erectile dysfunction while 97.3% females scored 26.5 on the Female Sexual Function Index scale suggestive of sexual difficulties. Sexual stress was significantly greater in females (70.8%) than males (63.1%). Educational level, occupation, anxiety, and erectile dysfunction were independently associated with sexual stress in males. Being a housewife or unemployed, husband's age >35 years, marriage duration of 5-10 years, anxiety, and female sexual dysfunction were predictors of sexual relation stress in females. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower sexual satisfaction in both genders.

However, the real challenge is to develop and uplift medical infrastructure, such as diagnostic tools capable of prompt diagnosis and instant and economic medical treatment that is available to the masses. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, are atomic sheets that have been in the news for quite some time due to their unprecedented electronic mobilities, high thermal conductivity, appreciable thermal stability, excellent anchoring capabilities, optical transparency, mechanical flexibility, and a unique capability to integrate with arbitrary surfaces. These attributes of 2D materials make them lucrative for use as an active material platform for authentic and prompt (within minutes) disease diagnosis via electrical or optical diagnostic tools or via electrochemical diagnosis. We present the opportunities provided by 2D materials as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","output":"2D materials as a diagnostic platform for the detection and sensing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: a bird's-eye view"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single-port access (SPA) is an emerging concept in minimally invasive colorectal surgery. The authors report their experience using SPA sigmoidectomy as an early-elective approach to complicated diverticulitis with paracolic abscess. METHODS Between September 2009 und April 2010, 4 patients underwent SPA sigmoidectomy for Hinchey-I diverticulitis using the reusable X-Cone device. RESULTS After a median time of antibiotic treatment of 8 days, SPA sigmoidectomy was performed successfully in all patients. The median operative time was 200 minutes (range, 187-221 minutes). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were recorded; the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range, 5-7 days). No incisional hernias were observed at midterm follow-up (median, 11.5 months; range, 8-14 months). CONCLUSIONS When performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon, early-elective SPA sigmoidectomy is a feasible and safe approach to complicated diverticulitis.

MWA is a recently introduced thermal needle ablation treatment modality with theoretical advantages compared with radiofrequency ablation, such as greater intratumoral temperatures, lack of a grounding pad, and superior convection profile. However, experience has been limited in the human kidney. METHODS Ten patients with a single, solid-enhancing renal tumor from June 2008 to November 2008 received laparoscopic or computed tomography-guided percutaneous MWA at a tertiary referral center with 14 months of follow-up. MWA was performed using the Valleylab Evident, 915-MHz MWA system at 45 W with intraoperative biopsy before ablation, and peripheral fiberoptic thermometry to determine the treatment endpoints. The patients were followed up with contrast-enhanced computed tomography at 1 month, 6 months to 1 year, and annually to monitor for tumor recurrence. RESULTS The follow-up duration for the 6 male and 4 female patients (mean tumor size 3.65 cm, range 2.0-5.5; mean age 69.8 years) was 17.9 months. The recurrence rate, defined by persistent enhancement, was 38% (3 of 8). The intraoperative and postoperative complication rate was 20% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS MWA resulted in poor oncologic outcomes with a significant complication rate at an intermediate level of follow-up. However, MWA has promising theoretical advantages and should not be discarded. Additional studies should be considered to better understand the microwave-tissue interaction and treatment endpoints for different size renal masses before widespread use.","output":"Initial experience using microwave ablation therapy for renal tumor treatment: 18-month follow-up."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Research carried out in 2016 by NASS showed that the range and quality of axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) services generally offered around the UK were variable 1. The publication by the regulator, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), of a Guideline for Spondyloarthritis (NG65) in 2017 2 and the corresponding Quality Standard (QS170) in 2018 3, for the first time provided national guidance and standards of services that should be available for people with axial SpA. National oversight of the implementation of these however was missing. Objectives: NASS worked with Parliamentarians to establish the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Axial Spondyloarthritis in January 2019. We gave it a very specific objective -to oversee the implementation of NH65 and QS170. The group seeks to improve axial SpA services in England whilst raising awareness of the condition at a parliamentary level, working closely with NASS. Methods: The group is a unique forum in the UK, bringing together patients, clinicians, researchers, policy makers, national bodies and parliamentarians. The group has met five times covering a range of topics including the delay to diagnosis, the uptake of NG65 and hydrotherapy. In 2019 the group carried out a national inquiry into the standards of axial SpA services in the UK, developing a ten-question quality framework, based largely on the NICE Guideline recommendations and Quality Standard. In July 2020 a meeting was convened to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on axial SpA services. The meeting presented research carried out by NASS and M&F Health with patients and clinicians respectively. Results: The results of the national inquiry for England were published in January 2020 4. The inquiry found that large discrepancies remain in the provision of axial SpA services. Only 21% of local commissioning bodies have an inflammatory back pain pathway, and less than half of NHS providers have a specialist axial SpA clinic. The results of COVID survey shows significant impacts on the health of axial SpA patients and on the availability and modality of rheumatology services. The APPG later published a report with a set of recommendations 5, creating minimum service specifications for axial SpA services during crisis periods such as the recent pandemic, as well as service recovery. Comment on this research was also published in The Lancet Rheumatology 6. In September 2020 the work of the APPG led to a debate in Parliament on delayed diagnosis in axial SpA. Discussions on the future of hydrotherapy services has resulted in the mobilisation of stakeholders across condition areas. Conclusion: All All Party Parliamentary Group is already proving to be an effective political lever to improve axial SpA care. It has shown huge variations in the standard of care and provision of services still remain and has brought this to the attention of Parliamentarians, policy makers and clinicians.","output":"Creating political levers to improve axial spondyloarthritis care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aortic thrombus can be rare, requiring prompt recognition and management to prevent sequelae.

Although these strategies can be recommended, or even imposed, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception of the risks associated with a potential infection. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated. To better understand these dynamics, we propose an epidemiological SIR model that uses evolutionary game theory for combining in a single process social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. In particular, we consider a disease spreading through a population, whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs the agents health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the agents strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of infected agents. Our results show recurrent infection waves, which are usually seen in previous historic epidemic scenarios with voluntary quarantine. In particular, such waves re-occur as the population reduces disease awareness. Notably, the risk perception is found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak, while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the fundamental role of social strategies.","output":"An epidemiological model with voluntary quarantine strategies governed by evolutionary game dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Single-port access laparoscopic surgery is emerging as a method to improve the morbidity and cosmetic benefits of conventional laparoscopic surgery and minimize the surgical trauma. However, the feasibility of this procedure in rectal surgery has not yet been determined. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate our initial experience using single-port access in laparoscopic rectal surgery. DESIGN This investigation was designed as a prospective clinical study. SETTINGS The study took place in a university hospital. PATIENTS Ten patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer underwent rectal resections. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measures are perioperative data including intraoperative and postoperative complications, pathological outcome, length of stay, and short-term follow-up. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 67 (range, 49-83) and the median body mass index was 23.5 kg/m (range, 20-25 kg/m). Six patients had previously had abdominal surgery. The operations were 6 low anterior resections (4 receiving diverting ileostomy), 2 anterior resections, 1 Hartmann procedure, and 1 abdominoperineal resection. The median operative time was 229 minutes (range, 185-318), and blood loss ranged from 0 to 100 mL. In 2 cases, it was necessary to add an extra 5-mm port to deal with intraoperative complications. The median hospital stay was 7 days (range, 4-14). There were no anastomotic leaks and no mortality. All of the resection margins were clear, and the circumferential resection margin was a median of 11 mm (range, 2.5-25). The median number of lymph nodes examined was 14 (range, 3-20). LIMITATIONS This study's limitations include the lack of registration of postoperative pain, immunological parameters, and long-term clinical and oncological outcome. The small sample size makes it difficult to ascertain complication and conversion rates. CONCLUSIONS Single-port access laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can be performed safely in slim patients with a small tumor. This technique can be an alternative option for selected patients in the hands of skilled laparoscopic surgeons.

However, studies investigating whether social capital that controls the effects of population density also influences the infection rate are limited. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data of Japans every prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only negatively correlates with infection rates and population densities, but also negatively correlates with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Additionally, controlling the relationship between the variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the relationship between population density and infection rates, indicating that social distancing alone is not enough to deter coronavirus disease; social capital needs to be recharged.","output":"Social Capital Mediates the Relationship between Social Distancing and COVID-19 Prevalence in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first antiviral drug, idoxuridine, was approved in 1963, 90 antiviral drugs categorized into 13 functional groups have been formally approved for the treatment of the following 9 human infectious diseases: (i) HIV infections (protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, entry inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues), (ii) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (lamivudine, interferons, nucleoside analogues, and acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues), (iii) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (ribavirin, interferons, NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B polymerase inhibitors), (iv) herpesvirus infections (5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridine analogues, entry inhibitors, nucleoside analogues, pyrophosphate analogues, and acyclic guanosine analogues), (v) influenza virus infections (ribavirin, matrix 2 protein inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors), (vi) human cytomegalovirus infections (acyclic guanosine analogues, acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogues, pyrophosphate analogues, and oligonucleotides), (vii) varicella-zoster virus infections (acyclic guanosine analogues, nucleoside analogues, 5-substituted 2'-deoxyuridine analogues, and antibodies), (viii) respiratory syncytial virus infections (ribavirin and antibodies), and (ix) external anogenital warts caused by human papillomavirus infections (imiquimod, sinecatechins, and podofilox).

The target was a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, or a woman whose sexual orientation and gender identity were unspecified.

Fear of hypoglycaemia is a hurdle to effective correction of hyperglycaemia because it promotes under-dosing of insulin. Strategies to minimise hypoglycaemia include education and training for improved hypoglycaemia awareness and the development of technologies to allow their early detection and thus minimise their occurrence. Patients with impaired hypoglycaemia awareness would benefit the most from these technologies. The purpose of this systematic review is to review currently available or in-development technologies that support detection of hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia risk, and identify gaps in the research. Nanomaterial use in sensors is a promising strategy to increase the accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring devices for low glucose values. Hypoglycaemia is associated with changes on vital signs, so electrocardiogram and encephalogram could also be used to detect hypoglycaemia. Accuracy improvements through multivariable measures can make already marketed galvanic skin response devices a good noninvasive alternative. Breath volatile organic compounds can be detected by dogs and devices and alert patients at hypoglycaemia onset, while near-infrared spectroscopy can also be used as a hypoglycaemia alarms. Finally, one of the main directions of research are deep learning algorithms to analyse continuous glucose monitoring data and provide earlier and more accurate prediction of hypoglycaemia. Current developments for early identification of hypoglycaemia risk combine improvements of available 'needle-type' enzymatic glucose sensors and noninvasive alternatives.

After treatment, in the observation group, the score of each of the symptoms of TCM, i.e. unsound sleep, irritability and hot temper, profuse sputum and sticky feeling in the mouth, bitter taste in the mouth and foul breath, abdominal distention and poor appetite, as well as lassitude was reduced as compared with that before treatment successively (P<0.01), and the scores aforementioned (excepted for the unsound sleep) in the observation group were all lower than the control group (P<0.05). The total effective rates were 83.3% (35/42) in the observation group and 84.4% (38/45) in the control group, without statistical difference in comparison (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined treatment of baduanjin and auricular point sticking therapy improves sleep quality, the conditions of anxiety and depression and the symptoms in TCM for patients of COVID-19 with insomnia.

One potential means to provide care while avoiding unnecessary person\\\\to\\\\person contact is to offer remote services (telemedicine). This study aimed to (1) gather real\\\\time information on the use and perception of telemedicine in people living with type 1 diabetes and (2) assess the challenges, such as restricted access to health care and/or medical supplies. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was widely distributed between 24 March and 5 May 2020 using an open\\\\access web\\\\based platform. Data were analysed descriptively, and results were stratified according to age, sex and HbA(1c). RESULTS: There were 7477 survey responses from individuals in 89 countries. Globally, 30% reported that the pandemic had affected their healthcare access due to cancelled physical appointments with their healthcare providers. Thirty\\\\two per cent reported no fundamental change in their medical follow\\\\up during this period, with 9% stating that no personal contact was established with their doctors over the duration of the study. Twenty\\\\eight per cent received remote care through telephone (72%) or video\\\\calls (28%). Of these, 86% found remote appointments useful and 75% plan to have remote appointments in the future. Glucose control, indicated by HbA(1c), was positively associated with positive perception of telemedicine. In males, 45% of respondents with an HbA(1c) > 9% rated telemedicine not useful compared to those with lower HbA(1c,) while 20% of females with an HbA(1c) > 9% rated it not useful ((2) = 14.2, P = .0016). CONCLUSION: Remote appointments have largely been perceived as positive in people with type 1 diabetes with the majority (75%) stating that they would consider remote appointments beyond the pandemic. Age and level of education do not appear to influence perception of telemedicine, whereas poor glucose control, particularly in males, seems to negatively affect perception.","output":"Use and perception of telemedicine in people with type 1 diabetes during the COVID\\\\19 pandemicResults of a global survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Resumption of elective surgery during the current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis has been debated widely and largely discouraged. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to assess the feasibility of resuming elective operations during the current and possible future peaks of this COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We collected data during the peak of the current pandemic in the United Kingdom on adult patients who underwent elective surgery in a COVID-19 free hospital from 8(th) April to 29(th) May 2020. The study included patients from various surgical specialities. Non-elective and pediatric cases were excluded. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality post operatively. Secondary outcomes were the rate of COVID-19 infections, new onset of pulmonary symptoms after hospitalisation, and requirement for admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). RESULTS: A total of 309 consecutive adult patients were included in this study. No patients died nor required ICU admission. Operations graded Intermediate were the most commonly performed procedure representing 91% of the total number. One patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection after being transferred to the nearest local emergency hospital for management of post-operative pain secondary to common bile duct stone and was successfully treated conservatively on the ward. No patient developed pulmonary complications. Three patients were admitted for greater than 23 hours. 27 patients (8.7%) developed complications. Complications graded as 2 and 3 according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 14 and 2 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study shows that, despite the severity and high transmissibility of novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease, COVID-19 free hospitals can represent a safe setting to resume many types of elective surgery during the peak of a pandemic.","output":"Is a COVID-19 free hospital the answer to resuming elective surgery during the current pandemic?

COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family. This disease has spread rapidly around the world and soon became an international public health emergency leading to an unpredicted pressure on the hospital emergency units. Early routine blood biomarkers could be key predicting factors of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality as suggested for C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, prothrombin and D-dimer. This study aims to identify other early routine blood biomarkers for COVID-19 severity prediction disclosed directly into the emergency section. Methods. Our research was conducted on 156 COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Sapienza University Hospital Policlinico Umberto I of Rome, Italy, between March 2020 and April 2020 during the paroxysms initial phase of the pandemic. In this retrospective study, patients were divided into three groups according to their outcome: (1) emergency group (patients who entered the emergency room and were discharged shortly after because they did not show severe symptoms); (2) intensive care unit (ICU) group (patients who attended the ICU after admission to the emergency unit); (3) the deceased group (patients with a fatal outcome who attended the emergency and, afterward, the ICU units). Routine laboratory tests from medical records were collected when patients were admitted to the emergency unit. We focused on Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine kinase (CK), Myoglobin (MGB), Ferritin, CRP, and D-dimer. Results. As expected, ANOVA data show an age morbidity increase in both ICU and deceased groups compared with the emergency group. A main effect of morbidity was revealed by ANOVA for all the analyzed parameters with an elevation between the emergency group and the deceased group. Furthermore, a significant increase in LDH, Ferritin, CRP, and D-dimer was also observed between the ICU group and the emergency group and between the deceased group and ICU group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses confirmed and extended these findings. Conclusions. This study suggests that the contemporaneous presence of high levels of LDH, Ferritin, and as expected, CRP, and D-dimer could be considered as potential predictors of COVID-19 severity and death.","output":"Early Routine Biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 Morbidity and Mortality: Outcomes from an Emergency Section"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the global population adversely The impact is not limited to health only;rather extend to affect the global economy, transport, education and largely the social integrity The impact of COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the marginalized population more intensely The marginalized population in the community are severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic Community support and timely intervention for these population will prevent the spread of infection to these people as well as in the community This review discusses the impact of COVID-19 in the marginalized population and some recommendations to deal with this issue Extensive review of literature done by using the terms of marginalized population (transgender individuals, commercial sex workers, refugees, and migrant workforces, peoples living in prison, old age homes and hospice care) with COVID-19 in the electronic databases","output":"The Health Crisis of Marginalized Populations during COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), aimed at reducing the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic, has dramatically influenced our behaviour in everyday life.

Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and more predictable routines and reducing person-to-person contact activities. Moreover, we show that the stringency of interventions alone does explain the number and duration of visits to venues: individual patterns of visits seem to be influenced by the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions.","output":"Living in a pandemic: adaptation of individual mobility and social activity in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine influenza virus is an emerging, highly contagious, respiratory pathogen that has not previously been radiographically described.

To do this we perform the inference at two levels, assuming one transmission rate parameter for within-household infection, and another transmission rate parameter for infection between different households. We use a simplifying assumption: that between-household infections always occur in naive households; while still performing full joint inference on the within-household infection parameters. In addition, a novel technique is used to remove systematic bias when the number of new infections per day is growing or decaying, as is common in real outbreaks, without the need for contemporaneous estimates of the serial interval. The method is validated on simulated data and is shown to perform well, even when the number of infected households is relatively small.","output":"Inference of population-level disease transmissibility from household-structured symptom onset data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite major setbacks to its health infrastructure and health workforce capacity, Liberia began its first post-graduate training program for physicians in 2013.

We examined the literature to determine whether a history of tobacco use increases risks for adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, LitCovid, Scopus, and Europe PMC (for preprints) using COVID-19 and tobacco-related terms. We included studies of human subjects with lab-confirmed COVID-19 infections that examined tobacco use history as an exposure and used multivariable analyses. The data was collected between March 31(st), 2020, and February 20(th), 2021. Outcomes included mortality, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and illness severity. RESULTS: Among the 39 studies (33 peer-reviewed, 6 preprints) included, the most common outcome assessed was mortality (n = 32). The majority of these studies (17/32) found that tobacco use increased risk, one found decreased risk, and 14 found no association. Tobacco use was associated with increased risk of hospitalization in 7 of 10 studies, ICU admission in 6 of 9 studies, mechanical ventilation in 2 of 6 studies, and illness severity in 3 of 9 studies. One study found that tobacco use history increased risk of pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients. Tobacco use was found to compound risks associated with diabetes (n = 1), cancer (n = 2), and chronic liver disease (n = 1).

IFITM3 localizes to endosomes and can potently restrict the replication of influenza A viruses (IAV) and several other viruses that also enter host cells through the endocytic pathway. Here, we investigate whether IFITMs are involved in protection in ducks, the natural host of influenza virus. We identify and sequence duck IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFITM5. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we demonstrate the upregulation of these genes in lung tissue in response to highly pathogenic IAV infection by 400-fold, 30-fold, 30-fold, and 5-fold, respectively. We express each IFITM in chicken DF-1 cells and show duck IFITM1 localizes to the cell surface, while IFITM3 localizes to LAMP1-containing compartments. DF-1 cells stably expressing duck IFITM3 (but not IFITM1 or IFITM2) show increased restriction of replication of H1N1, H6N2, and H11N9 IAV strains but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Although duck and human IFITM3 share only 38% identity, critical residues for viral restriction are conserved. We generate chimeric and mutant IFITM3 proteins and show duck IFITM3 does not require its N-terminal domain for endosomal localization or antiviral function; however, this N-terminal end confers endosomal localization and antiviral function on IFITM1. In contrast to mammalian IFITM3, the conserved YXX endocytosis signal sequence in the N-terminal domain of duck IFITM3 is not essential for correct endosomal localization. Despite significant structural and amino acid divergence, presumably due to host-virus coevolution, duck IFITM3 is functional against IAV. IMPORTANCE Immune IFITM genes are poorly conserved across species, suggesting that selective pressure from host-specific viruses has driven this divergence. We wondered whether coevolution between viruses and their natural host would result in the evasion of IFITM restriction. Ducks are the natural host of avian influenza A viruses and display few or no disease symptoms upon infection with most strains, including highly pathogenic avian influenza. We have characterized the duck IFITM locus and identified IFITM3 as an important restrictor of several influenza A viruses, including avian strains.

METHODS Combined lysis of thrombus with ultrasound and systemic tissue-plasminogen-activator for emergent revascularization in acute ischemic stroke is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will enroll subjects with the following main inclusion criteria: less than 45 hours from symptom onset (three-hours in US and Canada), age 18-80 years, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score  10, and premorbid modified-Rankin-score of 0-1, eligibility for full dose recombinant tissue-plasminogen-activator. Subjects will receive two-hours of 2-MHz pulsed wave transcranial ultrasound (target group) or sham ultrasound (control group). The projected sample size is approximately 824 subjects. RESULTS The primary endpoint, based on intention-to-treat criteria of patients enrolled within three-hours of symptom onset is the comparison between target and control groups of modified-Rankin-score scores at day 90 poststroke assessed using the proportional odds method. The study will have two planned interim analyses after approximately one-third and two-thirds of subjects have reached the 90-day modified-Rankin-score evaluation. Safety outcomes are symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 h and an overall analysis of adverse events.

Public Health England (PHE) Manchester rapidly escalated testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the highest COVID-19 incidence location in England. The results of the PHE Manchester SARS-CoV-2 surveillance during the first wave are presented. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected for patients fitting the PHE SARS-CoV-2 case definition from 11th February to 31st August 2020. Respiratory tract, tissue, faecal, fluid and cerebrospinal (CSF) samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by a semi-quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. RESULTS: Of the 204,083 tests for SARS-CoV-2, 18,011 were positive demonstrating a positivity of 8.90%. Highest positivity was in nasal swabs (20.99%) followed by broncheo-alveolar lavage samples (12.50%). None of the faecal, fluid or CSF samples received were positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 patients in the North-West of England during the first UK wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Highest positivity rate was in nasal specimens suggesting this is the optimum sample type within this dataset for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

A critical step in the treatment and management of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline, with computed tomography (CT) imaging being a particularly effective method for determining the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT images. More specifically, machine-driven design exploration was leveraged to determine a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we build a customized network design tailored for predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) based on a patients CT scan, initial spirometry measurement, and clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to study the decision-making behavior of Fibrosis-Net as to verify that predictions are based on relevant visual indicators in CT images. Experiments using a patient cohort from the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge showed that the proposed Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the challenge. Furthermore, explainability-driven performance validation demonstrated that the proposed Fibrosis-Net exhibits correct decision-making behavior by leveraging clinically-relevant visual indicators in CT images when making predictions on pulmonary fibrosis progress. Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge, and has been shown to exhibit correct decision-making behavior when making predictions.

METHODS: This manuscript describes the synthesis and characterization of PCL nanoparticles for controlled release of the drug chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine (ClAlPc) as a photosensitizer for application in PDT. The PCL-ClAlPc nanoparticles were developed by the nanoprecipitation process. The structure and morphology of the nanoparticles were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The size of nanomaterials was studied using the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method. Photophysical and photochemical characterizations were performed. Subsequently, photobiological studies were also used to characterize the system. RESULTS: The nanoparticles had an average diameter of 384.7  138.6 nm and a polydispersity index of 0.153. SEM analysis revealed that the system formed a spherical shape typical of these delivery systems. Charging efficiency was 82.1%  1.2%. The phthalocyanine-loaded PCL nanoparticles maintained their photophysical behavior after encapsulation. Cell viability was determined after the dark toxicity test, and it was possible to observe that there was no evidence of toxicity in the dark, for all concentrations tested. The assay also revealed that adenocarcinoma cells treated with free ClAlPc and in the nanoformulation showed 100% cell death when subjected to PDT protocols. The intracellular location of the photosensitizer indicated a high potential for accumulation in the cytoplasm and nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: From the photophysical, photochemical and photobiological analyzes obtained, it was possible to observe that the development of PCL nanoparticles encapsulated with ClAlPc, by the nanoprecipitation method was adequate and that the in vivo release study is efficient to reduce the release rate and attenuate the burst of PS loaded on PCL nanoparticles.

Furthermore, the adapted SIRD model includes time-varying auto-regressive contagion parameters, which dynamically converge according to the stage of the pandemic. This new model is identified through a three-layered procedures, with analytical regressions, Least-Squares optimization runs and auto-regressive model fits. The data-driven model is validated and shown to adequately describe the contagion curves over large forecast horizons. In this model, control input is defined as finitely parametrized values for social distancing guidelines, which directly affect the transmission and infection rates of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The NMPC strategy generates piece-wise constant quarantine guidelines which can be relaxed/strengthen as each week passes. The implementation of the method is pursued through a search mechanism, since the control is finitely parametrized and, thus, there exist a finite number of possible control sequences.

One of the largest problems with COVID-19 is the typical delay in testing and diagnosis that can lead to additional transmission of the disease. Under consultation with a board-certified radiologist, the study team evaluated the common radiological findings of COVID-19 on computed tomography (CT) and compared the efficacy of chest radiographs (i.e., x-rays) to CT in diagnosing COVID-19. METHODS: In 2020, the authors completed a retrospective review of radiologic imaging data (i.e., the original imaging report notes) from Italy performed on 47 patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy during the national outbreak from February to March 2020. Radiologic images were obtained from Societ Italiana di Radiologia Medica e Interventistica radiological database of COVID-19 patients. Each case was analyzed for whether they had positive findings on either chest radiograph or CT or both among patients who had positive COVID-19 test results. RESULTS: The authors found significant radiological finding similarities among the 47 COVID-19 positive case studies from Italy during the February to March 2020 time period. Ground glass opacities and crazy paving were the most significant findings, resembling the findings in China and other Coronavirus strains. The authors statistical analyses indicated that CT scans were more reliable by 30.7% than chest radiographs in identifying signs of COVID-19. In cases where either an initial negative swab for COVID-19 or providers lacked patient social histories, chest radiographs were used to show clinical findings consistent with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, chest radiographs appear to be a consistent method to assist in the diagnosis of most COVID-19 cases.

For example, exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of complications and mortality from COVID-19. Obesity can also exacerbate the damaging effects of air pollution on the lungs and may enhance the association between air pollution and increased COVID-19 severity. Poor sleep is another factor leading to impaired immunity, likely due to the coinciding melatonin depletion.

In the premises of the Covid-19 pandemic, several preliminary studies have highlighted a delay in the perception of risk by individuals, which potentially holds back the implementing of the necessary precautionary measures: people underestimated the risks associated with the virus, and therefore also the importance of complying with sanitary guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, the salience of the threat and of the risk of mortality could then have transformed the way people generate their beliefs. This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world. Here, we propose to explore the evolution of beliefs and behaviors during the Covid-19 crisis, using the theory of predictive coding and the theory of terror management, two influential frameworks in cognitive science and in social psychology.","output":"Coronavirus : cerveau prdictif et gestion de la terreur./ [Coronavirus: Predictive brain and terror management]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within a short period of time, COVID-19 grew into a world-wide pandemic.

Based on reported infection case studies, we construct an epidemiological model that focuses on transmission around the symptom onset. The model is calibrated against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the initial outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical interventions. Mathematical treatment of the model yields explicit expressions for the size of latent and pre-symptomatic subpopulations during the exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic growth rate as input. We then explore reduction of the basic reproduction number R(0) through specific transmission control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and sheltering in place. When these measures are implemented in combination, their effects on R(0) multiply. We also compare our model behaviour to the first wave of the COVID-19 spreading in various affected regions and highlight generic and less generic features of the pandemic development.","output":"Harnessing peak transmission around symptom onset for non-pharmaceutical intervention and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, and China strengthens research on various aspects to allow their athletes to compete successfully in winter sport. Simultaneously, Government-directed initiatives aim to increase public participation in recreational winter sport. These parallel developments allow research to advance knowledge and understanding of the physiological determinants of performance and health related to winter sport. Winter sport athletes often conduct a substantial amount of training with high volumes of low-to-moderate exercise intensity and lower volumes of high-intensity work. Moreover, much of the training occur at low ambient temperatures and winter sport athletes have high risk of developing asthma or asthma-related conditions, such as exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. The high training volumes require optimal nutrition with increased energy and dietary protein requirement to stimulate muscle protein synthesis response in the post-exercise period. Whether higher protein intake is required in the cold should be investigated. Cross-country skiing is performed mostly in Northern hemisphere with a strong cultural heritage and sporting tradition. It is expected that innovative initiatives on recruitment and training during the next few years will target to enhance performance of Chinese athletes in classical endurance-based winter sport. The innovation potential coupled with resourcing and population may be substantial with the potential for China to become a significant winter sport nation. This paper discusses the physiological aspects of endurance training and performance in winter sport highlighting areas where innovation may advance in athletic performance in cold environments. In addition, to ensure sustainable development of snow sport, a quality ski patrol and rescue system is recommended for the safety of increasing mass participation.","output":"The Road to the Beijing Winter Olympics and Beyond: Opinions and Perspectives on Physiology and Innovation in Winter Sport"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nanoparticles represent promising drug carrier systems. In the case of cytostatics such as doxorubicin, carrier colloid systems as human serum albumin (HSA) nanoparticles, may increase their therapeutic efficiency and decrease their side-effects (toxicity) and any potential multidrug resistance. In the present study, doxorubicin, as a widely used antineoplastic agent, was incorporated into the matrix of human serum albumin and three different particle-sized doxorubicin-loaded HSA nanoparticles were prepared, using a previously described desolvation method. Our objective was to find out if different particle sizes of colloid carriers can allow regarding the given cytostatic agent. MATERIAL AND METHODS The three prepared nanoparticles were labelled using technetium (Tc-99m) and were tested for their physicochemical colloidal quality, fluctuations, and radiochemical stability. Biodistribution of different-sized radiolabelled colloids were determined by means of scintigraphic imaging studies in healthy male Wistar rats. Images were taken by gamma camera at several times and organ uptakes were estimated by quantitative ROI analysis. RESULTS In vitro measurements showed that more than 95% of doxorubicin proportion was permanently adsorbed to human serum albumin. Radiolabelled doxorubicin-loaded particles had high-degree and durable labelling efficiency and particle size stability. Biodistribution results had a close correlation to earlier described results of radiocolloids in similar particle size ranges. In vivo examinations verified that colloid carriers have insignificant size fluctuations after an intravenous application and they show the proper distribution according to their particle size. CONCLUSIONS Our investigations verified that different and stable particle sizes make drug carrier HSA nanoparticles possible to apply different drug targeting in a potential clinical use.","output":"In vitro and biodistribution examinations of Tc-99m-labelled doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore and provide contextual meaning around issues surrounding food insecurity, namely, factors influencing food access, as one domain of food security.

PARTICIPANTS Thirty English-speaking individuals (8 males, 22 females) between the ages of 18-70, with varying family composition residing within the Cayo District. RESULTS Participants describe a complex interconnectedness between family- and individual-level barriers to food access. Specifically, family composition, income, education, and employment influence individuals' ability to afford and access food for themselves or their families. Participants also cite challenges with transportation and distance to food sources and educational opportunities as barriers to accessing food. CONCLUSION These findings provide insight around food security and food access barriers in a middle-income country and provide avenues for further study and potential interventions.

Many hospitals reduced their ordinary activity by up to 80%, to leave healthcare staff, wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds available for the significant number of Covid-19 patients. All this resulted in a prolonged wait for hospitalization of all other patients, including those with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) eligible for surgery. The majority of thoracic surgery departments changed the clinical-therapeutic path of patients, re-adapting procedures based on the needs dictated by the pandemic while not delaying the necessary treatment. The establishment of Covid-19-free hub centers allowed some elective surgery in NSCLC patients but most of the operations were delayed. The technology has partly facilitated patients' visits through telemedicine when security protocols have prevented face-to-face assessments. Multidisciplinary consultations had to deal also with the priority of the NSCLC cases discussed. Interpretation of radiologic exams had to take into account the differential diagnosis with Covid-19 infection.

Sputum examination can be useful in diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but is less well established in children. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in induced sputum (IS) specimens from children hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. METHODS. Among children aged 1C59 months, we compared organism detection by multiplex PCR in IS and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. To assess whether organism presence or density in IS specimens was associated with chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia (radiographic pneumonia), we compared prevalence and density in IS specimens from children with radiographic pneumonia and children with suspected pneumonia but without chest radiographic changes or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of pneumonia (nonpneumonia group). RESULTS. Among 4232 cases with World Health OrganizationCdefined severe or very severe pneumonia, we identified 1935 (45.7%) with radiographic pneumonia and 573 (13.5%) with nonpneumonia. The organism detection yield was marginally improved with IS specimens (96.2% vs 92.4% for NP/OP specimens for all viruses combined [P = .41]; 96.9% vs 93.3% for all bacteria combined [P = .01]). After accounting for presence in NP/OP specimens, no organism was detected more frequently in the IS specimens from the radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases. Among high-quality IS specimens, there were no statistically significant differences in organism density, except with cytomegalovirus, for which there was a higher quantity in the IS specimens from cases with radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases (median cycle threshold value, 27.9 vs 28.5, respectively; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS. Using advanced molecular methods with IS specimens provided little additional diagnostic information beyond that obtained with NP/OP swab specimens.","output":"Limited Utility of Polymerase Chain Reaction in Induced Sputum Specimens for Determining the Causes of Childhood Pneumonia in Resource-Poor Settings: Findings From the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The current fabrication methods for micro and nano scale Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices either require high environmental conditions or sophisticated procedures at high cost.

The effects of several critical parameters on the printing process were studied. The dimension of the printed patterns and the printing frequency were preciously controlled by the voltage parameters. The patterns with a network structure was demonstrated. The results indicated that the voltage amplitude and the pulse frequency could both control the dimensions of droplets and the printing frequency.

Pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature but extra\\\\pulmonary manifestations are also common. Factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood and the pathogenesis of SARS\\\\CoV infection remains unclear. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as the functional cellular receptor for SARS\\\\CoV. Studies of the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS\\\\CoV, and ACE2 protein expression, reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of this deadly disease. ACE2 is expressed at high level in the primary target cells of SARS\\\\CoV, namely pneumocytes and surface enterocytes of the small intestine. Despite the fact that SARS\\\\CoV can infect the lung and intestine, the tissue responses in these two organs are different. All other tissues and cell types expressing ACE2 may be potential targets of SARS\\\\CoV infection. Remarkably, endothelial cells, which express ACE2 to a high level, have not been shown to be infected by SARS\\\\CoV. There is also evidence that cell types without detectable ACE2 expression may also be infected by the virus. Furthermore, studies in a new human cell culture model have indicated that the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection. Therefore, other virus receptors or co\\\\receptors may be required in different tissues. Moreover, the interaction between SARS\\\\CoV and the immunological or lymphoid system remains to be defined. It is clear that we are only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS. As our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms improves, a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease.

Maternal and perinatal outcomes were compared in women with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with those with negative tests. KEY FINDINGS: Between March 31st and September 30th, 2020, 1211 pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 5.4% (n = 65), corresponding to (i) 22 ongoing infections at admission, including two with mild clinical symptoms and 20 asymptomatic women; (ii) 43 cases of previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure; (iii) and 1146 women who were negative for both SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serological test. None of the screened mothers required hospital admission for coronavirus disease before or after delivery, nor were any of the newborns admitted to the intensive care unit. All newborns from mothers with positive PCR on admission were PCR negative. There were no significant differences in maternal or perinatal outcomes among the three studied groups.

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 999 community-dwelling residents aged 65-90 years. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect socioeconomic status, social participation, and PA data in August 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between socioeconomic status, social participation, and maintaining PA.

People were mainly advised to remain home quarantined to curb the virus spread. Industrial and vehicular movements were ceased as a result of lockdown, and therefore the rate of pollutants entering the ecosystem also reduced in many places. Water and air pollution remained a major concern in the last few decades as these were gradually deteriorating in many spheres including the hydrosphere and atmosphere. As the nation-wide lockdown period in India completed more than two months, this study attempted to analyze the impact of lockdown on water and air quality to understand the short-term environmental changes. Using remote sensing data, this study demonstrated the improvements in ambient water quality in terms of decreased turbidity levels for a section of the Sabarmati River in the Ahmedabad region of India. The Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) concentrations are evaluated to underline the turbidity levels in the study area before and during the lockdown period using the Landsat 8 OLI images. We noticed that the average SPM has significantly decreased by about 36.48% when compared with the pre-lockdown period; and a drop of 16.79% was observed from the previous year's average SPM. Overall, the average SPM concentration during the lockdown period (8.08 mg/l), was the lowest when compared with pre-lockdown average and long-term (2015C2019) April month average. The atmospheric pollution level (NO2, PM2.5, and PM10) data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board for Ahmedabad city also shows a significant improvement during the study period, implying a positive response of COVID-19 imposed lockdown on the environmental fronts.","output":"COVID-19 and its impact on environment: Improved pollution levels during the lockdown period C A case from Ahmedabad, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 disease has been a pandemic caused by a -coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

To test whether distortions in the age distribution of deaths can track pandemic activity. Methods. We compared weekly distributions of all-cause deaths by age during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States from March to December 2020 with corresponding prepandemic weekly baseline distributions derived from data for 2015 to 2019. We measured distortions via Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and 2 goodness-of-fit statistics as well as deaths among individuals aged 65 years or older as a percentage of total deaths (PERC65+). We computed bivariate correlations between these measures and the number of recorded COVID-19 deaths for the corresponding weeks. Results. Elevated COVID-19-associated fatalities were accompanied by greater distortions in the age structure of mortality. Distortions in the age distribution of weekly US COVID-19 deaths in 2020 relative to earlier years were highly correlated with COVID fatalities (K-S: r = 0.71, P < .001; 2: r = 0.90, P < .001; PERC65+: r = 0.85, P < .001).

Using a re-calibrated agent-based model, we explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions, including case isolation, home quarantine, school closures, and stay-at-home restrictions (i.e., \\"social distancing\\"). Our nowcasting modelling indicated that the levels of reduced interactions in workplaces and across communities attained in Sydney and other parts of the nation were inadequate for controlling the outbreak. A counter-factual analysis suggested that if 70% of the population comply with tight stay-at-home restrictions, then at least 45 days are needed for new daily cases to fall from their peak to below ten per day. Our model successfully predicted that, under a progressive vaccination rollout, if 40-50% of the Australian population follow stay-at-home restrictions, the incidence will stabilise by mid-October 2021.

As ensuring the availability of such supplies during disruptions is critical, the debate on how to increase supply chain resilience in healthcare has gained new momentum. We present empirical evidence from a multi-tier case study spanning nine European medical supplies manufacturers and hospital groups. Based on the resource dependence theory, we investigated procurement-related strategies to improve medical supplies availability. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 39 procurement and supply chain management experts and derived seven propositions on buffering and bridging approaches for managing evolving resource dependencies and thereby strengthening supply chain resilience in a pandemic. Overall, we confirm the resource dependency theory's applicability for explaining companies' mitigation measures in a pandemic disruption. We find that bridging measures within the healthcare supply base, such as offering vertical procurement support for suppliers or leveraging long-term buyer-supplier relationships, are more effective for securing medical supplies than buffering measures. Complementing bridging with buffering, such as extended upstream procurement or resource sharing among hospitals, can lead to superior risk mitigation as capacities of the present supplier base may not suffice. Furthermore, we extend the resource dependence theory by showing that the severity of disruptions caused by a pandemic triggers new forms of buffering external to the HCSC. Both traditional and new buffering measures establish novel flows of medical supplies in the HCSC that can enable higher supply security in a pandemic.","output":"Improving resilience of the healthcare supply chain in a pandemic: Evidence from Europe during the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Christchurch groundwater system is an exceptional water resource with very high drinking water quality supplying all the water requirements of the city. The groundwater system has changed over the years because of rising groundwater abstraction due to increasing population and development. The present (2017) data revealed slightly older 14C ages and increasingly steep west-east age gradients compared to the earlier work from 1976 to 2006, showing continued upflow of deep water into the exploited aquifers which is much older on the east (coastal) side than on the west (inland) side. In addition, the 3H ages for wells on the west side of the system are often much younger than their 14C ages showing that there is input of young shallow water to the wells in addition to the deep water input. Application of a binary model identifies the ages and amounts of the two components, showing that the young component is becoming younger although smaller as a proportion of the flow, and the old component from depth is becoming larger. Newly completed wells near the Waimakariri River have allowed identification of the young component, which is almost entirely composed of very young Waimakariri River seepage at all depths and therefore has very little chemical loading. Instead any chemical input (e.g. chloride, nitrate) to the Christchurch aquifers is being brought in by the old deep component which on the western side of the Christchurch system is derived from rainfall recharge on the developing Ashley-Waimakariri Plains area (plus river seepage). Chemical traces of this deep input from the northwest are at present very subtle, although more appreciable signals are seen in some wells further to the north of Christchurch.

Damage in the lungs of COVID-19 patients is characterized pathologically as diffuse alveolar damage, the degree of which correlates with the severity of the disease. We hypothesized that the ventilatory ratio (VR), a surrogate parameter for the dead space fraction, might stratify the severity of COVID-19 and predict the successful discontinuation of respiratory support. MethodsForty COVID-19 patients in our ICU were enrolled in this study. Respiratory variables were collected from 2 hours (day 0) after the initiation of respiratory support. We monitored the longitudinal values of VR and other respiratory parameters for 28 days. Patients successfully discontinued from respiratory support by day 28 of ICU stay were defined as the successfully discontinued group, while those who died or failed to discontinue were defined as the failed to discontinue group. VR and other respiratory parameters were compared between these groups. ResultsExcept for advanced age, prolonged ventilation period, and higher mortality in the failed to discontinue group, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of any other background or respiratory parameter at 2 hours (day 0) after initiation of respiratory support. Longitudinal VR monitoring revealed significantly higher VR values in the failed to discontinue group than the successfully discontinued group on day 4 of respiratory support. Upon predicting the failure to discontinue respiratory support, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of VR values on day 4 of respiratory support was 0.748. A threshold of 1.56 achieved the highest predictive performance with a sensitivity of 0.667 and a specificity of 0.762. This threshold enabled the prediction of the successfully discontinued outcome at 0.810 of the negative predictive value. ConclusionsElevated VR values on day 4 of respiratory support were predictive of successful discontinuation of respiratory support in patients with severe COVID-19. Longitudinal VR values after initiation of respiratory support can be used as a practical index to stratify severe COVID-19.","output":"Increase in ventilatory ratio indicates progressive alveolar damage and suggests poor prognosis in severe COVID-19: A single-center retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW -Gal syndrome is among a vexing perioperative consideration for anesthesiologists.

Among 532 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative participants, 530 (99.6%) seroconverted with either vaccine. After adjustments for age and gender MEL regression modeling revealed that the average IgG increased after the second dose compared to the first dose (p<0.001).

Our study shows that shaping attitudes and behavioural intention towards certain values, for example towards sustainability, needs clearer manifestation in societies in general, as well as in professional communities.","output":"Ethical Attitudes Among Engineering Students: Some Preliminary Insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids on outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation. METHODS: We used routine care data from 51 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids at 0.8 mg/kg/day eq. prednisone (CTC group) versus standard of care (no-CTC group) among adults 18 to 80 years old with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was intubation or death by day 28. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e., time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 891 patients included in the analysis, 203 were assigned to the CTC group. Use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with risk of intubation or death by day 28 (weighted hazard ratio [wHR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.39) or cumulative death rate (wHR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.98). However, use of corticosteroids was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death by day 28 in the prespecified subgroups of patients requiring oxygen &#8805; 3 L/min (wHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85) or C-reactive protein level &#8805; 100 mg/L (wHR 0.44, 95%CI 0.23 to 0.85). Number of hyperglycaemia events was higher for patients with than without corticosteroids, but number of infections was similar. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between the use of corticosteroids and intubation or death in the broad population of patients 18 to 80 years old with COVID-19 hospitalized in non-intensive care unit settings. However, the treatment was associated with reduced risk of intubation or death for patients with &#8805; 3 L/min oxygen or C-reactive protein level &#8805; 100 mg/L at baseline.

Over 50% develop sleep/wake disturbances (SWDs) that can affect brain development and healing. We hypothesized SWDs would portend worse executive function outcomes in children aged 3C18 years with TBI 1C3 months after hospital discharge. SWDs were defined using the Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (t-scores  60). Outcomes included the Global Executive Composite (GEC, t-score) from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second and Preschool Editions, and multiple objective executive function assessments combined through Principal Components Analysis into a Neurocognitive Index (NCI, z-score). Multiple linear regression evaluated associations between SWDs and executive function outcomes, controlling for covariates. Among 131 children, 68% had clinically significant SWDs, which were associated with significantly worse median scores on the GEC (56 vs. 45) and NCI (?0.02 vs. 0.42; both p < 0.05). When controlling for baseline characteristics and injury severity in multivariable analyses, SWDs were associated with worse GEC (-coefficient = 7.8; 95% Confidence Interval = 2.5, 13.1), and worse NCI (-coefficient = ?0.4; 95% Confidence Interval = ?0.8, ?0.04).

METHODS: We use a susceptible-infected model to estimate the impact of delayed distribution of azithromycin treatment on the prevalence of active trachoma. RESULTS: We identify three distinct scenarios for geographic districts depending on whether the basic reproduction number and the treatment-associated reproduction number are above or below a value of 1. We find that when the basic reproduction number is <1, no significant delays in disease control will be caused. However, when the basic reproduction number is >1, significant delays can occur. In most districts, 1 y of COVID-related delay can be mitigated by a single extra round of mass drug administration. However, supercritical districts require a new paradigm of infection control because the current strategies will not eliminate disease.

This base-level disruptive technology can boost the security and privacy-related efficiency of various domains. As Bangladesh is currently aiming for sustainable development, blockchain technology adoption by local researchers is growing robustly. However, in Bangladesh, the blockchain Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is not yet well structured which is also limiting the perspective of local developers and researchers. Therefore, sectors like governance, healthcare, security, privacy, farming, information authentication, cryptocurrencies, internet architecture, data, and so on are unable to utilize the full potential of this technology. In this research, the authors conduct an in-depth review of such types of blockchain technology-related research articles that have been published recently and are also solely focused on Bangladesh. From 5 publishers (IEEE Xplore, ACM, ScienceDirect, Taylor&Francis, and SpringerLink) this study analyses 70 articles published during the year 2016-2020. The study results find the top 13 sectors where Bangladeshi researchers are currently focusing on. Those studies identify that the rigid policy by the government, scarcity of expert researchers, and lack of resources are the main reasons why Bangladesh is still struggling to accommodate blockchain extensively. In addition, published papers are mostly based on theoretical concepts without an appropriate implementation.

However, the network performance is highly related to architecture design, which commonly requires human experts with domain knowledge. In this paper, we combat this challenge with the recent advance in neural architecture search (NAS) to find an optimal network for CPath applications. In particular, we use differentiable architecture search (DARTS) for its efficiency. We first adopt a probing metric to show that the original DARTS lacks proper hyperparameter tuning on the CIFAR dataset, and how the generalization issue can be addressed using an adaptive optimization strategy. We then apply our searching framework on CPath applications by searching for the optimum network architecture on a histological tissue type dataset (ADP). Results show that the searched network outperforms state-of-the-art networks in terms of prediction accuracy and computation complexity. We further conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the transferability of the searched network to new CPath applications, the robustness against downscaled inputs, as well as the reliability of predictions.","output":"Probeable DARTS with Application to Computational Pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pension funds with the largest assets under management are aware of their responsibility for the future pensions of their members, which is why they are continuously looking for new opportunities for profitable investments with the least possible risk.

We test social science hypotheses for vaccine hesitancy, focusing on partisanship, trust in institutions, and social-demographic characteristics of registered voters. Methods We use survey data from a representative sample of American registered voters collected in November 2020 to study vaccine hesitancy, and the reasons for vaccine hesitancy, at a point in time before the vaccine was available and hence show underlying responses based on beliefs and not on clinical trial data. We use multivariate logistic regression models to test hypotheses on vaccine hesitancy. Results We find that consistently similar groups of people tend to be vaccine hesitant. Specifically, black voters, those between the ages of 45 and 64, female voters, voters without college degrees, voters not worried about the spread of COVID-19, and voters who are concerned about government and the CDC's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, were vaccine hesitant. We also provide intriguing results showing the nuanced reasons that the vaccine hesitant provide. Conclusions Our analysis allows us to establish important baseline information from a social science perspective on vaccine hesitancy at a crucial time, right before COVID-19 vaccines were beginning to be made available to adult Americans.

However, in some cases, these wires may remain in situ and are often considered as a contraindication for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in the future. Therefore, we aimed to provide data about safety and image quality of CMR in these patients. METHODS: This is a report on a subpopulation out of 88 patients after heart transplantation that were included in a prospective cohort study and underwent multiple CMR in their post-transplant course. During CMR, patients were monitored by electrocardiogram and all examinations were observed by a physician to document potential adverse events. Additionally, image quality was assessed by an imaging specialist. RESULTS: Nineteen of 88 patients included had temporary pacing wires in situ. These patients underwent a total of 51 CMR studies. No major adverse event and only one single, mild sensory event could be documented. All CMR studies showed preserved diagnostic image quality. Temporary pacing wires were visible in 100% of HASTE and cine sequences. In less than 50% of the examinations, temporary pacing wires were also visible in T1 and T2 mapping, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences, without any impairment of image quality. CONCLUSIONS: With a low event rate of only one mild adverse event during 51 CMR examinations (2%), CMR appears to be safe in patients with retained temporary epicardial pacing wires after heart transplantation.

He had rapidly evolving ARDS [partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen ratio: 175], and sepsis. Laboratory results showed lymphocytopenia, and increased D-dimer levels (7.7 g/ml; normal: 0C0.5 g/ml). The patient was treated in the intensive care unit. On day-1, ARDS-net/prone positioning ventilation, and empiric anti-COVID treatment integrating prophylactic anticoagulation was administered. On hospital day-2, the patient developed shock with worsening oxygenation. Point-of-care-ultrasound depicted a large thrombus migrating from the right atrium to the pulmonary circulation. Intravenous alteplase (100 mg over 2 h) was administered as rescue therapy. The patient made an uneventful recovery, and was discharged to home isolation (day-20) on oral rivaroxaban.

In the phase 3 PALACE trials, pts reached remission (REM)/low disease activity (LDA) targets at 52 wks most frequently when early APR treatment was initiated and pts were in moderate disease activity, as measured by Clinical Disease Activity Index for PsA (cDAPSA) score. In APPRAISE, we assessed APR effectiveness/tolerability in pts with PsA in routine clinical practice in Canada. Objectives: This interim efficacy analysis focused on the available data on APR effectiveness measuring rate of achieving cDAPSA REM or LDA at 12 mos and Pt Acceptable Symptom Status (PASS) results. Methods: The prospective, multicenter, observational APPRAISE study assessed APR effectiveness/tolerability in adults with active PsA in routine clinical care enrolled from July 2018-March 2020. Pts were followed from treatment initiation to 12 mos, with visits suggested every 4 mos. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the rate of achieving at least LDA (cDAPSA <14) at 12 mos. Pt-reported outcome measures were assessed. Data reported are as observed in pts continuing APR treatment. Results: In total, 101 pts were enrolled in APPRAISE. Mean age was 52 yrs;56% were women. Mean (SD) PsA duration at baseline (BL) was 6 (8) yrs. Oligoarticular disease (4 joint involvement) was most common (41%), followed by polyarticular (35%). Most pts (92%) received prior conventional DMARDs and 17% received prior biologic therapy;concomitant MTX was reported in 41% at BL. By 12 mos, 41/101 enrolled pts discontinued, 35 reached 12 mos follow-up (4 mos: n=92;8 mos: n=61), and 25 have yet to reach 12 mos. The majority (92%) of discontinuations due to lack/loss of effectiveness or AEs occurred within 4-8 mos. AEs were primarily GI related early in treatment. The proportion of pts with continued APR achieving cDAPSA REM/LDA treatment targets increased significantly over time (Figure 1). Significant reductions were seen over 12 mos in swollen/tender joint counts and plaque psoriasis, with reduced mean (SD) body surface area of -4% (9%) (Table 1). Prevalence of dactylitis/enthesitis at BL, 4, 8, and 12 mos was 17%/33%, 9%/24%, 5%/19%, and 0%/21%, respectively. Pain assessment (VAS) significantly improved over time. The proportion of pts achieving PASS with continued APR increased significantly over 12 mos (BL: 27%;12 mos: 65%) (Figure 1). COVID restrictions impacted in-office assessment visits, necessitating reliance on virtual visits. Conclusion: Pts with PsA receiving APR were assessed at regular intervals in routine clinical care in Canada. This interim analysis revealed a greater number of pts receiving APR (66%) who completed the 12-mo follow-up achieved REM or LDA, as measured by cDAPSA over 12 mos. A majority of pts (65%) reported satisfaction with their disease state, as measured by PASS.

This chapter describes that the immune aggregate should be incubated for 1 hour at 37C and then left in the cold overnight. This is the optimum approach for a system, where the concentration of neither the antigen nor the antiserum is known, and maximum clumping is needed. However, with many systems these parameters have been established, and if it is known that clumping can be obtained readily, for example, as with the avian infectious bronchitis system, then incubation for 1 hour at 37C is sufficient, followed by spinning at 10,000 rpm for half an hour. Viruses in the small to intermediate size range are ideal for immune studies, as the particles are not disproportionately larger than the antibody molecules attached to them, and interaction between them can be visualized with better than 10 a resolution. Particles as large as the poxviruses are becoming too large for good resolution of antibody molecules to be obtained, and aggregates of poxvirus particles are usually too dense to be recorded photographically except at low power. In the field of clinical virology, there is a possibility that the electron microscope technique of negative staining will become a standard method of diagnosis.

A significant advantage of MIF over the currently investigated dietary changes is its feasibility. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim to study the effects of MIF on skin, gut, and metabolic health in psoriasis patients. METHODS: A 2-arm pilot randomized controlled open cross-over study will be performed in 24 patients with psoriasis. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either start with 12 weeks of MIF and go on a subsequent regular diet for another 12 weeks or start with 12 weeks of regular diet and do subsequent MIF for 12 weeks. The following parameters will be assessed: demographics, disease phenotype, medical and familial history, psoriasis severity, dermatology-specific and general quality of life, nutritional and physical habits, mental and intestinal health, intestinal and cutaneous integrity, inflammatory and metabolic markers, and satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 24 participants have been enrolled in the study. The final visit is foreseen for June 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The aim is to uncover the effects of MIF on psoriasis severity and gut health integrity through clinical and molecular investigation. More precisely, we want to map the evolution of the different markers, such as psoriasis severity, permeability, and inflammation, in response to MIF as compared to a regular diet,. Understanding how dietary lifestyles can affect epithelial lineages, such as the skin and gut, will greatly improve our understanding of the development of psoriasis and may offer a nonpharmacological venue for treatments.

In addition, these challenges may be exacerbated for children living in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as South Africa where there are already barriers such as poverty, access to resources and availability of support. Understanding the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on children with ASD is imperative in order to create awareness as well as provide equitable services and support to both children with ASD and their families. PURPOSE: The study aimed to explore family-reported changes for children with ASD and their reactions and responses to the Covid-19 restrictions in South Africa. METHOD: A qualitative research design was employed. Twelve families consisting of different family compositions with a total of 21 family members (mothers, fathers and grandmothers) participated in the current study using semistructured interviews. Data were transcribed and analysed using a framework method for thematic analysis. RESULTS: Findings indicated that children with ASD present with unique challenges related to Covid-19. Negative themes such as children's obstructive reactions due to the immediate changes to their routines, increases in emotional dysregulation as well as loss of previously acquired skills as a result of lack of access to services during lockdown were reported. However, families also reported on positive changes such as improved social interactions as children became more accustomed to their new lockdown routines. IMPLICATIONS: The Covid-19 response has had a negative impact on children with disabilities, specifically around access to services and support for both children with ASD and their families.

Reasons for this increase are understandable in the context of individual level factors such as self-isolation, lockdown, grief, survivor guilt, and other factors but also broader social and economic factors such as unemployment, insecure employment and resulting poverty, especially as the impacts of 2008 recession are still being felt in many countries further accompanied by social isolation. For those who are actively employed a fear of job and income loss and those who have actually become ill and recovered or those who have lost family and friends to illness, it is not surprising that they are stressed and feeling the psychological impact. Furthermore, multiple uncertainties contribute to this sense of anxiety. These fears and losses are major immediate stresses and undoubtedly can have long-term implications on mental health. Economic uncertainty combined with a sense of feeling trapped and resulting lack of control can contribute to helplessness and hopelessness where people may see suicide as a way out. Taking a macro view, we present a statistical model of the impact of unemployment, and national income declines, on suicide, separately for males and females over the life cycle in developed countries. This impact may reflect a potent combination of social changes and economic factors resulting in anomie. The governments and policymakers have a moral and ethical obligation to ensure the physical health and well-being of their populations. While setting in place preventive measures to avoid infections and then subsequent mortality, the focus on economic and social recovery is crucial. A global pandemic requires a global response with a clear inter-linked strategy for health as well as economic solutions. The models we have constructed represent predictions of suicide rates among the 38 highly industrialized OECD countries over a period of 18 years (2000C2017). Unemployment has a major effect on increasing suicide, especially in middle-aged groups. However, the impact of economic decline through losses of national income (GDP per capita) are substantially greater than those of unemployment and influence suicide throughout the life course, especially at the oldest ages.","output":"Acceleration of Anxiety, Depression, and Suicide: Secondary Effects of Economic Disruption Related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In view of the globally evolving Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, German hospitals rapidly expanded their intensive care capacities. However, it is possible that even with an optimal use of the increased resources, these will not suffice for all patients in need. Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary authors group with support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethico-legal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supra-individual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. Assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient's general health status prior to the current illness.","output":"Entscheidungen ber die Zuteilung intensivmedizinischer Ressourcen im Kontext der COVID-19-Pandemie : Klinisch-ethische Empfehlungen der DIVI, der DGINA, der DGAI, der DGIIN, der DGNI, der DGP, der DGP und der AEM./ [Decisions on the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic : Clinical and ethical recommendations of DIVI, DGINA, DGAI, DGIIN, DGNI, DGP, DGP and AEM.

Therefore, data about complications experienced during use of the drug are limited. This is the first published case series (1 case report exists) to describe remdesivir infiltration in 3 patients with COVID-19. SUMMARY: In the first case, a 91-year-old woman experienced remdesivir infiltration resulting in edema, hematoma at the area of infiltration; on palpation, the affected area felt cooler than the surrounding areas. Swelling was still present after 6 weeks. In the second case, remdesivir infiltration occurred in a 72-year-old male, resulting in edema, hematoma, and pain at the area of infiltration. The hematoma lasted for 7 days. The third case concerned a 67-year-old woman, in whom remdesivir infiltration led to edema and a small hematoma. The hematoma regressed to a negligible size within 3 days. However, a week after infiltration, redness had reappeared. In 2 cases, the patient was immediately treated with hyaluronidase injections, but no specific treatments were provided in the other case. CONCLUSION: Based on the product information provided by remdesivirs manufacturer, we believe symptoms and signs observed in the 3 cases may have resulted from the low pH (~4) of the nonbuffered remdesivir solution, although the patients were not formally assessed for caustic injury. Previous experience with other noncytotoxic medications suggests that infusion-specific factors (eg, volume of leaked fluid) and patient-specific factors (eg, advanced age) may have a role in the outcome of remdesivir infiltration. The possibility of symptoms caused by cyclodextrins in the formulation or by intrinsic toxicity of remdesivir warrants exploration.","output":"Peripheral infiltration of remdesivir in 3 patients with COVID-19: Case series and discussion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND We describe blood supply and usage from March to December 2020 in two research medical hospitals in the Apulia region of Italy: Research Hospital \\"Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza\\" (Centre 1) and University Hospital of Bari (Centre 2).

RESULTS Blood donations were lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a significant reduction in red blood cells (RBC) transfused (-29% in 2020 vs 2019) and fewer transfusions in 2020 in the Internal Medicine departments (-67% and -44% in Centres 1 and 2, respectively) and Intensive C are Units (ICUs) (-53% and -54% in Centres 1 and 2, respectively). The overall number of fatalities was significantly lower in 2020 than in 2019; the proportion of fatalities in men was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (53.9% and 41.5%, respectively; p=0.000).

We showed that conditional inducible H2A.Z deletion blocked memory-enhancing effects of androgen depletion (induced by gonadectomy), and of pharmacological inhibition of the androgen receptor with flutamide. Similarly, H2A.Z deletion blocked the memory-reducing effects of DHT, and DHT treatment in cultured hippocampal neurons altered H2A.Z binding, suggesting that AR is an H2A.Z regulator in neurons.

In January, 2020, state, local, and federal public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient's symptom onset date. Contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested. FINDINGS: Patient 1-a woman in her 60s-returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to Patient 2.

In addition to effective public awareness, legal and spiritual approaches were utilized to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country of Belize. From March 2020 when the first case was confirmed, the methods employed to curb spread were so effective that no new case was reported for over 50 days. In an attempt to reopen the country for business, the success of effectively preventing widespread of the COVID-19 made the government ease some of the strict preventive measures of community spread.

As part of a national ambulatory care policy, HAH for cancer intravenous treatments is becoming a priority. This work aims to describe the specificities of ICI infusion at home. Methods: Through national hospital database (PMSI), all patients with at least one ICI infusion in 2019 were identified. Patients characteristics and ICI infusion specificities in hospitals and in HAH were described. Patients journeys (time to infusion in HAH, time spent in HAH protocols, alternation of infusion in HAH and in hospitals after HAH infusion initiation) were retrospectively analyzed (maximum of 5-year prior period) using swimmer plots and clustering algorithms. Results: In 2019, 36,526 patients received ICI at least once in hospitals including 60 who had infusions at home. Patients treated at home were 62.2 years old (65.5 yo in hospitals) and 61.7% male (67.4% in hospitals). HAHs patients suffered from lung cancer (77%;61% in hospitals) and melanoma (23%;14% in hospitals). HAH patients were mainly treated with nivolumab (58%, 54% in hospitals). Seven out of 22 French regions experienced home ICI infusion (min:1;max:21 patients). Average time from first infusion in hospitals to HAH initiation was close to one year (341 days, [95%CI 268-413]) and average time spent between first and last infusion in HAH was 115 days [95%CI 80-150]). Two types of HAH management protocol were observed: All infusions in HAH and Alternation of infusions in HAH and hospitals.

The aim of this study is to delineate the associations of COVID-19, SSC and NLPR3 rs10157379 T > C and NLPR3 rs10754558 C > G variants; and the protective role of SSC in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We recruited COVID-19 patients, 308 with critical, 63 with moderate and 157 with mild disease. Increased SSC protects against SARS, critical disease, and death due to COVID-19. Increasing age, male sex and rs10754558 CG significantly reduce SSC protection. The rs10157379 CT and rs10754558 GG genotypes are positively associated with SARS. Partial Least Squares analysis shows that a) 41.8% of the variance in critical COVID-19 symptoms is explained by SSC and oxygen saturation (inversely associated), inflammation, chest computed tomography abnormalities, increased body mass index, SARS and age (positively associated); and b) the effects of the NLRP3 rs10157379 and rs10754558 variants on critical COVID-19 are mediated via SSC (protective) and SARS (detrimental). SSC includes anosmia and dysgeusia, and maybe gastrointestinal symptoms. In conclusion, intersections among the rs10754558 variant, age, and sex increase risk towards critical COVID-19 by attenuating SSC.

It has a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild infection to severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation. In the middle of a pandemic, when medical resources (including mechanical ventilators) are scarce, there should be a scoring system to provide the clinicians with the information needed for clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a scoring system based on the data obtained on admission, to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study included COVID-19 patients admitted to Sina Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences from February 20 to May 29, 2020. Patients data on admission were retrospectively recruited from Sina Hospital COVID-19 Registry (SHCo-19R). Mul-tivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to identify the predictive factors for mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 681 patients were included in the study;74 patients (10.9%) needed mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, while 607 (89.1%) did not. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that age (OR,1.049;95% CI:1.008-1.091), history of diabetes mellitus (OR,3.216;95% CI:1.134-9.120), respiratory rate (OR,1.051;95% CI:1.005-1.100), oxygen saturation (OR,0.928;95% CI:0.872-0.989), CRP (OR,1.013;95% CI:1.001-1.024) and bicarbonate level (OR,0.886;95% CI:0.790-0.995) were risk factors for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization.

N95 respirators are commonly used to protect healthcare workers from respiratory pathogens, including the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and are increasingly employed by other frontline workers and the general public. Under routine circumstances, these masks are disposable, single-use items, but extended use and reuse practices have been broadly enacted to alleviate critical supply shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. While extended-time single use presents a low risk of pathogen transfer, repeated donning and doffing of potentially contaminated masks presents increased risk of pathogen transfer. Therefore, efficient and safe decontamination methods for N95 masks are needed to reduce the risk of reuse and mitigate local supply shortages. Here we review the available literature concerning use of germicidal ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light to decontaminate N95 masks. We propose a practical method for repeated point-of-use decontamination, using commercially-available UV-C crosslinker boxes from molecular biology laboratories or a simple low-cost, custom-designed and fabricated device to expose each side of the mask to 800-1200 mJ/cm2 of UV-C. We measure the dose that penetrated to the interior of the respirators and model the potential germicidal action on SARS-CoV-2. Our experimental results, in combination with modeled data, suggest that a two-minute UV-C treatment cycle should induce a >3-log-order reduction in viral bioburden on the surface of the respirators, and a 2-log order reduction throughout the interior. The resulting exposure is 100-fold less than the dose expected to damage the masks, facilitating repeated decontamination. As such, UV-C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is a practical strategy for small-scale point-of-use decontamination of N95s.","output":"Principles and Practice of SARS-CoV-2 Decontamination of N95 Masks with UV-C"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seen many cardiopulmonary rehabilitation services delivering programmes remotely One area of concern is how to assess exercise capacity when a supervised exercise test is not possible The aim of this review was to examine the relationship between functional exercise tests and recommended exercise tests for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation Methods: A rapid narrative review was carried out Searches were conducted by two of the study authors The study had the following features Participants: adults, all with long-term conditions;intervention: any/none;outcome: Duke activity status index (DASI), sit to stand (STS, 30 s, 1 min and 5 repetitions), short physical performance battery (SPPB), 4-metre gait speed (4MGS) or step test (Chester/others) AND directly compared to one of the recommended exercise tests for cardiopulmonary rehabilitation: 6-min walk test (6MWT), incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) or cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in terms of reporting agreement/correlation;Study design: primary research only, controlled trials or observational studies Results: Sixteen articles out of 249 screened were included (n=2271 patients) Overall, there were weak-strong correlations for the included tests with a recommended exercise test (r=0 38-0 85) There were few reported issues with feasibility or safety of the tests However, all tests were supervised in a clinical setting The test that had the highest correlation with the field walking test was the 4MGS with the ISWT (r=0 78) and with the 6MWT (r=0 85) Discussion: The 4MGS has the highest correlation with routine measures of exercise tolerance However, it may be difficult to standardise in a remote assessment or to prescribe exercise from Clinicians should strive for face-to-face standardised exercise tests where possible to be able to guide exercise prescription","output":"Which functional outcome measures can we use as a surrogate for exercise capacity during remote cardiopulmonary rehabilitation assessments?

However, MV itself can trigger ventilator-associated lung injury in patients. We hypothesized that the mechanisms of lung injury through redox imbalance might also be associated with pulmonary inflammatory status, which has not been so far described. We tested it by delivering different tidal volumes to normal lungs undergoing MV. Healthy Wistar rats were divided into spontaneously breathing animals (control group, CG), and rats were submitted to MV (controlled ventilation mode) with tidal volumes of 4 mL/kg (MVG4), 8 mL/kg (MVG8), or 12 mL/kg (MVG12), zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP), and normoxia (FiO(2) = 21%) for 1 hour. After ventilation and euthanasia, arterial blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lungs were collected for subsequent analysis. MVG12 presented lower PaCO(2) and bicarbonate content in the arterial blood than CG, MVG4, and MVG8. Neutrophil influx in BALF and MPO activity in lung tissue homogenate were significantly higher in MVG12 than in CG. The levels of CCL5, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 in lung tissue homogenate were higher in MVG12 than in CG and MVG4. In the lung parenchyma, the lipid peroxidation was more important in MVG12 than in CG, MVG4, and MVG8, while there was more protein oxidation in MVG12 than in CG and MVG4. The stereological analysis confirmed the histological pulmonary changes in MVG12.

PCR-based tests are the gold standard for the confirmation of COVID-19, but immunological tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection are widely available and play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Nanomechanical sensors are biosensors that work based on a change in the mechanical response of the system when a foreign object is added. In this paper, a graphene-based nanoresonator sensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection was introduced and analyzed by using the finite element method (FEM). The sensor was simulated by coating a single-layer graphene sheet (SLGS) with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 antigen. In the following, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses were randomly distributed on the SLGSs, and essential design parameters of the nanoresonator, including frequency shift and relative frequency shift, were evaluated. The effect of the SLGS size, aspect ratio and boundary conditions, antibody concentration, and the number of viruses variation on the frequency shift and relative frequency shift were investigated. The results revealed that, by proper selection of the nanoresonator design variables, a good sensitivity index is achievable for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 virus even when the number of the viruses are less than 10 per test. Eventually, according to the simulation results, by using SLGS geometry determination, an analytical relationship is presented to predict the limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor with the required sensitivity index.

The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), Satisfaction with Online Study Scale (SAT-5), and Feelings Towards Study Obligations Scale (FETSOS) were used to assess the constructs and the relations observed within the study. RESULTS: The results indicate that more than half of all respondents reported high levels of stress. The difference in the reported levels of perceived stress between genders were statistically significant (N=4454, F(2)=56.719, P<.001, Cohen d=0.35). Overall, the results suggest that a decline in the motivation to study, the quality of internet and mobile connections, and the presence of distracting factors in the study space were the 3 main factors related to the students negative emotions as associated with the timeliness, performance, and quality of the study obligations. Furthermore, the results show that the level of satisfaction with online study affected stress such that the higher the satisfaction, the lower the stress.

In this work, the spread of Covid-19 is modelled as a differentiable game between the planner and population with appropriate disease spread dynamical equations. We first characterise the equilibrium dynamics of only the population with modifed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) equations to highlight the qualitative nature of the equilbrium. Using this result, we formulate the joint equilibrium exposure profile between the planner and population. Additionally, as in case of Covid-19, the role of asymptomatic carriers, inadequacies in testing, contact tracing and quarantining can lead to a significant underestimate of the true infected numbers as compared to just the detected numbers. Therefore, it is vital to model the true infected numbers within the context of choices made by individuals within the population. To incorporate this, we extend our framework by modifying the dynamics to include additional sub-compartments of \`undetected infected' and \`detected infected' in the disease dynamics.

It rapidly spread and many cases were identified in multiple countries, posing a global health problem. Here, we report the first patient cured of COVID-19 infection in Changsha, China, and the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and management of this patient are all described in this report. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman developed cough and fever after returning to Changsha from Wuhan on January 9, 2020. She tested positive for COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis which was supported by chest CT. The patient was treated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets and interferon alfa-2b injection. A low dose of glucocorticoids was used for a short period to control bilateral lung immune response, and this patient avoided being crushed by cytokine storms that might have occurred. The clinical condition of this patient improved, and a COVID-19 assay conducted on January 25, 2020 generated negative results. This patient recovered and was discharged on January 30, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there are numerous reports on COVID-19 infections focusing on the disease's epidemiological and clinical characteristics. This case describes the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and management of a patient cured of COVID-19 infection, which may serve as reference for future cases, while further studies are needed.","output":"First patient management of COVID-19 in Changsha, China: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory disease that has been spread all over the globe. Therefore, it is an urgent requirement to identify and develop drugs for this contagious infection. The papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 performs critical functions in virus replication and immune evasion, making it an enticing therapeutic target. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV PLpro proteases have significant similarities, and an inhibitor discovered for SARS-CoV PLpro is an exciting first step toward therapeutic development. Here, a set of antiviral molecules were screened at the catalytic and S-binding allosteric sites of papain-like protease (PLpro). Molecular docking results suggested that five molecules (44560613, 136277567, S5652, SC75741, and S3833) had good binding affinities at both sites of PLpro. Molecular dynamics analysis like root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and hydrogen bond results showed that identified molecules with PLpro tend to form stable PLpro-inhibitor(s) complexes. Molecular Mechanics/Position-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) analysis confirmed that antiviral molecules bound PLpro complex had lower energy (-184.72  7.81 to -215.67  6.73 kJ/mol) complexes.

The virus responsible for COVID-19-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-gains entry into host cells via ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). ACE2 is a primary enzyme within the key counter-regulatory pathway of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which acts to oppose the actions of Ang (angiotensin) II by generating Ang-(1-7) to reduce inflammation and fibrosis and mitigate end organ damage. As COVID-19 spans multiple organ systems linked to the cardiovascular system, it is imperative to understand clearly how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may affect the multifaceted RAS. In addition, recognition of the role of ACE2 and the RAS in COVID-19 has renewed interest in its role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in general. We provide researchers with a framework of best practices in basic and clinical research to interrogate the RAS using appropriate methodology, especially those who are relatively new to the field. This is crucial, as there are many limitations inherent in investigating the RAS in experimental models and in humans. We discuss sound methodological approaches to quantifying enzyme content and activity (ACE, ACE2), peptides (Ang II, Ang-[1-7]), and receptors (types 1 and 2 Ang II receptors, Mas receptor). Our goal is to ensure appropriate research methodology for investigations of the RAS in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and COVID-19 to ensure optimal rigor and reproducibility and appropriate interpretation of results from these investigations.","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, COVID-19, and the Renin-Angiotensin System: Pressing Needs and Best Research Practices."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The assessment of population mental health relies on survey data from representative samples, which come with considerable costs. Drawing on research which established that absolutist words (e.g. never) are semantic markers for depression, we propose a new measure of population mental health based on the frequency of absolutist words in online search data (absolute thinking index; ATI). Our aims were to first validate the ATI, and to use it to model public mental health dynamics in France and the UK during the current COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we extracted time series for a validated dictionary of 19 absolutist words, from which the ATI was computed (weekly averages, 2019C2020, n = 208) using Google Trends. We then tested the relationship between ATI and longitudinal survey data of population mental health in the UK (n = 36,520) and France (n = 32,000). After assessing the relationship between ATI and survey measures of depression and anxiety in both populations, and dynamic similarities between ATI and survey measures (France), we tested the ATIs construct validity by showing how it was affected by the pandemic and how it can be predicted by COVID-19-related indicators. A final step consisted in replicating ATIs construct validity tests in Japan, thereby providing evidence for the ATIs cross-cultural generalizability. ATI was linked with survey depression scores in the UK, r = 0.68, 95%CI[0.34,0.86],  = 0.23, 95%CI[0.09,0.37] in France and displayed similar trends. We finally assessed the pandemics impact on ATI using Bayesian structural time-series models. These revealed that the pandemic increased ATI by 3.2%, 95%CI[2.1,4.2] in France and 3.7%, 95%CI[2.9,4.4] in the UK. Mixed-effects models showed that ATI was related to COVID-19 new deaths in both countries  = 0.14, 95%CI[0.14,0.21].

But what baseline should be chosen? We propose two novel approaches: an alternative retrospective baseline derived from the lowest weekly death rates achieved in previous years and a within-year baseline based on the average of the 13 lowest weekly death rates within the same year. These baselines express normative levels of the lowest feasible target death rates. The excess death rates calculated from these baselines are not distorted by past mortality peaks and do not treat non-pandemic winter mortality excesses as inevitable. We obtained weekly series for 35 industrialized countries from the Human Mortality Database in 2000C2020. Observed, baseline and excess mortalities were measured by age-standardized death rates. We assessed weekly and annual excess death rates driven by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and those related to seasonal (predominantly) respiratory infections in earlier years. There was a distinct geographic pattern with high excess death rates in Eastern Europe followed by parts of the UK, and countries of Southern and Western Europe. Some Asia-Pacific and Scandinavian countries experienced lower excess mortality. In 2020 and earlier years, the alternative retrospective and the within-year excess mortality figures were higher than estimates based on conventional metrics. While the latter were typically negative or close to zero in normal years without extraordinary epidemics, the alternative estimates were substantial. Cumulation of this usual excess over 2C3 years results in human losses comparable to those caused by COVID-19. Challenging the view that non-pandemic seasonal winter mortality is inevitable would focus attention on reducing premature mortality in many countries. As SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be the last respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause a pandemic, such measures would also strengthen global resilience in the face of similar threats in the future.","output":"What should be the baseline when calculating excess mortality?

Home collection occurred within 2 h of semen processing. Patient sperm parameters, FR (#2PN/MII), D5-UQBR (# transferable and freezable quality blastocysts/# 2PN), and PR in fresh transfer cycles were compared between clinic and home groups with t-tests. The association between time to processing on outcomes was assessed with regression modeling, controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Mean male age was 37.9 years in the clinic group and 37.2 years in the home group (p = 0.380). On average, men were abstinent for 3.0 days (SD 1.7) in the clinic group and 4.1 days (SD 5.4) in the home group (p = 0.028).

Nevertheless, coronary heart disease remains the major cause of death in developed and developing countries and chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) are still a major target of utilization of non-invasive cardiac imaging and invasive procedures. Current guidelines recommend the use of non-invasive imaging in patients with CCS to identify subjects at higher risk to be referred for invasive coronary angiography and possible revascularization. These recommendations are challenged by two opposite lines of evidence. Recent trials have somewhat questioned the efficacy of coronary revascularization as compared with optimal medical therapy in CCS. As a consequence the role of imaging in these patients and in in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy is under debate.

Its genome encodes accessory genes that differ significantly within coronaviruses and contribute to the virus pathogenicity. Among accessory genes, open reading frame 8 (ORF8) stands out by being highly variable and showing structural changes suspected to be related with the virus ability to spread. However, the function of ORF8 remains to be elucidated, making it less studied than other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Here I show that ORF8 is poorly conserved among related coronaviruses. The ORF8 phylogeny built using 11,113 SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed traces of a typical expanding population with a small number of highly frequent lineages. Interestingly, I detected several nonsense mutations and three main deletions in the ORF8 gene that either remove or significantly change the ORF8 protein. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can persist without a functional ORF8 protein. Deletion breakpoints were found located in predicted hairpins suggesting a possible involvement of these elements in the rearrangement process.

The same approach is possible in the field of mental health. However, a commonly levelled (but misguided) criticism prevents systems modelling from being more routinely adopted, namely, that the presence of uncertainty around key model input parameters renders a model useless. This study explored whether radically different simulated trajectories of suicide would result in different advice to decision makers regarding the optimal strategy to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on mental health. Using an existing system dynamics model developed in August 2020 for a regional catchment of Western Australia, four scenarios were simulated to model the possible effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of psychological distress. The scenarios produced a range of projected impacts on suicide deaths, ranging from a relatively small to a dramatic increase. Discordance in the sets of best-performing intervention scenarios across the divergent COVID-mental health trajectories was assessed by comparing differences in projected numbers of suicides between the baseline scenario and each of 286 possible intervention scenarios calculated for two time horizons; 2026 and 2041. The best performing intervention combinations over the period 2021C2041 (i.e., post-suicide attempt assertive aftercare, community support programs to increase community connectedness, and technology enabled care coordination) were highly consistent across all four COVID-19 mental health trajectories, reducing suicide deaths by between 23.9C24.6% against the baseline. However, the ranking of best performing intervention combinations does alter depending on the time horizon under consideration due to non-linear intervention impacts. These findings suggest that systems models can retain value in informing robust decision making despite uncertainty in the trajectories of population mental health outcomes. It is recommended that the time horizon under consideration be sufficiently long to capture the full effects of interventions, and efforts should be made to achieve more timely tracking and access to key population mental health indicators to inform model refinements over time and reduce uncertainty in mental health policy and planning decisions.","output":"Sound Decision Making in Uncertain Times: Can Systems Modelling Be Useful for Informing Policy and Planning for Suicide Prevention?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a current analysis of the effect of coronavirus pandemic on select global stock indexes (SSE Composite Index [China], Euronext 100 [Europe], Dow Jones Industrial Average [United States of America] Objective: the objective of the paper is to evaluate the extent and direction of the differential effect of COVID-19 pandemic on select world stock index Method: data on stock value performance were gathered for fifty days before and fifty days within the Coronavirus epidemic;data were analysed using the paired t-test of difference in mean stock values at an alpha level of 0 05(5%) Findings: Results reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has different effects on the stock markets Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a significant reduction in mean stock value during the coronavirus period, Chinese Stock Exchange Composite Index experienced a significant increase in mean stock values during epidemic higher than before the epidemic On the contrary, the S&P 500 and the Euronext 100 indexes show a non-significant difference in mean stock price Implications: The paper provides direction to stock market participants, investors and speculators regarding a safer investment destination during this time of COVID-19 pandemic;the paper serves a good case study for class room teaching and also provides direction for further research Value: this paper provides the first empirical research on the early effect of COVID-19 pandemic on three global important regional stock indexes, which finds that some stock markets such as the Shanghai Composite Index is resilient to COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Global Stock Market Values: A Differential Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe ability to quantify an immune response after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential.

MethodsSamples from 30 healthy participants, aged 18-55 years, who received two injections with mRNA-1273 at a dose of 25 g (n=15) or 100 g (n=15), were collected at Days 1 (first vaccination), 15, 29 (second vaccination), 43 and 57. ACOV2S results (shown in U/mL - equivalent to BAU/mL per the first WHO international standard) were compared with results from ELISAs specific to antibodies against the Spike protein (S-2P) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) as well as neutralization tests including nanoluciferase (nLUC80), live-virus (PRNT80), and a pseudovirus neutralizing antibody assay (PsVNA50). ResultsRBD-specific antibodies were already detectable by ACOV2S at the first time point of assessment (d15 after first vaccination), with seroconversion before in all but 2 participants (25 g dose group); all had seroconverted by Day 29. Across all post-baseline visits, geometric mean concentration of antibody levels were 3.27-7.48-fold higher in the 100 g compared with the 25 g dose group. ACOV2S measurements were highly correlated with those from RBD ELISA (Pearsons r=0.938; p<0.0001) and S-2P ELISA (r=0.918; p<0.0001). For both ELISAs, heterogeneous baseline results and smaller increases in antibody levels following the second vs first vaccination compared with ACOV2S were observed.

Employees of Philips Japan, Ltd. were recruited to participate in COVID-19 screening from October to December 2020. Asymptomatic individuals (n = 824) submitted self-collected saliva samples. Samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR in both 10-sample pools and individual tests. We also surveyed participants regarding their thoughts and behaviors after the PCR screening project. Two of the 824 individuals were positive by RT-qPCR. In the pooled testing, one of these two had no measurable Ct value, but showed an amplification trend at the end of the PCR cycle. Both positive individuals developed cold-like symptoms, but neither required hospitalization. Of the 824 participants, 471 responded to our online questionnaire. Overall, while respondents agreed that PCR screening should be performed regularly, the majority were willing to undergo PCR testing only when it was provided for free or at low cost. In conclusion, pooled testing of saliva samples can support frequent large-scale screening that is rapid, efficient, and inexpensive.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR testing of pooled saliva samples: A case study of 824 asymptomatic individuals and a questionnaire survey in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although conventional pain relief therapeutics have centered around mu-opioid agonists, these drugs are limited by adverse side effects, including respiratory depression and addiction potential. The ongoing opioid epidemic has galvanized research into novel analgesic therapies with more favorable profiles. New pharmacologic agents have been developed to target neuronal pathways involved in pain sensation. Certain receptors have been recognized to mediate nociceptive transmission, central sensitization, and the development of chronic pain states. OBJECTIVES We conducted a literature review to identify potential targets for novel analgesic therapies. STUDY DESIGN This study is a narrative review of potential analgesic targets. We characterize their antinociceptive mechanisms of action and evaluate their therapeutic potential. METHODS A systemized search of available literature on novel analgesics was performed. A search was performed through the PubMed database to identify articles with key words of \\"novel analgesics,\\" \\"novel non-opioid analgesics,\\" \\"novel pain targets,\\" and \\"non-opioid analgesics.\\" Potential drug classes were identified and researched through corresponding keywords, with an emphasis on publications from 2018 to 2020. Older articles were included if frequently referenced by current literature. RESULTS Potential novel analgesic targets include Nav1.7, Nav1.8, CaV2.2, and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) cation channel receptors in the peripheral nervous system. Other approaches disrupt the synthesis of pronociceptive signaling molecules such as nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Within central pain pathways, modification of kappa-opioid, delta-opioid, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and cannabinoid receptors have been investigated in chronic pain and hyperalgesia models. Recent advances in molecular technology have also presented opportunities to modify protein expression or the cellular genome altogether. LIMITATIONS Several analgesic targets have only demonstrated efficacy in preclinical trials. There are limited data evaluating the long-term safety profiles of therapies further on in development. CONCLUSIONS We provide an overview of potential analgesic therapies in various stages of development, which may become clinically relevant in the near future. Some drugs such as TRPV1 agonists, anti-IL-6, and anti-nerve growth factor antibodies have demonstrated analgesic effect in specific clinical pain states.","output":"Receptor and Molecular Targets for the Development of Novel Opioid and Non-Opioid Analgesic Therapies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a case report of a 63-year-old African American female with a past medical history most significant for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma that presented for evaluation of persistent shortness of breath. Initial workup was remarkable for refractory anemia, moderate schistocytes on peripheral smear and lab work suggestive of a hemolytic anemia. Due to concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), she subsequently underwent several rounds of plasma exchange without significant improvement. Secondary to progressive renal failure, patient eventually had a renal biopsy with findings remarkable for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Simultaneously, patient was also diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. After a few weeks of supportive care, she was stable for discharge. Unfortunately, she did become dialysis dependent. Prior to hospital admission, she was being treated for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and had received chemotherapy with gemcitabine. Her last chemotherapy session was approximately 3 weeks prior to her first hospitalization. Furthermore, although her hemolytic work did suggest TMA, it was not consistent with the diagnosis of TTP. She was transferred to a tertiary care center where hemolytic labs were trended, and supportive care was maximized. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to further investigate the pathophysiology of TMA in patients with active malignancies and COVID-19 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first case of TMA in a patient with both metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and COVID-19 infection.","output":"Thrombotic Microangiopathy in a Patient With COVID-19 Infection and Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract COVID-19 has become one of the worst infectious disease outbreaks of recent times, with over 2.1 million cases and 120,000 deaths so far. Our study investigated the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features of 63 patients with COVID-19 in Beijing. Patients were classified into four groups, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill. The mean age of our patients was 47 years of age (range 3C85) and there was a slight male predominance (58.7%). Thirty percent of our patients had severe or critically ill disease, but only 20% of severe and 33% of critically ill patients had been to Wuhan. Fever was the most common presentation (84.1%), but cough was present in only slightly over half of the patients. We found that lymphocyte and eosinophils count were significantly decreased in patients with severe disease (p = 0.001 and p = 0.000, respectively). Eosinopenia was a feature of higher levels of severity. Peripheral CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes were significantly decreased in severe and critically ill patients, but there was only a non-statistically significant downward trend in NK cell numbers with severity. Of note is that liver function test including AST, ALT, GGT and LDH were elevated, and albumin was decreased. The inflammatory markers CRP, ESR and ferritin were elevated in patients with severe disease or worse. IL-6 levels were also higher, indicating that the presence of a hyperimmune inflammatory state portends higher morbidity and mortality.

Differentiation between pure viral COVID-19 pneumonia and secondary infection can be challenging. In patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission physicians often decide to prescribe antibiotic therapy. However, overuse of anti-infective therapy in the pandemic should be avoided to prevent increasing antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin (PCT) and CRP have proven useful in other lower respiratory tract infections and might help to differentiate between pure viral or secondary infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 between 6th March and 30th October 2020. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory findings with focus on PCT and CRP levels and microbiology results were evaluated. Patients with and without secondary bacterial infection in relation to PCT and CRP were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the best discriminating cut-off value of PCT and CRP with the corresponding sensitivity and specificity was calculated. RESULTS: Out of 99 inpatients (52 ICU, 47 Non-ICU) with COVID-19, 32 (32%) presented with secondary bacterial infection during hospitalization. Patients with secondary bacterial infection had higher PCT (0.4 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p = 0.016) and CRP (131 versus 73 mg/L; p = 0.001) levels at admission and during the hospital stay (2.9 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001 resp. 293 versus 94 mg/L; p < 0.001). The majority of patients on general ward had no secondary bacterial infection (93%). More than half of patients admitted to the ICU developed secondary bacterial infection (56%). ROC analysis of highest PCT resp. CRP and secondary infection yielded AUCs of 0.88 (p < 0.001) resp. 0.86 (p < 0.001) for the entire cohort. With a PCT cut-off value at 0.55 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 91% with a specificity of 81%; a CRP cut-off value at 172 mg/L yielded a sensitivity of 81% with a specificity of 76%. CONCLUSION: PCT and CRP measurement on admission and during the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 may be helpful in identifying secondary bacterial infections and guiding the use of antibiotic therapy.","output":"C-reactive protein and procalcitonin for antimicrobial stewardship in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have diverse compositions, from traditional inac-tivated virus vaccines to various new-generation vaccines.

Increasing evidence shows that the microbiota plays a role in disease progression and severity, but long-term and international multicenter assessment of the variations in viral and bacterial communities as drivers of exacerbations are lacking. METHODS: Two-hundred severe COPD patients from Europe and North America were followed longitudinally for 3 years. We performed nucleic acid detection for 20 respiratory viruses and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial microbiota in 1179 sputum samples collected at stable, acute exacerbation and follow-up visits. RESULTS: Similar viral and bacterial taxa were found in patients from the USA compared to Bulgaria and Czech Republic but their microbiome diversity was significantly different (P < 0.001) and did not impact exacerbation rates. Virus infection was strongly associated with exacerbation events (P < 5E-20). Human rhinovirus (13.1%), coronavirus (5.1%) and influenza virus (3.6%) constitute the top viral pathogens in triggering exacerbation. Moraxella and Haemophilus were 5-fold and 1.6-fold more likely to be the dominating microbiota during an exacerbation event. Presence of Proteobacteria such as Pseudomonas or Staphylococcus amongst others, were associated with exacerbation events (OR > 0.17; P < 0.02) but more strongly associated with exacerbation frequency (OR > 0.39; P < 4E-10), as confirmed by longitudinal variations and biotyping of the bacterial microbiota, and suggesting a role of the microbiota in sensitizing the lung.

The emergence of new variants, particularly during relaxation of social distancing policies and implementation of mass vaccination, highlights the need for real-time integration of detailed patient clinical data alongside pathogen genomic data. We linked clinical data with viral genome sequence data to compare patients admitted during the first and second waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Clinical, laboratory and demographic data from five electronic health record (EHR) systems was collected for all cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test between March 13th 2020 and February 17th 2021. SARS-CoV-2 viral sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore Technology. Descriptive data are presented comparing cases between waves, and between cases of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 variants. Results: There were 5810 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive cases comprising inpatients (n=2341), healthcare workers (n=1549), outpatients (n=874), emergency department (ED) attenders not subsequently admitted (n=532), inter-hospital transfers (n=281) and nosocomial cases (n=233). There were two dominant waves of admissions starting from around March 13th and October 20th, both with a temporally aligned rise in nosocomial cases (n=96 in wave one, n=137 in wave two). 1470 SARS-CoV-2 isolates were successfully sequenced, including 216/838 (26%) admitted cases from wave one, 472/1503 (31%) admitted cases in wave two and 121/233 (52%) nosocomial cases. 400/472 (85%) of sequenced isolates from admitted cases in wave two were the B.1.1.7 variant. The first B.1.1.7 variant was identified on 15th November 2020 and increased rapidly to comprise almost all sequenced isolates in January 2021 (n=600/617, 97%). Females made up a larger proportion of admitted cases in wave two (47.2% vs 41.8%, p=0.012), and in those infected with the B.1.1.7 variant compared to non-B.1.1.7 variants (48.0% vs 41.8%, p=0.042). A diagnosis of frailty was less common in wave two (11.5% v 22.8%, p<0.001) and in the group infected with B.1.1.7 (14.5% v 22.4%, p=0.001). There was no difference in severity on admission between waves, as measured by hypoxia at admission (wave one: 64.3% vs wave two: 65.6%, p=0.658). However, a higher proportion of cases infected with the B.1.1.7 variant were hypoxic on admission compared to other variants (70.0% vs 62.5%, p=0.029). Conclusions: Automated EHR data extraction linked with SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data provides valuable insight into the evolving characteristics of cases admitted to hospital with COVID-19. The proportion of cases with hypoxia on admission was greater in those infected with the B.1.1.7 variant, which supports evidence the B.1.1.7 variant is associated with more severe disease. The number of nosocomial cases was similar in both waves despite introduction of many infection control interventions before wave two, an observation requiring further investigation.","output":"First and second SARS-CoV-2 waves in inner London: A comparison of admission characteristics and the effects of the B.1.1.7 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Este trabalho foi realizado por alunos do Ensino Mdio do campus Niteri do Colgio Pedro II, no perodo de 2015 a 2016, com o apoio do Programa de incentivo a Projetos de Pesquisa de Iniciao Cientfica Jnior da Pr-Reitoria de PsGraduao, Pesquisa, Extens?o e Cultura do Colgio Pedro II (PROPGPEC).

However, conventional supervised deep learning models are incapable of recognizing novel diseases that do not exist in the training dataset. Automated early-stage detection of novel infectious diseases can be vital in controlling their rapid spread. Moreover, the development of a conventional CAD model is only possible after disease outbreaks and datasets become available for training (viz. COVID-19 outbreak). Since novel diseases are unknown and cannot be included in training data, it is challenging to recognize them through existing supervised deep learning models. Even after data becomes available, recognizing new classes with conventional models requires a complete extensive re-training. The present study is the first to report this problem and propose a novel solution to it. In this study, we propose a new class of CAD models, i.e., Deep-Precognitive Diagnosis, wherein artificial agents are enabled to identify unknown diseases that have the potential to cause a pandemic in the future.

The model is also tested on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV samples as unseen diseases and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. The proposed model eliminates the need for model re-training by creating a new class in real-time for the detected novel disease, thus classifying it on all subsequent occurrences.

STUDY DESIGN: Since cross-reactivity with common cold human coronaviruses occurs, serological testing includes a risk of false-positive results. Therefore, the selected cohort for RST-validation was based on combined immunoassay (presence of specific antibodies) and RT-qPCR (presence of SARS-CoV-2) data. RST-performance for FP blood and serum was assessed by performing each RST in two groups, namely SARSCoV- 2 positive (n=108) and negative healthcare workers (n=89). Differences in accuracy and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for a range (1-50%) of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates. RESULTS: The OrientGene showed overall acceptable performance, with sensitivities of 94.4% and 100%, and specificities of 96.6% and 94.4%, using FP blood and serum, respectively. Although three RST reach optimal specificities (100%), the OrientGene clearly outperforms in sensitivity. At a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence rate of 40%, this RST outperforms the other tests in NPV (96.3%) and reaches comparable PPV (94.9%). Although the specificity of the Covid-Presto is excellent when using FP blood or serum (100% and 97.8%, respectively), its sensitivity decreases when using FP blood (76.9%) compared to serum (98.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Performances of the evaluated RST differ largely. Only one out of five RST (OrientGene) had acceptable sensitivity and specificity using FP blood. Therefore, the latter could be used for seroprevalence studies in a high-prevalence situation.

Consequently, stroke therapies that can suppress deleterious effects of ischemic injury are desperately needed. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been recently suggested to beneficially influence experimental stroke outcomes by converting the vasoconstrictor Ang II into the vasodilator Ang 1C7. In this review, we extensively discuss the protective functions of ACE2-Ang (1C7)-MasR axis of renin angiotensin system (RAS) in ischemic stroke.","output":"The Role of the ACE2/MasR Axis in Ischemic Stroke: New Insights for Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic situation has created many challenges for maintaining positive relationships between fast fashion retailers and their suppliers. In the proposed paper it is assumed that strong and ethical relationships may be beneficial for all supply chain members, especially in the era of global pandemic. Therefore, the aforementioned issues (fast fashion retailers ethical behavior towards suppliers) constituted the subject of the paper. Our knowledge about relationships between fast retail chains and their suppliers in the times of global pandemic is relatively week. Trying to fill the gap, this paper discussed relationships between fast fashion retail chains and their suppliers customers on the basis of literature review and case study research. Purpose: The aim of the paper was to indicate the scope of activities undertaken by retailers and addressed at suppliers by fast fashion retail chains in pandemic times. The following goals of descriptive and cognitive character were assumed in the paper: (a) Identification of the fast fashion retailers common behavior in the era of pandemic, and (b) indication of ethical practices applied by fast fashion retail chains which are beneficial for all retail chain members, based on the Inditex example. Methodology: Based on the theoretic deliberation of retail chain relationships with suppliers in the pandemic times, qualitative research was conducted to supplement the theoretical background. The purpose of this study was to identify how fast fashion retailers maintain relationships with their suppliers in supply chains. The conducted research enabled us to reveal answers to the following research questions: What are good practices of fast fashion retailers in terms of relationships with suppliers? Can socially responsible, trustworthy fast fashion retailers stay profitable in the Covid-19 pandemic? The theoretical deliberation was based on a critical literature review. The empirical part of the paper was based on case study research. The conducted research was descriptive in nature, conducted in order to describe a particular phenomenon within its context, and was not intended to provide conclusive evidence, but to have a better understanding of the problem. A descriptive intrinsic case study was the method applied in the research. Results: On the grounds of literature studies, as well as collected information, we can state that close and ethical cooperation with suppliers, based on socially responsible relationships, are becoming a more and more important part of the strategy for commercial chains. There are companies that use any legal measures to not fulfil their obligations as contractors and avoid paying for orders completed and in production. The descriptive case study research allowed us to observe, analyze, and report good practices of fast fashion retailers in terms of relationships with their suppliers based on the Inditex example. The theoretical contribution: On the grounds of the case study, we can state that during pandemic times fast fashion retail chains have focused on the development of relationships with suppliers, which means changing from transactional to relationship marketing in cooperation strategies. Practical implications (if applicable): The paper provided intellectual input into the managerial problem of how to develop mutual beneficiary relationships between fast retail chains and their suppliers. The study suggests that fast fashion retail chains have to take into consideration growing customer expectations, which regard their cooperations strategies toward suppliers.","output":"To What Extent Retail Chains Relationships with Suppliers Make the Business TrustworthyAn Empirical Study on Fast Fashion in Pandemic Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our theoretically driven cluster-randomized cohort control study sought to understand how psychosocial safety climate (PSC)-a climate to protect worker psychological health-could be built in different organizational change scenarios. We drew on event system theory to characterize change (planned vs. shock) as an event (observable, bounded in time and space, nonroutine) to understand how events connect and impact organizational behavior and features (e.g., job design, PSC). Event 1 was an 8-month planned intervention involving training middle managers to enact PSC in work units and reduce job stressors. Event 2 was the shock COVID-19 pandemic which occurred midintervention (at 4 months). Three waves (T1, 0 months; T2, 4 months; T3, 8 months) of data were collected from experimental (295T1, 224T2, 119T3) and control (236T1, 138T2, 83T3) employees across 22 work groups. Multilevel analysis showed in Event 1 (T1T2) a significant Group  Time effect where PSC (particularly management priority) significantly increased in the experimental versus control group. Under Event 2 (T2T3), PSC was maintained at higher levels in the experimental versus control group but both groups reported significantly increased PSC communication and commitment. Results suggest that middle management training increases PSC within 4 months. Event 2, COVID-19 was shocking and its novelty, disruption, criticality, and timing in Australian industrial history enabled a strong top management response, positively affecting the control group. PSC may be sustained and built in times of shock with top management will, the application of PSC principles, and a top-level pro-psychological health agenda.

THE CASE: In our COVID-19 ICU a 49-year-old male patient was admitted, with past medical history of obesity, smoking and diabetes, but no reported atherosclerotic complications. The patient had been admitted with severe hypoxemia and multiple pulmonary emboli were CT-confirmed. ICU-treatment included mechanical ventilation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Preparing the insertion of a new radial artery catheter for invasive blood pressure measurement and blood sampling, we detected that both radial arteries were non-pulsating and occluded: (a) Sonography showed the typical anatomical localization of both radial and ulnar arteries. However, Doppler-derived flow-signals could only be obtained from the ulnar arteries. (b) To test collateral arterial supply of the hand, a pulse-oximeter was placed on the index finger. Thereafter, the ulnar artery at the wrist was compressed. This compression caused an immediate loss of the finger's pulse-oximetry perfusion signal. The effect was reversible upon release of the ulnar artery. (c) To test for collateral perfusion undetectable by pulse-oximetry, we measured regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the thenar muscle by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Confirming our findings above, ulnar arterial compression demonstrated that thenar rSO2 was dependent on ulnar artery flow. The described development of bilateral radial artery occlusion in a relatively young and therapeutically anticoagulated patient with no history of atherosclerosis was unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: Since COVID-19 patients are at increased risk for arterial occlusion, it appears advisable to meticulously check for adequacy of collateral (hand-) perfusion, avoiding the harm of hand ischemia if interventions (e.g., catheterizations) at the radial or ulnar artery are intended.","output":"First, do no harm: bilateral radial artery occlusion in a COVID-19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of a chest X-ray (CXR) score and of clinical and laboratory data in predicting the clinical course of patients with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: This is a pilot multicenter retrospective study including patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ERs in three hospitals in Italy between February and March of 2020. Two radiologists independently evaluated the baseline CXR of the patients using a semi-quantitative score to determine the severity of lung involvement: a score of 0 represented no lung involvement, whereas scores of 1 to 4 represented the first (less severe) to the fourth (more severe) quartiles regarding the severity of lung involvement. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected. The outcome of patients was defined as severe if noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation was necessary, or if the patient died. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 140 patients. Most of the patients were symptomatic (132/138; 95.7%), and 133/140 patients (95.0%) presented with opacities on CXR at admission. Of the 140 patients, 7 (5.0%) showed no lung involvement, whereas 58 (41.4%), 31 (22.1%), 26 (18.6%), and 18 (12.9%), respectively, scored 1, 2, 3, and 4. In our sample, 66 patients underwent NIV or intubation, 37 of whom scored 1 or 2 on baseline CXR, and 28 patients died.

This survey was launched in February 2021 and ran for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose &#8805;7 days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. The survey was completed by 2002 respondents of whom 26.6% had a prior COVID-19 infection. A prior COVID-19 infection was associated with an increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (1.05-1.11)), fever (2.24 (1.86-2.70)), breathlessness (2.05 (1.28-3.29)), flu-like illness (1.78 (1.51-2.10)), fatigue (1.34 (1.20-1.49)) and local reactions (1.10 (1.06-1.15)). It was also associated with an increased risk of severe side effects leading to hospital care (1.56 (1.14-2.12)). While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 (1.01-1.11)) compared with viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p < 0.001), mostly local reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine recipients reported a considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR < 0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 (0.31-0.58)).

DESIGN: Multiphase, prospective mixed methods study. SETTING: Remote data collection and social media channels in the United Kingdom, 14 April to 1 August 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 13 adults (aged 18 years) with self-reported long covid and 10 clinicians evaluated content validity. 274 adults with long covid field tested the draft questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Published systematic reviews informed development of SBQ-LCs conceptual framework and initial item pool. Thematic analysis of transcripts from cognitive debriefing interviews and online clinician surveys established content validity. Consensus discussions with the patient and public involvement group of the Therapies for Long COVID in non-hospitalised individuals: From symptoms, patient reported outcomes and immunology to targeted therapies (TLC Study) confirmed face validity. Rasch analysis of field test data guided item and scale refinement and provided initial evidence of the SBQ-LCs measurement properties. RESULTS: SBQ-LC (version 1.0) is a modular instrument measuring patient reported outcomes and is composed of 17 independent scales with promising psychometric properties. Respondents rate their symptom burden during the past seven days using a dichotomous response or 4 point rating scale. Each scale provides coverage of a different symptom domain and returns a summed raw score that can be transformed to a linear (0-100) score. Higher scores represent higher symptom burden. After rating scale refinement and item reduction, all scales satisfied the Rasch model requirements for unidimensionality (principal component analysis of residuals: first residual contrast values <2.00 eigenvalue units) and item fit (outfit mean square values within 0.5 -1.5 logits). Rating scale categories were ordered with acceptable category fit statistics (outfit mean square values <2.0 logits). 14 item pairs had evidence of local dependency (residual correlation values >0.4). Across the 17 scales, person reliability ranged from 0.34 to 0.87, person separation ranged from 0.71 to 2.56, item separation ranged from 1.34 to 13.86, and internal consistency reliability (Cronbachs alpha) ranged from 0.56 to 0.91.

In this study, we examined the profile of mast cell activation markers in the serum of COVID-19 patients. We noticed that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients showed increased carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3) and decreased serotonin levels in their serum when compared with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. CPA3 levels correlated with C-reactive protein, the number of circulating neutrophils, and quick SOFA. CPA3 in serum was a good biomarker for identifying severe COVID-19 patients, whereas serotonin was a good predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Extensive clinical use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients. This highlights the need for the development of new anti-herpesviral drugs with novel targets. Herein the effects of a plant anthraquinone, emodin, on the HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity and virus yields were investigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HSV-1 alkaline nuclease activity was examined by nuclease activity assay. Inhibition of virus yields was measured by plaque reduction assay and immunohistochemical staining. Interaction between emodin and alkaline nuclease was analysed by docking technology. KEY RESULTS: Emodin specifically inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease in a biochemical assay. Plaque reduction assay revealed that emodin reduced the plaque formation with an EC(50) of 21.54.4 M. Immunohistochemical staining using the anti-nucleocapsid protein antibody demonstrated that emodin induced the accumulation of viral nucleocapsids in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner. Docking analysis further suggested that the inhibitory effect of emodin on the UL12 activity may result from the interaction between emodin and critical catalytic amino acid residues of UL12.

Also, this study aimed to explore the OTs perspective on the role of telerehabilitation during this pandemic lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS Online cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS 114 OTs completed the survey. The results of this study showed that 52.8% of therapists had stress and anxiety due to COVID-19 lockdown. We found that 60.7% of OTs (n=65) used telerehabilitation, versus 36.1% (n=39) before the lockdown. Telerehabilitation approaches were mostly implemented during this lockdown for children with autistic problems (66.6%), stroke (12.9%), cerebral palsy (6.4%), learning disabilities (9.6%), Parkinson's diseases (1.6%), and other medical conditions (2.8%). 10% of therapists reported that they lost their job, and 76% reported that this lockdown affected their income negatively.

The confidence degree for excluding cardiac thrombi was significantly higher than for LIE (4.40.8 vs. 3.41.3, p<0.0001). DSCT identified a CE source in 4 (8%) and LIE in 24 (48%) patients. The iodine ratio of CE sources was significantly lower compared to the left atrial appendage of patients with no CE sources (0.250.1 mg/mL vs. 0.910.2 mg/mL, p<0.0001). TEE/cardiac CT, performed in 20 (40%) patients, identified a CE source in 5 (25%) cases, whereas DSCT identified 4 (20%), leading to a sensitivity and specificity of 80% (95% CI 28-99%) and 100% (95% CI 78-100%) respectively (kappa 0.86). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we identified DSCT as a potential unsophisticated approach for the early triage of CE sources among patients with AIS undergoing CTA upon admission.","output":"Early Triage of Cardioembolic Sources Using Chest Spectral Computed Tomography in Acute Ischemic Stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This experience report addresses one of five goals in a National Science Foundation project aligned to the research question: How does the implementation of a collaborative, multi-institutional learning community of faculty, staff, and administrators change the perceptions, attitudes and knowledge about the transfer process in undergraduate computing and engineering education? The transfer learning community (TLC) created to answer this question was composed of faculty and staff from a mid-sized research university and six partner community colleges. Over four years, members of the TLC participated in meetings and activities focused on articulation and curriculum alignment, cross-institutional advising, and interventions to support long-term, data-driven change to improve transfer student success, especially for women and underrepresented groups in undergraduate computing and engineering. Building common ground among faculty and staff across diverse computing and engineering departments at different institutions required time, trust, and intentional planning. Benefits of the TLC were particularly salient in the last project year (2019-20), when TLC leaders applied feedback from participants requesting more synergistic meetings and relevant activities and addressed shared concerns around transitioning to a fully remote educational model due to COVID-19 campus closures. Using data from surveys, interviews, and meeting transcripts, this paper will discuss lessons learned from this experience in the context of undergraduate computing and engineering education;how to use these lessons to support inclusive excellence in our post-pandemic higher education realities;and recommendations for adapting the TLC model for inter- and intra-institutional collaborations and partnerships for broadening successful transfer pathways in computing and engineering education. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Building Common Ground: An Inter-Institutional Computing Engineering Education Transfer Learning Community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Critically ill 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are 10 to 40 times more likely to die than the general population. Although progression from mild to severe COVID-19 has been associated with hypoxia, uncontrolled inflammation, and coagulopathy, the mechanisms involved in the progression to severity are poorly understood. METHODS: The virome of tracheal aspirates (TA) from 25 COVID-19 patients under IMV was assessed through unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and correlation analyses were conducted using available clinical data. Unbiased sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs (NS) from mild cases and TA from non-COVID patients were included in our study for further comparisons. RESULTS: We found higher levels and differential expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) genes in TA from critically ill and deceased patients when comparing nasopharyngeal swabs from mild cases to TA from non-COVID patients. In critically ill patients, higher HERV-K levels were associated with early mortality (within 14 days of diagnosis) in the intensive care unit. Increased HERV-K expression in deceased patients was associated with IL-17-related inflammation, monocyte activation, and an increased consumption of clotting/fibrinolysis factors. Moreover, increased HERV-K expression was detected in human primary monocytes from healthy donors after experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our data implicate the levels of HERV-K transcripts in the physiopathology of COVID-19 in the respiratory tract of patients under invasive mechanical ventilation.

As in humans, clinical outcome in dogs is variable, ranging from acute death to asymptomatic infections or chronic heart disease. In order to characterize cardiac manifestations of T. cruzi infections, we tracked a cohort of naturally-infected dogs and a matched cohort of uninfected dogs. We hypothesized that selected measures of cardiac disease (abnormal rate, abnormal rhythm, and elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI; a biomarker of cardiac injury)) would occur more commonly in infected than uninfected dogs matched by age, breed, sex and location. In addition to the clearly positive and negative dogs, we specifically tracked dogs with discordant test results across three independent serological assays to gather clinical data that might elucidate the infection status of these animals and inform the utility of the different testing approaches. RESULTS We placed an ambulatory ECG monitor (Holter) on 48 government working dogs and analyzed 39 successful recordings that met length and quality criteria from 17 T. cruzi-infected, 18 uninfected dogs and 4 dogs with discordant results. Overall, 76.5% of positive, 100.0% of discordant, and 11.1% of negative dogs showed > 1 ECG abnormality (p < 0.0001), and positive and discordant dogs had a higher mean number of different types of ECG abnormalities than negative dogs (p < 0.001-0.014). The most common cardiac abnormalities included supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and atrioventricular block. Positive dogs had higher serum concentrations of cTnI than both negative dogs (p = 0.044) and discordant dogs (p = 0.06). Based on dog handler reports, nearly all (4/5; 80%) dogs with reported performance decline or fatigue were T. cruzi-infected dogs. CONCLUSIONS Further understanding cardiac manifestations in dogs naturally infected with T. cruzi is critical for prognostication, establishing a baseline for drug and vaccine studies, and better understanding of zoonotic risk.","output":"Selected cardiac abnormalities in Trypanosoma cruzi serologically positive, discordant, and negative working dogs along the Texas-Mexico border."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe cases of COVID\\\\19, caused by novel coronavirus SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2, have been associated with a hyperinflammatory state.(Huang, Wang et al. 2020) This has been described as a form of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH)(Bergsten, Horne et al. 2017) that may contribute to increased mortality.(Ramos\\\\Casals, Brito\\\\Zeron et al. 2014) Screening with the HScore(Fardet, Galicier et al. 2014) to identify cases has been recommended to guide immunosuppressive therapy(Mehta, McAuley et al. 2020).","output":"Secondary HLH is uncommon in severe COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pathologic and laboratory investigations are essential when identification of the specific cause of bovine respiratory disease is needed.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS 890 ten-year-old children from the Generation R Cohort were subjected to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging for body composition (BMI, fat mass index (FMI), android-to-gynoid fat mass ratio, visceral fat index, liver fat fraction). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood sampling for detailed immunophenotyping of leukocytes by 11-color-flow cytometry at 10 years. RESULTS The following statistically significant associations were observed: 1SD increase in total FMI was associated with +8.4% (95%CI 2.0;15.2) V2 +V9 + and +7.4% (95%CI 2.4;12.5) CD8 +TEMRO cell numbers. 1SD increase in visceral fat index was associated with +10.7% (95%CI 3.3;18.7) V2 +V9 + and +8.3% (95%CI 2.6;14.4) CD8 +TEMRO cell numbers. Higher android-to-gynoid fat mass ratio was only associated with higher V2 +V9 + T cells. Liver fat was associated with higher CD8 +TEMRO cells but not with V2 +V9 + T cells. Only liver fat was associated with lower Th17 cell numbers: 1SD increase was associated with -8.9% (95%CI -13.7;-3.7) Th17 cells.

To date, limited research has been undertaken on how the administration route affects the overall treatment costs and the implications for this on UK clinical practice. The objective was to explore the cost implications of different administration routes for plaque psoriasis biologic interventions in the UK. METHODS: A simple economic model was developed to estimate and compare the total cost of drug administration over 2 years for all biologic interventions that have been approved by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence for use in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Administration costs were estimated for two different scenarios: administration in a hospital setting or following home delivery [paid for by the National Health Service (NHS)]. RESULTS: Costs of home delivery and administration in hospital over a 2-year time horizon varied substantially based on the choice of intervention. For home delivery, the lowest cost of 693 occurred with risankizumab, tildrakizumab and ustekinumab, while the highest cost of 3445 occurred with adalimumab, brodalumab, certolizumab and etanercept. For the scenario in which the interventions were administered in a hospital setting the costs ranged from 4224 for ustekinumab to 7463 for brodalumab. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that drug administration costs are meaningful and should be given greater consideration in the selection process of treatments for plaque psoriasis.

Within these patients, 13 lesions in 12 patients who developed local tumor progression in the follow-up period of at least 8 months were retrospectively reviewed. Imaging obtained before and after RFA was used for creating fused images on a workstation. Ablative margins were assessed using only axial images, and with fused images. RESULTS The ablative margin was assessed as sufficient in all 13 lesions using side-by-side axial images; however, all lesions were assessed as insufficient with fused imaging evaluation. The reason for the discrepancy of the assessment results were differences in the respiratory dislocation of the liver in the pre- and post-RFA images in eight lesions (61.5%), and rotational displacement of the liver and the torso in five (38.5%). The site of local tumor recurrence relative to the HCC lesion was craniocaudal in 12 lesions, dorsoventral in seven and lateral in seven. In all lesions, the site of local tumor recurrence was congruent with the area of the thinnest ablative margin.

This study assessed the effect of a nationwide lockdown in France on admissions for acute surgical conditions and the subsequent impact on postoperative mortality. METHODS: This was an observational analytical study, evaluating data from a national discharge database that collected all discharge reports from any hospital in France. All adult patients admitted through the emergency department and requiring a surgical treatment between 17 March and 11 May 2020, and the equivalent period in 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the change in number of hospital admissions for acute surgical conditions. Mortality was assessed in the matched population, and stratified by region. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, 57 589 consecutive patients were admitted for acute surgical conditions, representing a decrease of 20.9 per cent compared with the 2019 cohort. Significant differences between regions were observed: the decrease was 15.6, 17.2, and 26.8 per cent for low-, intermediate- and high-prevalence regions respectively. The mortality rate was 1.92 per cent during the lockdown period and 1.81 per cent in 2019. In high-prevalence zones, mortality was significantly increased (odds ratio 1.22, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 1.40). CONCLUSION: A marked decrease in hospital admissions for surgical emergencies was observed during the lockdown period, with increased mortality in regions with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

COVID-19 is also a new infectious disease. The symptoms of this disease, which include fever, shortness of breath, and cough, can be mild to severe and can even lead to death. Due to the use of immunosuppressive drugs by Patients with MS, they might be at greater risk of catching COVID-19. Thus, patients with MS may be more afraid of catching the virus. One of the important factors is the relationship between cognitive deficit and the increase in patients' fear of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between fear of catching COVID-19 and cognitive impairment in patients with MS. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the MS Clinic, Sina hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Our participants in this project were Patients with MS who were over 18 years old and had no history of other neurological and psychiatric diseases. In addition to obtaining demographic and clinical information, we measured the fear of catching the COVID 2019 via Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), which is 7-item questionnaire. We also used Multiple Sclerosis Neuro Psychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ) to assess memory and information processing speed in Patients with MS.

As a consequence, based on prior investigations, this work initially employed the viral concentration detection technique, followed by the RT-qPCR assay, as the foundation for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater. After that, the ability and efficacy of chlorine, ozone, and UV disinfection to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus from wastewater were examined. Chlorine disinfection is the most extensively used disinfection technology due to its multiple advantages. With a chlorine dioxide disinfectant dose of 40 mg/L, the SARS-CoV virus is inactivated after 30 min of contact time. On the other hand, ozone is a powerful oxidizer and an effective microbicide that is employed as a disinfectant due to its positive characteristics. After 30 min of exposure to 1000 ppmv ozone, corona pseudoviruses are reduced by 99%. Another common method of disinfection is using ultraviolet radiation, which is usually 253.7 nm suitable for ultraviolet disinfection. At a dose of 1048 mJ/cm(2), UVC radiation completely inactivates the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, to evaluate disinfection performance and optimize disinfection strategies to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, this study attempted to investigate the ability to remove and compare the effectiveness of each disinfectant to inactive the SARS-CoV-2 virus from wastewater, summarize studies, and provide future solutions due to the limited availability of integrated resources in this field and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide.","output":"A Review on the Potential of Common Disinfection Processes for the Removal of Virus from Wastewater"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Degradation of autophagosomal cargo requires the tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes that is mediated by the scaffolding protein autophagy related 14 (ATG14).

Results: The three overarching themes identified were: Effect on Recovery, Virtual Recovery Resources, and Effect on General Life. Within each overarching theme, lower-order parent themes and subthemes reflected varied participant experiences. Specifically, one group of participants cited negative impacts due to COVID-19, a second group reported positive impacts, and a third group where each participant reported experiencing both positive and negative impacts. Additionally, while participants had positive experiences with virtual resources, they also cited negative experiences and identified suggestions for improvement and other requested resources. Conclusions: Findings suggest that while many participants experienced significant hardships, a proportion of participants experienced unexpected positive impacts as well.

However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission and mass infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government mobile and fog computing framework that can trace positive and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing apps and stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC), to ensure user privacy. Each user's mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when registering on the central application. The mobile device and the central application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC) every two hours, and this RUERC is broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. Any nearby mobile device can receive the RUERC and record it for the next up to 21 days. As the government maintains the database of server-generated UERCs and contains a mapping between UERC and RUERC, the users' mobile devices can store the RUERC in the application cache without requiring further encryption. Additionally, if any cases are found, the ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the identity of the infected person. This way, governments can let organizations continue their economic activities without complete lockdown.

This paper presents a review of scholarly journal articles that explore the human rights discourse related to social work education in the United States. Upon reviewing the literature, the following categories emerged: (1) general articles on integrating human rights into social work education; (2) pedagogical frameworks, models, and examples of incorporating human rights into social work education; and (3) measures and perceptions related to assessing the integration of human rights in social work education. Findings indicate that the inclusion of human rights into social work education in the United States is in its infancy. It is recommended that social work programs in the United States be more intentional about integrating human rights content into the curricula to train culturally competent and globally minded social workers.","output":"An Exploration of Human Rights and Social Work Education in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prolonging non\\\\pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) used in the control of pandemics can cause a devastating effect on the overall economic and social welfare levels. Therefore, policymakers are facing a difficult duty in terms of implementing economically and socially sustainable and acceptable measures. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of NPIs implemented to control the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. To this end, eight NPI measures were analysed, and their effects on the number of cases were investigated for France, Spain, China, and South Korea. In the study, the treatment effect of these mechanisms on the daily increase rate of the total number of cases during a certain period was analysed by using logarithmic linear regression with a dummy variables model. The findings indicate that the measures are effective against the spread of the pandemic at different levels. The findings also suggest that the most effective measure in decreasing the number of cases is workplace closure. An analysis comparing the effectiveness of countrywide measures and regional measures shows that school closing is the most effective measure to decrease the number of cases when implemented countrywide as opposed to regional implementation.","output":"Effects of non\\\\pharmaceutical interventions against COVID\\\\19: A cross\\\\country analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction This study aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the number of people seen at public facilities in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sierra Leone for essential primary healthcare services. Methods The number of weekly consultations for antenatal care (ANC), outpatient (OPD), expanded programme on immunisations (EPI), family planning (FP) services and HIV, for the period of January 2018-December 2020, were collected from 25 primary healthcare facilities in Masaka district, Uganda, 21 health centres in Goma, DRC, and 29 facilities in Kambia district, Sierra Leone. Negative binomial regression models accounting for facility level clustering and season were used to analyse changes in activity levels between 2018, 2019 and 2020. Results We found no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of OPD, EPI or ANC consultations in Goma. Family planning consultations were 17% lower in March-July 2020 compared to 2019, but this recovered by December 2020. New diagnoses of HIV were 34% lower throughout 2020 compared to 2019. Compared to the same periods in 2019, facilities in Sierra Leone had 18-29% fewer OPD consultations throughout 2020, and 27% fewer DTP3 doses in March-July 2020, but this had recovered by Jul-Dec. There was no evidence of differences in other services. In Uganda there were 20-35% fewer under-5 OPD consultations, 21-66% fewer MCV1 doses, and 48-51% fewer new diagnoses of HIV, throughout 2020, compared to 2019. There was no difference in the number of HPV doses delivered in 2020 compared to 2019. Conclusions The level of disruption appeared to correlate with the strength of lockdown measures in the different settings and community attitudes towards the risk posed by COVID-19. Mitigation strategies such as health communications campaigns and outreach services proved important to limit the impact of lockdowns on primary healthcare services.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision & utilisation of primary health care services in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kambia district, Sierra Leone & Masaka district, Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Autologous hepatocyte transplantation after ex vivo gene therapy is an alternative to liver transplantation for metabolic liver disease. Here we evaluate ex vivo gene therapy followed by transplantation of single-cell or spheroid hepatocytes. METHODS Pig and mouse hepatocytes were isolated, labeled with zirconium-89 and returned to the liver as single cells or spheroids. Biodistribution was evaluated through positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient pig hepatocytes were isolated and transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the Fah gene. Animals received portal vein infusion of single-cell or spheroid autologous hepatocytes after ex vivo gene delivery. Portal pressures were measured and ultrasound was used to evaluate for thrombus. Differences in engraftment and expansion of ex vivo corrected single-cell or spheroid hepatocytes were followed through histologic analysis and animals' ability to thrive off 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione. RESULTS Positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging showed spheroid hepatocytes with increased heterogeneity in biodistribution as compared with single cells, which spread more uniformly throughout the liver. Animals receiving spheroids experienced higher mean changes in portal pressure than animals receiving single cells (P < .01). Additionally, two animals from the spheroid group developed portal vein thrombi that required systemic anticoagulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of spheroid- and single-cell-transplanted animals showed similar engraftment and expansion rates of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-positive hepatocytes in the liver, correlating with similar weight stabilization curves. CONCLUSION Ex vivo gene correction of autologous hepatocytes in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient pigs can be performed using hepatocyte spheroids or single-cell hepatocytes, with spheroids showing a more heterogeneous distribution within the liver and higher risks for portal vein thrombosis and increased portal pressures.","output":"Hepatocyte spheroids as an alternative to single cells for transplantation after ex vivo gene therapy in mice and pig models."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study mapped the role of ICT, digital platforms, the internet connectivity and skills of the personnel vis--vis implementation processes of SDGs in public organizations in Kenya.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than the general population but risk factors for HCW infection are not well described. Methods We conducted a prospective sero-epidemiological study of HCWs at a UK teaching hospital using a SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Risk factors for seropositivity were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Findings 410/5,698 (7.2%) staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seroprevalence was higher in those working in designated COVID-19 areas compared with other areas (9.47% versus 6.16%) Healthcare assistants (aOR 2.06 [95%CI 1.14-3.71]; p=0.016) and domestic and portering staff (aOR 3.45 [95% CI 1.07-11.42]; p=0.039) had significantly higher seroprevalence than other staff groups after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 working location. Staff working in acute medicine and medical sub-specialities were also at higher risk (aOR 2.07 [95% CI 1.31-3.25]; p=0.002). Staff from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds had an aOR of 1.65 (95% CI 1.32-2.07; p<0.0001) compared to white staff; this increased risk was independent of COVID-19 area working. The only symptoms significantly associated with seropositivity in a multivariable model were loss of sense of taste or smell, fever and myalgia; 31% of staff testing positive reported no prior symptoms. Interpretation Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst HCWs is heterogeneous and influenced by COVID-19 working location, role, age and ethnicity.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational study. METHODS Four-hundred twenty-two eyes of 422 patients in 3 age categories (60-69 years, 70-79 years, and 80-89 years) scheduled for phacoemulsification were consecutively enrolled. The eyes underwent examinations with an infrared pupillometer to obtain the parameters of the pupillary light response preoperatively and at 1 day and 1 and 3 months postoperatively. Differences in the parameters of the pupillary response were compared among 4 time intervals and the 3 age categories. RESULTS The mean maximum and minimum pupillary diameters significantly decreased at 1 day postoperatively and returned to the preoperative level by 1 month postoperatively (P<.0001). The mean percentage of pupillary constriction was significantly reduced at 1 and 3 months postoperatively compared with preoperatively and at 1 day postoperatively (P<.0001). The average pupillary constriction and dilation velocities were significantly lower at 1 and 3 months postoperatively than they were preoperatively and at 1 day postoperatively (P<.0001). The latency to constriction did not differ significantly among the time intervals. The percentage of pupillary constriction was significantly smaller, and the average constriction and dilation velocities were lower in association with higher age categories at all time intervals (P.0185). CONCLUSION The pupillary light response was impaired several months after cataract surgery and worsened with increasing patient age, indicating that cataract surgery may compromise the pupillary constriction and dilation functions in association with age.","output":"Pupillary light response after cataract surgery in healthy patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The media attention to the personal sphere of famous and important individuals has become a key element of the gender narrative.

On the basis of a score for words that is introduced to account for gender unbalance in both representative and news coverage, we show that the political personalization in Italy is more detrimental for women than men, with the persistence of entrenched stereotypes including a masculine connotation of leadership, the resulting women's unsuitability to hold political functions, and a greater deal of focus on their attractiveness and body parts. In addition, women politicians are covered with a more negative tone than their men counterpart when personal details are reported. Further, the major contribution to the observed gender differences comes from online news rather than print news, suggesting that the expression of certain stereotypes may be better conveyed when click baiting and personal targeting have a major impact.","output":"Gender stereotypes in the mediated personalization of politics: Empirical evidence from a lexical, syntactic and sentiment analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the global pandemic, COVID-19, through the lens of responses to vulnerable migrants, asking what state responses mean for the future of human rights values and for humanitarian interventions.

Although each change had evidence-based infection prevention rationale, healthcare personnel (HCP) may have variable perceptions of their relative values. Methods Between October-December 2020, we conducted a voluntary, anonymous, IRB-approved survey of UNC Medical Center HCP regarding their views on personal protective equipment (PPE) and hospital policies designed to prevent COVID acquisition. The survey collected occupational and primary work location data (COVID unit or not) as well as their views on specific infection prevention practices during COVID. Chi squared tests (two tailed) were used to compare differences in the proportions. Results The overall results are displayed (Figure). Among the 694 HCP who responded to the survey, we found HCP were largely (68%) satisfied that the organization was taking all the necessary measures to protect them from COVID-19. A significantly greater proportion (14% more) of HCP (81.7% compared to 67.6%;95% CI of difference 9.4-18.5%, P< 0.0001) agreed that all PPE was available to them compared to those who were confident that the organization was taking necessary steps for protection, highlighting that safety is more than simply availability of supplies. More than 90% felt that daily screening of patients/visitors and patient/visitor mask requirements were important for protecting them from acquiring COVID in the workplace and that wearing a mask themselves was a key intervention for protecting others. Fewer HCP (72-80%), although still a majority, perceived that eye protection and daily symptom screening for HCP were beneficial. Symptom screening for patients/visitors was perceived by 19% more HCP (90.9% compared to 72.2%;95% CI of difference 15-23%) to be beneficial than symptom screening of HCP (P< 0.0001). Figure. HCP Perceived Benefit of Infection Prevention Strategies during COVID Conclusion Although infection prevention strategies were implemented based on evidence and in alignment with CDC recommendations, it is important to acknowledge that the perception and acceptance of these recommendations varied among our HCP.

To provide a more comprehensive description of the epidemiological characteristics of cluster transmission and the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 carried by asymptomatic carriers, we studied the epidemiological characteristics of 70 clusters. 70 clusters including 311 consecutive subjects from January 20, 2020, to March 10, 2020, were enrolled. Of 70 clusters, 5 were infected by asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers. We gathered and analyzed information about their demographic, epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic classification, and cluster characteristics. Among the 66 asymptomatic carriers in Jiangsu Province, 49 asymptomatic were observed in 311 subjects distributed in 70 clusters. We demonstrated that there is a significance between the severity of cases infected by asymptomatic carriers and cases infected by symptomatic patients (P=0.033) and the former usually presented with milder symptoms. A significant difference was shown regarding the level distribution of age (P=0.006) and the frequency distribution of gender (P=0.014) and disease severity of COVID-19 (P=0.008) among the seven groups classified by the relationship with the index cases. The average age of infected medical staff was the youngest and the majority of infected medical are females while the infected patients were generally oldest and usually accompanied by severest symptoms. We concluded that asymptomatic carriers are mainly screened out of clusters and the patients infected by asymptomatic carriers present with milder symptoms than those infected by symptomatic patients, which indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 shares decreased virulence among asymptomatic carriers.

We investigated whether patients with previous CVD have increased risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) when hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: We included 839 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory values, ECG at admission and medications at admission were collected based on electronic medical records. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality or MACE. RESULTS: Median age was 67 years, 453 (54%) were males and 277 (33%) had history of CVD. In total, 152 (18%) died and 687 (82%) were discharged, including 72 (9%) who survived a MACE.

Since the most severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 appears to be a severe acute respiratory syndrome, azithromycin has been proposed as a potential treatment. Azithromycin is known to have immunomodulating and antiviral properties. In vitro studies have demonstrated the capacity of azithromycin in reducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, TNF alpha, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate T-helper functions. At the same time there are multiple clinical evidences of the role of azithromycin in acute respiratory distress syndrome and against Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some preliminary evidence has demonstrated controversial results regarding efficacy of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. First, a French trial demonstrated 100% virological negativizing of six patients treated with azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine vs. 57.1% of patients treated with only hydroxychloroquine and 12.5% of the control group (P < 0.05). On the other hand, another case series revealed no efficacy at all on 11 patients treated with the same combination and doses. Furthermore, there are some concerns regarding the association of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine because of potential QT prolongation.

While much attention rightly remains on victims of police brutality, there is a sparse literature on police brutality and perinatal health outcomes. We aimed to explore how Black pregnant women perceive police brutality affects them during pregnancy and might affect their children. METHODS: This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews among 24 Black pregnant women in New Haven, Connecticut (January 2017 to August 2018). Interview questions explored neighborhood factors, safety, stressors during pregnancy, and anticipated stressors while parenting. Grounded theory informed the analysis. RESULTS: Participants, regardless of socioeconomic status, shared experiences with police and beliefs about anticipated police brutality, as summarized in the following themes: (1) experiences that lead to police distrust C If this is the way that mommys treated [by police]; (2) anticipating police brutality C Im always expecting that phone call; (3) stress and fear during pregnancy C Its a boy, [I feel] absolutely petrified; and (4) the talk about avoiding police brutality C How do you get prepared? Even participants who reported positive experiences with police anticipated brutality towards their children. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between Black people and police on a personal, familial, community, and societal level influenced how Black pregnant women understand the potential for police brutality towards their children.

Airway remodeling is characterized by structural changes which include airway smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis due to thickening of the reticular basement membrane, mucus metaplasia of the epithelium, and angiogenesis. Epidemiologic studies suggest that both genetic and environmental factors may contribute to decline in lung function and airway remodeling in a subset of asthmatics. Environmental factors include respiratory viral infection-triggered asthma exacerbations, and tobacco smoke. There is also evidence that several asthma candidate genes may contribute to decline in lung function, including ADAM33, PLAUR, VEGF, IL13, CHI3L1, TSLP, GSDMB, TGFB1, POSTN, ESR1 and ARG2. In addition, mediators or cytokines, including cysteinyl leukotrienes, matrix metallopeptidase-9, interleukin-33 and eosinophil expression of transforming growth factor-, may contribute to airway remodeling in asthma. Although increased airway smooth muscle is associated with reduced lung function (i.e. forced expiratory volume in 1 second) in asthma, there have been few long-term studies to determine how individual pathologic features of airway remodeling contribute to decline in lung function in asthma. Clinical studies with inhibitors of individual gene products, cytokines or mediators are needed in asthmatic patients to identify their individual role in decline in lung function and/or airway remodeling.","output":"Genes and Pathways Regulating Decline in Lung Function and Airway Remodeling in Asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Senegal reported the first COVID-19 case on March 2, 2020. A nationwide cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted to capture the true extent of COVID-19 exposure. Methods: Multi-stage random cluster sampling of households was carried out between October 24 and November 26, 2020, at the end of the first wave of COVID-19 transmission. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) were screened using three distinct ELISA assays. Adjusted prevalence for the survey design were calculated for each test separately, and thereafter combined. Crude, adjusted prevalence based on tests performances and weighted prevalence by sex-age strata were estimated to assess the seroprevalence.Findings: Of the 1,463 participants included in this study, 588% were women and the mean age of participants was 292 years (range 025C820). The national seroprevalence was estimated at 28 . 4% (95% CI: 261-308). There was substantial regional variability. Four regions recorded the highest seroprevalence: Ziguinchor (567%), Sedhiou (480%), Dakar (440%) and Kaolack (327%) whereas, Louga (111%) and Matam (112%), located in the Center-North, were less impacted in our analysis.

Such legislation achieves Congress' original intention to create universal entitlements for low-income persons who lack health coverage and concentrate new federal health spending on them (unlike M4A). Arguments for federalizing Medicaid involve state budget relief, efficiency, social justice and the history that created national industries from local and state-based health systems.

Poorly constructed guidelines that are incomprehensive and/or ambiguous may compromise HCWs safety. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a tool to appraise guidelines on infection control strategies in HCWs based on the guidelines published early in the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND OUTCOMES: A three-stage, web-based, Delphi consensus-building process among a panel of diverse HCWs and healthcare managers was performed. The tool was validated by appraising 40 international, specialty-specific, and procedure-specific guidelines along with national guidelines from countries with a wide range of gross national income. RESULTS: Overall consensus (75%) was reached at the end of three rounds for all six domains included in the tool. The Delphi panel recommended an ideal infection control guideline should encompass six domains: general characteristics (domain-1), engineering recommendations (domain-2), personal protection equipment (PPE) use (domain-3), and administrative aspects (domain 4-6) of infection control. The appraisal tool performed well across the six domains and the inter-rater agreement was excellent for the 40 guidelines. All included guidelines performed relatively better in domains 1-3 compared with domains 4-6 and this was more evident in guidelines originating from lower-income countries. CONCLUSION: The guideline appraisal tool was robust and easy to use. Engineering recommendations aspects of infection control, administrative measures that promote optimal PPE use, and HCW wellbeing were generally lacking in assessed guidelines.

The pathogenesis of H5N1 viral infection is associated with the ability of the virus to induce apoptotic cell death. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by H5N1 remains unclear. In the present study we demonstrate that H5N1 virus is able to up-regulate the expression of gene associated with retinoid and interferon induced mortality-19 (GRIM-19) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). GRIM-19 has been identified as a novel gene with apoptotic effects in virus-infected cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells is significantly decreased in H5N1-infected GRIM-19 depleted hMDMs, which is also associated with a decrease of BH3-interacting domain death agonist cleavage and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release to the cytosol. These results suggested the involvement of GRIM-19 in apoptosis induced by H5N1 virus. Furthermore, neutralizing-IFN- Ab is able to suppress GRIM-19 expression in H5N1-infected cells resulting in a decrease in apoptotic cell number, indicating that IFN- secreted by H5N1-infected hMDMs regulates GRIM-19 expression leading to apoptosis.

In many cases, this has challenged patient-centered care. We set out to examine individuals' attitudes toward shared decision making (SDM) and to identify predictors of participation preference during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with a large convenience sample (N = 1061). Our main measures of interest were participants' generic and COVID-19-related participation preference as well as their acceptance and distress regarding a triage vignette. We also assessed anxiety, e-health literacy, and aspects of participants' health. We conducted group comparisons and multiple linear regression analyses on participation preference as well as triage acceptance. RESULTS: In generic decision making, most participants expressed a strong need for information and a moderate participation preference. In the hypothetical case of COVID-19 infection, most preferred physician-led decisions. Generic participation preference was the strongest predictor of COVID-19-related participation preference, followed by age, education, and anxiety. Furthermore, both higher generic and COVID-19-related participation preferences predicted lower triage acceptance.

The corona pandemic has had massive effects on all social life since it began last year and has a significant impact on leisure and professional sports. Very early on, the question arose as to when and how sports enthusiasts can go back to their sporting activities or take part in competitions after an infection. Several publications that have appeared since spring 2020 have addressed this topic. It is generally accepted that no physical activity should be carried out during the acute infection. The extent of the diagnosis, which is recommended before returning to (competitive) sport, is determined depending on the clinical course. While there were concerns at the beginning of the pandemic that cardiac involvement would occur in many cases, this risk initially seems to have been overestimated. On the other hand, there is increasing data that non-cardiac consequences of the infection can impair athletes in the practice of their sport in the long term.

Attempts for a sustainable control of this scourge by vaccination have not yet fully satisfied. With an increasing knowledge and methodology in disease resistance, a new world-wide endeavour has been started to support the combat of animal diseases, based on the existence of valuable gene variants with regard to any host-pathogen interaction. Several groups have produced a wealth of evidence for natural variability in resistance/susceptibility to PRRS in our commercial breeding lines. However, up to now, exploiting existing variation has failed because of the difficulty to detect the carriers of favourable and unfavourable alleles, especially with regard to such complex polygenic traits like resistance to PRRS. New hope comes from new genomic tools like next generation sequencing which have become extremely fast and low priced. Thus, research is booming world-wide and the jigsaw puzzle is filling up C slowly but steadily. On the other hand, knowledge from virological and biomedical basic research has opened the way for an intervening way, i.e. the modification of identified key genes that occupy key positions in PRRS pathogenesis, like CD163. CD163 was identified as the striking receptor in PRRSV entry and its knockout from the genome by gene editing has led to the production of pigs that were completely resistant to PRRSV C a milestone in modern pig breeding. However, at this early step, concerns remain about the acceptance of societies for gene edited products and regulation still awaits upgrading to the new technology. Further questions arise with regard to upcoming patents from an ethical and legal point of view. Eventually, the importance of CD163 for homeostasis, defence and immunity demands for more insight before its complete or partial silencing can be answered. Whatever path will be followed, even a partial abolishment of PRRSV replication will lead to a significant improvement of the disastrous herd situation, with a significant impact on welfare, performance, antimicrobial consumption and consumer protection.

Part of the mortality gap can be explained by lower screening rates in Appalachian counties. Researchers at Markey Cancer Center partnered with primary care clinics in eastern Kentucky to address this disparity by identifying strategies to implement evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to improve CRC screening and follow-up in Appalachian Kentucky. Methods: Members of the research team conducted formative research activities to identify multilevel barriers to CRC screening. A menu of EBIs was then created to address these barriers, and clinic champions selected EBIs that were feasible in their respective practices. However, because of restrictions during COVID-19, clinics experienced multiple changes to workflow and operations, necessitating modifications to program activities. Over a series of virtual meetings, clinic champions selected adaptations that could allow clinics to continue promoting CRC screening in their practices despite COVID-related limitations. Results: Changes in clinic staffing and workflow resulting from COVID-19 included provider furloughs, a state-mandated pause in elective procedures, mandatory parking lot visits for many in-person visits, and an increase in telehealth. Among our clinic partners, total in-person visits were reduced by nearly half from first to second quarter of 2020, whereas telehealth visits were 23 times higher, though telehealth visits were cut in half by third quarter. To match these changing modes of practice, clinics adapted creative strategies for communicating CRC screening recommendations to patients, including shifting from paper to digital educational tools, promoting screening via telehealth visits, and prioritizing recommendations for stool-based tests over colonoscopy for average-risk patients. As a result, orders for FIT and FIT-DNA were 2 and 3 times higher, respectively, from second to third quarter of 2020. Conclusion: Rural primary care clinics in Appalachia continue to promote CRC screening despite the multiple challenges related to COVID-19. One relevant reference for clinicians is the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable's playbook for reigniting CRC screening during COVID-19, a document that promotes stool-based screening for average-risk patients. While elective procedures remain backlogged in rural areas due to state regulations, research partners should emphasize the need to prioritize stool-based CRC screening for average-risk populations and reserve scheduling colonoscopies for high-risk individuals or those with abnormal stool-based test results. While our clinical partners had previously focused on a colonoscopy first approach to screening, our findings suggest that our clinic partners increased orders for stool-based CRC tests. Nevertheless, continued outreach is needed to ensure CRC screening rates remain optimal.","output":"Colorectal cancer screening in Appalachian Kentucky primary care clinics during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, especially to those with associated cardiovascular disease. An online Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) survey on consecutive congenital heart disease (CHD) patients, was carried out to determine depression during the Spanish coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine. Two-hundred forty-two out of 407 (59%) CHD patients answered the survey, 123 (51%) had mild defects, 88 (36%) moderate and 31 (13%) great defects, most of them between 18 and 24 years old and 51% were male. Patients were dichotomized to no or mild (PHQ-9 < 10) and moderate to severe ( 10) depressive symptoms. Thirty-four (14%) patients showed a PHQ-9  10 and 10 of them (29%) were under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment during the quarantine. During the study period, 9 (4%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with a NYHA above 2 (P=0.025), living in houses without garden or balcony (P=0.014), needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/medication in the previous 12 months or being under anxiolytic/antidepres-sant treatment during the confinement had, significantly, a PHQ-9 score  10 (P < 0.001).

Although extensive studies have explored the COVID-19 transmission patterns and (non-) pharmaceutical intervention to protect the general public, limited research has analysed the measures to prevent nosocomial transmission based upon detailed interpersonal contacts between medical staff and patients. AIM: This paper aims to develop and evaluate proactive prevention measures to contain the nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. The specific objectives are (1) to understand the virus transmission via interpersonal contacts among medical staff and patients; (2) to define proactive measures to reduce the risk of infection of medical staff and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of these measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic in hospitals. METHODS: We observed the operation of a typical primary hospital in China to understand the interpersonal contacts among medical staff and patients. We defined effective distance as the indicator for risk of transmission. Then three proactive measures were proposed based upon the observations, including a medical staff rotation system, the establishment of a separate fever clinic and medical staff working alone. Finally, the impacts of these measures are evaluated with a modified Susceptible-Exposure-Infected-Removed model accommodating the situation of hospitals and asymptomatic and latent infection of COVID-19. The case study was conducted with the hospital observed in December 2019 and February 2020. FINDINGS: The implementation of the medical staff rotation system has the most significant impact on containing the epidemic. The establishment of a separate fever clinic and medical staff working alone also benefits from inhibiting the epidemic outbreak. The simulation finds that if effective prevention and control measures are not taken in time, it will lead to a surge of infection cases in all asymptomatic probabilities and incubation periods.","output":"Measures to prevent nosocomial transmissions of COVID-19 based on interpersonal contact data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cardinal virulence factor of human-pathogenic enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is Shiga toxin (Stx), which causes severe extraintestinal complications including kidney failure by damaging renal endothelial cells.

To explore this molecularly, we investigated the Stx receptor content and transcriptomic profile of two human renal epithelial cell lines: highly Stx-sensitive ACHN cells and largely Stx-insensitive Caki-2 cells. Though both lines exhibited the Stx receptor globotriaosylceramide, RNAseq revealed strikingly different transcriptomic responses to an Stx challenge. Using RNAi to silence factors involved in ACHN cells Stx response, the greatest protection occurred when silencing RAB5A and TRAPPC6B, two host factors that we newly link to Stx trafficking. Silencing these factors alongside YKT6 fully prevented the cytotoxic Stx effect.

Pseudo-continuous ASL-MRI was performed with post-label delays of 1525-1800 ms. Intra-aneurysmal \\"trapped labelled spins\\" (TLS)-related hypersignal, as seen on cerebral blood flow (CBF)-weighted maps of ASL-MRI, was investigated. Intermodality equivalence with DSA [O'Kelly-Marotta (OKM) grading for occlusion], 3D-TOF-MRA, and 3D spin-echo T1-weighted (\\"black-blood\\") images was assessed. RESULTS Ten cases were included. \\"TLS\\" signal was demonstrable in 7/8 (87.5%) of the DSA-visible flow-diverted aneurysms (OKM grade B3, n = 6; OKM grade A3, n = 2). No TLS was seen in both OKM-D (excluded) aneurysms. TLS was not visualised in an OKM-B3 aneurysm with < 3 mm opacifying remnant. 3D-TOF-MRA and ASL-MRI were discordant at 5 instances (45.4%; TOF-MRA false negative, n = 4; false positive, n = 1). Loss of flow void on black-blood images corresponded to the absence of TLS and vice versa in all cases but one. CONCLUSION \\"Trapped labelled spins\\"-related signal on ASL-MRI occurs in patent large aneurysms that have undergone successful endovascular flow diversion.

Clinical warning signs for SD manifest late in the disease course and are nonspecific, leading to missed cases and excess hospital burden. Better SD prognostics are urgently needed. METHODS: We integrated 11 public datasets profiling the blood transcriptome of 365 dengue patients of all ages and from seven countries, encompassing biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity. We performed an iterative multi-cohort analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-severe patients and SD progressors. Using only these DEGs, we trained an XGBoost machine learning model on public data to predict progression to SD. All model parameters were locked prior to validation in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort of 377 dengue patients in Colombia. We measured expression of the DEGs in whole blood samples collected upon presentation, prior to SD progression. We then compared the accuracy of the locked XGBoost model and clinical warning signs in predicting SD. RESULTS: We identified eight SD-associated DEGs in the public datasets and built an 8-gene XGBoost model that accurately predicted SD progression in the independent validation cohort with 86.4% (95% CI 68.2C100) sensitivity and 79.7% (95% CI 75.5C83.9) specificity. Given the 5.8% proportion of SD cases in this cohort, the 8-gene model had a positive and negative predictive value (PPV and NPV) of 20.9% (95% CI 16.7C25.6) and 99.0% (95% CI 97.7C100.0), respectively. Compared to clinical warning signs at presentation, which had 77.3% (95% CI 58.3C94.1) sensitivity and 39.7% (95% CI 34.7C44.9) specificity, the 8-gene model led to an 80% reduction in the number needed to predict (NNP) from 25.4 to 5.0. Importantly, the 8-gene model accurately predicted subsequent SD in the first three days post-fever onset and up to three days prior to SD progression. CONCLUSIONS: The 8-gene XGBoost model, trained on heterogeneous public datasets, accurately predicted progression to SD in a large, independent, prospective cohort, including during the early febrile stage when SD prediction remains clinically difficult. The model has potential to be translated to a point-of-care prognostic assay to reduce dengue morbidity and mortality without overwhelming limited healthcare resources.

Cote dIvoire adopted the intervention and opened the first KMC unit in 2019. This study aimed to assess barriers and facilitators of KMC implementation in Cote dIvoire, a year after its introduction, as well as proposed solutions for improving KMC implementation in the country. METHOD: This was a qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews, carried out in September 2020 in the first KMC unit opened at the Teaching Hospital of Treichville. The study involved healthcare providers providing KMC and mothers of newborn who were receiving or received KMC at the unit. A thematic analysis was performed using both inductive and deductive (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research-driven) approaches. NVivo 12 was used to assist with coding. RESULTS: A total of 44 semi-structured interviews were conducted, 12 with healthcare providers and 32 with mothers. The barriers identified were lack of supplies, insufficiency of human resources, lack of space for admission, lack of home visits, lack of food for mothers, lack of collaboration between health services involved in newborn care, increased workload, the beliefs of carrying the baby on the chest, fathers resistance, low rate of exclusive breastfeeding, lack of community awareness. Facilitators identified were training of healthcare providers, strong leadership, the low cost of KMC, healthcare providers perceived value of KMC, mothers?healthcare providers relationship, mothers adherence to KMC and the capacity of the KMC unit to network with external organizations. The proposed solutions for improving KMC implementation were volunteer staff motivation, intensifying education and counselling of mothers and families, the recruitment of a psychologist and the involvement of all stakeholders.

ARDS is a phenotype among patients with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to disseminated vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD). In response to the viral septicemia, the host activates the complement system which produces terminal complement complex C5b-9 to neutralize pathogen. C5b-9 causes pore formation on the membrane of host endothelial cells (ECs) if CD59 is underexpressed. Also, viral S protein attraction to endothelial ACE2 receptor damages ECs. Both affect ECs and provoke endotheliopathy. Disseminated endotheliopathy activates two molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. The former releases inflammatory cytokines from ECs, which lead to inflammation. The latter initiates endothelial exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) multimers and FVIII from WeibelCPalade bodies. If ADAMTS13 is insufficient, ULVWF multimers activate intravascular hemostasis of ULVWF path. In activated ULVWF path, ULVWF multimers anchored to damaged endothelial cells recruit circulating platelets and trigger microthrombogenesis. This process produces microthrombi strings composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes, leading to endotheliopathy-associated VMTD (EA-VMTD). In COVID-19, microthrombosis initially affects the lungs per tropism causing ARDS, but EA-VMTD may orchestrate more complex clinical phenotypes, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome, hepatic coagulopathy, MODS and combined micro-macrothrombotic syndrome. In this pandemic, ARDS and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) have often coexisted. The analysis based on two hemostatic theories supports ARDS caused by activated ULVWF path is EA-VMTD and PTE caused by activated ULVWF and TF paths is macrothrombosis. The thrombotic disorder of COVID-19 sepsis is consistent with the notion that ARDS is virus-induced disseminated EA-VMTD and PTE is in-hospital vascular injury-related macrothrombosis which is not directly related to viral pathogenesis. The pathogenesis-based therapeutic approach is discussed for the treatment of EA-VMTD with antimicrothrombotic regimen and the potential need of anticoagulation therapy for coinciding macrothrombosis in comprehensive COVID-19 care.","output":"COVID-19 Sepsis: Pathogenesis and Endothelial Molecular Mechanisms Based on Two-Path Unifying Theory of Hemostasis and Endotheliopathy-Associated Vascular Microthrombotic Disease, and Proposed Therapeutic Approach with Antimicrothrombotic Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The EU's response to the COVID-19 crisis, namely the approval of the Next Generation package, provides an opportunity to explore to what extent the existing Smart Specialisation regional strategies and related ecosystems have been taken into account in the highly relevant territorial context in which the national Recovery Plans have been designed.

However, all of the interviewed regions have confirmed that the drafting of the national recovery and resilience plan lacked an ex-ante alignment with the regional S3 strategies, and failed to consider the existing regional S3 ecosystems. The separation of the recovery logic (based on the operation of public consultations at national level to identify strategic projects) from the S3 logic (based on a strategic prioritisation exercise conducted by each regional ecosystem) confirms that an opportunity may have been missed in the recovery planning process to consolidate the multi-actor, multilevel and place-based S3 approach.

OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in the number and demographic characteristics of patients initiating treatment for incident kidney failure following the COVID-19 pandemic by race and ethnicity, county-level COVID-19 mortality rate, and neighborhood-level social disadvantage. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional time-trend study used data from US patients who developed kidney failure between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. Data were analyzed between January and July 2021. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Number of patients initiating treatment for incident kidney failure and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at treatment initiation. RESULTS: The study population included 127 149 patients with incident kidney failure between January 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020 (mean [SD] age, 62.8 [15.3] years; 53 021 [41.7%] female, 32 932 [25.9%] non-Hispanic Black, and 19 835 [15.6%] Hispanic/Latino patients). Compared with the preCCOVID-19 period, in the first 4 months of the pandemic (ie, March 1 through June 30, 2020), there were significant decreases in the proportion of patients with incident kidney failure receiving preemptive transplantation (1805 [2.1%] preCCOVID-19 vs 551 [1.4%] during COVID-19; P < .001) and initiating hemodialysis treatment with an arteriovenous fistula (2430 [15.8%] preCCOVID-19 vs 914 [13.4%] during COVID-19; P < .001).

BNT162b2 is new type of vaccine, and previous studies have shown that the antibody response was significantly elevated in patients with prior COVID-19 infection after the first dose of BNT162b2 vaccination. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy of the vaccination or the adverse reactions of people with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan. The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibody titer and adverse reactions of BNT162b2 vaccine among participants with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan. Methods The data for this prospective study was collected between April 15, 2021, and June 9, 2021. All of the hospital staff who received the BNT162b2 vaccine were included in this study and were sorted into either the prior infection group or the control group. We collected the data of adverse reactions through self-reporting and calculated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibody titer for all participants. Results The antibody titer of the prior-infection group in first antibody test was significantly higher than that of the control group in the second antibody test. There was no significant difference in adverse reactions between the prior infection group receiving its first vaccination and the control group receiving its second vaccination. Furthermore, the history of prior infection was not related to local and systemic adverse reactions in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusion Our study shows that the antibody response following the first vaccination in the prior COVID-19 infection group was found to be comparable to that of the second vaccination in the control group; however, the evaluation of adverse reactions was inadequate and further, large-scale studies are needed.","output":"Evaluation of the antibody response and adverse reactions of the BNT162b2 vaccine of participants with prior COVID-19 infection in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emotions play an important role in learning. As a part of our research efforts on algorithm education, we planned to evaluate the impact of an educational system to experiment with algorithms on students' emotions. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic changed both the educational context and the educational process. We redesigned our study to inquire two research questions: (a) what is the emotional level of students in the current situation?, and (b) what is the emotional impact of OptimEx on students of an algorithm course? We planned an evaluation in a lab session under mixed conditions, i.e. students could choose between attending physically or virtually. We used the PANAS questionnaire, which allows assessing 20 emotions, classified into positive and negative. The outcomes show that students experienced higher emotional levels for positive emotions than negative. Furthermore, students who attended face-to-face scored stronger emotions. After the session, all students decreased their negative emotional levels, with the students who attended physically also experiencing an increase in positive emotions.

METHODS The time-division multiplexing (TDM) technique and SMS method were integrated to achieve a high slice-acceleration (e.g., 6) factor for acquiring relaxation-diffusion MRI. Two variants of the sequence, referred to as TDM3e-SMS and TDM2s-SMS, were developed to simultaneously acquire slice groups with three distinct TEs and two slice groups with the same TE, respectively. Both sequences were evaluated on a 3T scanner with in vivo human brains and compared with standard single-band (SB) -EPI and SMS-EPI using diffusion measures and tractography results. RESULTS Experimental results showed that the TDM3e-SMS sequence with total slice acceleration of 6 (multiplexing factor (MP) = 3  multi-band factor (MB) = 2) provided similar image intensity and microstructure measures compared to standard SMS-EPI with MB = 2, and yielded less bias in intensity compared to standard SMS-EPI with MB = 4. The three sequences showed a similar positive correlation between TE and mean kurtosis (MK) and a negative correlation between TE and mean diffusivity (MD) in white matter. Multi-fiber tractography also shows consistency of results in TE-dependent measures between different sequences. The TDM2s-SMS sequence (MP = 2, MB = 2) also provided imaging measures similar to standard SMS-EPI sequences (MB = 2) for single-TE diffusion imaging. CONCLUSIONS The TDM-SMS sequence can provide additional 2 to 3 acceleration to SMS without degrading imaging quality. With the significant reduction in scan time, TDM-SMS makes joint relaxation-diffusion MRI a feasible technique in neuroimaging research to investigate new markers of brain disorders.","output":"Accelerating joint relaxation-diffusion MRI by integrating time division multiplexing and simultaneous multi-slice (TDM-SMS) strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community-acquired pneumonia is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and is often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. Although it can be caused by a wide variety of micro-organisms, the pneumococcus, atypicals, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and certain Gram-negative rods are the usual pathogens encountered. The site-of-care decision is critical in determining the site and type of care as well as the extent of diagnostic workup. Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible particularly in those requiring admission to hospital, but typically the physician does not know with any degree of certainty the identity of the etiologic pathogen. A number of national guidelines have been published to help the physician with this choice. The initial drug(s) can be modified if necessary if the pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern becomes known. Adjunctive therapy such as pressors and fluid replacement are of value and macrolides appear to help as well, likely secondary to their immunomodulatory effects.

Nine experts from different Latin American countries developed a simplified algorithm for COVID-19 diagnosis in the region, using a modified Delphi method. Twenty-four questions related to diverse diagnostic settings were initially proposed, followed by an extensive discussion of the literature and experts experience. According to time from close contact or symptom onset, the algorithm considers three different timeframes (7 days, 8C13 days, and 14 days) and discusses diagnostic options for each one. SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) continues to be the diagnostic test of choice from Day 1 to Day 14 after symptom onset or close contact, although antigen testing may be used in high-prevalence settings or in particular situations (such as from Day 0 to Days 5C7 of symptom onset). Antibody assays may be used for diagnostic confirmation, mainly after Day 14, if there is an epidemiological or individual need. If the clinical suspicion is very high, but other tests are negative, these assays may be used as an adjunct to decision-making from Days 8C13.

To date, little has been published about PLWH's perspective on the ACA. We explored ACA knowledge, HIV stigma, trust in the healthcare system, and ACA attitudes among PLWH with ADAP-funded QHPs in Virginia. METHODS: Participants were surveyed about demographic characteristics, ACA knowledge, HIV stigma, trust in various healthcare and government entities, and attitudes toward the ACA. Descriptive statistics were used. We assessed for associations (1) between baseline characteristics and correct ACA knowledge, HIV-related stigma, trust, and ACA attitudes and (2) between correct ACA knowledge and the following data: sources of ACA knowledge, HIV stigma, and trust. RESULTS: Participants (n = 53) were a vulnerable population based on the assessment of social determinants of health, and 30% had correct ACA knowledge. Almost three-fourths of participants used HIV clinic case managers for ACA information. Participants who used websites for ACA information had correct ACA knowledge more often compared to those that did not (71% vs. 15%; p = 0.001). Those with correct ACA knowledge had lower stigma scores compared to those without correct ACA knowledge (93.8; SD: 15.4 vs. 108; SD: 20.3; p = 0.01). Participants trusted HIV clinicians more than general clinicians and insurance companies. No association was found between having correct ACA knowledge and endorsing having enough information about the ACA to understand how it will impact their HIV care. CONCLUSIONS: Websites imparted accurate ACA information. HIV clinic case managers were the most used source, and HIV clinicians were a trusted source of information. HIV clinicians and case managers should consider disseminating information about the ACA and its impact on HIV care delivery via internet videos.

In addition, the expressions of ACE2 in different parts of the respiratory system were detected by immunohistochemical staining to explain the special chest CT features of COVID-19 by ACE2 expression. RESULTS: Of 58 patients, the main respiratory manifestations were fever and cough. Spherical or patchy GGO was the initial CT manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia. CT findings manifested as rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations in chest CT scans.

Demand for health care expenditure increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is interesting in modeling the nexus between public and private health expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. To this end, the present study analyzed the nexus between public and private health care expenditure, economic growth, and environmental pollution for 36 Asian countries for the period 1991-2017. FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression analysis confirm the EKC hypothesis in Asia. Besides, FMOLS and quantile regressions reached the reducing effects of government and private health expenditures on CO2 emissions. While quantile regression results show that public and private health expenditures can mitigate CO2 emissions; however, these results differ for various levels of CO2. Findings of quantile regression show a significant impact of both public and private health expenditures in reducing CO2 at the 50th and 75th quantiles but results are insignificant for the 25th quantile. Overall, the paper concludes that both government and private health sectors' expenditures caused CO2 emissions to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO2 emissions is greater than that of the government health sector. The concluding remark is that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. Hence, the health administrators need to increase public and private health expenditures with an effective cost-service and energy-efficient management approach to reach sustainable health services and a sustainable environment in Asia.","output":"The roles of economic growth and health expenditure on CO2 emissions in selected Asian countries: a quantile regression model approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS /hypothesis The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the hospitalization rates for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), osteomyelitis and lower limb revascularization procedure in people with DFU.

METHODS: We present data from a German cohort of 147 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The patients were divided into three groups according to their liver status during treatment. The first group included patients without elevated alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin, the third patients meeting the biochemical criteria of acute liver failure (ALF) and the second all other patients. RESULTS: Liver injury was detected in 75 (50.7%) and 93 (63%) patients by admission and during treatment respectively. ALF was associated with the male sex, younger age and higher BMI.

However, detailed analysis is lacking to explore the complex effect of sex with age or comorbidities. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed among 2,938 SFTS patients entered during 2011C2020 in Xinyang, China. The case fatality rate (CFR) was estimated for their association with sex, age, and comorbidities by an interactive way. The difference of immune response between sex was explored in an age dependent way. Results: An overall CFR of 15.3% (450/2,938) was obtained, which appeared to be higher in males than in females [17.7% vs. 13.6%, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00C1.53; P = 0.048] and increased dramatically with age (P < 0.001). The associations between sex and SFTS fatal outcome were age-dependent and varied according to the status of comorbidities. The mortality-related risk conferred by older age was more pronounced in males, with aOR (95% CI) to be 5.76 (3.75C8.84) vs. 5.30 (3.54C7.95) in female. Sex-stratified analysis disclosed significant associations between death and comorbidities among female patients (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.40C2.49; P < 0.001), while none among males. Among females, the significant associations between presence of comorbidity and fatal outcome differed among age groups, with aOR (95% CI) decreased from 2.28 (1.16C4.46) in 60 years, to 2.06 (1.34C3.18) in 60C70 years and further to 1.55 (0.97C2.47) in >70 years. Altogether 194 SFTS patients were randomly selected for the test of B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD4 cells percentages, and anti-SFTSV IgM antibody level, the results revealed that males >60 years had significantly decreased percentages of B cells, CD4 cells, lower anti-SFTSV IgM antibody titer, and increased level of NK cells than male aged 60 years, while none of these age specific differences was observed in the females. This finding underlies the more pronounced age specific difference in CFR among male than female. Conclusions: Males had a significantly higher mortality of SFTS than did females, and more likely to be affected by aging for SFTS mortality. This difference can be explained by the effect from comorbidities and the host immunity. It is essential to take a sex- and age-based approach to SFTS treatment and management.","output":"Sex Differences in Case Fatality Rate of Patients With Severe Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes have been widely studied to assess the immunological fitness and evolutionary adaptation of animal populations. Among the Canidae, the raccoon dogs adventurous nature, omnivorous behavior, and high variability of intracellular pathogens make it ideal to study selection on MHC class I in a non-model canid species. Here, we examined allelic diversity and evolutionary patterns of MHC class I genes in the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). We identified 48 novel MHC class I alleles from 31 raccoon dogs from Japan and Russia. Some alleles were geographically restricted, whereas others were widely distributed across the species range. The rate of non-synonymous substitutions was greater than that of synonymous substitutions for both exon 2 and exon 3 encoding 1 and 2 domains, respectively, in the  chain of the MHC class I protein. Positively selected sites at the amino acid level were evident in both the 1 and 2 domains, and a recombination breakpoint was found in exon 3. Bayesian phylogenetic trees showed no evidence of trans-species polymorphism (TSP) with alleles from carnivoran species in other families but did detect TSP between raccoon dogs and the domestic dog, Canis familiaris, indicative of long-term balancing selection in canids. Our results indicate that the extensive allelic diversity of MHC class I in Japanese and Russian raccoon dogs has been influenced and maintained by pathogen-driven positive selection, recombination, and long-term balancing selection.

It would inspire policymakers to renovate measures and policies that would help in rehabilitating all sectors in general and more affected groups in particular. From 30 districts of Rwanda, 510 respondents have been sampled through convenience andJudgmental techniques. Findings revealed that people misinterpret the pandemic which lowers their level of compliance to Covid-19 preventive measures. Stay home orders were not a fruitful time for families whereby 84% of respondents were victims of domestic and sexual violence. However, with 16%, it was a good time for family cohesion. Isolation and social values frustration, family disorganization and dysfunctional, depression, and anxiety are major social effects of Covid-19. Loss of Jobs, decreased salaries, none compliance with preventive measures fines, incapacity to pay bank loans, inability to satisfy family basic needs, government extra investment in medical health care have enormously affected the Rwandan economy. Thus, there is a need of strengthening sensitization of covid-19 spread, preventive measures, short and long-term consequences associated with it.

The high incidence of COVID-19 in the elderly is a health problem worldwide. The lack of public knowledge about preventing the transmission of COVID-19 and the behaviour of not complying with health protocols are very risky to public health status. Anticipation to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 is carried out by the government by providing vaccinations for high-risk groups. The condition that occurs is that there are many risk groups who lack knowledge so they are not willing to carry out vaccinations. This will have an impact on the high risk of transmission of COVID-19. The socialization that has been carried out has not reached the maximum target. We need the right method by which health cadres can carry out their duties and roles in increasing COVID-19 vaccination coverage. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the implementation of service to the Health Cadre group in the Mulyorejo District Area to increase vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hoped that the public, especially those at high risk of transmitting COVID-19 have knowledge about the importance of vaccination. Therefore, self-awareness arises to be willing to vaccinate as an effort to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Self-awareness will increase vaccination coverage in risk groups especially the elderly.

Despite a successful vaccine rollout during the first half of 2021, cases and hospitalisations have started to increase since the end of May as the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant increases in frequency. The final step of relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in England has been delayed from 21 June to 19 July 2021. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmision-1 (REACT-1) study measures the prevalence of swab-positivity among random samples of the population of England. Round 12 of REACT-1 obtained self-administered swab collections from participants from 20 May 2021 to 7 June 2021; results are compared with those for round 11, in which swabs were collected from 15 April to 3 May 2021. Results Between rounds 11 and 12, national prevalence increased from 0.10% (0.08%, 0.13%) to 0.15% (0.12%, 0.18%). During round 12, we detected exponential growth with a doubling time of 11 (7.1, 23) days and an R number of 1.44 (1.20, 1.73). The highest prevalence was found in the North West at 0.26% (0.16%, 0.41%) compared to 0.05% (0.02%, 0.12%) in the South West. In the North West, the locations of positive samples suggested a cluster in Greater Manchester and the east Lancashire area. Prevalence in those aged 5-49 was 2.5 times higher at 0.20% (0.16%, 0.26%) compared with those aged 50 years and above at 0.08% (0.06%, 0.11%). At the beginning of February 2021, the link between infection rates and hospitalisations and deaths started to weaken, although in late April 2021, infection rates and hospital admissions started to reconverge. When split by age, the weakened link between infection rates and hospitalisations at ages 65 years and above was maintained, while the trends converged below the age of 65 years. The majority of the infections in the younger group occurred in the unvaccinated population or those without a stated vaccine history. We observed the rapid replacement of the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 with the Delta variant during the period covered by rounds 11 and 12 of the study. Discussion The extent to which exponential growth continues, or slows down as a consequence of the continued rapid roll-out of the vaccination programme, including to young adults, requires close monitoring. Data on community prevalence are vital to track the course of the epidemic and inform ongoing decisions about the timing of further lifting of restrictions in England.","output":"REACT-1 round 12 report: resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in England associated with increased frequency of the Delta variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unexpected but exceedingly consequential, the COVID-19 outbreak has undermined livelihoods, disrupted the economy, induced upheavals, and posed challenges to government decision-makers. Under various behavioural regulations, such as social distancing and transport limitations, social media has become the central platform on which people from all regions, regardless of local COVID-19 severity, share their feelings and exchange thoughts. Our study illustrates the evolution of moods expressed on social media regarding COVID-19-related issues and empirically confirms the hypothesis that the severity of the pandemic substantially correlates with these sentiments by analysing tweets on Sina Weibo (Chinas central social media platform). Methodologically, we leveraged Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training, the most state-of-the-art natural language processing pre-trained sentiment-related multipurpose model, to label Sina Weibo tweets during the most distressed period in 2020. Given that the model itself does not provide a feature explanation, we utilize a random forest and linear probit model with the labelled sample to demonstrate how each word plays a role in the prediction. Finally, we demonstrate a strong negative linear relationship between the local severity of COVID-19 and the local sentiment response by incorporating miscellaneous geo-economic control variables.

Several prophylactic vaccines against COVID-19 are currently in development, yet little is known about peoples acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine. Methods We conducted an online survey of adults ages 18 and older in the United States (n=2,006) in May 2020. Multivariable relative risk regression identified correlates of participants willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine acceptability). Results Overall, 69% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they thought their healthcare provider would recommend vaccination (RR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.49C2.02) or if they were moderate (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.02C1.16) or liberal (RR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07C1.22) in their political leaning. Participants were also more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they reported higher levels of perceived likelihood getting a COVID-19 infection in the future (RR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.01C1.09), perceived severity of COVID-19 infection (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.04C1.11), or perceived effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine (RR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.40C1.52).

Vaccines against COVID-19 became available in December 2020 with limited supply, resulting in the need for policies regarding prioritization. The next month, SARS-CoV-2 variants were detected that were more transmissible but still vaccine-susceptible, raising scrutiny of these policies. In particular, prioritization of higher-risk people could prevent more deaths per dose of vaccine administered but could also delay herd immunity if the prioritization introduced bottlenecks that lowered vaccination speed (the number of doses that could be delivered per day). We used mathematical modeling to examine the trade-off between prioritization and the vaccination speed. Methods A stochastic, discrete-time susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model with age- and comorbidity-adjusted COVID-19 outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by July 1, 2021) was used to examine the trade-off between vaccination speed and whether or not vaccination was prioritized to individuals age 65+ and \\"essential workers,\\" defined as including first responders and healthcare, transit, education, and public safety workers. The model was calibrated to COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital census, ICU census, and deaths in NYC. Vaccination speed was assumed to be 10,000 doses per day starting December 15th, 2020 targeting healthcare workers and nursing home populations, and to subsequently expand at alternative starting times and speeds. We compared COVID-outcomes across alternative expansion starting times (January 15th, January 21st, or February 1st) and speeds (20,000, 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, or 200,000 doses per day for the first dose), as well as alternative prioritization options (\\"yes\\" versus \\"no\\" prioritization of essential workers and people age 65+). Model projections were produced with and without considering the emergence of a SARS-COV-2 variant with 56% greater transmissibility over January and February, 2021. Results In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, the emergence of the more transmissible variant would triple the peak in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths and more than double cumulative infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. To offset the harm from the more transmissible variant would require reaching a vaccination speed of at least 100,000 doses per day by January 15th or 150,000 per day by January 21st. Prioritizing people ages 65+ and essential workers increased the number of lives saved per vaccine dose delivered: with the emergence of a more transmissible variant, 8,000 deaths could be averted by delivering 115,000 doses per day without prioritization or 71,000 doses per day with prioritization. If prioritization were to cause a bottleneck in vaccination speed, more lives would be saved with prioritization only if the bottleneck reduced vaccination speed by less than one-third of the maximum vaccine delivery capacity. These trade-offs between vaccination speed and prioritization were robust over a wide range of delivery capacity. Conclusions The emergence of a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to triple the 2021 epidemic peak and more than double the 2021 COVID-19 burden in NYC. Vaccination could only offset the harm of the more transmissible variant if high speed were achieved in mid- to late January. Prioritization of COVID-19 vaccines to higher-risk populations saves more lives only if it does not create an excessive vaccine delivery bottleneck.","output":"Under what circumstances could vaccination offset the harm from a more transmissible variant of SARS-COV-2 in NYC?

Everyday activities such as social interactions with colleagues must therefore be reconsidered. Existing literature emphasises that social interactions, typically conducted in the traditional workplace, are a fundamental feature of social life and shape employees experience of work. This experience is completely removed for many employees due to the pandemic and, presently, there is a lack of knowledge on how individuals maintain social interactions with colleagues via technology when working from home. Given that a lack of social interaction can lead to social isolation and other negative repercussions, this study aims to contribute to the existing body of literature on remote working by highlighting employees experiences and practices around social interaction with colleagues. This study takes an interpretivist and qualitative approach utilising the diary-keeping technique to collect data from twenty-nine individuals who had started to work from home on a full-time basis as a result of the pandemic. The study explores how participants conduct social interactions using different technology platforms and how such interactions are embedded in their working lives. The findings highlight the difficulty in maintaining social interactions via technology such as the absence of cues and emotional intelligence, as well as highlighting numerous other factors such as job uncertainty, increased workloads and heavy usage of technology that affect their work lives. The study also highlights that despite the negative experiences relating to working from home, some participants are apprehensive about returning to work in the traditional office place where social interactions may actually be perceived as a distraction. The main contribution of our study is to highlight that a variety of perceptions and feelings of how work has changed via an increased use of digital media while working from home exists and that organisations need to be aware of these differences so that they can be managed in a contextualised manner, thus increasing both the efficiency and effectiveness of working from home.","output":"Working from Home During Covid-19: Doing and Managing Technology-enabled Social Interaction With Colleagues at a Distance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our studies are mainly focused on developing strategies of immune regulation.

RESULTS Evidence for the protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding against childhood obesity have been provided by studies which explored 5 physiologic mechanisms and those that established the causality between breastfeeding and lower risk of obesity. The few studies that disputed this relationship highlighted the influence of confounding factors. A new insight on molecular mechanisms, however, points to a direct and indirect effect of human milk oligosaccharides on the prevention of overweight and obesity.

Connectivity patterns varied strongly among years and seasons in the scale and shape but not in the direction of dispersal. This interannual variation in dispersal kernels introduced temporal covariance among dispersal routes with overall positive correlations in connections across the metapopulation that may reduce stochastic metapopulation growth rates. The extent of variation in mean dispersal distance observed here among years is comparable in magnitude to the differences across reef fish species.

This study suggests that the cognitive paradox of simultaneously believing known facts less and new, alternative facts more is the outcome of a distrust mindset, characterized by spontaneous consideration of alternatives, including misinformation. We captured this paradox and its correlates in a scale that measures individuals' ability to distinguish between the truth value of well-established facts (Earth rotates eastward around its own axis, completing a full rotation once in about 24 h) and baseless alternative facts (Earth can change its rotation direction and flip its axis, and we will never notice it). Assuming that an anti-COVID-19 vaccine attitude arises from a chronically distrusting mindset, we sampled participants on Prolific who were pre-screened for their COVID-19 vaccine attitude based on earlier responses. We found that people who rejected COVID-19 vaccines believed well-established facts less, and alternative facts more, compared to supporters of the vaccine. Less discernment between truths and falsehoods was correlated with less intellectual humility, more distrust and greater reliance on one's intuition. This observed thought pattern offers insights into theoretical understanding of the antecedents of belief in alternative facts and conspiracy theories.","output":"Believing in nothing and believing in everything: The underlying cognitive paradox of anti-COVID-19 vaccine attitudes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed sex-based differences in anti-viral responses, with a higher rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as a higher rate of morbidity and mortality in men than in women.

In this context, we aim to assess the Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) service availability and readiness in health facilities in Nepal by analyzing data from Nepal Health Facility Survey (NHFS), 2015. METHODS: We utilized cross-sectional data from the nationally representative NHFS, 2015. Service availability was measured by seven signal functions of BEmONC, and service readiness by the availability and functioning of supportive items categorized into three domains: staff and guidelines, diagnostic equipment, and basic medicine and commodities. We used the World Health Organizations service availability and readiness indicators to estimate the readiness scores. We performed a multiple linear regression to identify important factors in the readiness of the health facilities to provide BEmONC services. RESULTS: The BEmONC service readiness score was significantly higher in public hospitals compared with private hospitals and peripheral public health facilities. Significant factors associated with service readiness score were the facility type (14.69 points higher in public hospitals, P<0.001), number of service delivery staff (2.49 points increase per each additional delivery staff, P<0.001), the service hours (4.89 points higher in facilities offering 24-hour services, P = 0.01) and status of periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths (4.88 points higher in facilities that conducted periodic review, P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BEmONC services in Nepal could be improved by increasing the number of service delivery staff, expanding service hours to 24-hours a day, and conducting periodic review of maternal and newborn deaths at health facilities, mainly in the peripheral public health facilities. The private hospitals need to be encouraged for BEmONC service readiness.","output":"Basic emergency obstetric and newborn care service availability and readiness in Nepal: Analysis of the 2015 Nepal Health Facility Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this work is to present Virtual Tutoring as a strategy of the Psychopedagogy and Tutoring service to respond to the need for accompaniment and monitoring of students from the Faculty of Sciences and Engineering of a university in the north of Lima during the first four months into the COVID-19 pandemic.

Plasma C5a and C3a levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We identified elevated levels of plasma C3a and C5a in HD patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls. Serial sampling identified that C5a levels were elevated prior to clinical deterioration in patients who developed severe disease. C3a more closely mirrored both clinical and biochemical disease severity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that activation of complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, leading to endothelial injury and lung damage.

This situation has highlighted the need to assess whether existing national electoral legislation includes enough instruments to ensure citizens safety during voting procedures, even under the conditions of a global pandemic. Such instruments, often grouped under the umbrella of voter facilitation or convenience voting, range from voting in advance and various forms of absentee voting (postal, online, and proxy voting) to assisted voting and voting at home and in hospitals and other healthcare institutions. While most democracies have implemented at least some form of voter facilitation, substantial cross-country differences still exist. In the push to develop pandemic-sustainable elections in different institutional and political contexts, variation in voter facilitation makes it possible to learn from country-specific experiences. As accessibility and inclusiveness are critical components of elections for ensuring political legitimacy and accountability these lessons are of utmost importance. In this study, we focus on Finland, where the Parliament decided in March 2021 to postpone for two months the municipal elections that were originally scheduled to be held on April 18. Although the decision was mostly justified by the sudden and dramatic daily increase in new COVID-19 infections, the inability to guarantee the opportunity to vote for those in quarantine was included among the likely risks. The failure to organize health-safe voting procedures to accommodate the original schedule emphasizes a certain paradox in the Finnish electoral legislation: caution in introducing new facilitation instruments has led to lower levels of preparedness and flexibility in crisis situations. Although a forerunner in implementing extensive advance voting opportunities, Finland has only recently introduced postal voting, which is restricted to voters living abroad. Hence, we ask: what can be learned from this form of convenience voting if expanded to all voters to enhance the sustainability of elections? Our analyses are based on a survey conducted among non-resident voters (n = 2,100) after the 2019 parliamentary elections in which postal voting from abroad was allowed for the first time. Our results show that whereas trust in the integrity of postal voting is quite high, various efforts needed from individual voters substantially increase the costs of postal voting. Postal operations also raise concerns. Furthermore, voters felt that requiring two witnesses made postal voting cumbersome, an issue that needs to be resolved, particularly if applying postal voting in the context of a pandemic. The Finnish case constitutes a concrete example of a situation in which voter facilitation targeted to a particular segment of society may become a testbed for electoral engineering that will improve voting opportunities for everyone.

Removal of these cytokines by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) prior to end-organ damage may improve clinical outcomes. This manuscript is intended to serve as a preliminary guidance document for application of TPE in patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The available literature pertaining to the role of TPE for treatment of COVID-19 patients was reviewed to guide optimal management. It included indication, contraindication, optimal timing of initiation and termination of TPE, vascular access and anticoagulants, numbers and mode of procedures, outcome measures and adverse events. RESULTS: Out of a total of 78 articles, only 65 were directly related to the topic. From these 65, only 32 were acceptable as primary source, while 33 were used as supporting references. TPE in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be classified under ASFA category III grade 2B. The early initiation of TPE for 1-15 patient's plasma volume with fresh frozen plasma, or 4-5% albumin or COVID-19 convalescent plasma as replacement fluids before multiorgan failure, has better chances of recovery. The number of procedures can vary from three to nine depending on patient response. CONCLUSION: TPE in COVID-19 patients may help by removing toxic cytokines, viral particles and/or by correcting coagulopathy or restoring endothelial membrane. Severity score (SOFA & APACHE II) and cytokine levels (IL-6, C-reactive protein) can be used to execute TPE therapy and to monitor response in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Understanding the role of therapeutic plasma exchange in COVID-19: preliminary guidance and practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Routine HIV testing accompanied with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) requires innovative support in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the usage of HIV self-testing (HIVST) kits and their secondary distribution to partners among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China, who use PrEP, in an observational study between 2018 and 2019. METHODS: In 4 major cities in China, we prospectively followed-up MSM from the China Real-world oral PrEP demonstration study, which provides daily or on-demand PrEP for 12 months, to assess the usage and secondary distribution of HIVST on quarterly follow-ups. Half of the PrEP users were randomized to receive 2 HIVSTs per month in addition to quarterly facility-based HIV testing. We evaluated the feasibility of providing HIVST to PrEP users. RESULTS: We recruited 939 MSM and randomized 471 to receive HIVST, among whom 235 (49.9%) were daily and 236 (50.1%) were on-demand PrEP users. At baseline, the median age was 29 years, 390 (82.0%) men had at least college-level education, and 119 (25.3%) had never undergone facility-based HIV testing before. Three months after PrEP initiation, 341 (74.5%) men had used the HIVST provided to them and found it very easy to use. Among them, 180 of 341 (52.8%) men had distributed the HIVST kits it to other MSM, and 132 (51.6%) among the 256 men who returned HIVST results reported that used it with their sexual partners at the onset of intercourse. Participants on daily PrEP were more likely to use HIVST (adjusted hazard ratio=1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) and distribute HIVST kits (adjusted hazard ratio=1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7) than those using on-demand PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: MSM who used PrEP had a high rate of usage and secondary distribution of HIVST kits, especially among those on daily PrEP, which suggested high feasibility and necessity for HIVST after PrEP initiation. Assuming that fourth-generation HIVST kits are available, HIVST may be able to replace facility-based HIV testing to a certain extent.

PRSs are typically constructed using pruning and thresholding (P+T), but the best choice of parameters is uncertain; thus multiple settings are used and the best is chosen. This optimization can lead to inflated type I error. To correct this, permutation procedures can be used but they can be computationally intensive. Alternatively, a single parameter setting can be chosen a priori for the PRS, but choosing suboptimal settings result in loss of power. We propose computing PRSs under a range of parameter settings, performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the resulting set of PRSs, and using the first PRS-PC in association tests. The first PC reweights the variants included in the PRS with new weights to achieve maximum variation over all PRS settings used. Using simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed PRS-PCA approach with a permutation test and a priori selection of p-value threshold. We then apply the approach to the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank study to test for PRS association with psychosis using a variety of PRSs constructed from summary statistics from the largest studies of psychiatric disorders and related traits. The PRS-PCA approach is simple to implement, outperforms the other strategies in most scenarios, and provides an unbiased estimate of prediction performance.

Triage guidelines, however, differ on whether limited resources should focus on maximizing lives or life-years. Choosing between these two approaches has implications for neonatology. Neonatal units have ventilators, some adaptable for adults. This raises the question of whether, in crisis conditions, guidelines for treating extremely premature babies should be altered to free-up ventilators. Some adults who need ventilators will have a survival rate higher than some extremely premature babies. But surviving babies will likely live longer, maximizing life-years. Empiric evidence demonstrates that these babies can derive significant survival benefits from ventilation when compared to adults.

In this study, our goal was to explore the changing expression levels of acute-phase reaction proteins (APRPs) in the serum of COVID-19 patients and to elucidate the immunological characteristics of COVID-19. In the study design, we recruited 72 COVID-19 patients, including 22 cases of mild degree, 38 cases of moderate degree and 12 cases of severe degree. We also recruited 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 20 normal control subjects as a comparison. Fasting venous blood was taken to detect the content of complement 3 (C3), complement 4 (C4), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and prealbumin (PA). When compared the COVID-19 group with the CAP and normal control groups, respectively, the mean value of CRP and SAA in the COVID-19 group (including mild, moderate and severe patients) had increased significantly (P < 0.01), whereas the mean values of C3, C4 and PA decreased (P < 0.01). For the asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients with COVID-19, the actual aggravation of disease may be more advanced than the clinical appearances. Meanwhile, the statistical analyses indicated that the development of COVID-19 brought about a significant increase in the content of CRP and SAA (P < 0.01), and a decline in the content of C3, C4 and PA (P < 0.01). These findings suggested that the changes in the level of APRPs could be used as indicators to identify the degree and progression of COVID-19, and the significant changes might demonstrate the aggravation of disease.

We sought to understand the needs for those seeking assistance with food through Compass and how these needs changed due to COVID-19. CF Foundation Compass is a free, personalised case management service to help with insurance, financial, legal, and other issues PwCF are facing. Methods: We identified Compass calls between January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 related to food assistance. We reviewed whether callers had an additional need reported during the call. For 2020 calls, we also determined whether their needs could be met by community resources;2019 referral data was not available. Results: Compass received 174 requests for food assistance. Food requests almost tripled between 2019 (47) and 2020 (127). Of the 174 food requests, 60% of callers had an additional need and 38% had 2 or more additional needs. 75% of the additional needs related to other social factors including utility costs (33%), housing (27%), medical needs (13%), and car issues (5%). In 2020, half of food needs (44%) were not met by community resources. 17% of callers did not follow Compass recommendations. Conclusions: Given the unique caloric needs of PwCF, lack of food is a concern. Food access in the U.S. has been impacted by COVID-19 and community resources are scarce. People facing FI are more likely to have other social needs, such as affordable housing. CF clinicians are uniquely positioned to have sensitive conversations and address these factors to understand the need and improve quality of life for their patients. This can be accomplished by screening for social factors and collecting and evaluating the data.

The resulting neutropenia as well as injury to the pulmonary and gastrointestinal mucosa allow pathogenic micro-organisms easy access to the body. The symptoms of an incipient infection are usually subtle and limited to unexplained fever due to the absence of granulocytes. This is the reason why prompt administration of antimicrobial agents while waiting for the results of the blood cultures, the so-called empirical approach, became an undisputed standard of care. Gram-negative pathogens remain the principal concern because their virulence accounts for serious morbidity and a high early mortality rate. Three basic intravenous antibiotic regimens have evolved: initial therapy with a single antipseudomonal -lactam, the so-called monotherapy; a combination of two drugs: a -lactam with an aminoglycoside, a second -lactam or a quinolone; and, thirdly, a glycopeptide in addition to -lactam monotherapy or combination. As there is no single consistently superior empirical regimen, one should consider the local antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates in the selection of the initial antibiotic regimen. Not all febrile neutropenic patients carry the same risk as those with fever only generally respond rapidly, whereas those with a clinically or microbiologically documented infection show a much slower reaction and less favorable response rate. Once an empirical antibiotic therapy has been started, the patient must be monitored continuously for nonresponse, emergence of secondary infections, adverse effects, and the development of drug-resistant organisms. The averageduration of fever in serious infections in eventually successfully treated neutropenic patients is 4C5 days. Adaptations of an antibiotic regimen in a patient who is clearly not responding is relatively straightforward when a micro-organism has been isolated; the results of the cultures, supplemented by susceptibility testing, will assist in selecting the proper antibiotics. The management of febrile patients with pulmonary infiltrates is complex. Bronchoscopy and a high resolution computer-assisted tomographic scan represent the cornerstones of all diagnostic procedures, supplemented by serological tests for relevant viral pathogens and for aspergillosis. Fungi have been found to be responsible for two thirds of all superinfections that may surface during broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of neutropenic patients. Antibiotic treatment is usually continued for a minimum of 7 days or until culture results indicate that the causative organism has been eradicated and the patient is free of major signs and symptoms. If a persistently neutropenic patient has no complaints and displays no evidence of infection, early watchful cessation of antibiotic therapy or a change to the oral regimen should be considered.","output":"Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Febrile Neutropenia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Comprehensive epidemiological surveys for Lyme disease have not been conducted for the Bactrian camel in China.

Therefore, we developed a simple and rapid real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction for the timely detection of the common ALV subgroups, whereby the amplification can be obtained in 35 min under isothermal conditions at 63 C, ability to specific, sensitive and rapid detect all the common ALV subgroups. METHODS: A set of four specific primers was designed to target the sequences of the pol gene of ALV, and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay were developed and compared with PCR and virus isolation methods. RESULTS: The results from specificity of the LAMP assay showed that only target ALVs DNA was amplified. The LAMP assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 20 copies/reaction of ALV DNA, which was 10 times higher than the conventional PCR measurement. To further evaluate the reliability of the method, the assay was evaluated with ALV DNA from a panel of 81 clinical samples suspected of ALV infection. The results verify that the LAMP method was more sensitive than the conventional PCR and virus isolation method. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the developed LAMP assay was a simple, inexpensive, sensitive method for the rapid detection of the most common subgroups of ALV, and it provided a useful and practical tool in the eradication program for ALV in the poultry industry.","output":"Rapid detection of the common avian leukosis virus subgroups by real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of perceptual decision-making in monkeys has provided insights into the process by which sensory evidence is integrated toward a decision.

Respondents evaluated scenarios reflecting uses of digital data for COVID-19 control (case identification, digital contact tracing, policy setting, and enforcement of quarantines). Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of support for use of personal digital data in 9 scenarios to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection, rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted for each scenario and included factors hypothesized to be associated with views about digital data use for COVID-19 mitigation measures.

Interestingly, although it is often believed that fairly high concentrations (M) are needed to achieve antisense activity, our PNA-R8 was effective at 200 nM. RNA-seq characterized microRNA-155 as a broad-acting riboregulator, feedback restraining a late myeloid differentiation-induced pro-inflammatory network, comprising MyD88-signalling and ubiquitin-proteasome components. Our results highlight the important role of the microRNA machinery in fine-control of blood-derived human phagocyte immunity and open the door for further studies on regulatory RNAs in difficult-to-transfect primary human immune cells.","output":"Efficient antisense inhibition reveals microRNA-155 to restrain a late-myeloid inflammatory programme in primary human phagocytes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: To evaluate the feasibility of identifying viruses from aircraft cabin air, we evaluated whether respiratory viruses trapped by commercial aircraft air filters can be extracted and detected using a multiplex PCR, bead\\\\based assay. Methods and Results: The ResPlex II assay was first tested for its ability to detect inactivated viruses applied to new filter material; all 18 applications of virus at a high concentration were detected. The ResPlex II assay was then used to test for 18 respiratory viruses on 48 used air filter samples from commercial aircraft. Three samples tested positive for viruses, and three viruses were detected: rhinovirus, influenza A and influenza B. For 33 of 48 samples, internal PCR controls performed suboptimally, suggesting sample matrix effect. Conclusion: In some cases, influenza and rhinovirus RNA can be detected on aircraft air filters, even more than 10 days after the filters were removed from aircraft. Significance and Impact of the Study: With protocol modifications to overcome PCR inhibition, air filter sampling and the ResPlex II assay could be used to characterize viruses in aircraft cabin air. Information about viruses in aircraft could support public health measures to reduce disease transmission within aircraft and between cities.","output":"Detection of respiratory viruses on air filters from aircraft"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Simultaneous qualitative and quantitative assessment of eight flavonoids and two terpenoids were performed in fourteen in vitro raised morphogenic cultures of Glycyrrhiza glabra. Our study revealed that the spectrum and production of ten compounds, under investigation, were higher in organized tissue than the undifferentiated mass, however, aerial portions of the in vitro raised plants (leaf and stem) were found to be devoid of therapeutically relevant triterpenoid, glycyrrhizin. A correlation was observed between cell maturation, morphological differentiation and glycyrrhizin accumulation. Mature stolons (4 months) were characterized by the maximum accumulation of glycyrrhizin (8.60 g/mg) in in vitro plantlets. The cytotoxic effect of the extracts evaluated against a panel of human cancer cell lines (in vitro) indicated that the pancreatic cell line (MIA-PaCa-2) were sensitive to all the fourteen extracts investigated. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive report relating plant growth regulators to metabolite spectrum and cytotoxic assessment in in vitro raised G. glabra cultures.

These attacks come as part of the government's attempts to further neoliberal development and undermine environmental and indigenous rights, taking advantage of what the Minister of Environment called 'a moment of calm while the press is focusing on the pandemic'. The pandemic has intensified environmental conflicts affecting indigenous peoples, both in amplifying conflicts but also in sparking new acts of resistance and self-protection of indigenous lives and territories. Based on case studies and monitoring of rapidly evolving social media and WhatsApp posts, the researchers analyse these processes through a political ecology lens. The researchers find confirmed cases and deaths amongst indigenous peoples centred around tourism hotspots, mining sites, and other development projects. Yet the presence of these risks, and long term conflicts related to land-grabbing and resource theft linked to said development, has in some cases strengthened community ties and increased capacity for active resistance. While some Mebengokr.. (Kayap..) communities in the Amazon have fled further into the forest to maintain isolation, others have expelled gold-miners from their villages. Tupinamb.. and Patax.. communities in the Northeast have set up blockades to keep people, and the virus, out.

Little is understood about the role of shocks on the career path and how the interplay of individual reactions to shocks shapes careers. The purpose of this study is to provide understanding of responses to different attributes of career shocks and career shocks as antecedents to career and job change. A qualitative approach was chosen and data were obtained from 25 semi-structured interviews with a sample of mid-career individuals who had experienced shocks in their work lives. The analysis was 2-fold and aimed at unearthing of individual responses to shocks and the question of the role of shocks on changes in the career path. Firstly, the analysis of career shocks revealed a pattern of distinct agentic responses in relation to shocks of different attributes. Secondly, from the analysis of shock attributes and corresponding responses over time career changer profiles emerged which differ in regard to career change behavior and magnitude of changes in the career (e.g., major career changes into another field). A process model which depicts how post-shock careers are shaped distinctively in relation to different shock attributes and corresponding responses is presented. This study underlines the importance of understanding the unplannable in career development and shows a variety of options for individuals to develop their careers despite shocks. Limitation stems from the investigation of a sample limited to mid-career individuals. The findings provide a new conceptual lens to theorize and conduct research on career shocks and career changes and facilitate the development of coping strategies for career shocks.

Results: Overall, 502 respondents from 40 countries across six continents completed the survey. The mean number (SD) of ICU beds was 64  84. The most popular initial diagnostic tools used for treatment initiation were arterial blood gas (48%) and clinical presentation (37.5%), while the national COVID-19 guidelines were the most used (61.2%). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) (53.8%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (47%), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (92%) were mostly used for mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases, respectively. However, only 38.8%, 56.6% and 82.9% of the respondents had standard protocols for HFNC, NIV, and IMV, respectively. The most frequently used modes of IMV and NIV were volume control (VC) (36.1%) and continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support (CPAP/PS) (40.6%). About 54% of the respondents did not adhere to the recommended, regular ventilator check interval.

This paper considers how the inability for urban patients to access in-person care expediated the introduction of virtual solutions in health service delivery thus creating a new access paradigm for rural and remote Australians. CONTEXT 'Physical distancing' is a phrase synonymous with public health responses to COVID-19 in Australia, but distance is a decades-long problem for rural health access. Counterintuitively, the pandemic and associated restrictions on mobility have reduced in real terms the distance from, and therefore the time taken to access, critical public services. 'Lockdowns' have unlocked health access for rural and remote Australians in ways that had been rejected prior to 2020. The pandemic has disrupted traditional delivery models and allowed the piloting of novel solutions, at the same time as stress-testing current delivery systems. In the process, it has laid bare a myopia we term 'urban paternalism' in understanding and delivering rural health. APPROACH This commentary outlines how the COVID-19 operating environment has challenged traditional urban-dominated policy thinking about virtual health care delivery and how greater availability of telehealth appointments goes some way to reducing the health access gap for rural and remote Australians. CONCLUSION Australian Commonwealth Government policy changes to expand the Medical Benefit Scheme (MBS) to include telephone or online health consultations are a positive initiative towards supporting Australians through the ongoing public health crisis and have also created access parity for some rural and remote patients. Although initially announced as a temporary COVID-19 measure in March 2020, telehealth has now become a permanent feature of the Medicare landscape. This significant public health reform has paved the way for a more flexible and inclusive universal health care system but, more importantly, taken much needed steps towards improving access to primary health care for patients in rural and remote areas. Now the question is: Can the health care system integrate this virtual model of delivery into 'business as usual' to ensure the long-term sustainability of telehealth services to rural and remote Australia?","output":"Survival of rural telehealth services post-pandemic in Australia: A call to retain the gains in the 'new normal'."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How to achieve the continuous improvement of the environmental performance level of the power industry within the requirements of clean and low-carbon energy development is the fundamental requirement and inevitable choice for the construction of ecological civilization and sustainable development.

The environmental efficiency is divided into two links: power generation efficiency and transmission and distribution efficiency. The study found that, within the research interval, the overall environmental efficiency of Chinas 30 provinces is low, and the differences between provinces and cities are large, but they have gradually developed in a better direction after 2015. The power generation efficiency of the first link in most provinces and municipalities is higher than the transmission and distribution efficiency of the second link, and the low transmission and distribution efficiency is an important reason for the low comprehensive level of environmental efficiency. The overall evolution trend of environmental efficiency in the six regions of China is roughly the same, but the regional differences are obvious, showing a trend of high in the southeast and low in the northwest.

T-cell immunity to COVID-19 is mediated through differentiated CD4(+) T-cells and cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cells, although their differentiation is often atypical and ambiguous in COVID-19 and single cell dynamics of key genes need to be characterized. Notably, T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients, although their molecular features are still yet to be fully revealed. Importantly, it is not clear which T-cell activities are beneficial and protective and which ones can contribute to the development of severe COVID-19. In this article, we examine the latest evidence and discuss the key features of T-cell responses in COVID-19, showing how T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients. Particularly, we highlight the impairment of FOXP3 induction in CD4(+) T-cells and how the impaired FOXP3 expression can lead to the differentiation of abnormally activated (hyperactivated) T-cells and the dysregulated T-cell responses in severe patients. Furthermore, we characterise the feature of hyperactivated T-cells, showing their potential contribution to T-cell dysregulation and immune-mediated tissue destruction (immunopathology) in COVID-19.","output":"T-cell dysregulation in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the overall survival of patients with operable stage IA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who undergo early SBRT (within 0C30 days after diagnosis) versus delayed surgery (90C120 days after diagnosis). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: During the COVID-19 pandemic, national guidelines have recommended patients with operable stage IA NSCLC to consider delaying surgery by at least 3 months or, alternatively, to undergo SBRT without delay. It is unknown which strategy is associated with better short- and long-term outcomes. METHODS: Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling and propensity score-matched analysis was used to compare the overall survival of patients with stage IA NSCLC in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2015 who underwent early SBRT (0C30 days after diagnosis) versus that of patients who underwent delayed wedge resection (90C120 days after diagnosis). RESULTS: During the study period, 570 (55%) patients underwent early SBRT and 475 (45%) underwent delayed wedge resection. In multivariable analysis, delayed resection was associated with improved survival [adjusted hazard ratio 0.61; (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50C0.76)]. Propensity-score matching was used to create 2 groups of 279 patients each who received early SBRT or delayed resection that were well-matched with regard to baseline characteristics. The 5-year survival associated with delayed resection was 53% (95% CI: 45%C61%) which was better than the 5-year survival associated with early SBRT (31% [95% CI: 24%C37%]). CONCLUSION: In this national analysis, for patients with stage IA NSCLC, extended delay of surgery was associated with improved survival when compared to early treatment with SBRT.","output":"Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Versus Delayed Surgery for Early-stage Non-small-cell Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to investigate an antimicrobial and degradable composite material consisting of melt-blown poly(lactic acid) nonwoven fabrics, alginate, and zinc.

Clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients can be classified as non-severe, severe and critical cases. In particular, studies have highlighted the relationship between the lymphopenia and the severity of the illness, where CD8 [Formula: see text] T cells have the lowest levels in critical cases. However, quantitative understanding of the immune responses in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Objectives: In this work, we aim to elucidate the key parameters that define the course of the disease deviating from severe to critical cases. Dynamics of different immune cells are taken into account in mechanistic models to elucidate those that contribute to the worsening of the disease. Methods: Several mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations are proposed to represent data sets of different immune response cells dynamics such as CD8 [Formula: see text] T cells, NK cells, and also CD4 [Formula: see text] T cells in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Parameter fitting is performed using the differential evolution algorithm. Non-parametric bootstrap approach is introduced to abstract the stochastic environment of the infection. Results: The mathematical model that represents the data more appropriately is considering CD8 [Formula: see text] T cell dynamics. This model had a good fit to reported experimental data, and in accordance with values found in the literature. The NK cells and CD4 [Formula: see text] T cells did not contribute enough to explain the dynamics of the immune responses. Conclusions: Our computational results highlight that a low viral clearance rate by CD8 [Formula: see text] T cells could lead to the severity of the disease. This deregulated clearance suggests that it is necessary immunomodulatory strategies during the course of the infection to avoid critical states in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Computational Simulations to Dissect the Cell Immune Response Dynamics for Severe and Critical Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to assess the mental state of Poles in the first weeks of the SARS-COV-2 epidemic","output":"Mental health and the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic - Polish research study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amyloidoses are a group of diseases associated with the formation of pathological protein fibrils with cross-? structures. Approximately 5-10% of the cases of these diseases are determined by amyloidogenic mutations, as well as by transmission of infectious amyloids (prions) between organisms. The most common group of so-called sporadic amyloidoses is associated with abnormal aggregation of wild-type proteins. Some sporadic amyloidoses are known to be induced only against the background of certain pathologies, but in some cases the cause of amyloidosis is unclear. It is assumed that these diseases often occur by accident. Here we present facts and hypotheses about the association of sporadic amyloidoses with vascular pathologies, trauma, oxidative stress, cancer, metabolic diseases, chronic infections and COVID-19. Generalization of current data shows that all sporadic amyloidoses can be regarded as a secondary event occurring against the background of diseases provoking a cellular stress response. Various factors causing the stress response provoke protein overproduction, a local increase in the concentration or modifications, which contributes to amyloidogenesis.

It has been associated with short-term absenteeism in school and has a negative impact on academic and daily activities. Therefore, the aim of the study was to show the evidence on the magnitude and correlates of dysmenorrhea in Ethiopia. METHOD: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the literature from different databases such as PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library. We also used unpublished literature from Google, Google Scholar. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were extracted using a Microsoft Excel data extraction format. STATA version 14 statistical software was used for data analysis. To assess the heterogeneity of the primary articles, the Cochrane Q test statistics and the I2 test were carried out. Publication bias was inspected by funnel plot, and Egger's test was performed to confirm the presence of publication bias. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of dysmenorrhea and its associated factors. RESULT: A total of 12 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence estimate of dysmenorrhea among female students in Ethiopia is 71.69% (66.82%-76.56%). In our systematic review, among factors associated with dysmenorrhea, the family history of dysmenorrhea was frequently reported in included studies. Therefore, dysmenorrhea was significantly associated with a family history of dysmenorrhea (adjusted odds ratio = 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.80-7.85)). CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence estimate of dysmenorrhea among students was much higher in Ethiopia.

METHODS: We searched the PubMed Database from March 12 to April 12, 2020 and identified 559 publications in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet which were divided into COVID-19 (cases, n = 204) and nonCOVID-19 (controls, n = 355) associated content. After exclusion of secondary, unauthored, response letters and non-matching article types, 155 COVID-19 publications (including 13 original articles) and 130 nonCOVID-19 publications (including 52 original articles) were included in the comparative analysis. The hierarchical level of evidence was determined for each publication included and compared between cases and controls as the main outcome. A quantitative scoring of quality was carried out for the subgroup of original articles. The numbers of authors and citation rates were also compared between groups. RESULTS: The 130 nonCOVID-19 publications were associated with higher levels of evidence on the level of evidence pyramid, with a strong association measure (Cramers V: 0.452, P <0.001). The 155 COVID-19 publications were 186-fold more likely to be of lower evidence (95% confidence interval [CI] for odds ratio, 7.0C47; P <0.001).

Methods: In patients aged &#8805;70 years, an online geriatric assessment questionnaire was launched, from which the CFS was scored by the geriatrics team. Additional clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. Risk factors related to ageing, such as the CFS, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index, living situation and cognitive decline, were examined alongside frequently reported risk factors in the general population. Outcomes were in-hospital death (primary outcome) and oxygen need of &#8805;6 litres and early warning score &#8805;7, as parameters for severe disease (secondary outcomes). Baseline characteristics were described with descriptive statistics. Associations were analysed with uni- and multivariable analyses. Results: One hundred and five patients were included, median age 82 years. CFS scores were 1-4 in 43, 5-6 in 45, and 7-9 in 17 patients. In multivariable analysis, CFS and cognitive decline were the only risk factors that were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presence of respiratory symptoms on admission and male gender showed and independent association with severe disease. Conclusion: A retrospective analysis shows that CFS and cognitive decline have added value for predicting in-hospital mortality in older patients with COVID-19 disease.","output":"Risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease and death in patients aged 70 and over: a retrospective observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of COVID-19 outbreak on the treatment time of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in Hangzhou, China. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of STEMI patients admitted to the Hangzhou Chest Pain Center (CPC) during a COVID-19 epidemic period in 2020 (24 cases) and the same period in 2019 (29 cases). General characteristics of the patients were recorded, analyzed, and compared. Moreover, we compared the groups for the time from symptom onset to the first medical contact (SO-to-FMC), time from first medical contact to balloon expansion (FMC-to-B), time from hospital door entry to first balloon expansion (D-to-B), and catheter room activation time. The groups were also compared for postoperative cardiac color Doppler ultrasonographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF),the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE),Kaplan-Meier survival curves during the 28 days after the operation. RESULTS: The times of SO-to-FMC, D-to-B, and catheter room activation in the 2020 group were significantly longer than those in the 2019 group (P < 0.05). The cumulative mortality after the surgery in the 2020 group was significantly higher than the 2019 group (P < 0.05).

Here, we investigate SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in high-risk HCWs in a Belgian general hospital after both the first and the second waves. Three different immunoassays were used to determine immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in volunteer HCWs who worked in at least one COVID-19-dedicated ward [emergency department, intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine department] in our institution from 8 May 2020 to 19 May 2020 (n = 267) and from 18 January 2021 to 8 February 2021 (n = 189). Risk factors for seropositivity were also assessed using a questionnaire filled out by all participants. We report a steep increase in seroprevalence after the second wave and report a higher seropositivity in HCWs than in the general population. Furthermore, we show that ICU personnel and especially nurses exhibit a proportionally lower SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. This study documents the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in highly exposed HCWs in a context of high viral circulation prior to vaccination campaigns.

Yet, secondary bacterial infection is uncommon. However, as epithelium is injured and barrier function is lost, bacterial products entering the circulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. METHODS: We studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on days 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), (1  3)--d-glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, 13 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA ( 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtually all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Indeed, dental procedures produce aerosols which can be loaded with viral particles, and as such, constitute a major contamination route by the virus. At the request of the Conference of Deans of the Faculties of Odontology, the National College of University Dentists in Public Health (CNCDUSP) set up a working group in order to issue recommendations for oral care in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, given the specific risks faced by practitioners. Considering the lack of awareness of the specifics of dentistry in the medical world and among decision-makers, and given the speed with which national measures to fight the epidemic were implemented, the recommendations of the CNCDUSP had to be drawn up rigorously and quickly before being released to the profession. They take into account epidemiological data related to the virus, the specificities of oral care, and thus propose protective measures for dental surgery professionals.The necessary adaptation of the healthcare system during an epidemic will certainly make it possible to learn lessons from this health crisis.","output":"[Oral care and the Coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is unmet need for effective therapies of intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) that are common cause of menstrual disturbance and infertility, since current clinical procedures do not improve prognosis for patients with moderate to severe IUA, with a recurrence rate of 23C50%. Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a therapeutic option with unsolved issues for IUA patients in the past few years. Primary endometrial epithelial cells for cell therapy are largely hampered with the extremely limited proliferation capacity of uterine epithelial cells. This study was to evaluate whether IUA is curable with conditionally reprogrammed (CR) endometrial epithelial cells. METHODS: Mouse endometrial epithelial cells (MEECs) were isolated from C57BL female mice, and long-term cultures of MEECs were established and maintained with conditional reprogramming (CR) method. DNA damage response analysis, soft agar assay, and matrigel 3D culture were carried out to determine the normal biological characteristics of CR-MEECs. The tissue-specific differentiation potential of MEECs was analyzed with airCliquid interface (ALI) 3D culture, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Massons trichrome and DAB staining, immunofluorescence assay. IUA mice were constructed and transplanted with CR-MEECs. Repair and mechanisms of MEECs transplantation in IUA mice were measured with qRT-PCR, Massons trichrome, and DAB staining. RESULTS: We first successfully established long-term cultures of MEECs using CR approach. CR-MEECs maintained a rapid and stable proliferation in this co-culture system. Our data confirmed that CR-MEECs retained normal biological characteristics and endometrium tissue-specific differentiation potential. CR-MEECs also expressed estrogen and progesterone receptors and maintained the exquisite sensitivity to sex hormones in vitro. Most importantly, allogeneic transplantation of CR-MEECs successfully repaired the injured endometrium and significantly improved the pregnancy rate of IUA mice.

The disease has affected more than 200 countries, and the measures that have been implemented to combat its spread, as there is still no vaccine or definitive medication, have been based on supportive interventions and drug repositioning. Brazil, the largest country in South America, has had more than 140,000 recorded deaths and is one of the most affected countries. Despite the extensive quantity of scientifically recognized information, there are still conflicting discussions on how best to face the disease and the virus, especially with regard to social distancing, preventive methods, and the use of medications. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the Brazilian population's basic knowledge about COVID-19 to demonstrate how Brazilians are managing to identify scientifically proven information. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. An original online questionnaire survey was administered from June 16 to August 21, 2020, across all five different geopolitical regions of the country (ie, the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South). The questionnaire was comprised of questions about basic aspects of COVID-19, such as the related symptoms, conduct that should be followed when suspected of infection, risk groups, prevention, transmission, and social distancing. The wrong questionnaire response alternatives were taken from the fake news combat website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Participants (aged &#8805;18 years) were recruited through social networking platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The mean distributions, frequencies, and similarities or dissimilarities between the responses for the different variables of the study were evaluated. The significance level for all statistical tests was less than .05. RESULTS: A total of 4180 valid responses representative of all the states and regions of Brazil were recorded. Most respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, getting an average of 86.59% of the total score with regard to the basic aspects of the disease. The region, education level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association (P<.001) with knowledge about the disease, which meant that women, the young, those with higher education levels, nonrecipients of social assistance, and more economically and socially developed regions had more correct answers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Brazilians with social media access have a good level of basic knowledge about COVID-19 but with differences depending on the analyzed subgroup.

Family aggregation occurred in 87.5% of infant and preschool-aged children (7/8), and also school-aged children (14/16), but only 12.5% (1/8) of adolescents (p<0. 05, p<0.001). Most of these patients had mild symptoms, mainly fever (20/32), followed by cough (10/32) and fatigue (4/32). The average duration of viral RNA in respiratory samples and gastrointestinal samples were 15.8 d and 28.9 d, respectively. Detox duration in feces decreased with age, namely 39.8 d, 27.5 d and 20.4 d in infant and preschool children, school children and adolescents respectively (p(0-6, -18)<0. 01, p(0-6, -14)<0. 05). Pneumonia was found in 14 children, without any statistical significance in the incidence of pneumonia between different age groups. Thirty patients were treated with antiviral drugs and all patients were stable and gradually improved after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Most children with COVID-19 had a mild process and good prognosis. More attention should be paid to household contact history investigation in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in young children. Viral RNA lasts longer in gastrointestinal system than the respiratory tract, especially in younger children.","output":"Childhood COVID-19: a multi-center retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting the outcome of outbreaks as early and as accurately as possible is crucial for decision making and policy implementations. A significant challenge faced by forecasters is that not all outbreaks and epidemics turn into pandemics making the prediction of their severity difficult. At the same time, the decisions made to enforce lockdowns and other mitigating interventions versus their socioeconomic consequences are not only hard to make, but also highly uncertain. The majority of modeling approaches to outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics take an epidemiological approach that considers biological and disease processes. In this paper, we accept the limitations of forecasting to predict the long-term trajectory of an outbreak, and instead, we propose a statistical, time-series approach to modelling and predicting the short-term behaviour of COVID-19. Our model assumes a multiplicative trend, aiming to capture the continuation of the two variables we predict (global confirmed cases and deaths) as well as their uncertainty. We present the timeline of producing and evaluating 10-day-ahead forecasts over a period of four months. Our simple model offers competitive forecast accuracy and estimates of uncertainty that are useful and practically relevant.","output":"COVID-19: Forecasting confirmed cases and deaths with a simple time-series model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccine uptake is essential to managing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and vaccine hesitancy is a persistent concern.

viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019 Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019 As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases were classified as \\"pneumonia of unknown etiology \\" The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program The etiology of this illness is now attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family, COVID-19 On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a \\"COVID-19,\\" which is the acronym of \\"coronavirus disease 2019\\" In the past twenty years, two additional coronavirus epidemics have occurred SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases This new virus seems to be very contagious and has quickly spread globally In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs) The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts  the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV  before jumping to humans The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide seems to be a serious public health risk Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the \\"very high\\" level, on February 28, 2020 Probably, the effects of the epidemic caused by the new CoV has yet to emerge as the situation is quickly evolving World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem possible devastating effects Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention

Recent data challenge the appropriateness of providing standard amounts of calories and protein during acute critical illness. Restricting calorie and protein intakes seemed beneficial, suggesting a role for metabolic pathways such as autophagy, a potential key mechanism in safeguarding cellular integrity, notably in the muscle, during critical illness. However, the optimal calorie and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. NUTRIREA-3 will be the first trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding. We hypothesised that nutritional support with calorie and protein restriction during acute critical illness decreased day 90 mortality and/or dependency on intensive care unit (ICU) management in mechanically ventilated patients receiving vasoactive amine therapy for shock, compared with standard calorie and protein targets. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: NUTRIREA-3 is a randomised, controlled, multicentre, open-label trial comparing two parallel groups of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive amine therapy for shock and given early nutritional support according to one of two strategies: early calorie-protein restriction (6 kcal/kg/day-0.2C0.4 g/kg/day) or standard calorie-protein targets (25 kcal/kg/day, 1.0C1.3 g/kg/day) at the acute phase defined as the first 7 days in the ICU. We will include 3044 patients in 61 French ICUs. Two primary end-points will be evaluated: day 90 mortality and time to ICU discharge readiness. The trial will be considered positive if significant between-group differences are found for one or both alternative primary endpoints.

We aimed to identify risk factors for grief and support needs. Methods: Online survey of people bereaved in the UK (deaths 16 March 2020-2 January 2021), recruited via media, social media, national associations/organisations. Grief was assessed using the Adult Attitude to Grief (AAG) scale, which calculates an overall index of vulnerability (IOV) (range 0-36). Practical and emotional support needs were assessed in 13 domains. Results: 711 participants, mean age 49.5 (SD 12.9, range 18-90). 628 (88.6%) were female. Mean age of the deceased 72.2 (SD 16.1). 311 (43.8%) deaths were from confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Mean IOV was 20.41 (95% CI = 20.06 to 20.77). 28.2% exhibited severe vulnerability (IOV [] 24). In six support domains relating to psycho-emotional support, 50% to 60% of respondents reported high/fairly high levels of need. Grief and support needs increased strongly for close relationships with the deceased (versus more distant) and with reported social isolation and loneliness (P < 0.001), whereas they reduced with age of the deceased above 40 to 50. Other risk factors were place of death and reduced support from health professionals after death (P < 0.05). Conclusions: High overall levels of vulnerability in grief and support needs were observed. Relationship with the deceased, age of the deceased, and social isolation and loneliness are potential indicators of those at risk of even higher vulnerability in grief and support needs. Healthcare professional support after death is associated with more positive bereavement outcomes.","output":"Factors associated with higher levels of grief and support needs among people bereaved during the pandemic: Results from a national online survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inspired by the self-assembly approach, in this work, the chromogen, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), was successfully co-precipitated in aqueous solution to form collective nanoparticles (NPs) of signal molecules (TMB-NPs). Utilizing poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the molecular delivery approach, the formed emulsion nanovesicle (TMB-NPs@PLGA) exhibits an enrichment of the collective signal molecules in a single antibody-antigen conjugation. A specific antibody-conjugated TMB-NPs@PLGA forms an immunocomplex sandwich structure upon the addition of influenza virus (IV)/A. The addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) dissolves the PLGA nanovesicles, releasing the encapsulated TMB-NPs. Sequentially, the TMB-NPs release TMB molecules upon the addition of DMSO. The released TMB is catalytically oxidized by H2O2 with self-assembled protein-inorganic nanoflowers, where copper nanoflowers (CuNFs) acted as the nanozyme. The developed immunoassay demonstrates high sensitivity for IV/A with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 32.37 fg mL-1 and 54.97 fg mL-1 in buffer and serum, respectively. For practical needs, a clinically isolated IV/A/H3N2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were detected with the LODs of 17 pfu mL-1 and 143 fg mL-1, respectively.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from SARI cases (hospitalized patients with fever, cough, and onset in the previous 10 days) were tested using the FTD\\\\33 Kit and the CDC rRT\\\\PCR influenza assays. We assessed sensitivity and specificity of the FTD\\\\33 Kit for detecting influenza A, influenza B, and the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain using the CDC human influenza rRT\\\\PCR panel as the gold standard. RESULTS: From December 2016 to February 2019, 1706 SARI cases were identified, 1511 specimens were tested, and 211 were positive for influenza A (14.0%) and 100 for influenza B (6.6%) by either assay.

Following the growth of air traffic, the probability of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2015. This study also revealed seasonal asymmetries of transmission routes: Sri Lanka and Maldives have emerged as origins; neglected cities at central and coastal China have been increasingly vulnerable to dengue importation and onward transmission.

This study aims to assess the proportion of preventive practices towards COVID-19 and associated factors among educators in Vietnam. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on educators at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City (UMP) using a self-administered questionnaire between June and August 2020. Online surveys and a multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to determine factors associated with practices. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were performed using Stata 14. RESULTS: A total of 779 eligible participants were approached, most of them under 50 years (84.1%), around three-fifth were female (61.0%) and lecturers (61.1%), with only 38.1% of them working at hospitals. Overall, the majority of participants had good preventive practices towards COVID-19 (88.6%). Factors identified as being associated with good practices included participants who are lecturers (AOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.05C2.97), attending training courses related to COVID-19 (AOR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.05C2.87), working at hospitals (AOR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.28C4.76) and having a higher level of knowledge and attitude relating to COVID-19 (AOR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.52C5.17; AOR 2.8, 95% CI: 1.70C4.48, respectively) (all p < 0.05).

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55).

Current main-stream diagnostic methods in the laboratory include nucleic acid PCR tests and direct viral antigen tests for detecting active infections, and indirect human antibody tests specific to SARS-CoV-2 to detect prior exposure. In this Perspective, we briefly describe the PCR and antigen tests and then focus mainly on existing antibody tests and their limitations including inaccuracies and possible causes of unreliability. False negatives in antibody immunoassays can arise from assay formats, selection of viral antigens and antibody types, diagnostic testing windows, individual variance, and fluctuation in antibody levels. Reasons for false positives in antibody immunoassays mainly involve antibody cross-reactivity from other viruses, as well as autoimmune disease. The spectrum bias has an effect on both the false negatives and false positives. For assay developers, not only improvement of assay formats but also selection of viral antigens and isotopes of human antibodies need to be carefully considered to improve sensitivity and specificity. For clinicians, the factors influencing the accuracy of assays must be kept in mind to test patients using currently imperfect but available tests with smart tactics and realistic interpretation of the test results.","output":"COVID-19 Antibody Tests and Their Limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Together, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma account for the most common non-infectious respiratory pathologies.

In 2020, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (CDC). To avoid another pandemic from happening after covid-19 we must work on drug discovery and vaccines to prevent TB from spreading. OBJECTIVE This work is done on mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, using laboratory experiments and computational biological tools to characterize methyltransferase proteins of Mtb. This study is targeted to find out any potential drug or vaccine target in Mtb. METHOD With the help of bioinformatic tools a hypothetical methyltransferse protein was selected from previously reported variety of 121 methyltransferses according to the domain configuration. The protein was verified by the thermal stability, Protein conformational changes, localization, signal peptide chain, structure prediction and function, mutational analysis and molecular docking. RESULTS Rv3366 gene was selected based on its secretory characteristic and localisation in mitochondria among 121 methyltransferases. SignalP4.1 and Mitoprot ll were used for the cleavage site prediction. Protein modelled by online server has 95.6% allowed region and validated by Ramachandran Plot Statistics from Richardson's lab. The biophysical characteristics of the gene were also identified using methyltransferase assay, thermal denaturation assay, spectrophotometry, fluorescence assay. Alarm assay was done for quantitation of viable cell number in proliferation and cytotoxicity in the presence of the target protein. MitoTracker Red CMXRos kit was used to verify the localisation of the protein in mitochondria.

Materials and Methods: This was a survey study of physicians from different specialties who provided patient care during the pandemic in Turkey. A total of 824 physicians responded to questionnaire, which consisted of 5 sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) anxiety level; (3) knowledge; (4) perspective; and (5) willingness to use telemedicine. Results: Fifty-six percent of the participants were found to experience mild-to-severe anxiety during the pandemic. It was found that the early career physicians most likely report anxiety about COVID-19 (p = 0.012). Physicians working in training and research hospital settings had higher Beck Anxiety Inventory scores compared to their colleagues working in private health care institutions (p = 0.011). Anxiety levels of physicians were not affected by working experience, existence of comorbidities, or living conditions of the participants (p = 0.138, p = 0.317, and p = 0.123, respectively). The results showed that the participants had a low level of knowledge about telemedicine. Only 61.1% of the physicians stated that they had heard of telemedicine before. The physicians who experienced telemedicine before (N = 76, 9.2% of all the participants) were more likely to find telemedicine beneficial both in pandemic (p < 0.001) and postpandemic period (p = 0.002).

PURPOSE This cross-sectional study investigated relationships among self-reported adaptive body awareness (Multidimensional Interoceptive Awareness Scale-2; MAIA-2), CS-related symptoms (Central Sensitization Inventory; CSI), and pain intensity and further delineate potential direct and indirect links among these constructs. METHODS Online surveys were administered to 280 individuals with chronic pain reporting elevated CSI scores. Strategic sampling targeted respondents to reflect the 2010 census. Pearson's correlations characterized overall relationship between variables. Multiple regression analyses investigated potential direct links. A path analysis assessed mediational effects of CS-related symptoms on the relationship between adaptive body awareness and pain intensity. RESULTS CSI demonstrated strong, inverse correlations with some MAIA-2 subscales, but positive correlations with others. Higher CSI scores predicted greater pain intensity (b = .049, p  .001). Two MAIA-2 subscales, Not-Distracting (b = -0.56, p  .001) and Not-Worrying (b = -1.17, p  .001) were unique predictors of lower CSI. Not-Distracting (b =-.05, p = .003) and Not-Worrying (b = -0.06, p = .007) uniquely predicted lower pain intensity.

Currently, the most common detection methods for the virus are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow tests. PCR takes more than an hour to obtain the results and lateral flow tests have difficulty with detecting the virus at low concentrations. In this study, 60 clinical human saliva samples, which included 30 positive and 30 negative samples confirmed with RT-PCR, were screened for COVID-19 using disposable glucose biosensor strips and a reusable printed circuit board. The disposable strips were gold plated and functionalized to immobilize antibodies on the gold film. After functionalization, the strips were connected to the gate electrode of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor on the printed circuit board to amplify the test signals. A synchronous double-pulsed bias voltage was applied to the drain of the transistor and strips. The resulting change in drain waveforms was converted to digital readings. The RT-PCR-confirmed saliva samples were tested again using quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to determine cycling threshold (Ct) values. Ct values up to 45 refer to the number of amplification cycles needed to detect the presence of the virus.

AIM: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy during the first European lockdown (March-May 2020). METHODS: Patients undergoing endoscopy in nine endoscopy units across six European countries during the period of the first European lockdown for COVID-19 (March-May 2020) were included. Prior to the endoscopy procedure, participants were stratified as low- or high- risk for potential COVID-19 infection according to the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) and the European Society of Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Nurses and Associates (ESGENA) joint statement, and contacted 7-14 d later to assess COVID-19 infection status. PEU were questioned regarding COVID-19 symptoms and/or infection via questionnaire, while information regarding hospitalizations, intensive care unit-admissions and COVID-19-related deaths were collected. The number of weekly endoscopies at each center during the lockdown period was also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 1267 endoscopies were performed in 1222 individuals across nine European endoscopy departments in six countries. Eighty-seven (7%) were excluded because of initial positive testing. Of the 1135 pre-endoscopy low risk or polymerase chain reaction negative for COVID-19, 254 (22.4%) were tested post endoscopy and 8 were eventually found positive, resulting in an infection rate of 0.7% [(95%CI: 0.2-0.12]. The majority (6 of the 8 patients, 75%) had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Of the 163 PEU, 5 [3%; (95%CI: 0.4-5.7)] tested positive during the study period.

Guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during aerosol-generating procedures, and droplet (> 5 m) precautions at other times. However, emerging evidence indicates respiratory activities may be a more important source of aerosols than clinical procedures such as tracheal intubation. We aimed to measure the size, total number and volume of all human aerosols exhaled during respiratory activities and therapies. We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 l.min-1 to count and size-fractionate close to all exhaled particles (0.5-25 m). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during six respiratory activities (quiet breathing; talking; shouting; forced expiratory manoeuvres; exercise; and coughing) with three respiratory therapies (high-flow nasal oxygen and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation). Activities were repeated while wearing facemasks. When compared with quiet breathing, exertional respiratory activities increased particle counts 34.6-fold during talking and 370.8-fold during coughing (p < 0.001). High-flow nasal oxygen 60 at l.min-1 increased particle counts 2.3-fold (p = 0.031) during quiet breathing. Single and dual circuit non-invasive respiratory therapy at 25/10 cm.H2 O with quiet breathing increased counts by 2.6-fold and 7.8-fold, respectively (both p < 0.001). During exertional activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared with activities alone. Respiratory activities (including exertional breathing and coughing) which mimic respiratory patterns during illness generate substantially more aerosols than non-invasive respiratory therapies, which conversely can reduce total emissions.

Given the multiple T-cell epitopes shared by wild-type virus and its variants, we hypothesized that vaccines that target multiple T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 may provide a universal protection against the wild-type virus as well as its variants, even the heavily mutated ones. To test this, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell precursors in healthy individuals using overlapping peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and protease (P) proteins as target antigens. Diverse T-cell precursor frequencies specific to these viral antigens were detected in healthy individuals, including high, medium, low, and no responders. This was further confirmed by efficient induction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immune responses using ex vivo dendritic cell (DC)/T cell coculture. The results demonstrated T-cell responses consistent with the precursor frequencies of each of the individuals tested. Importantly, the combination of all five viral peptide pools induced the strongest cellular immune response, and further, after a DC-peptides re-stimulation, even the no responders developed an increased anti-viral T-cell response. These analyses recapitulate the presence of a broad anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular immunity even in an immune na?ve population, which could be enhanced by antigen presenting cells presenting the overlapping antigenic peptides.

This study examined the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) in Chinese pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study comprising 1309 pregnant and postpartum women across 12 provinces in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was assessed using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression in pregnant and postpartum women was 27.43% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.01%-29.85%). Women who were worried about themselves or their babies being infected with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.562, 95% CI = 1.670-3.929), and those who had delayed regular medical checkups (OR = 2.434, 95% CI = 1.580-3.750) were at higher risk of depression. Compared with those living in central and western parts of China, women living in northern (OR = 0.513, 95% CI = 0.326-0.807) and southeastern parts of China (OR = 0.626, 95% CI = 0.463-0.846) were less likely to have depression. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increased likelihood of mental health problems among pregnant and postnatal women. Over a quarter of the pregnant and postpartum women in China had depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we present the virological features relevant to clinical practice, and summarize the epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, and preventive strategies of A(H7N9) infection. RECENT FINDINGS As of 18 February 2014, A(H7N9) virus has caused 354 infections in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong with a case-fatality rate of 32%. Elderly men were most affected. Most patients acquired the infection from direct contact with poultry or from a contaminated environment, although person-to-person transmission has likely occurred. A(H7N9) infection has usually presented with severe pneumonia, often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. Mild infections have been reported in children and young adults. Nasopharyngeal aspirate and sputum samples should be collected for diagnosis, preferably using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors improved survival, but the efficacy of antivirals was hampered by resistant mutants. The closure of live poultry markets in affected areas has significantly contributed to the decline in the incidence of human cases.

The development of potent, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies to reduce lung inflammation and re-establish the homeostasis in the respiratory tract is still a challenge. Previously, we developed a unique anti-inflammatory nanodrug, P12 (made of hexapeptides and gold nanoparticles), which can attenuate Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages. However, the effect of the administration route on its therapeutic efficacy and tissue distribution remained to be defined. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically compared the effects of three different administration routes [the intratracheal (i.t.), intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.)] on the therapeutic activity, biodistribution and pulmonary cell targeting features of P12. Using the LPS-induced ALI mouse model, we found that the local administration route via i.t. instillation was superior in reducing lung inflammation than the other two routes even treated with a lower concentration of P12. Further studies on nanoparticle biodistribution showed that the i.t. administration led to more accumulation of P12 in the lungs but less in the liver and other organs; however, the i.v. and i.p. administration resulted in more nanoparticle accumulation in the liver and lymph nodes, respectively, but less in the lungs. Such a lung favorable distribution was also determined by the unique surface chemistry of P12. Furthermore, the inflammatory condition in the lung could decrease the accumulation of nanoparticles in the lung and liver, while increasing their distribution in the spleen and heart. Interestingly, the i.t. administration route helped the nanoparticles specifically target the lung macrophages, whereas the other two administration routes did not. CONCLUSION: The i.t. administration is better for treating ALI using nanodevices as it enhances the bioavailability and efficacy of the nanodrugs in the target cells of the lung and reduces the potential systematic side effects.","output":"Administration route governs the therapeutic efficacy, biodistribution and macrophage targeting of anti-inflammatory nanoparticles in the lung"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Direct closure (DC) of eyelid defects has been retrospectively shown to give excellent outcomes. We present prospective outcome data as further evidence to promote its wider use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A consecutive, unselected, series of patients undergoing eyelid tumour resection was studied prospectively. DC was attempted at the time of biopsy in all of them. If DC proved impossible, delayed reconstruction using other techniques was later performed. Defect size, pre- and post-operative palpebral aperture (PA) measurements and the final visit patients' and surgeons' satisfaction scores for function and appearance were recorded. RESULTS Seventy-three eyelids of 70 patients were studied. Mean resected specimen width was 16.4 mm (4-26 mm) in the DC group, versus 23.9 mm (11-42 mm) for other, non-DC reconstructions. Primary DC was achieved in 74% of this cohort. Mean final post-operative PA measurements in the DC group were 0.7 mm vertically (p = 0.003) and 0.8 mm horizontally (p = 0.009) less than preoperatively, but there was no statistical difference (p = 0.1) in the final horizontal measurements between the operated and un-operated sides in the DC group. DC satisfaction scores were excellent for both eyelid function and appearance. CONCLUSIONS DC of eyelid defects, irrespective of per-operative PA distortion, gives excellent late post-operative outcomes. We recommend that DC, aligning the closure tension parallel to the lid margin, is attempted whenever wound margin approximation is possible in preference to alternative reconstruction techniques, regardless of any temporary PA distortion and globe displacement that this may cause. Eyelid function and appearance recover to near normal within 2 months.","output":"Direct eyelid defect closure: a prospective study of functional and aesthetic outcomes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has a devastating impact on the economies and health care system of sub-Saharan Africa. Healthcare workers (HWs), the main actors of the health system, are at higher-risk because of their occupation. Serology-based estaimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HWs represent a measure of HWs level of exposure to the virus and a guide to the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. This information is currently lacking in Ethiopia. This study aims to develop an in-house antibody testing assay and assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among Ethiopian high-risk front-line HWs. A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted among HWs in five public hospitals located in different geographic regions of Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected using questionnaire-based interviews. From consenting HWs, blood samples were collected between December 2020 and February 2021, the period between the two peaks of COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The collected sera were tested using an in-house immunoglobin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies on sera collected from HWs. Of 1,997 HWs who provided a blood sample, demographic and clinical data, 50.5% were female, 74.0% had no symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and 29.0% had history of contact with suspected or confirmed patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall seroprevalence was 39.6%. The lowest (24.5%) and the highest (48.0%) seroprevalence rates were found in Hiwot Fana Specialized Hospital in Harar and ALERT Hospital in Addis Ababa, respectively. Of the 821 seropositive HWs, 224(27.3%) had history of symptoms consistent with COVID-19. A history of close contact with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases was strongly associated with seropositivity (Adjusted odds Ratio (AOR) =1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8; p=0.015). High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels were observed in the five Ethiopian hospitals.

COVID-19 is gradually posing a serious threat to global public health. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized and contrasted. Especially, urine-oral transmission, prevention and management of the kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 were emphasized. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched PubMed for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords \\"SARS\\", \\"MERS\\", \\"COVID-19\\" or \\"kidney injury\\". ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for ongoing studies. We also used relevant data from websites, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). RESULTS Similar to two other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 caused severe respiratory syndrome with rapid progression and kidney injury. The infection process of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by specifically binding to ACE2. The COVID-19 patients combined with kidney impairment are associated with a higher risk of mortality, compared with those without comorbidities. The pathological changes of the kidney are mainly due to local SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirectly by pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Besides, studies have confirmed the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in urine, raising the possibility of urine-oral transmission. Thus, it is significant for preventing possible potential urine-oral transmission and improving the cure rate of acute kidney injury of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Emerging evidence supports that in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections, the prevalence of kidney injury is high and usually leads to a poor prognosis. The optimal prevention, management of kidney injury will benefit for COVID-19 patients.","output":"Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coronaviruses and Kidney Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a global integration of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) into public health surveillance.

High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high.

Wildfire incidents can be an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly for wildland firefighters who congregate in work and living settings. In this review, we examine how exposure to wildfire smoke can contribute to an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Human exposure to particulate matter (PM), a component of wildfire smoke, has been associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses; increasing the likelihood for adverse respiratory symptomology and pathology. In multiple epidemiological studies, wildfire smoke exposure has been associated with acute lower respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and wildfire smoke inhalation may present an increased risk for COVID-19 illness in wildland firefighters due to PM based transport of SARS CoV-2 virus and up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) (i.e. ACE-2 functions as a trans-membrane receptor, allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain entry into the epithelial cell). Wildfire smoke exposure may also increase risk for more severe COVID-19 illness such as cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current infection control measures, including social distancing, wearing cloth masks, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, frequent hand washing, and daily screening for COVID-19 symptoms are very important measures to reduce infections and severe health outcomes. Exposure to wildfire smoke may introduce additive or even multiplicative risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of disease in wildland firefighters. Thus, additional mitigative measures may be needed to prevent the co-occurrence of wildfire smoke exposure and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Wildland firefighter exposure to smoke and COVID-19: A new risk on the fire line"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Primary to validate a commercial semi-automated computed tomography angiography (CTA) -software for vulnerable plaque detection compared to histology of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) specimens and secondary validating calcifications scores by in vivo CTA with ex vivo non-contrast enhanced computed tomography (NCCT).

Sixteen patients had their CEA specimen NCCT scanned. The semi-automated CTA software analyzed carotid stenosis using different HU values defining plaque components. The predictive values of CTA based detection of vulnerable plaques were calculated. Quantification of calcifications on CTA using region of interest (ROI)-function and mathematical equations was done manually, and validated by NCCT of the CEA specimen.

However, no studies have compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of such patients. Objectives: To report and compare the demographic characteristics, treatments, use of critical care resources, and outcomes of patients admitted to an Australian ICU with H1N1 influenza during the winter of 2009, and SARS-CoV-2 during the winter of 2020. Methods: This was a multicenter project, using national data from previous and ongoing epidemiological studies concerning severe acute respiratory infections in Australia. All ICUs admitting patients with H1N1 or coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were included and contributed data. We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with H1N1 admitted to ICU in the winter of 2009 versus patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the winter of 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Potential years of life lost (PYLL) were calculated according to sex-adjusted life expectancy in Australia. Results: Across the two epochs, 861 patients were admitted to ICUs; 236 (27.4%) with COVID-19 and 625 (72.6%) with H1N1 influenza. The number of ICU admissions and bed-days occupied were higher with 2009 H1N1 influenza. Patients with COVID-19 were older, more often male and overweight, and had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at ICU admission. The highest age-specific incidence of ICU admission was among infants (0C1 yr of age) for H1N1, and among the elderly (65 yr) for COVID-19. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was similar (11.5% in COVID-19 vs. 16.1% in H1N1; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.42C1.06]; P = 0.10). The PYLL was greater with H1N1 influenza than with COVID-19 at 154.1 (95% CI, 148.7C159.4) versus 13.6 (95% CI, 12.2C15.1) PYLL per million inhabitants. Conclusions: In comparison with 2009 H1N1 influenza, COVID-19 admissions overwinter in Australia resulted in fewer ICU admissions, and lower bed-day occupancy. Crude in-hospital mortality was similar, but because of demographic differences in affected patients, deaths due to 2009 H1N1 influenza led to an 11-fold increase in the number of PYLL in critically ill patients.","output":"Comparison of Critical Care Occupancy and Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients during the 2020 COVID-19 Winter Surge and 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We compared the characteristics and clinical outcomes of hospitalized individuals with COVID\\\\19 with [people with HIV (PWH)] and without (non\\\\PWH) HIV co\\\\infection in Spain during the first wave of the pandemic.

Concurrent infection, which may require administration of a potentially nephrotoxic agent, can worsen AKI and lead to poor outcomes. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus associated with nosocomial infections, especially in severely immunocompromised and debilitated patients. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combination (TMP/SMX) is considered the treatment of choice but can itself lead to AKI, posing a significant challenge in the management of patients with concomitant COVID-19 and S. maltophilia pneumonia. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old male with end-stage renal disease and post renal transplant presented with severe respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and was intubated upon admission. His renal functions were normal at the time of admission. The patient subsequently developed superimposed bacterial pneumonia with S. maltophilia requiring administration of TMP/SMX. However, TMP/SMX led to the development of AKI, which continued to worsen despite appropriate management including hemodialysis. This coincided with and most likely resulted in the patient's clinical deterioration and ultimate death. CONCLUSIONS The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving and appears to be multifactorial. The condition can significantly worsen especially when nephrotoxic agents are given, probably due to a cumulative or synergistic effect. Great caution should be taken when administering nephrotoxic agents in the setting of COVID-19 as it can lead to adverse patient outcomes.","output":"Renal Transplant Recipient with Concurrent COVID-19 and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Pneumonia Treated with Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole Leading to Acute Kidney Injury: A Therapeutic Dilemma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory diseases are major health concerns in the pig production sector worldwide, contributing adversely to morbidity and mortality.

An average compartment morbidity of 60%, mortality of 4% and case fatality of 9% was recorded in the outbreak herds. Post-mortem examinations revealed acute lesions resembling porcine pleuropneumonia in all 28 pigs investigated from the outbreak herds and in 2 of the 24 (8%) pigs from the non-outbreak herds. Chronic lesions were recorded in another 2 pigs (8%) from the non-outbreak herds. Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was isolated from lungs and/or pleura from all tested pigs (n = 28) in the outbreak herds, and from 2 out of 24 pigs (8%) in the non-outbreak herds, one pig with an acute and another pig with a chronic infection. No other significant bacterial findings were made. Seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae antibodies was detectable in all outbreak herds analyzed and in six out of seven non-outbreak herds, but the risk ratio for seroconversion of individual pigs was higher (risk ratio 2.3 [1.50- 3.43 95% CI; P < 0.001]) in the outbreak herds. All herds tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 and negative for influenza A viruses on oral fluid RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The main etiological pathogen found during acute outbreaks of respiratory disease was A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8. All pigs from outbreak herds had typical lesions of acute porcine pleuropneumonia, and only A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 was identified. Co-infections were not found to impact disease development.","output":"A descriptive study of acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in Norwegian fattening pig herds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of digital applications and remote communication technologies for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) has increased rapidly in recent years [...].","output":"Digital Innovation in Multiple Sclerosis Management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has been affected by COVID-19 coronavirus. At the time of this study, the number of infected people in the United States is the highest globally (7.9 million infections). Within the infected population, patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure. Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19 on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term daily logs of blood pressure and heart rate associated with 70 ARDS patients admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing 42506 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19 positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal data. Using only the first eight days of the data, our deep learning model is able to achieve 78.79% accuracy to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients.","output":"Detection of COVID-19 Using Heart Rate and Blood Pressure: Lessons Learned from Patients with ARDS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microcystin-leucine-arginine (MLCR) is a cyanobacterial toxin, and has been demonstrated to cause neurotoxicity. In addition, MCLR has been identified as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase (PP)1 and PP2A, which are known to regulate the phosphorylation of various molecules related to synaptic excitability. Thus, in the present study, we examined whether MCLR exposure affects seizures induced by a low dose of kainic acid (KA; 0.05 g, i.c.v.) administration. KA-induced seizure occurrence and seizure score significantly increased after repeated exposure to MCLR (2.5 or 5.0 g/kg, i.p., once a day for 10 days), but not after acute MCLR exposure (2.5 or 5.0 g/kg, i.p., 2 h and 30 min prior to KA administration), and hippocampal neuronal loss was consistently facilitated by repeated exposure to MCLR. In addition, repeated MCLR significantly elevated the membrane expression of kainate receptor GluK2 subunits, p-pan-protein kinase C (PKC), and p-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) at 1 h after KA. However, KA-induced membrane expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was significantly reduced by repeated MCLR exposure. Consistent with the enhanced seizures and neurodegeneration, MCLR exposure significantly potentiated KA-induced oxidative stress and microglial activation, which was accompanied by increased expression of p-ERK and p-PKC in the hippocampus. The combined results suggest that repeated MCLR exposure potentiates KA-induced excitotoxicity in the hippocampus by increasing membrane GluK2 expression and enhancing oxidative stress and neuroinflammation through the modulation of p-CaMKII, p-PKC, and p-ERK.","output":"Repeated exposure to microcystin-leucine-arginine potentiates excitotoxicity induced by a low dose of kainate."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The author here explores ideas on friendship from a philosophical, theological, sociological, and humanbecoming paradigm perspective.

Since pretreatment with IFNs can block viral infection, we reasoned that pharmacological activation of innate immune pathways could control SARS-CoV-2 infection. To identify potent antiviral innate immune agonists, we screened a panel of 75 microbial ligands that activate diverse signaling pathways and identified cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), canonical STING agonists, as antiviral. Since CDNs have poor bioavailability, we tested the small molecule STING agonist diABZI, and found that it potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of diverse strains including variants of concern (B.1.351) by transiently stimulating IFN signaling. Importantly, diABZI restricts viral replication in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and in mice in vivo.

Previous literature reports significant improvement in IBS symptoms with initiation of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) and monitored reintroduction. However, dietary adherence to the LFD is difficult, with patients stating that the information given by health care providers is often generalized and nonspecific, requiring them to search for supplementary information to fit their needs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether Heali, a novel artificial intelligence dietary mobile app can improve adherence to the LFD, IBS symptom severity, and quality of life outcomes in adults with IBS or IBS-like symptoms over a 4-week period. METHODS: Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (CON), in which participants received educational materials, and the experimental group (APP), in which participants received access to the mobile app and educational materials. Over the course of this unblinded online trial, all participants completed a battery of 5 questionnaires at baseline and at the end of the trial to document IBS symptoms, quality of life, LFD knowledge, and LFD adherence. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 participants in the study (29 in each group), and 25 participants completed the study in its entirety (11 and 14 for the CON and APP groups, respectively). Final, per-protocol analyses showed greater improvement in quality of life score for the APP group compared to the CON group (31.1 and 11.8, respectively; P=.04). Reduction in total IBS symptom severity score was 24% greater for the APP group versus the CON group. Although this did not achieve significance (C170 vs C138 respectively; P=.37), the reduction in the subscore for bowel habit dissatisfaction was 2-fold greater for the APP group than for the CON group (P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: This initial study provides preliminary evidence that Heali may provide therapeutic benefit to its users, specifically improvements in quality of life and bowel habits. Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of participants to test the efficacy of Heali app use to improve outcomes for patients with IBS.

While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out. Faecal shedding is common and prolonged and has caused an outbreak in Hong Kong. We studied the stability of SARS-CoV under different conditions, both in suspension and dried on surfaces, in comparison with other human-pathogenic viruses, including human coronavirus HCoV-229E. In suspension, HCoV-229E gradually lost its infectivity completely while SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for up to 9 days; in the dried state, survival times were 24 h versus 6 days. Thermal inactivation at 56C was highly effective in the absence of protein, reducing the virus titre to below detectability; however, the addition of 20% protein exerted a protective effect resulting in residual infectivity. If protein-containing solutions are to be inactivated, heat treatment at 60C for at least 30 min must be used. Different fixation procedures, e.g. for the preparation of immunofluorescence slides, as well as chemical means of virus inactivation commonly used in hospital and laboratory settings were generally found to be effective. Our investigations confirm that it is possible to care for SARS patients and to conduct laboratory scientific studies on SARS-CoV safely. Nevertheless, the agents tenacity is considerably higher than that of HCoV-229E, and should SARS re-emerge, increased efforts need to be devoted to questions of environmental hygiene.","output":"Stability and inactivation of SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cognitive empathy (also known as perspective-taking) is an important, teachable, skill.

The literature shows that working nights or on call can lead to pregnancy complications including miscarriage, preterm labor, and preeclampsia. In addition, infant-parent bonding in the postpartum period is crucial for breastfeeding, health, and well-being. No national standards exist for flexible scheduling options for pregnant or new parent residents. Our project objectives are 1) to describe a policy for scheduling pregnant and new parent residents in an emergency medicine (EM) residency and 2) to report pilot outcomes to assess feasibility of implementation, resident satisfaction, and pregnancy outcomes. Methods An EM residency task force developed a proposal of scheduling options for pregnant and new parent residents based on best practice recommendations and resident input. The policy included prenatal scheduling options for pregnant residents and postpartum scheduling options for all new resident parents. Resident support for the policy was evaluated via an anonymous survey. It was piloted for 2 months in an EM residency program. Results Policy development resulted in 1) an opt-out prenatal pregnancy work hour option policy with no nights or call during the first and third trimesters, 2) a 6-week new parent flexible scheduling policy, and 3) clarified sick call options. A majority of residents approved the new policy. During the 2-month pilot period, four residents (of 73 total) utilized the policy. The chief residents reported no added burden in scheduling. Of the residents who utilized the policy, all reported high satisfaction. There were no reported pregnancy or postpartum complications.

Posterior-stabilised (PS) and condylar-stabilised (CS) designed prosthesis do not require a posterior-cruciate ligament to provide stability. The aim of the current study was to compare the range of motion (ROM) and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing cemented total knee arthroplasty (TKA) using either a PS or CS design prosthesis. METHODS: A total of 167 consecutive primary TKAs with a CS bearing (mobile deep-dish polyethylene) were retrospectively identified and compared to 332 primary TKA with a PS constraint, with similar design components from the same manufacturer. Passive ROM was assessed at last follow-up with use of a handheld goniometer. Clinical scores were assessed using Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs); International Knee Society (IKS) knee and function scores and satisfaction score. Radiographic assessment was performed pre and post operatively consisting of mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA), femoral and tibial mechanical angles measured medially (FMA and TMA, respectively) on long leg radiographs, tibial slope and patella height as measured by the Blackburne-Peel index (BPI). RESULTS: Both groups had a mean follow-up of 3 years (range 2-3.7 years). Mean post-operative maximum knee flexion was 117  4.9 in the PS group and 119  5.2 in the CS group (p = 0.29). Postoperative IKS scores were significantly improved in both groups compared to preoperative scores (p < 0.01). The mean IKS score in the PS group was 170.9  24.1 compared to 170.3  22.5 in the CS group (p = 0.3).

They have contributed to the emergence of new public health topics (e.g. gynaecological and obstetric violence, long-Covid), the unearthing of testimonials of medical injustice, and in some cases, the creation of new evidence and changes in medical practice. Main text: From a theoretical and methodological perspective, we observe two powerful mechanisms at play on social media, which can facilitate the implementation of feminist epidemiological research and address so-called anti-feminist bias: social media as a third space and the power of groups. Social media posts can be seen as inhabiting a third space, akin to what is said off the record or in-between doors, at the end of a therapy session. Researchers somehow miss the opportunity to use the third spaces that people occupy. Similarly, another existing space that researchers are seldom interested in are peer-groups. Peer-groups are the ideal terrain to generate bottom-up research priorities. To some extent, their on-line versions provide a safe and emancipatory space, accessible, transnational, and inclusive. We would argue that this could bring feminist epidemiology to scale. Conclusion: Given the emancipatory power of social media, we propose recommendations and practical implications for leveraging the potential of online-sourced feminist epidemiology at different stages of the research process (from design to dissemination), and for increasing synergies between researchers and the community. We emphasise that attention should be paid to patriarchal sociocultural contexts and power dynamics, the mitigation of risks for political recuperation and stigmatisation, and the co-production of respectful discourse on studied populations.","output":"Womens voices on social media: the advent of feminist epidemiology?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the Psychological Insights for Understanding COVID-19 series, international experts introduce important themes in psychological science that engage with people's unprecedented experience of the pandemic, drawing together chapters as they originally appeared before COVID-19 descended on the world.

This simulation course aimed to enhance training in a lower-resource environment despite the challenges of decreased operative volume and lack of in-person instruction. METHODS: The course was developed by surgeons from Bolivian and U.S.-based institutions and offered twice between July-December 2020. Didactic content and skill techniques were taught via weekly live videoconferences. Additional mentorship was provided through small group sessions. Participants were evaluated by pre- and post-course tests of didactic content as well as by video task review. RESULTS: Of the 24 enrolled participants, 13 were practicing surgeons and 10 were surgery residents (one unspecified). Fifty percent (n = 12) indicated almost never performing laparoscopic surgeries pre-course. Confidence significantly increased for five laparoscopic tasks. Test scores also increased significantly (68.2%  12.5%, n = 21; vs 76.6%  12.6%, n = 19; p = 0.040). While challenges impeded objective evaluation for the first course iteration, adjustments permitted video scoring in the second iteration.

Calculated by crossover analysis, the synergy index, attributable proportion and relative excess risk due to interact of anxiety and hypertension were1.698,0.371 and 3.822, and the correlation index of interaction between depression and hypertension were 1.475, 0.295, and 3.493. The Social Support &Depression interaction term and Social Support &Anxiety interaction term were negatively correlated with QOL (p<0.01), and explained an extra 5.7% and 5.6% of the variance respectively (p<0.01). Conclusion: Anxiety, depression and hypertension have interaction on the QOL of patients with gynecological tumors.

Both infection and death caused by SARS-CoV-2 are still rapidly increasing worldwide. In this study, we demonstrate that viral coding proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have distinct features and are most, medium and least conserved with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the rest four mild coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1), respectively. Moreover, expression of host responsive genes (HRG), HRG-enriched biological processes, and HRG-enriched KEGG pathways upon infection of SARS-CoV-2 show slightly overlapping with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but distinctive to the four mild coronaviruses. Interestingly, enrichment of overactivation of neutrophil by HRGs is only and commonly found in infections of severe SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV but not in the other four mild coronaviruses, and the related gene networks show different patterns. Clinical data supports that overactivation of neutrophil for severe patients can be one major factor for the similar clinical symptoms observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to infections of the other two severe coronavirus (SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV). Taken together, our study provides a mechanistic insight into SARS-CoV-2 epidemic via revealing the conserved and distinct features of SARS-CoV-2, raising the critical role of dysregulation of neutrophil for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The authors hypothesized that even though children have highly vasoreactive arteries, because of a robust cerebral collateral blood flow, they rarely develop symptomatic CV. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed their university hospital's neurointerventional database for children (that is, patients  18 years) who were examined or treated for aneurysmal or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) during the period 1990-2013. Images from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were analyzed for the extent of CV and collateralization of the cerebral circulation. Results from transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography were correlated with those from DSA. Cerebral vasospasm on TCD ultrasonography was defined according to criteria developed for adults. Clinical outcomes of CV were assessed with the pediatric modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS Among 37 children (21 boys and 16 girls ranging in age from 8 months to 18 years) showing symptoms of an aneurysmal SAH (comprising 32 aneurysms and 5 traumatic pseudoaneurysms), 17 (46%) had CV confirmed by DSA; CV was mild in 21% of these children, moderate in 50%, and severe in 29%. Only 3 children exhibited symptomatic CV, all of whom had poor collateralization of cerebral vessels. Among the 14 asymptomatic children, 10 (71%) showed some degree of vessel collateralization. Among 16 children for whom TCD data were available that could be correlated with the DSA findings, 13 (81%) had CV according to TCD criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of TCD ultrasonography for diagnosing CV were 95% and 59%, respectively. The time to CV onset detected by TCD ultrasonography was 5  3 days (range 2-10 days). Twenty-five (68%) of the children had good long-term outcomes (that is, had mRS scores of 0-2). CONCLUSIONS Children have a relatively high incidence of angiographically detectable, moderate-to-severe CV. Children rarely develop symptomatic CV and have good long-term outcomes, perhaps due to robust cerebral collateral blood flow. Criteria developed for detecting CV with TCD ultrasonography in adults overestimate the prevalence of CV in children. Larger studies are needed to define TCD ultrasonography-based CV criteria for children.","output":"Extent of collateralization predicting symptomatic cerebral vasospasm among pediatric patients: correlations among angiography, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and clinical findings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text]","output":"Life Interrupted C On the Front Lines with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The terms of the United Kingdom's (UK's) departure from the European Union (EU) are currently being negotiated.

Although these trials can offer significant advantages over traditional clinical trials, the process of designing and implementing direct-to-family studies is poorly defined, especially in children with rheumatic disease. This paper provides lessons learnt from the design and implementation of a self-controlled, direct-to-family pilot trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a medication management device on adherence to hydroxychloroquine in paediatric SLE. METHODS: Several design features accommodate a direct-to-family approach. Participants meeting eligibility criteria from across the USA were identified a priori through a disease registry, and all outcome data are collected remotely. The primary outcome (medication adherence) is evaluated using electronic medication event-monitoring, plasma drug levels, patient questionnaires and pill counts. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include (1) lupus disease activity measured by a remote SLE Disease Activity Index examination and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire; and (2) hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Recruitment of the initial target of 20 participants was achieved within 10 days. Due to initial recruitment success, enrolment was increased to 26 participants. Additional participants who were interested were placed on a waiting list in case of dropouts during the study. DISCUSSION AND DISSEMINATION: Direct-to-family trials offer several advantages but present unique challenges. Lessons learnt from the protocol development, design, and implementation of this trial will inform future direct-to-family trials for children and adults with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, the data collected remotely in this trial will provide critical information regarding the accuracy of teleresearch in lupus, the impact of adherence to hydroxychloroquine on disease activity and a pharmacokinetic analysis to inform paediatric-specific dosing of hydroxychloroquine.

METHODS: We searched the PubMed database using combinations of the following MeSH terms: intracranial aneurysm, radiosurgery, radiotherapy, inflammatory changes in aneurysmal walls from 1967 to 2019. RESULTS: 51 studies, for a total cohort of 60 patients, are described. The median latency between the radiation treatment and the diagnosis was 9,83 years, ranging from a minimum of 0,33 to a maximum of 33. The modality of rays' administration was variable, and the dosage ranged from a minimum of 12 grays to a maximum of 177,2 grays. The anterior circulation appeared to be more frequently involved, and the most compromised vessel was the internal carotid artery. Radiation-induced vascular diseases have already been described in literature as well as RT-induced cellular and structural changes such as necrosis, macrophage or mononuclear cell infiltration, and several data support the role of inflammation in the development and remodelling of intracranial aneurysms, that, on one hand, favours them and, on the other, is necessary to their healing after endovascular treatment.

We have first developed the LSTM model with word2vec to predict PPIs between human and virus, named LSTM-PHV, by using amino acid sequences alone. The LSTM-PHV effectively learnt the training data with a highly imbalanced ratio of positive to negative samples and achieved an AUC of 0.976 with an accuracy of 98.4% using 5-fold cross-validation. By using independent test dataset, we compared the LSTM-PHV with existing state-of-the-art PPI predictors including DeepViral. In predicting PPIs between human and unknown or new virus, the LSTM-PHV presented higher performance than the existing predictors when they were trained by multiple host protein-including datasets. LSTM-PHV learnt multiple host protein sequence contexts more efficiently than the DeepViral. Interestingly, learning of only sequence contexts as words presented remarkably high performances.

The resulting Draft Report demonstrates both the benefits and risks of an economic approach to these issues. Some of the broader systemic recommendations have merit such as the need for stepped care, coordinated crisis management and the important role of welfare, housing and the workplace in improving mental health. However, there are areas of concern, particularly for mental health services in the public sector. One is a disproportionate emphasis on prevention and intervention in the early years of life for strategies where evidence for effectiveness is limited. Another is the introduction of market-based approaches such as shadow billing or a commissioner/provider split to the funding of mental health services across Australia. Among the numerous problems of such market-driven approaches are the increased costs of additional bureaucracy and the lack of commissioner expertise in planning services or evidence-based practice. As a result, similar arrangements have been abandoned in other jurisdictions. The Commission's final recommendations and the Australian Government's response are awaited and the resulting changes to the mental health system, and beyond, may well be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS Twenty-seven subjects with PMV in our respiratory care center (RCC) were divided randomly into an exercise training group (n = 12) and a control group (n = 15). The exercise program comprised 10 sessions of exercise training. The measurement of pulmonary mechanics and physical functional status (Functional Independence Measurement and Barthel index) were performed pre-study and post-study. The hospitalization outcomes included: days of mechanical ventilation, hospitalization days, and weaning and mortality rates during RCC stay. RESULTS The training group had significant improvement in tidal volume (143.6 mL vs 192.5 mL, P = .02) and rapid shallow breathing index after training (162.2 vs 110.6, P = .009). No significant change was found in the control group except respiratory rate. Both groups had significant improvement in functional status during the study. However, the training group had greater changes in FIM score than the control group (44.6 vs 34.2, P = .024).

The newborn  four-year old child is particularly difficult to study because of their lack of cooperation and size. The recent progress in computer technology made pulmonary function testing available for this age range and opened up new possibilities for monitoring changes in disease processes affecting the respiratory system. This may improve medical management of infants and children with lung and heart diseases in particular. In 1989, Shannon [49] proposed in this Journal that the minimum physiological information needed for the intelligent use of mechanical ventilation (particularly if lower airway and/or pulmonary parenchymal disease was apparent) required the measurement of at least 4 variables: i) arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide; ii) arterial oxygen saturation; iii) the mechanical time constant of the lung and iv) FRC. In many circumstances, arterial CO(2) is approximated by alveolar (end-tidal) CO(2) and the arterial oxygen saturation is obtained from pulse oximetry accurately if perfusion is adequate. The mechanical time constant and FRC are easily measured by the techniques described above and together provide important information concerning appropriate ventilator settings for a given disease. The described techniques bring new insights and awareness, but also new responsibilities in the management of infants and children with respiratory compromise. Not all of these techniques need to be applied to all infants in the ICU. Not all the assumptions upon which some of the techniques we have described are based will prove true.

Evidence from adequately powered randomised studies with a low risk of bias for the optimal anaesthetic in this context is limited. OBJECTIVE We tested the hypothesis that when using remifentanil-based intra-operative analgesia, desflurane would be the most suitable anaesthetic: with noninferiority in the occurrence of upper airway complications and superiority in emergence times compared with sevoflurane or propofol. DESIGN A randomised, multicentre, partially double-blinded, three-arm, parallel-group study. SETTING Two university and two regional German hospitals, from February to October 2015. PATIENTS A total of 352 patients (age 18 to 75 years, ASA physical status I to III, BMI less than 35 kg m and fluent in German) were enrolled in this study. All surgery was elective with a duration of 0.5 to 2 h, and general anaesthesia with a LMA was feasible. INTERVENTION The patients were randomised to receive desflurane, sevoflurane or propofol anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES This study was powered for the primary outcome 'time to state date of birth' and the secondary outcome 'intra-operative cough'. Time to emergence from anaesthesia and the incidence of upper airway complications were assessed on the day of surgery. RESULTS The primary outcome was analysed for 343 patients: desflurane (n=114), sevoflurane (n=111) and propofol (n=118). The desflurane group had the fastest emergence. The mean ( SD) times to state the date of birth following desflurane, sevoflurane and propofol were 8.1  3.6, 10.1  4.0 and 9.8  5.1 min, respectively (P < 0.01).

After setting seropositivity thresholds for perfect specificity (100%), we estimated sensitivities of 95% for IgG, 90% for IgA, and 81% for IgM for detecting infected individuals between 15 and 28 days after symptom onset. While the median time to seroconversion was nearly 12 days across all three isotypes tested, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with median times to seroreversion of 71 and 49 days after symptom onset. In contrast, anti-RBD IgG responses decayed slowly through 90 days with only 3 seropositive individuals seroreverting within this time period. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were strongly correlated with anti-S neutralizing antibody titers, which demonstrated little to no decrease over 75 days since symptom onset. We observed no cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted antibodies with other widely circulating coronaviruses (HKU1, 229 E, OC43, NL63). These data suggest that RBD-targeted antibodies are excellent markers of previous and recent infection, that differential isotype measurements can help distinguish between recent and older infections, and that IgG responses persist over the first few months after infection and are highly correlated with neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Persistence and decay of human antibody responses to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: One of the major challenges in treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is predicting the severity of disease. We aimed to develop a new score for predicting progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 239 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from two medical centers in China between February 6 and April 6, 2020 were retrospectively included. The prognostic abilities of variables, including clinical data and laboratory findings from the electronic medical records of each hospital, were analysed using the Cox proportional hazards model and KaplanCMeier methods. A prognostic score was developed to predict progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 239 patients, 216 (90.38%) patients had mild/moderate disease, and 23 (9.62%) progressed to severe disease. After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, pulmonary disease, age > 75, IgM, CD16(+)/CD56(+) NK cells and aspartate aminotransferase were independent predictors of progression to severe COVID-19. Based on these five factors, a new predictive score (the PAINT score) was established and showed a high predictive value (C-index = 0.91, 0.902  0.021, p < 0.001). The PAINT score was validated using a nomogram, bootstrap analysis, calibration curves, decision curves and clinical impact curves, all of which confirmed its high predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINT score for progression from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19 may be helpful in identifying patients at high risk of progression.

METHODS: Following scoping review methods, we included 30 studies that varied in terms of methodology and theoretical approaches. The search included peer\\\\reviewed articles and grey literature published between March and September 2020. RESULTS: Based on the studies reviewed, we found that COVID\\\\19 infection and death rates increased not only with age and comorbidities, but also with discrimination and structural inequities based on racism and sexism. Racial and ethnic minority workers, including migrant workers, are concentrated in high\\\\risk occupations and this concentration is correlated to lower socioeconomic conditions. The COVID\\\\19 pandemic appears in the occupational health and safety spotlight as an exacerbator of already existing socioeconomic inequalities and social inequalities in health, especially in light of the intersection of issues related to racism, ethnic minority status, and sexism. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides early evidence about the limitations of institutions' responses to the pandemic, and their capacity to provide a safe and decent working environment for all workers, regardless of their employment status or the social protections they may enjoy under normal circumstances.

Worldwide, such services are underfunded and under-resourced, and services in Ireland are no different. It is vital that existing services are regularly reviewed for both efficacy and acceptability. Our objective was to review published studies evaluating service user satisfaction with CAMHS in Ireland and CAMHS therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were systematically searched. Studies were included if they reported on service user satisfaction or an evaluation of CAMHS in Ireland. RESULTS: From an initial 125 articles identified, 15 studies meet the inclusion criteria: four reporting on overall CAMHS satisfaction, three on satisfaction where a specific diagnosis was present, while eight evaluated various interventions offered. Whilst most service users perceived services to be satisfactory, important issues relating to accessibility were present. Evidence of efficacy was present for a small number of interventions, but studies were limited by methodological issues. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of studies evaluating CAMHS in Ireland. The extant literature suggests a positive experience once accessed, but long waiting times and poor collaboration are seen to limit services users' experience. More robust methodologically sound studies are urgently required.

In just two years, the pandemic has wreaked a lot of havoc across the globe. Various determining factors will decide the fate of a looming third wave in India. Although there is no direct evidence of a third wave, many metro cities in India have reported a surge of new cases despite mass vaccination. The rapid development of vaccines and mass vaccination programmes has helped contain the crisis in the past. An updated and robust vaccination campaign along with public measures like the avoidance of large gatherings will help counter the third wave. Over 50% of the eligible population in India has been fully vaccinated to date. The emergence of new strains like the Alpha, Beta, Kappa, and Delta variants of concern, which may exhibit vaccine resistance, may complicate matters. Significant challenges include inadequate data collection, public unawareness, fake news, irregular vaccine supply, and the presence of mutant variants. Comorbidities like dengue complicate disease course. Travel restrictions, personal protective equipment shortages, and barriers to healthcare access are important obstacles to overcome. An increased focus on pandemic preparedness is needed. Targeted vaccination campaigns can help build a favorable public perspective. Data gathering and research need to be promoted.

Methods We gathered case-information, including: demographics, staff-residence postcode, resident cell number, work areas/dates, test results, staff interview dates/notes and resident prison-transfer dates. Epidemiological curves were mapped by prison location. Control measures included isolation (exclusion from work or cell-isolation), cohorting (new admissions and work-area groups), asymptomatic testing (case-finding), removal of communal dining and movement restrictions. Facemask use and enhanced hygiene were already in place. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and interviews determined genetic relationship between cases plausibility of transmission.

Much of the assistance caregivers provide, such as administering medications or financial management, relies on cognitive ability, but little is known about caregivers' cognitive functioning. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported experience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss over the past year (5), could affect caregivers' risk for adverse health outcomes and affect the quality of care they provide. CDC analyzed SCD among caregivers aged 45 years through a cross-sectional analysis of data from 22 states in the 2015-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Among adults aged 45 years, SCD was reported by 12.6% of caregivers who provided care to a family member or friend with a health condition or disability in the past 30 days compared with 10.2% of noncaregivers (p<0.001).

Methods: Since November 2020, the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe Network Group started collecting observational data on HIV and COVID-19 co-infections. In total, 16 countries from Central and Eastern European submitted data (eCRF) on 557 HIV-positive patients. The current analyses included patients who had a radiological examination performed. Logistic regression models were used to identify the factors associated with death, ICU admission, and partial recovery (poor COVID-19 outcomes). Factors that were significant in the univariate models (p<0.1) were included in multivariate model. Results: Radiological data were available for 224 (40.2%) patients, 108 (48.2%) had computed tomography, and 116 (51.8%) had a chest X-ray. Of these, 211 (94.2%) were diagnosed using RT-PCR tests, 212 (94.6%) were symptomatic, 123 (55.6%) were hospitalized, 37 (16.6%) required oxygen therapy, and 28 (13.1%) either died, were admitted to ICU, or only partially recovered. From the radiologists description, 138 (61.6%) patients had typical radiological changes, 18 (8.0%) atypical changes, and 68 (30.4%) no changes.

This cross-sectional study included 155 COVID-19 patients diagnosed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using oropharyngeal swabs. All patients had clinical examination, routine laboratory investigation, and chest computerized tomography scan. O2 saturation, serum D dimer, C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and serum ferritin were assessed. NLR can predict the adverse outcome (e.g., disease deterioration and shock) at cut-off 6.65, with 92% sensitivity and 20.7% specificity. LDH at cut-off value of 364.5 had 79.3% sensitivity and 47% specificity. Ferritin at a cut-off value of 1036 had 60.9% sensitivity and 60.6% specificity. NLR alone was not an independent predictor for ICU, however, combining NLR with ferritin and LDH predicted the need for ICU. Total leucocytic count (TLC), neutrophil count, lymphocytic count, D dimer, and CRP were independent predictors for the need of ICU admission (P < 0.05). Admitted patients to ICU and dead patients had higher COVID-19 Reporting and Data System, length of stay, LDH, and ferritin and lower O2 saturation than non-admitted and alive ones.

The Pabon Lasso method was used, considering hospitals in the third quadrant of the plot as top-performing in the territory. A particular focus was on performance changes during the pandemic caused by SARS-COV-2 coronavirus. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There is considerable heterogeneity in the length of stay, bed occupancy and turnover rate between territories. The proportion of top-performing hospitals varied between 20% and 43%, providing between 16% and 69% of inpatients episodes within the territory. However, countries did not differ in how their hospitals were distributed across the four quadrants of the Pabon Lasso plot. Comparison of Croatian and Kosovar data from 2019 to 2020 suggested a significant decrease in turnover and occupancy rates, but most hospitals retained their plot quartiles from the previous year.

Support for a transactional model between anti-mattering and depression symptoms was found. Specifically, anti-mattering positively predicted later depression symptoms and depression symptoms consistently predicted later anti-mattering. Depression symptoms also shared a negative association with later mattering but not the reverse, supporting a symptoms-driven model of depression symptoms and mattering. Auto-regressive paths, residual covariances, and cross-lagged paths were invariant over time. Accounting for gender, household income, parental education, and fear of COVID-19 as covariates did not change the results.

As structures of drugs increase in complexity, the importance of computational predictions comes into sharp focus. Knowledge of various computational tools enables us to predict the molecular properties, toxicity, and biological efficacy of the drugs and help the medicinal chemists to discover new drugs more efficiently. Newly approved drugs have higher affinities for proteins and nucleic acids and are applied for the treatment of human diseases. We have carried out the computational studies of 21 such NCEs, specifically small molecules and antibodyCdrug conjugates, and studied the biological efficacy of these drugs. Their bioactivity score and molecular and pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated using online computer software programs, viz., Molinspiration and Osiris Property Explorer. The SwissTargetPrediction tool was used for the efficient prediction of protein targets for the NCEs. The results indicated higher stability for the drug complexes due to a larger HOMOCLUMO gap. A high electrophilicity index reflects good electrophilic behavior and high reactivity of the drugs. Lipinskis rule of five indicated that most of the drug complexes are likely to be orally active. These drugs also showed non-mutagenic, non-tumorigenic, non-irritant, and non-effective reproductive behavior.

METHODS During the period between January 2014 and December 2016, a total number of 132 laparoscopic surgeries were performed for bening adnexal masses in our clinic. Seventy women underwent CLS and 62 women underwent MLS. Pathological results and operating time of procedures, estimated blood loss, preoperative and postoperative complications, patient scale and observer scale (POSAS) and length of hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS There was no difference between the two groups regarding preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative surgical procedure performed, and length of hospital stay. The groups were compared in terms of postoperative pathological diagnosis using the Chi-square test, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Comparing the operation time and hematocrit change, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups.

We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. RESULTS: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 4.89-8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CrI 3.05-5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles).

We also examined the extent of scientific evaluations of southern African plant species against the respiratory-infective viruses, with the aim of stimulating interest in this area and focusing on future studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook an extensive review of ethnobotanical books, reviews and primary scientific studies to identify southern African plants which are used in traditional southern African medicine to treat viral respiratory diseases. This information was used to identify gaps in the current research that require further study. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-seven southern African plant species were identified as traditional therapies for viral respiratory diseases. Surprisingly, only one of those species (as well as twenty-one other species not recorded for these purposes) has been evaluated for the ability to block respiratory virus production. Furthermore, most of these studies screened against a single viral strain and none of those studies examined the mechanism of action of the plant preparations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite well documented records of the use of southern African plants to treat respiratory viral diseases, the field is poorly explored. Nearly all of the plant species used in traditional healing systems to treat these diseases are yet to be tested. Substantial further work is required to verify the efficacy of these traditional medicines.","output":"The traditional use of southern African medicinal plants in the treatment of viral respiratory diseases: A review of the ethnobotany and scientific evaluations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1007/s12291-021-00967-0.].","output":"Correction to: \\"Silent Hypoxemia\\" Leads to Vicious Cycle of Infection, Coagulopathy and Cytokine Storm in COVID-19: Can Prophylactic Oxygen Therapy Prevent It?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: During the first winter of exposure, the H1N1 2009 influenza virus placed considerable strain on intensive care unit (ICU) services in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). We assessed the impact of the H1N1 2009 influenza virus on ICU services during the second (2010) winter, following the implementation of vaccination. METHODS: A prospective, cohort study was conducted in all ANZ ICUs during the southern hemisphere winter of 2010. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics, including vaccination status and outcomes, were collected. The characteristics of patients admitted during the 2010 and 2009 seasons were compared. RESULTS: From 1 June to 15 October 2010, there were 315 patients with confirmed influenza A, of whom 283 patients (90%) had H1N1 2009 (10.6 cases per million inhabitants; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.4 to 11.9) which was an observed incidence of 33% of that in 2009 (P < 0.001). The maximum daily ICU occupancy was 2.4 beds (95% CI, 1.8 to 3) per million inhabitants in 2010 compared with 7.5 (95% CI, 6.5 to 8.6) in 2009, (P < 0.001). The onset of the epidemic in 2010 was delayed by five weeks compared with 2009. The clinical characteristics were similar in 2010 and 2009 with no difference in the age distribution, proportion of patients treated with mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU admission, or hospital mortality. Unlike 2009 the incidence of critical illness was significantly greater in New Zealand (18.8 cases per million inhabitants compared with 9 in Australia, P < 0.001). Of 170 patients with known vaccination status, 26 (15.3%) had been vaccinated against H1N1 2009. CONCLUSIONS: During the 2010 ANZ winter, the impact of H1N1 2009 on ICU services was still appreciable in Australia and substantial in New Zealand.

Nowadays, a new technique for rapid tooling, Additive Manufacturing (AM), can create customized products with more complex geometries and short life cycles (flexibility) in order to keep up with the new variables imposed by the manufacturing environment. In the last two decades, the migration from subtractive manufacturing to AM has materialized such products with reduced costs and cycle times. AM has been recently promoted to develop polymer molds for product manufacturing. This paper reviews the main findings in the literature concerning polymer molds created by AM compared to conventional (metal) molds obtained by subtractive manufacturing. Information about specific topics is scarce or nonexistent, for example, about the characterization of the most commonly injected materials and molds used in this type of technology, their mechanical properties (part and mold), designs for all types of geometries, and costs. These aspects are addressed in this literature review, highlighting the advantages of this alternative manufacturing process, which is considered a desirable technology worldwide.","output":"Analysis and Advances in Additive Manufacturing as a New Technology to Make Polymer Injection Molds for World-Class Production Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Due to the limited research examining the psychological impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), our study aims to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological outcomes and assess the differences between participants with and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the psychological outcomes as latent factors and items.

The 2015 South Korean MERS outbreak presented an opportunity for us to compare tweets responding to the same outbreak in different languages. Methods We obtained a 1% sample through Twitter streaming application programming interface from June 1 to 30, 2015. We identified MERS-related tweets with keywords such as MERS and its translation in five different languages. We translated non-English tweets into English for statistical comparison. Results We retrieved MERS-related Twitter data in five languages: Korean (N = 21,823), English (N = 4024), Thai (N = 2084), Japanese (N = 1334) and Indonesian (N = 1256). Categories of randomly selected user profiles (p < 0.001) and the top 30 sources of retweets (p < 0.001) differed between the five language corpora. Among the randomly selected user profiles, K-pop fans ranged from 4% in the Korean corpus to 70% in the Thai corpus; media ranged from 0% (Thai) to 14% (Indonesian); political advocates ranged from 0% (Thai) to 19% (Japanese); medical professionals ranged from 0% (Thai) to 7% (English). Among the top 30 sources of retweets for each corpus (150 in total), 70 (46.7%) were media; 29 (19.3%) were K-pop fans; 7 (4.7%) were political; 9 (6%) were medical; and 35 (23.3%) were categorized as Others. We performed chi-square feature selection and identified the top 20 keywords that were most unique to each corpus.

The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in lower respiratory specimens (such as sputum) is higher than that for upper respiratory specimens (such as nasal and pharyngeal swabs). However, sputum specimens are usually quite viscous, requiring a homogenization process prior to nucleic acid (NA) extraction for RT-PCR. Sputum specimens from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were treated with four commonly used reagentssaline, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC), proteinase K (PK), and dithiothreitol (DTT), prior to NA extraction. These reagents were then compared for their performance in diagnosing COVID-19 in real clinical practice. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in PK- or DTT-treated sputum was comparable, and higher than that in sputum treated with NALC or saline. While there was a 4.8% (1/21) false negative rate for the PK- and DTT-treated sputum, neither treatment showed any false positive cases among patients with non-COVID diseases. Moreover, sputum pretreated with saline, NALC, PK or DTT showed higher detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to pharyngeal swabs. Taken together, we provide direct evidence recommending the use of PK or DTT to pretreat sputum samples to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 detection by clinical laboratories. Moreover, our methods should help to standardize the procedure of processing sputum specimens and improve the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in these samples.","output":"Direct Clinical Evidence Recommending the Use of Proteinase K or Dithiothreitol to Pretreat Sputum for Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to healthcare workers worldwide. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia, and to identify the factors associated with these psychological disorders. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted from January 21 to March 2, 2021. Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare workers from different parts of Saudi Arabia were recruited through snowball sampling. Psychological outcomes were measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Pearson's chi-square test was used to explore the bivariate association between diverse characteristics and each outcome. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results: A total of 501 healthcare workers completed the survey, of whom 60% were female and nearly half were pharmacists. The majority (76.25%) of respondents reported that a family member, friend, or colleague had contracted COVID-19, and more than one-third (36%) knew someone who died due to COVID-19. Overall, the estimated prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 54.69, 60.88, and 41.92%, respectively. The multivariate analysis revealed that healthcare workers with chronic diseases, nurses, and healthcare workers from the southern region were more likely to suffer from depression and stress. Further, individuals with positive COVID-19 test results showed a greater proportion of depressive symptoms compared to others. In addition, knowing someone who died due to COVID-19 and having a chronic illness were predisposing factors for anxiety. Conclusion: After more than a year, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress remains substantial among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia.

This situation may have an impact on mental health, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption. The aim of this research report is therefore to describe changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption in the general French population during the first two weeks of lockdown and identify any associated factors. METHODS: Self-reported changes in smoking and alcohol consumption following the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020 were collected from 2,003 respondents aged 18 years and older in an online cross-sectional survey carried out from March 30 to April 1, 2020. Anxiety and depression levels were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: Among current smokers, 26.7% reported an increase in their tobacco consumption since lockdown and 18.6% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 54.7%. The increase in tobacco consumption was associated with an age of 18-34 years, a high level of education, and anxiety. Among alcohol drinkers, 10.7% reported an increase in their alcohol consumption since lockdown and 24.4% reported a decrease, while it remained stable for 64.8%. The increase in alcohol consumption was associated with an age of 18-49 years, living in cities of more than 100,000 inhabitants, a high socio-professional category, and a depressive mood.

Sir William Osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, Humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever. Despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicatedvariola virus, the agent of smallpox. In its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics. Bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the Black Death caused by Yersinia pestis in 14th century Europe. However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. Focusing on viruses, a catalog of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time.

There are three different isotypes of PPARs: PPAR&#945;, PPAR?3, and PPAR?/?. PPAR?3 is an established regulator of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that PPAR?3 exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in multiple disease models. PPAR?3 can also modulate the activation and polarization of macrophages, regulate the function of dendritic cells and mediate T cell survival, activation, and differentiation. In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways and biological functions of PPAR?3 and focus on how PPAR?3 and its agonists play protective roles in autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid diseases, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary Sjogren syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis.","output":"The roles of PPAR?3 and its agonists in autoimmune diseases: A comprehensive review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most patients who became critically ill following infection with COVID-19 develop severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) attributed to a maladaptive or inadequate immune response. The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system that is involved in the opsonization of viruses but also in triggering further immune cell responses. Complement activation was seen in plasma adsorber material that clogged during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Apart from the lung, the kidney is the second most common organ affected by COVID-19. Using immunohistochemistry for complement factors C1q, MASP-2, C3c, C3d, C4d, and C5b-9 we investigated the involvement of the complement system in six kidney biopsies with acute kidney failure in different clinical settings and three kidneys from autopsy material of patients with COVID-19. Renal tissue was analyzed for signs of renal injury by detection of thrombus formation using CD61, endothelial cell rarefaction using the marker E-26 transformation specific-related gene (ERG-) and proliferation using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-staining. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Biopsies from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS, n = 5), severe acute tubular injury (ATI, n = 7), zero biopsies with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, n = 7) and 1 year protocol biopsies from renal transplants (Ctrl, n = 7) served as controls. In the material clogging plasma adsorbers used for extracorporeal therapy of patients with COVID-19 C3 was the dominant protein but collectin 11 and MASP-2 were also identified. SARS-CoV-2 was sporadically present in varying numbers in some biopsies from patients with COVID-19. The highest frequency of CD61-positive platelets was found in peritubular capillaries and arteries of COVID-19 infected renal specimens as compared to all controls. Apart from COVID-19 specimens, MASP-2 was detected in glomeruli with DIC and ATI. In contrast, the classical pathway (i.e. C1q) was hardly seen in COVID-19 biopsies. Both C3 cleavage products C3c and C3d were strongly detected in renal arteries but also occurs in glomerular capillaries of COVID-19 biopsies, while tubular C3d was stronger than C3c in biopsies from COVID-19 patients. The membrane attack complex C5b-9, demonstrating terminal pathway activation, was predominantly deposited in COVID-19 biopsies in peritubular capillaries, renal arterioles, and tubular basement membrane with similar or even higher frequency compared to controls. In conclusion, various complement pathways were activated in COVID-19 kidneys, the lectin pathway mainly in peritubular capillaries and in part the classical pathway in renal arteries whereas the alternative pathway seem to be crucial for tubular complement activation. Therefore, activation of the complement system might be involved in the worsening of renal injury. Complement inhibition might thus be a promising treatment option to prevent deregulated activation and subsequent collateral tissue injury.","output":"Complement Activation in Kidneys of Patients With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) not only causes serious diarrhea in suckling piglets but also possesses the potential for cross-species transmission, which has sparked growing interest when studying this emerging virus. We previously identified a novel accessory protein NS7a encoded by PDCoV; however, the function of NS7a was not resolved. In this study, we demonstrated that PDCoV NS7a is an interferon antagonist. Overexpression of NS7a notably inhibited Sendai virus (SeV)-induced interferon-? (IFN-?) production and the activation of IRF3 rather than NF-&#954;B. NS7a also inhibited IFN-? promoter activity induced by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKK?, which are key components of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway but not IRF3, the transcription factor downstream of TBK1/IKK?. Surprisingly, NS7a specifically interacts with IKK? but not with the closely related TBK1. Furthermore, NS7a interacts simultaneously with the kinase domain (KD) and the scaffold dimerization domain (SDD) of IKK?, competing with TRAF3, and IRF3 for binding to IKK?, leading to the reduction of RLR-mediated IFN-? production. The interactions of TRAF3-IKK? and IKK?-IRF3 are also attenuated in PDCoV-infected cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV NS7a inhibits IFN-? production by disrupting the association of IKK? with both TRAF3 and IRF3, revealing a new mechanism utilized by a PDCoV accessory protein to evade the host antiviral innate immune response.","output":"Porcine Deltacoronavirus Accessory Protein NS7a Antagonizes IFN-?

OBJECTIVE: We performed a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID-19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles. METHODS: This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented for COVID-19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri, USA between March and September 2020. We classified and analyzed patients according to their preexisting asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID-19 testing results. RESULTS: COVID-19 suspected patients (n=435) were enrolled in this study. The proportion of patients testing positive for COVID-19 was 69.2% and 81.9% in the asthma and non-asthma groups respectively. The frequency of relevant symptoms are similar between asthma groups with positive and negative COVID-19 test results.

CONCLUSION: While the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue sections has yet to be determined, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP alone without spike RNA suggests that cleaved SP may be present in cutaneous endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium, providing a potential pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 endotheliitis.","output":"Discordant anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RNA staining in cutaneous perniotic lesions suggests endothelial deposition of cleaved spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination coverage needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in each United States (U.S.) state. However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% [Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% [CrI: 12.3%-14.2%], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% [CrI: 0.1%-0.3%] in Hawaii to 2.8% [CrI: 1.8%-4.1%] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% [CrI: 1.2%-2.0%] in Vermont to 23% [CrI: 20%-28%] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The airborne spread is the main route of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus, including e SARS CoV-2 virus causing the disease known as COVID-19 The implicit risk of aerosolization of SARS CoV-2 infective microdroplets while carrying out respiratory function tests has caused a significant limitation of activity in most Pulmonary Function Laboratories since the beginning of the pandemic This document aims to update the recommendations for the management of Pulmonary Function Laboratories in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Argentina New recommendations include ways to carry out pulmonary function testing during the context of a high and low community viral spread phase, the evaluation of post-COVID-19 patients, as well as several aspects of biosafety for patients and operators Measures consist of promoting air circulation in the environment, the use of antimicrobial filters, the protection of airways and mucous membranes, and hand washing","output":"Recommendations for pulmonary function laboratories in the COVID-19 era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the travel insurance industry, cancel-for-any-reason insurance, also known as a cancellation protection service (CPS), is a recent attempt to strike a balance between customer satisfaction and service provider (SP) profits However, some exceptional circumstances, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a dramatic decrease in SP revenues, especially for non-refundable tickets purchased early with CPS This paper begins by presenting a risk group segmentation of customers in an online ticket reservation system Then, a CPS fee is recommended depending on the different customer risk groups provided by the cluster segmentation via different clustering algorithms such as centroid-based K-means, hierarchical agglomerative, DBSCAN, and artificial neural network-based SOM algorithms According to the implemented cluster metrics, which include the Silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index, Entropy index, and DBCV index, the SOM algorithm presents the most appropriate result After predicting the new customer cluster, a CPS fee will be calculated with the proposed adaptive CPS method based on the cluster segmentation weights Determining the weight of each cluster is related to the total CPS revenue threshold for all clusters defined by the SP Therefore, to avoid a loss for SPs, the total CPS revenue will be kept constant with the threshold that the SP has been adjusted The experimental results based on real-world data show that the risk group segmentation of customers helps to maintain a balance between CPS fees and SP profits Finally, according to the calculated weights, the proposed model pegs the SP gain/loss variation with a 0 00012 exchange ratio CCBY","output":"Cancel-for-Any-Reason Insurance Recommendation Using Customer Transaction-Based Clustering"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells have a recognised innate-like capacity for antibacterial host defence, consequent on the specificity of their T cell receptor (TCR) for small molecule metabolites produced by a range of prokaryotic and fungal species, their effector memory phenotype, and their expression of cytotoxic molecules.

In this retrospective, descriptive ecological study, we utilized Google Trends (GT) to characterize the second COVID-19 wave and its association with official case counts based on search terms related to symptoms, testing, disease complications, medications, preventive behaviors, and healthcare utilization. Methods: GT is a publicly available, online tracking system of Google searches. Searches are presented as relative search volumes (RSV) from 0 (least) to 100 (most number of searches). We performed pre-defined Web searches in India from 2/12/2021 to 5/09/2021. We characterized the peak RSV, RSV doubling rates, and Spearman rank correlation of selected search terms with official case counts. We also used date-adjusted linear regression to estimate the association between highly correlated search terms and official case counts. We then qualitatively classified public search queries into thematic groups to better understand public awareness and needs related to COVID-19. Results: We observed that searches for symptoms (most searched terms in order: fever, cough, headache, fatigue, chest pain), disease states (infection, pneumonia), COVID-19-related medications (remdesivir, ivermectin, azithromycin, Fabiflu, dexamethasone), testing modalities (PCR, CT Scan, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation), healthcare utilization (oxygen cylinders, hospital, physician), and preventive behaviors (lockdown, mask, pulse oximetry, hand sanitizer, quarantine) all demonstrated increases, in line with increases in official case counts. Symptoms, PCR testing, outpatient medications, and preventive behaviors peaked around April 24th, approximately two weeks prior to the peak RSV in official case counts.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between recent exposure to ACEIs/ARBs and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We used the data from a nationwide cohort of patients with COVID-19 from the health insurance claims data of South Korea, which were released for research purposes for public health by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea. Patients with COVID-19 were identified using the relevant diagnostic code. Propensity score-matching (1:1) was carried out among patients with CVD according to the type of medication (ACEIs/ARBs vs. other), and the risk of death was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 4936 patients with COVID-19 were analyzed, of whom 1048 (21.2%) had CVD. Of the 1048 patients with CVD, 864 (82.4%) received at least one anti-hypertensive medication prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19, including 359 (41.6%) who received ACEIs/ARBs and 505 (58.4%) who received drugs other than ACEIs/ARBs. Using the propensity scores for ACEIs/ARBs use, we matched 305 pairs of patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs and patients receiving other drugs. The recent use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.14) and propensity score-matching analysis (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.16).

However, brain tissue culture studies have shown that oligodendrocytes support transcription of all CDV genes and later on degenerate, although no viral proteins can be found in these cells. It remains to be shown how such a restricted infection leads to demyelination. Concomitant with immunologic recovery during the further course of the disease, inflammation occurs in the demyelinating lesions with progression of the lesions in some animals. A series of experiments in vitro suggested that chronic demyelination is due to a bystander mechanism associated with the virus-induced immune response in which antibody dependent cell-mediated reactions play an important role.

In comparison with the current available medical modalities, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging is the simplest and fastest means for probing the tissue perfusion. Specifically, the perfusion parameters estimated from the ultrasound time-intensity curve (TIC) and statistics-based time-Nakagami parameter curve (TNC) approaches were found able to quantify the perfusion. However, due to insufficient tolerance on tissue clutters and subresolvable effects, these approaches remain short of reproducibility and robustness. Consequently, the window-modulated compounding (WMC) Nakagami parameter ratio imaging was proposed to alleviate these effects, by taking the ratio of WMC Nakagami parameters corresponding to the incidence of two different acoustic pressures from an employed transducer. The time-Nakagami parameter ratio curve (TNRC) approach was also developed to estimate perfusion parameters. Measurements for the assessment of muscle perfusion were performed from the flow phantom and animal subjects administrated with a bolus of ultrasound contrast agents. The TNRC approach demonstrated better sensitivity and tolerance of tissue clutters than those of TIC and TNC. The fusion image with the WMC Nakagami parameter ratio and B-mode images indicated that both the tissue structures and perfusion properties of ultrasound contrast agents may be better discerned.","output":"Window-Modulated Compounding Nakagami Parameter Ratio Approach for Assessing Muscle Perfusion with Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, can bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, damage multiple organs and is more contagious.

While 14-day isolation of infected individuals could effectively reduce the risk of subsequence transmission, it also significantly impacts the patient's financial, psychological, and emotional well-being. It is, therefore, vital to investigate how the isolation duration could be shortened when effective vaccines are available and in what circumstances we can live with COVID-19 without isolation and quarantine. Methods: An individual-based modeling approach was employed to estimate the likelihood of secondary infections and the likelihood of an outbreak following the isolation of an index case for a range of isolation periods. Our individual-based model integrates the viral load and infectiousness profiles of vaccinated and unvaccinated infected individuals. The effects of waning vaccine-induced immunity against Delta and Omicron variant transmission were also investigated. Results: In the baseline scenario in which all individuals are unvaccinated, and no nonpharmaceutical interventions are employed, there is a chance of about 3% that an unvaccinated index case will make at least one secondary infection after being isolated for 14 days, and a sustained chain of transmission can occur with a chance of less than 1%. We found that at the outbreak risk equivalent to that of 14-day isolation in the baseline scenario, the isolation duration can be shortened to 7.33 days (95% CI 6.68-7.98) if 75% of people in the community are fully vaccinated during the last three months. In the best-case scenario in which all individuals in the community are fully vaccinated, isolation of infected individuals may no longer be necessary, at least during the first three months after being fully vaccinated, indicating that booster vaccination may be required after being fully vaccinated for three to four months. Finally, our simulations showed that the reduced vaccine effectiveness against Omicron variant transmission does not much affect the risk of an outbreak if the vaccine effectiveness against infection is maintained at a high level via booster vaccination. Conclusions: The isolation duration of a vaccine breakthrough infector could be safely shortened if a majority of people in the community are immune to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A booster vaccination may be necessary three months after full vaccination to keep the outbreak risk low.","output":"Community vaccination can shorten the COVID-19 isolation period: an individual-based modeling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in stroke care in several countries. The objective was to describe lockdown stroke care in a tertiary stroke center in Dsseldorf, Germany near Heinsberg, a German hot spot for COVID-19 in spring 2020. METHODS: In a retrospective, observational, single-center study, we compared all patients treated in our emergency department (ED), patients seen by a neurologist in the ED, ED patients suffering from ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) as well as stroke patients admitted to our stroke unit during lockdown in spring 2020 (16 March 2020C12 April 2020) to those cared for during the same period in 2019 and lockdown light in fall 2020 (2 November C 29 November 2020). RESULTS: In spring 2020 lockdown the mean number of patients admitted to our ED dropped by 37.4%, seen by a neurologist by 35.6%, ED stroke patients by 19.2% and number of patients admitted to our stroke unit by 10% compared to the same period in 2019.

Assessing the effect of COVID-19 on liver injury is of great importance. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to establish the characteristics of liver function tests in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic search of publications from December 2019 up to April 2020 in Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline (via PubMed) databases was performed. Both cross-sectional and case series studies reporting an association between liver injury and COVID-19 infection were included. The data were analyzed using the STATA software (version 11.0) and the random-effects model for I2&gt;50% was used to pool the results. Results: In this meta-analysis, 42 articles comprising a total of 6,557 COVID-19 patients were studied. The prevalence of increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels was 30% and 21% in non-severe patients and 38% and 48% in severe patients, respectively. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were 4.22, 4.96, and 4.13 times more likely to have elevated AST, ALT, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, respectively. Conclusion: Elevation in liver function tests was higher in patients with severe than non-severe COVID-19 infection. Given the widespread use of drugs that increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, healthcare providers should be aware of changes in liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients. The inclusion of other studies from outside China could confirm the pattern of elevation in liver function tests in COVID-19 patients across the globe.

Developing countries like Bangladesh, India, and others are still facing a delay in recognizing COVID-19 cases. Hence, there is a need for immediate recognition with perfect identification of infection. This clear visualization helps to save the life of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the help of traditional RT-PCR testing, the combination of medical images and deep learning classifiers delivers more hopeful results with high accuracy in the prediction and recognition of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 disease is recently researched through sample chest X-ray images, which have already proven its efficiency in lung diseases. To emphasize corona virus testing methods and to control the community spreading, the automatic detection process of COVID-19 is processed through the detailed medication reports from medical images. Although there are numerous challenges in the manual understanding of traces in COVID-19 infection from X-ray, the subtle differences among normal and infected X-rays can be traced by the data patterns of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To improve the detection performance of CNN, this paper plans to develop an Ensemble Learning with CNN-based Deep Features (EL-CNN-DF). In the initial phase, image scaling and median filtering perform the pre-processing of the chest X-ray images gathered from the benchmark source. The second phase is lung segmentation, which is the significant step for COVID detection. It is accomplished by the Adaptive Activation Function-based U-Net (AAF-U-Net). Once the lungs are segmented, it is subjected to novel EL-CNN-DF, in which the deep features are extracted from the pooling layer of CNN, and the fully connected layer of CNN are replaced with the three classifiers termed Support Vector Machine (SVM), Autoencoder, Naive Bayes (NB). The final detection of COVID-19 is done by these classifiers, in which high ranking strategy is utilized. As a modification, a Self Adaptive-Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (SA-TSA) is adopted as a boosting algorithm to enhance the performance of segmentation and detection. The overall analysis has shown that the precision of the enhanced CNN by using SA-TSA was 1.02%, 4.63%, 3.38%, 1.62%, 1.51% and 1.04% better than SVM, autoencoder, NB, Ensemble, RNN and LSTM respectively. The comparative performance analysis on existing model proves that the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms in terms of segmentation and classification of COVID-19 detection.","output":"Adaptive UNet-based Lung Segmentation and Ensemble Learning with CNN-based Deep Features for Automated COVID-19 Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hopefully most all PDJ readers, like I, have also benefited from multiple virtual learning opportunities and conferences that help keep our knowledge base up to date.

This highly localized and therefore high energy deposition can lead to enhanced cell-killing effects at absorbed doses that are non-lethal in low-LET type of exposure. Affinities of DOTA-DPhe1-Tyr3-octreotate (DOTATATE), 115In-DOTATATE, 175Lu-DOTATATE and 209Bi-DOTATATE were determined in the K562-SST2 cell line. Two other cell lines were used for radiation response assessment; BON and CA20948, with a low and high expression of somatostatin receptors, respectively. Cellular uptake kinetics of 111In-DOTATATE were determined in CA20948 cells. CA20948 and BON were irradiated with 137Cs, 177Lu-DTPA, 177Lu-DOTATATE, 213Bi-DTPA and 213Bi-DOTATATE. Absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRDcell dosimetry method for the specific binding and a Monte Carlo model of a cylindrical 6-well plate geometry for the exposure by the radioactive incubation medium. Absorbed doses were compared to conventional irradiation of cells with 137Cs and the relative biological effect (RBE) at 10% survival was calculated. RESULTS IC50 of (labelled) DOTATATE was in the nM range. Absorbed doses up to 7 Gy were obtained by 5.2 MBq 213Bi-DOTATATE, in majority the dose was caused by -particle radiation. Cellular internalization determined with 111In-DOTATATE showed a linear relation with incubation time. Cell survival after exposure of 213Bi-DTPA and 213Bi-DOTATATE to BON or CA20948 cells showed a linear-exponential relation with the absorbed dose, confirming the high LET character of 213Bi. The survival of CA20948 after exposure to 177Lu-DOTATATE and the reference 137Cs irradiation showed the typical curvature of the linear-quadratic model. 10% Cell survival of CA20948 was reached at 3 Gy with 213Bi-DOTATATE, a factor 6 lower than the 18 Gy found for 177Lu-DOTATATE and also below the 5 Gy after 137Cs external exposure.

This affected economic activities, individual and community livelihoods and wellbeing especially in rural communities in northern KwaZulu-Natal. Droughts direct and indirect impacts on public health require urgent institutional responses, especially in South Africas stride to eliminate HIV as a public health threat by 2030 in line with the UNAIDS goals. This paper draws on qualitative data from interviews and policy documents to discuss how the devastating effect of the 2015 drought experience in the rural Hlabisa sub-district of uMkhanyakude, a high HIV prevalence area, imposes an imperative for more proactive institutional responses to drought and other climate-related events capable of derailing progress made in South Africas HIV/AIDS response. We found that drought had a negative impact on individual and community livelihoods and made it more difficult for people living with HIV to consistently engage with care due to economic losses from deaths of livestock, crop failure, food insecurity, time spent in search of appropriate water sources and forced relocations. It also affected government institutions and their interventions. Interviewed participants reflections on drought-related challenges, especially those related to institutional and coordination challenges, showed that although current policy frameworks are robust, their implementation has been stalled due to complex reporting systems, and inadequate interdepartmental collaboration and information sharing. We thus argue that to address the gaps in the institutional responses, there is a need for more inclusive systems of drought-relief implementation, in which government departments, especially at the provincial and district levels, work with national institutions to better share data/information about drought-risks in order to improve preparedness and implementation of effective mitigation measures.","output":"Institutional Responses to Drought in a High HIV Prevalence Setting in Rural South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute exacerbation (AEx) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a clinically important complication of IPF that carries a high morbidity and mortality.

One population that might benefit from telehealth are individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Although FXS is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability, it is nonetheless a low incidence disorder. Individuals with FXS and their families are involved in research studies, clinical trials and receive interventions - many of which are only offered in a few locations in the United States and thus, not easily accessible to many families. The current project explored the feasibility of using telehealth procedures to collect multimodal behavioural and psychological assessment data from these families. METHODS: Participation in the current study involved online surveys, measures of physiological indices of stress, live interviews and observations of mother-child interactions conducted via distance videoconferencing using the family's own technology when possible. Across all modes of data collection, we obtained information regarding the feasibility of participating entirely via distance by documenting missing data as well as each mother's overall impression of participating via distance. RESULTS: Our telehealth procedures were successfully implemented across a wide range of technology platforms with limited difficulty, and we documented little missing data due to technology-related challenges. Perhaps most importantly, however, our sample of mothers reported high satisfaction with participating via distance.

It is then relevant to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in three hospitals in Peru in 2020, from March to May, 2020. Methods: We carried out a retrospective cohort study. The population consisted of patients from three Peruvian hospitals hospitalized for a diagnosis of COVID-19 during the March-May 2020 period. Independent sociodemographic variables, medical history, symptoms, vital functions, laboratory parameters and medical treatment were evaluated. In-hospital mortality was assessed as the outcome. We performed Cox regression models (crude and adjusted) to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Results: We analyzed 493 hospitalized adults; 72.8% (n=359) were male and the mean age was 63.3  14.4 years. COVID-19 symptoms appeared on average 7.9  4.0 days before admission to the hospital, and the mean oxygen saturation on admission was 82.6  13.8. While 67.6% (n=333) required intensive care unit admission, only 3.3% (n=16) were admitted to this unit, and 60.2% (n=297) of the sample died. In the adjusted regression analysis, it was found that being 60 years old or older (HR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.14-2.15), having two or more comorbidities (HR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.14), oxygen saturation between 85-80% (HR=2.52; 95% CI: 1.58-4.02), less than 80% (HR=4.59; 95% CI: 3.01-7.00), and being in the middle (HR=1.65; 95% CI: 1.15-2.39) and higher tertile (HR=2.18; 95% CI: 1.51-3.15) of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, increased the risk of mortality. Conclusions: The risk factors found agree with what has been described in the literature and allow the identification of vulnerable groups in whom monitoring and early identification of symptoms should be prioritized in order to reduce mortality.","output":"Risk factors for mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Peru: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Describe the sociodemographic, clinical and therapeutic aspects of the patients received for an emergency, during this period of pandemic, in a service of reference the service of odontostomatology General Hospital Grand Yoff of Dakar.

The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics over time of mortality among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Sweden, using nationwide data compiled by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Methods: Observational cohort study where all patients hospitalised in Sweden between March 1 and September 30, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity 14 days before to 5 days after admission and a discharge code for COVID-19 were included. Outcome was 60-day all-cause mortality. Patients were categorised according to month of hospital admission. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of death by month of admission, adjusting for, age, sex, comorbidities, care dependency, country of birth, healthcare region, and Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3 (patients in intensive care units;ICU). Findings: A total of 17,140 patients were included, of which 2943 died within 60 days of admission. The overall 60-day mortality was thus 17.2% (95% CI, 16.6%-17.7%), and it decreased from 24.7% (95% CI, 23.0%-26.5%) in March to 10.4% (95% CI, 8.9%-12.1%) post-wave (July-September). Adjusted relative risk (RR) of death was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.39-0.54) post-wave, using March as reference. Corresponding RR for patients not admitted to ICU and those admitted to ICU were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.42-0.59) and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.33-0.72), respectively. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19.4% (95% CI, 17.9%-21.1%) in the March cohort to 8.9% (95% CI, 7.5%-10.6%) post-wave. Interpretation: There was a gradual decline in mortality during the spring of 2020 in Swedish hospitalised COVID-19 patients, independent of baseline patient characteristics. Future research is needed to explain the reasons for this decline. The changing COVID-19 mortality should be taken into account when management and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated.

We study the impact of using RAs on investment performance during the 2020 financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic. We obtain daily portfolio and transaction data of investors on an online investment platform. Besides making investment decisions by themselves, investors can also leverage an RA system offered by the platform. We match RA users with other investors who did not use the RA with similar characteristics before the market crash, then compare their portfolio returns within four weeks after the crash. We find that RA users experienced significantly fewer losses during the market downturn. Moreover, our analyses of trading strategies show that RA users held less risky portfolios, whereas other investors stayed with their status quo and did not reduce the risk of their portfolios, which partly accounted for the performance discrepancy. During the subsequent period of market recovery, we observe that RA users were able to maintain their performance advantage. Overall, by trading adaptively to adjust the portfolio risk levels in response to market movements, the RA system mitigated losses and benefited its users. Further analyses of effect heterogeneity show that younger users or users with less investment experience benefited more from the RA, because they delegated a larger proportion of their assets to be managed by the RA.

In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors.

METHODS: Data from symptomatic adults hospitalized with COVID-19 at 86 hospitals in the US enrolled in the American Heart Associations COVID-19 CVD Registry was analyzed. The primary exposure was cancer history. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for demographics, CVD risk factors, and CVD. Interaction between history of cancer with concomitant CVD and CVD risk factors were tested. RESULTS: Among 8222 patients, 892 (10.8%) had a history of cancer and 1501 (18.3%) died. Cancer history had significant interaction with CVD risk factors of age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking history, but not underlying CVD itself.

Meals on Wheels Central Texas (MOWCTX) clients received calls in their homes or wherever they might have been when the call was received. The study included MOWCTX clients who fit their service criteria, including being homebound and expressing a need for food. A total of 296 participants were screened, of whom 240 were randomized to intervention or control. Interventions: Sixteen callers, aged 17 to 23 years, were briefly trained in empathetic conversational techniques. Each called 6 to 9 participants over 4 weeks daily for the first 5 days, after which clients could choose to drop down to fewer calls but no less than 2 calls a week. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, range 3-9; and 6-item De Jong Giervald Loneliness [De Jong] Scale, range 0-6). Secondary outcomes were depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and self-rated health (Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire). Results: The 240 participants were aged 27 to 101 years, with 63% aged at least 65 years (n = 149 of 232), 56% living alone (n = 135 of 240), 79% women (n = 190 of 240), 39% Black or African American (n = 94 of 240), and 22% Hispanic or Latino (n = 52 of 240), and all reported at least 1 chronic condition. Of 240 participants enrolled, 13 were lost to follow-up in the intervention arm and 1 in the control arm. Postassessment differences between intervention and control after 4 weeks showed an improvement of 1.1 on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (95% CI, 0.5-1.7; P < .001; Cohen d of 0.48), and improvement of 0.32 on De Jong (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.81; P = .06; Cohen d, 0.17) for loneliness; an improvement of 1.5 on the Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression (95% CI, 0.22-2.7; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.31) for depression; and an improvement of 1.8 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (95% CI, 0.44 to 3.2; P < .001; Cohen d, 0.35) for anxiety. General physical health on the Short Form Health Questionnaire Survey showed no change, but mental health improved by 2.6 (95% CI, 0.81 to 4.4; P = .003; Cohen d of 0.46). Conclusions and Relevance: A layperson-delivered, empathy-oriented telephone call program reduced loneliness, depression, and anxiety compared with the control group and improved the general mental health of participants within 4 weeks. Future research can determine whether effects on depression and anxiety can be extended to maximize clinical relevance.

Multiple surveys show that the number of Canadians willing to take the vaccine is insufficient to achieve herd immunity. Therefore, governments and health agencies are looking for solutions to increase vaccination uptake. Obtaining a better understanding of the perspective of those who are vaccine-hesitant is critical to developing successful implementation strategies for COVID-19 vaccination. OBJECTIVES: To explore COVID-19 vaccination determinants among hesitant caregivers and describe categories of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted 23 semi-structured telephone interviews with parents recruited from a tertiary pediatric care centre. Seventeen participants had previously attended a specialty clinic to discuss vaccine hesitancy; the remaining were recruited from an infectious diseases follow-up clinic. The interview guide was structured around the Theoretical Domains Framework, assessing 14 behavioural constructs to identify specific determinants that guide behaviour change. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by two independent data coders using a pragmatic inductive approach. Recurring themes were noted among subgroups of participants, who were subsequently divided into categories based on their underlying concerns. RESULTS: Five archetypes of vaccine-hesitant caregivers emerged in our data (Table 1). 1). Bubble Dwellers perceive themselves to be safe by following public health recommendations, and distinguish themselves from higher-risk groups to whom the vaccine should first be offered. 2). Worriers and Delayers identify the pandemic as a threat and are generally supportive of vaccines, but are concerned about side effects and issues surrounding vaccine development and prefer to delay vaccination. 3). Need-for-Normals are more concerned about social isolation and the economy than the direct effects of the COVID-19 virus, but express that the idea of a return to normal may sway their opinions regarding the vaccine. 4). Exceptionalists hold personal misperceptions of vaccine contraindications due to comorbidities or previous experiences with vaccination, and are concerned that the current rollout invokes a one size fits all model that does not apply to their circumstances. 5. Freedom Fighters view the pandemic as a hoax, are anti-establishment, and believe the information they have been provided is not convincing for them to adopt the vaccine. CONCLUSION: The evolving pandemic provides a unique opportunity to understand determinants of vaccination intention in the vaccine hesitant population. Our qualitative study is unique in that we were able to draw upon pre-identified vaccine hesitant individuals to explore their perspectives around COVID-19 immunization. We propose that rather than viewing these individuals as one homogenous group, policymakers and health professionals address these discrete subgroups with specific communication tools and information. We are hopeful that our results will help tailor implementation strategies that are targeted to different vaccine hesitancy archetypes, as the vaccine is made available to the general public in the coming year.

Objective: To assess how Dutch patients with cancer perceive cancer treatment and follow-up care (including experiences with telephone and video consultations [TC/VC]) and patients' well-being in comparison with a norm population during the COVID-19 crisis. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study of patients participating in the Dutch Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry and a norm population who completed a questionnaire from April to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with changes in cancer care (treatment or follow-up appointment postponed/canceled or changed to TC/VC). Differences in quality of life, anxiety/depression, and loneliness between patients and age-matched and sex-matched norm participants were evaluated with regression models. Results: The online questionnaire was completed by 4094 patients (48.6% response), of whom most were male (2493 [60.9%]) and had a mean (SD) age of 63.0 (11.1) years. Of these respondents, 886 (21.7%) patients received treatment; 2725 (55.6%) received follow-up care. Treatment or follow-up appointments were canceled for 390 (10.8%) patients, whereas 160 of 886 (18.1%) in treatment and 234 of 2725 (8.6%) in follow-up had it replaced by a TC/VC. Systemic therapy, active surveillance, or surgery were associated with cancellation of treatment or follow-up appointment. Younger age, female sex, comorbidities, metastasized cancer, being worried about getting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and receiving supportive care were associated with replacement of a consultation with a TC/VC. Patients and norm participants reported that the COVID-19 crisis made them contact their general practitioner (852 of 4068 [20.9%] and 218 of 979 [22.3%]) or medical specialist/nurse (585 of 4068 [14.4%] and 144 of 979 [14.7%]) less quickly when they had physical complaints or concerns. Most patients who had a TC/VC preferred a face-to-face consultation, but 151 of 394 (38.3%) were willing to use a TC/VC again. Patients with cancer were more worried about getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with the 977 norm participants (917 of 4094 [22.4%] vs 175 of 977 [17.9%]). Quality of life, anxiety, and depression were comparable, but norm participants more often reported loneliness (114 of 977 [11.7%] vs 287 of 4094 [7.0%]) than patients with cancer (P = .009). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with cancer in the Netherlands, 1 in 3 reported changes in cancer care in the first weeks of the COVID-19 crisis. Long-term outcomes need to be monitored. The crisis may affect the mental well-being of the general population relatively more than that of patients with cancer.","output":"Perceived Care and Well-being of Patients With Cancer and Matched Norm Participants in the COVID-19 Crisis: Results of a Survey of Participants in the Dutch PROFILES Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The human G-leukocyte antigen (HLA-G) molecule is a non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule.

The detection of COVID-19 has become a crucial task in the medical sector because of the soaring cases and the paucity of pharmaceutical supplies for detection. Considering the urgency, an immediate auxiliary automatic detection system is required for early diagnosis of the disease and helps the affected patients to be under immediate care. In this work, we aimed to propose an automatic detection system based on lung X-ray images, as radiography modalities is a promising way of faster diagnosis. In this work, we built a machine learning model considering X-ray images taken from publicly available data sets of 2000 images. The relevant features from the images were taken for building the model, prior that proper segmentation was applied to the X-ray images. The X-ray images are prone to noise and spatial aliasing which leads the boundary to be indistinguishable, so proper image segmentation is required Comprehensive validation has been performed on different segmentation techniques, among those, Sobel demonstrated an accurate result, which is not only effective in detecting edges but also good in removing noises within the image. Further, the preprocessed image is fed to a support vector machine (SVM) model, which accomplished the maximum classification accuracy of 99.17%, also SVM achieved precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.24%, 98.13%, 98.68% respectively in predicting the COVID-19 versus other pulmonary diseases.

Proponents of intermuscular surgical approaches believe that the direct-anterior approach may restore physical function more quickly than transgluteal approaches, perhaps because of diminished muscle trauma. To evaluate this, we compared patient-reported physical function and other outcome metrics during the first year after surgery between groups of patients who underwent primary THA either through the direct-anterior approach or posterior approach. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We asked: (1) Is a primary THA using a direct-anterior approach associated with better patient-reported physical function at early postoperative times (1 and 3 months) compared with a THA performed through the posterior approach? (2) Is the direct-anterior approach THA associated with shorter operative times and higher rates of noninstitutional discharge than a posterior approach THA? METHODS Between October 2008 and February 2010, an arthroplasty fellowship-trained surgeon performed 135 THAs. All 135 were performed using the posterior approach. During that period, we used this approach when patients had any moderate to severe degenerative joint disease of the hip attributable to any type of arthritis refractory to nonoperative treatment measures. Of the patients who were treated with this approach, 21 (17%; 23 hips) were lost to followup, whereas 109 (83%; 112 hips) were available for followup at 1 year. Between February and September 2011, the same surgeon performed 86 THAs. All 86 were performed using the direct-anterior approach. During that period, we used this approach when patients with all types of moderate to severe degenerative joint disease had nonoperative treatment measures fail. Of the patients who were treated with this approach, 35 (41%; 35 hips) were lost to followup, whereas 51 (59%; 51 hips) were available for followup at 1 year. THAs during the surgeon's direct-anterior approach learning period (February 2010 through January 2011) were excluded because both approaches were being used selectively depending on patient characteristics. Clinical outcomes included operative blood loss; allogeneic transfusion; adverse events; patient-reported Veterans RAND-12 Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores, and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scores at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Resource utilization outcomes included operative time, length of stay, and discharge disposition (home versus institution). Outcomes were compared using logistic and linear regression techniques. RESULTS After controlling for relevant confounding variables including age, sex, and BMI, the direct-anterior approach was associated with worse adjusted MCS changes 1 and 3 months after surgery (1-month score change, -9; 95% CI, -13 to -5; standard error, 2), compared with the posterior approach (3-month score change, -9; 95% CI, -14 to -3; standard error, 3) (both p < 0.001), while the direct-anterior approach was associated with greater PCS improvement at 3 months compared with the posterior approach (score change, 6; 95% CI, 2-10; standard error, 2; p = 0.008). There were no differences in adjusted PCS at either 1 month or 12 months, and no clinically important differences in UCLA scores. Although the PCS score differences are greater than the minimum clinically important difference of 5 points for this endpoint, the clinical importance of such a small effect is questionable. At 1 year after THA, there were no intergroup differences in self-reported physical function, although both groups had significant loss-to-followup at that time. Operative time (skin incision to skin closure) between the two groups did not differ (81 versus 79 minutes; p = 0.411). Mean surgical blood loss (403 versus 293 mL; p < 0.001; adjusted, 119 more mL; 95% CI, 79-160; p < 0.001) and in-hospital transfusion rates (direct-anterior approach, 20% [17/86] versus posterior approach, 10% [14/135], p = 0.050; adjusted odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.3-10.1; p = 0.016) were higher in the direct-anterior approach group. With the numbers available, there was no difference in the frequency of adverse events between groups when comparing intraoperative complications, perioperative Technical Expert Panel complications, and other non-Technical Expert Panel complications within 1 year of surgery, although this study was not adequately powered to detect differences in rare adverse events. CONCLUSIONS With suitable experience, the direct-anterior approach can be performed with expected results similar to those of the posterior approach. There may be transient and small benefits to the direct-anterior approach, including improved physical function at 3 months after surgery. However, the greater operative blood loss and greater likelihood of blood transfusions, even when the surgeon is experienced, may be a disadvantage. Given some of the kinds of bias present that we found, including loss to followup, the conclusions we present should be considered preliminary, but it appears that any benefits that accrue to the patients who had the direct-anterior approach would be transient and modest. Prospective randomized studies on the topic are needed to address the differences between surgical approaches more definitively.

Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short web based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed. At the time of the survey, over 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken as well as treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","output":"Flash Survey on SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Pediatric Patients on anti-Cancer Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ability to estimate protein-protein binding free energy in a computationally efficient via a physics-based approach is beneficial to research focused on the mechanism of viruses binding to their target proteins. Implicit solvation methodology may be particularly useful in the early stages of such research, as it can offer valuable insights into the binding process, quickly. Here we evaluate the potential of the related molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGB/SA) approach to estimate the binding free energy G(bind) between the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain and the human ACE2 receptor. The calculations are based on a recent flavor of the generalized Born model, GBNSR6. Two estimates of G(bind) are performed: one based on standard bondi radii, and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. We take the average of the resulting two G(bind) values as the consensus estimate. For the well-studied Ras-Raf protein-protein complex, which has similar binding free energy to that of the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex, the consensus G(bind) = ?11.8  1 kcal/mol, vs. experimental ?9.7  0.2 kcal/mol. The consensus estimates for the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 complex is G(bind) = ?9.4  1.5 kcal/mol, which is in near quantitative agreement with experiment (?10.6 kcal/mol). The availability of a conceptually simple MMGB/SA-based protocol for analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 /ACE2 binding may be beneficial in light of the need to move forward fast.","output":"MMGB/SA Consensus Estimate of the Binding Free Energy Between the Novel Coronavirus Spike Protein to the Human ACE2 Receptor."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has upended education systems.

OBJECTIVE: Following user-centered design, we explored the essential priorities and preferences of kidney transplant recipients and healthcare providers (HCP) to inform development of a smartphone app to improve immunosuppression adherence and communication. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive research design was used. SETTING: The University of Alberta Hospital adult kidney transplant program in Edmonton, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited by convenience sampling and included 32 kidney transplant recipients and 11 HCPs. METHODS: Seven focus groups (5 with recipients and 2 with HCPs) were conducted to inform app development. Sessions were recorded, and transcripts were coded to elucidate themes. RESULTS: App development to improve adherence was not a priority for HCP. Recipients prioritized choice: that all features be optional. Recipients preferred support while traveling; access to laboratory results; and use by younger or newly transplanted recipients. Both recipients and HCP preferred linkage to pharmacy; and self-management and accountability. For the app to improve communication, HCPs believed the priorities to be addressed included: clarity on scope of app; legal, ethical, and professional obligations; and charting. Both recipients and HCP prioritized HCP workload, and broader medication and health concerns. Healthcare providers preferred tech support; both recipients and HCPs preferred app access for nontransplant HCP. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include underrepresentation of physicians, recipients with racial/ethnic diversity, and potential selection bias of transplant recipients who perceived themselves to be adhering to immunosuppression medications. CONCLUSION: Future research is needed for the app to become a comprehensive, secure platform for broader communication between recipients and HCP, pharmacies, and nontransplant clinicians while streamlining HCP workload.","output":"Designing an App for Immunosuppression Adherence and Communication: A Qualitative Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How hospitals, Intensive Care Units and nursing care of critically ill patients have changed during the COVID-19 outbreak?

Methadone, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity. SETTING A large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centres and outpatient clinics. PARTICIPANTS 38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded after prescription of antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011.

COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19-related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis.

This technique is reported to be difficult when large fibroids are involved because of excessive blood loss during surgery. Skillful and fast suturing appears to be associated with reduced blood loss during LM. In this study we compared the surgical outcomes of using bidirectional Stratafix? barbed suture versus conventional suture during LM. METHODS This retrospective study included all patients who underwent LM for the treatment of intramural myoma in our institution between 2015 and 2020. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the technique of suturing during LM: Group 1 comprised patients in whom Stratafix? barbed suture was used (n = 29), and group 2 comprised those in whom conventional suture was used (n = 15). Data of patient age, myoma size, the number of myoma nodes, hemoglobin levels, total operation time, total suturing time, and blood loss during surgery were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS No significant differences in age (p = 0.463) or myoma size (P = 0.373) were observed between the 2 groups. Operation time (P = 0.0104), suturing time (P = 0.007), and blood loss (P = 0.0375) during surgery were significantly less with Stratafix? barbed suture than with conventional suture. No patient required intraoperative transfusion or conversion to laparotomy. CONCLUSION The use of bidirectional barbed suture reduces operation time, suturing time, and blood loss. As these new sutures have barbs, no knot-tying is required; thus, continuous suturing becomes very simple and maintaining hemostasis is easy. Unskilled gynecological surgeons who apply this suture technique can also perform LM easily. As the bidirectional barbed suture has multiple points of fixation, this suture technique can reapproximate tissue securely, which reduces the chances of reoperation because of proper suture knotting. Therefore, bidirectional Stratafix? barbed sutures could be an optimal and efficient alternative to conventional sutures for use by gynecological surgeons in Japan.","output":"Comparison between bidirectional Stratafix? barbed suture and conventional suture in laparoscopic myomectomy: a retrospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Chapter 2 we introduced vaccine efficacy parameters that require conditioning on exposure to infection. Household studies were used as the basis for defining exposure to infection in vaccine studies as early as the 1930s in evaluating the efficacy of pertussis vaccines (Kendrick and Eldering 1939). In addition to evaluating vaccine efficacy, household studies have been used to learn about transmission and natural history of many infections. Aspects of the natural history studied in households include the transmissibility, the incubation and latent periods, the duration of infectiousness, and the serial interval between cases (Hope-Simpson 1952; Bailey 1957). Household studies have also been used to evaluate other interventions, such as post-exposure prophylaxis with influenza antiviral agents (Welliver et al 2001; Hayden et al 2004). Exposure to an infectious case within a household can be used as a natural challenge study, for example, when studying immunological correlates of protection (Storsaeter et al 1998). Longitudinal studies of pneumococcal carriage in households and schools have been used to estimate the acquisition and clearance rates for asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage. The general idea of a transmission unit is that individuals make contact sufficient for transmission within it. Households are the most common form of transmission unit used in studies. It allows easy identification of contacts between a case and susceptibles, and families are convenient units of study. Many other settings are also used as transmission units in studies and analyses that condition on exposure to infection. These include sexual partnerships, classrooms, schools, school buses, airplanes, day care centers, and workplaces, among others.

The simulation tool is used to assess the effects of various interventions, assuming parameters that reflect the situation in Austria as an example. RESULTS: Strict contact reduction including isolation of infected persons in quarantine wards and at home can substantially delay the peak of the epidemic. Home isolation of infected individuals effectively reduces the height of the peak.

METHODS Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy was performed using the superDimension software system. Once the targeted lesion was within reach, multiple tissue samples were obtained. Statistical analysis was used to correlate the yield with the type of sedation among other factors. A successful procedure was defined if a diagnosis was made or a fiducial marker was adequately placed. RESULTS Navigational bronchoscopy was performed on a total of 120 targeted lesions. The overall complication rate of the procedure was 4.1%. The diagnostic yield and success of the procedure was 74% and 87%, respectively. Duration of the procedure was the only significant difference between the general anesthesia and IV sedation groups (mean, 58 vs. 43 min, P=0.0005). A larger tumor size was associated with a higher diagnostic yield (P=0.032).

Now, numbers have increased, and it has been reintroduced to many places in China, Japan, and Korea. In the breeding season, the crested ibis has high food needs (fish, freshwater invertebrate, etc.) to feed nestlings, and it prefers areas with rice paddies and waterbodies near to trees for nesting. We compared nest site preference from 1981 to 2019, and found that nest sites moved closer to houses of local farmers. In the 1980s, crested ibises only lived in remote mountain areas, where the farmers were too poor to afford pesticide and fertilizer, and consequently rice paddies contained substantial fish populations. In the meantime, the massive use of pesticides in more populated areas had caused the collapse of fish populations. A pesticide ban was enforced from 1981 on, when the crested ibis was rediscovered, and the freshwater biodiversity gradually recovered. The crested ibis returned to lower and more populated areas containing their ancestral habitats with large areas of wetlands. ABSTRACT: The number of breeding pairs of crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Hanzhong, China has recovered remarkably from 2 to 511 from 1981 to 2019. Although the crested ibis has been closely monitored, the habitat preference of the bird has not been well studied despite the extensive increase in abundance. We used nest site data from the past 39 years and 30 environmental variables to develop species distribution models for each year. We applied random forest to select important environmental variables, and used logistic regressions to quantify the changes in habitat preferences in 39 years, taking into account the effects of interaction and quadratic terms. We found that six variables had strong impacts on nest site selection. The interaction term of rice paddies and waterbodies, and the quadratic term of precipitation of the wettest quarter of the year were the most important correlates of nest presence. Human impact at nest sites changed from low to high as birds increased their use of ancestral habitats with abundant rice paddies. We concluded that during the population recovery, the crested ibises retained their dependence on wetlands, yet moved from remote areas to populated rural regions where food resources had recovered due to the ban of pesticide use.","output":"Changes in the Habitat Preference of Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) during a Period of Rapid Population Increase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Data about the effects of COVID-19 on the endocrine system are increasing, but COVID-19-associated thyroid dysfunctions are not known clearly.

By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched micellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low salt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are linear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 a Tdiff0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 a Tdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in branched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of differentiating various types of micellar microstructures. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing the existing restricted diffusion models and are shown to be much slower than the diffusion of proton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second viscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination of micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.","output":"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Diffusometry of Linear and Branched Wormlike Micelles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India currently faces a security dilemma specifically because of the rise of China, Russias strategic convergence with China, and the USs indeterminate Indo-Pacific policy stance.

While eight IL-21R-deficient patients have been reported previously, the natural course, immune characteristics of disease, and response to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remain to be comprehensively examined. In our study, we have collected clinical histories of 13 patients with IL-21R deficiency from eight families across seven centers worldwide, including five novel patients identified by exome or NGS panel sequencing. Eight unique mutations in IL21R were identified in these patients, including two novel mutations. Median age at disease onset was 2.5 years (0.5C7 years). The main clinical manifestations were recurrent bacterial (84.6%), fungal (46.2%), and viral (38.5%) infections; cryptosporidiosis-associated cholangitis (46.2%); and asthma (23.1%). Inflammatory skin diseases (15.3%) and recurrent anaphylaxis (7.9%) constitute novel phenotypes of this combined immunodeficiency. Most patients exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced proportions of memory B cells, circulating T follicular helper cells, MAIT cells and terminally differentiated NK cells. However, IgE levels were elevated in 50% of IL-21R-deficient patients. Overall survival following HSCT (6 patients, mean follow-up 1.8 year) was 33.3%, with pre-existing organ damage constituting a negative prognostic factor. Mortality of non-transplanted patients (n = 7) was 57.1%.

To do this we outline why a regimen simultaneously using many different drugs will be needed. At our current state of knowledge, even adding two or three drugs will not counter all the growth attributes of a currently incurable cancer. We show in this paper, the details of how an example six drug regimen, when added alongside of current traditional treatments, might inhibit enough of the eight core growth driving elements to allow those standard treatments to be more effective. We further show how medicines from general medical practice used to treat pain, fungal infections, psychosis, leprosy and other non-cancer related illnesses can be repurposed to block cancer cells survival pathways and growth drives. ABSTRACT: In part one of this two-part paper, we present eight principles that we believe must be considered for more effective treatment of the currently incurable cancers. These are addressed by multidrug adjunctive cancer treatment (MDACT), which uses multiple repurposed non-oncology drugs, not primarily to kill malignant cells, but rather to reduce the malignant cells growth drives. Previous multidrug regimens have used MDACT principles, e.g., the CUSP9v3 glioblastoma treatment. MDACT is an amalgam of (1) the principle that to be effective in stopping a chain of events leading to an undesired outcome, one must break more than one link; (2) the principle of Palmer et al. of achieving fractional cancer cell killing via multiple drugs with independent mechanisms of action; (3) the principle of shaping versus decisive operations, both being required for successful cancer treatment; (4) an idea adapted from Chow et al., of using multiple cytotoxic medicines at low doses; (5) the idea behind CUSP9v3, using many non-oncology CNS-penetrant drugs from general medical practice, repurposed to block tumor survival paths; (6) the concept from chess that every move creates weaknesses and strengths; (7) the principle of massby adding force to a given effort, the chances of achieving the goal increase; and (8) the principle of blocking parallel signaling pathways. Part two gives an example MDACT regimen, gMDACT, which uses six repurposed drugscelecoxib, dapsone, disulfiram, itraconazole, pyrimethamine, and telmisartanto interfere with growth-driving elements common to cholangiocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer. gMDACT is another example ofnot a replacement forprevious multidrug regimens already in clinical use, such as CUSP9v3.

The release of unique, latent-phase antigens are known to have a protective role in the immune response against Mtb. Although the BCG vaccine has been administered for nine decades to provide immunity against Mtb, the number of TB cases continues to rise, thereby raising doubts on BCG vaccine efficacy. The shortcomings of BCG have been associated with inadequate processing and presentation of its antigens, an inability to optimally activate T cells against Mtb, and generation of regulatory T cells. Furthermore, BCG vaccination lacks the ability to eliminate latent Mtb infection. With these facts in mind, we selected six immunodominant CD4 and CD8 T cell epitopes of Mtb expressed during latent, acute, and chronic stages of infection and engineered a multi-epitope-based DNA vaccine (C6). RESULT: BALB/c mice vaccinated with the C6 construct along with a BCG vaccine exhibited an expansion of both CD4 and CD8 T cell memory populations and augmented IFN- and TNF- cytokine release. Furthermore, enhancement of dendritic cell and macrophage activation was noted. Consequently, illustrating the elicitation of immunity that helps in the protection against Mtb infection; which was evident by a significant reduction in the Mtb burden in the lungs and spleen of C6 + BCG administered animals.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that olfactory dysfunction is also one of the earlier symptoms of COVID-19 but objective measures supporting this notion are currently missing. To determine whether olfactory dysfunction is an early sign of COVID-19, we assessed available longitudinal data from a web-based interface enabling individuals to test their sense of smell by rating the intensity of selected household odors. Individuals continuously used the interface to assess their olfactory functions and at each login, in addition to odor ratings, recorded their symptoms and result from potential COVID-19 test. A total of 205 COVID-19 positive individuals and 156 pseudo-randomly matched control individuals lacking positive test provided longitudinal data which enabled us to assess olfactory functions in relation to their test results date. We found that odor intensity ratings started to decline in the COVID-19 group as early as 6 days prior to test result date. Symptoms such as sore throat, aches, and runny nose appear around the same point in time; however, with a lower predictability of a COVID-19 diagnose.

It is imperative, then, to develop methods to actively assess where quarantine measures such as social distancing may be deficient and suppress those potential resurgence nodes as early as possible. OBJECTIVE: We ask if social media is an early indicator of public social distancing measures in the United States by investigating its correlation with the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) as compared to social mobility estimates reported from Google and Apple Maps. METHODS: In this observational study, the estimated R(t) was obtained for the period between March 5 and April 5, 2020, using the EpiEstim package. Social media activity was assessed using queries of social distancing or #socialdistancing on Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter, with social mobility assessed using Apple and Google Maps data. Cross-correlations were performed between R(t) and social media activity or mobility for the United States. We used Pearson correlations and the coefficient of determination () with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Negative correlations were found between Google search interest for social distancing and R(t) in the United States (P<.001), and between search interest and state-specific R(t) for 9 states with the highest COVID-19 cases (P<.001); most states experienced a delay varying between 3-8 days before reaching significance. A negative correlation was seen at a 4-day delay from the start of the Instagram hashtag #socialdistancing and at 6 days for Twitter (P<.001). Significant correlations between R(t) and social media manifest earlier in time compared to social mobility measures from Google and Apple Maps, with peaks at C6 and C4 days. Meanwhile, changes in social mobility correlated best with R(t) at C2 days and +1 day for workplace and grocery/pharmacy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the potential use of Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter as epidemiological tools in the assessment of social distancing measures in the United States during the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their correlation and earlier rise and peak in correlative strength with R(t) when compared to social mobility may provide proactive insight into whether social distancing efforts are sufficiently enacted. Whether this proves valuable in the creation of more accurate assessments of the early epidemic course is uncertain due to limitations. These limitations include the use of a biased sample that is internet literate with internet access, which may covary with socioeconomic status, education, geography, and age, and the use of subtotal social media mentions of social distancing.

We define initial conflicts to be special so-called symbolic transformation pairs, and show that they are minimally complete (and in the case of graphs also finite) in this symbolic way. We show that initial conflicts represent a proper subset of critical pairs again. We moreover demonstrate that (analogous to the case of rules without ACs) for each conflict a unique initial conflict exists representing it. We conclude with presenting a sufficient condition illustrating important special cases for rules with ACs, where we do not only have initial conflicts being complete in a symbolic way, but also find complete (and in the case of graphs also finite) subsets of conflicts in the classical sense.","output":"Initial Conflicts for Transformation Rules with Nested Application Conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely serious infection with an extremely high death rate worldwide. In March, the disease was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until now, there is no known vaccine or drug, since the unknown things related to the disease are more important than our theoretical and empirical knowledge. However, mathematical modeling and the estimation of the basic number of reproductions can provide clarifications in order to determine the potential and severity of this epidemic and therefore provide essential information to identify the type of measures and interventions to be taken to control the intensity of the spread of the disease. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new deterministic compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, the epidemiological state of the individuals and the intervention for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, there recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to the considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease if the number of reproduction R(0) was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemics differential equations. It should be mentioned that, the error between the considered model and the official data curve is quite small.","output":"Novel Corona virus Disease infection in Tunisia: Mathematical model and the impact of the quarantine strategy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The detection of other pathogens in hospitalized coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients are reported to be infrequent.

We also assessed sociodemographic differences associated with increased economic insecurity among women and transgender/nonbinary adults since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: An online, cross-sectional survey was administered to a general population sample of women and transgender individuals in one Midwestern state (N = 1,169). Results: IPV victimization during stay-at-home orders was associated with approximately three times higher odds of housing insecurity (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.06, p < .001) and increased health care insecurity (AOR = 2.95, p < .001) than those without victimization during stay-at-home orders, even after adjusting for IPV immediately prior to the pandemic. Multiracial, pregnant, and sexual minority (defined as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, or other sexual orientation [LGBQ +]) women and transgender/nonbinary individuals were at elevated risk for specific forms of increased insecurity. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for continued COVID-19 legislation that enhances housing and rental support for populations most in need of safe and stable housing, particularly survivors of IPV. Reduced access to health care limits IPV opportunities for intervention and treatment. Expanding accessible and affordable health care options during the COVID-19 pandemic can enhance the safety and well-being of survivors and increase opportunities for providers to screen for IPV.

The spike glycoprotein plays an important role in the viral infection process by recognizing and binding to the ACE2 receptor in host's cells. Due to the importance of this protein, current research efforts are focused on mutations that impact viral infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 viruses with a spike mutation at position 614 were recently shown to be more infectious than their wild-type ancestor. The D614G substitution eliminates a hydrogen bond with a threonine residue (T859) in an adjacent protein chain, allowing the spike protein to assume more readily an open conformation. Since the open conformation mediates attachment to the ACE2 receptor, the D614G mutant causes higher infectivity than the wild-type spike protein. The main goal of this research was to create physical 3D printed models of the wild-type and mutant spike proteins to visualize the molecular changes caused by the D614G mutation. Structural analyses of the wild-type and the D614G spike mutant were performed using the Protein Data Bank files, 6vxx and 6xs6. To visualize the conformational changes caused by the D614G mutation, the protein structure alignments were performed using Pymol. A combined file containing the superimposed structures was imported into Jmol to create the scripts for model construction and 3D printing. A small protein model was built to describe the overall structure of the spike and the location of the amino acids linked to higher viral infectivity. An additional detailed model was constructed to illustrate the biochemical interactions at the mutation site. In this model, important amino acids such as Asp614, Ala647, and Thr859 are highlighted due to their role in hydrogen bonding and spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. A magnetic piece was created to show the effects of the aspartic acid to glycine mutation at position 614. A Jmol tutorial was designed to complement the 3D models and assess students? learning of the structure and function of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This exercise will allow undergraduate students and faculty to visualize and better understand how single amino acid mutations can lead to changes in viral infectivity.","output":"3D Physical Models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein: Exploring the Impact of the D614G Mutation on Viral Infectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Failure to find and attract clinical trial participants remains a persistent barrier to clinical research. Researchers increasingly complement recruitment methods with social mediaCbased methods. We hypothesized that user-generated data from cancer survivors and their family members and friends on the social network Twitter could be used to identify, engage, and recruit cancer survivors for cancer trials. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aims to examine the feasibility of using user-reported health data from cancer survivors and family members and friends on Twitter in Los Angeles (LA) County to enhance clinical trial recruitment. We focus on 6 cancer conditions (breast cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma, lung cancer, and prostate cancer). METHODS: The social media intervention involved monitoring cancer-specific posts about the 6 cancer conditions by Twitter users in LA County to identify cancer survivors and their family members and friends and contacting eligible Twitter users with information about open cancer trials at the University of Southern California (USC) Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. We reviewed both retrospective and prospective data published by Twitter users in LA County between July 28, 2017, and November 29, 2018. The study enrolled 124 open clinical trials at USC Norris. We used descriptive statistics to report the proportion of Twitter users who were identified, engaged, and enrolled. RESULTS: We analyzed 107,424 Twitter posts in English by 25,032 unique Twitter users in LA County for the 6 cancer conditions. We identified and contacted 1.73% (434/25,032) of eligible Twitter users (127/434, 29.3% cancer survivors; 305/434, 70.3% family members and friends; and 2/434, 0.5% Twitter users were excluded). Of them, 51.4% (223/434) were female and approximately one-third were male. About one-fifth were people of color, whereas most of them were White. Approximately one-fifth (85/434, 19.6%) engaged with the outreach messages (cancer survivors: 33/85, 38% and family members and friends: 52/85, 61%). Of those who engaged with the messages, one-fourth were male, the majority were female, and approximately one-fifth were people of color, whereas the majority were White. Approximately 12% (10/85) of the contacted users requested more information and 40% (4/10) set up a prescreening. Two eligible candidates were transferred to USC Norris for further screening, but neither was enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the potential of identifying and engaging cancer survivors and their family members and friends on Twitter. Optimization of downstream recruitment efforts such as screening for digital populations on social media may be required. Future research could test the feasibility of the approach for other diseases, locations, languages, social media platforms, and types of research involvement (eg, survey research).

Here, we use replication-deficient murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudoviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV Spike (S) protein on their surface. These surrogates of native coronavirus counterparts serve as a model to analyze the S-mediated entry into target cells.

The primary outcome was abundant microaspiration of gastric contents, defined by the presence of pepsin at significant level in >30% of tracheal aspirates. Quantitative measurement of pepsin and salivary amylase was performed in all tracheal aspirates during the 48 h following enrollment. RESULTS A total of 326 patients were enrolled in the ten participating ICUs (162 in the PVC tapered-cuff group and 164 in the standard-cuff group). Patient characteristics were similar in the two study groups. The proportion of patients with abundant microaspiration of gastric contents was 53.5% in the tapered-cuff and 51.0% in the standard-cuff group (odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.72-1.82). While abundant microaspiration of oropharyngeal secretions was not significantly different (77.4 vs 68.6%, p = 0.095), the proportion of patients with tracheobronchial colonization was significantly lower (29.6 vs 43.3%, p = 0.01) in the tapered-cuff than in the standard-cuff group. No significant difference between the two groups was found for other secondary outcomes, including ventilator-associated events and VAP. CONCLUSIONS This trial showed no significant impact of tapered-cuff tracheal tubes on abundant microaspiration of gastric contents.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in health care and hospital workers (HCHWs) and assess how antibody levels change over time. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of employed HCHWs at a freestanding, urban pediatric tertiary care hospital. Employed HCHWs &#8805;18 years old who were asymptomatic and worked in clinical hospital locations were eligible to participate. Participants completed blood draws and surveys at baseline (between May 4, 2020, and June 2, 2020) and 2 months later (between July 6, 2020, and August 7, 2020). Surveys collected demographic information, SARS-CoV-2 exposures, and previous COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 530 participants enrolled in and completed baseline study activities. The median age was 37 years (range 19-67 years); 86% identified as female, and 80% identified as white. Two months later, 481 (91%) HCHWs completed another survey and blood draw. Four of 5 (0.9%) seropositive subjects at baseline remained seropositive at 2 months, although 3 had decreasing IgG indices. Five (1.0%) seropositive individuals, including 4 who were previously seropositive and 1 newly seropositive, were detected 2 months later. History of positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing results (P < .001) and history of COVID-19 exposure (P < .001) were associated with presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 1% of HCHWs in an urban pediatric hospital in a city with moderate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Participants with a known previous COVID-19 diagnosis showed a decline or loss of IgG antibodies over 2 months. These results have implications for identifying those with previous exposure and for ongoing public health recommendations for ensuring workplace safety.","output":"Prevalence of Health Care and Hospital Worker SARS-CoV-2 IgG Antibody in a Pediatric Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate the prevalence, experience and management of fatigue in adult survivors of critical illness. Data sources An electronic search was performed on seven databases: CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Emcare, British Nursing Index, and Web of Science. Study selection and data extraction Seventy-six peer-reviewed, English language studies that investigated fatigue or vitality in adult patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and followed up for any period were included. Extracted data were split into three datasets for analysis: data from vitality domain of SF-36 (dataset A), other quantitative data (dataset B), and qualitative data (dataset C). Methodological quality was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme (CASP) tools. Data synthesis We adopted a segregated approach to mixed-methods synthesis. We merged all datasets, attributing all results to one of four qualitative themes. These were prevalence and severity, contributing factors, impacts on quality of life, assessment and management. Results The prevalence of fatigue ranged from 13.8 to 80.9 %. Fatigue severity reached its nadir at approximately one month post ICU discharge, improved over time but seldom reached reference population scores. Various biological, disease related and psychological factors associated with fatigue were identified including age, poor pre-morbid status and sleep disturbance. No critical illness specific tool to assess fatigue in ICU survivors was identified. A paucity of evidence based interventions for management of fatigue in ICU survivors were identified despite fatigue negatively impacting on survivors quality of life. Conclusions This mixed method review shows that fatigue is highly prevalent in ICU survivors, negatively impacting their recovery. To date, no ICU specific fatigue assessment tool or targeted intervention has been designed to manage this symptom. Our review has identified factors, which may increase or mitigate against fatigue, along with potential management strategies, which should be used to inform future research and practice.","output":"Prevalence and experience of fatigue in survivors of critical illness: A mixed-methods systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating ectopic pregnancy have reported many different outcomes, which are themselves often defined and measured in distinct ways. This level of variation results in an inability to compare results of individual RCTs. The development of a core outcome set to ensure outcomes important to key stakeholders are collected consistently will guide future research in ectopic pregnancy. STUDY AIM: To develop and implement a core outcome set to guide future research in ectopic pregnancy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We have established an international steering group of key stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals with lived experience of ectopic pregnancy. We will identify potential outcomes from ectopic pregnancy from a comprehensive literature review of published randomised controlled trials. We will then utilise a modified Delphi method to prioritise outcomes. Subsequently, key stakeholders will be invited to score potential core outcomes on a nine-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not important) to 9 (critical). Repeated reflection and rescoring should promote whole and individual stakeholder group convergence towards consensus core outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To describe lung US imaging findings and aeration score of 34 children with COVID-19. METHODS: This study included 0C16-year-old patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted between April 19 and June 18, 2020 in two hospitals in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Lung US was performed as part of the routine evaluation by a skilled Pediatric Emergency physician. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and severity classifications were done according to an available clinical definition. The lung US findings were described for each lung field and a validated ultrasound lung aeration score was calculated. Data obtained was correlated with clinical information and other imaging modalities available for each case. RESULTS: Thirty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients had a lung US performed during this period. Eighteen (18/34) had abnormalities on the lung US, but eight of them (8/18) had a normal chest radiograph. Ultrasound lung aeration score medians for severe/critical, moderate, and mild disease were 17.5 (2C30), 4 (range 0C14), 0 (range 0C15), respectively (p = 0.001). Twelve patients (12/34) also had a chest computed tomography (CT) performed; both the findings and topography of lung compromise on the CT were consistent with the information obtained by lung US.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through a virtual survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used. To evaluate associated factors, prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance. Results: A total of 284 surveys were analysed (48.2% women; median age 22 years). Rates of (at least moderate) depression, anxiety and stress were 24.3%, 28.5% and 13.0%, respectively. Adjusted analyses found that having completed fewer years of study, being Catholic and having a chronic disease were associated with a higher rate of anxiety, while being of a younger age was associated with a higher rate of stress. The students reported mostly decreased physical activity, as well as increased Internet and social media use, hours of sleep, hours spent in front of a screen, food intake, and weight, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: In the context of the pandemic, despite the changes in habits described, rates of depression, anxiety and stress were lower than in previous studies in students in the health sciences. The higher rate of anxiety was associated with being in an earlier academic year, Catholicism and chronic diseases, while the higher rate of stress was associated with being of a younger age.","output":"Depresin, estrs y ansiedad en estudiantes de Medicina humana de Ayacucho (Per) en el contexto de la pandemia por COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is a novel beta coronavirus emerged in China in 2019.

We sought to evaluate the effect of SC on reducing attack rate and the need for critical care during COVID-19 outbreaks, while considering scenarios with concurrent implementation of self-isolation (SI) of symptomatic cases. METHODS: We developed an age-structured agent-based simulation model and parameterized it with the demographics of Ontario stratified by age and the latest estimates of COVID-19 epidemiologic characteristics. Disease transmission was simulated within and between different age groups by considering inter- and intra-group contact patterns. The effect of SC of varying durations on the overall attack rate, magnitude and peak time of the outbreak, and requirement for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in the population was estimated. Secondly, the effect of concurrent community-based voluntary SI of symptomatic COVID-19 cases was assessed. RESULTS: SC reduced attack rates in the range of 7.2-12.7% when the duration of SC increased from 3 to 16 weeks, when contacts among school children were restricted by 60-80%, and in the absence of SI by mildly symptomatic persons. Depending on the scenario, the overall reduction in ICU admissions attributed to SC throughout the outbreak ranged from 3.3 to 6.7%. When SI of mildly symptomatic persons was included and practiced by 20%, the reduction of attack rate and ICU admissions exceeded 6.3% and 9.1% (on average), respectively, in the corresponding scenarios. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that SC may have limited impact on reducing the burden of COVID-19 without measures to interrupt the chain of transmission during both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-method study of survey and interview data. We performed 40 baseline interviews and surveys in spring 2019 and 36 follow-up surveys and ten interviews one year later. We compared pre- and post-Likert scale responses of provider views on the importance of different aspects of standard medication abortion assessment and evaluation (e.g., related to ultrasounds and blood-typing). We performed content analysis of the follow-up interviews using deductive-inductive analysis. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that clinics substantially changed their medication abortion protocols in response to COVID-19, with more than half increasing their gestational age limits and introducing telemedicine for follow-up of a medication abortion. Interview analysis suggested that physicians were more supportive of self-sourced medication abortion in response to changing clinic protocols that decreased in-clinic assessment and evaluation for medication abortion, and as a result of physicians' altered assessments of risk in the context of COVID-19. Having evidence already in place that supported these practice changes made the implementation of new protocols more efficient, while working in a state with restrictive abortion policies thwarted the flexibility of clinics to adapt to changes in standards of care. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical assessment of risk and has shifted practice towards a less medicalized model.

This study explores the health and safety issues facing delivery riders in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, during the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular during the second lockdown (MayCOctober 2021). METHOD: A web-based survey of more than 800 riders was conducted in AugustCSeptember 2021. Following descriptive statistics, four logit models were fitted to examine the factors associated with (a) sanitizing ones hands, (b) using a face shield, (c) contracting a new health issue, and (d) engaging in riskier traffic behaviors during the lockdown. RESULTS: The riders who were less consistent in adopting health and safety measures tended to be male, older, less-educated, and vaccinated. Also, they were under greater financial pressure and had suffered a larger loss of income during the pandemic. To recover the loss, they worked longer hours and felt under more intense pressure at work. The job pressure, long working hours, and financial burdens led many drivers to adopt risky traffic behaviors, such as speeding. Conversely, where the companies and co-workers were more supportive, riders tended to adopt health prevention measures more often. Fear of Covid-19 also acted as a facilitator. Job and financial pressure combined with the fear of contracting the virus contributed to the occurrence of new heath issues during the pandemic. Again, support from the company and co-workers helped to reduce the risk of new health problems emerging.

We found that, during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the nationwide reduced air pollution (except for O3) could be largely explained by traffic control measures. During the traffic control period, every doubling of vehicle density was associated with a decrease of 4.2 (2.0, 6.4) g/m3 in PM2.5, 5.5 (2.9, 8.1) g/m3 in PM10, 1.5 (0.9, 2.0) g/m3 in NO2, and 0.04 (0.02, 0.07) mg/m3 in CO comparing cities with different vehicle densities. Similarly, for every 10% increase in the truck proportion, PM2.5 decreased by 12.3 (4.1, 20.6) g/m3, PM10 decreased by 14.3 (4.6, 23.9) g/m3, and CO decreased by 0.14 (0.05, 0.23) mg/m3. Moreover, the associations between vehicle density and reduction in PM2.5, PM10, and CO during the traffic control period were stronger and showed near-complete linearity in cities with low green coverage rate (All P < 0.05 for interaction).

Covering attacks that produce lower traffic is difficult through neural network models because it requires higher traffic for correct prediction. This paper proposes a novel robust and intelligent cyber-attack detection model to cover the issues mentioned above using the concept of heavy-hitter and graph technique to detect zero-day attacks. The proposed work consists of two phases (a) Signature generation and (b) Evaluation phase. This model evaluates the performance using generated signatures at the training phase. The result analysis of the proposed zero-day attack detection shows higher performance for accuracy of 91.33% for the binary classification and accuracy of 90.35% for multi-class classification on real-time attack data. The performance against benchmark data set CICIDS18 shows a promising result of 91.62% for binary-class classification on this model. Thus, the proposed approach shows an encouraging result to detect zero-day attacks.","output":"A robust intelligent zero-day cyber-attack detection technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of frequently occurrence of disasters worldwide, the disaster-coping capability is imperative for risk reduction and contemporary emergency management. The global COVID-19 pandemics since 2020 has further highlighted the significance of resilience construction at different geographical scales. Overall, the conceptual cognition of resilience in disaster management covers multiple elements and has diverse yieldings on regional assessment. This paper assesses the local resilience to the public health disaster at the prefecture-level city, focusing on two dimensions consisting of vulnerability and capability in the targeted provincial region of Jiangsu in China. To this end, based on the vulnerability-capability framework, the Rough Analytic Hierarchy Process (RAHP) method was applied for the resilience assessment. By the criteria derived from literature, the criteria weights were determined with the RAHP method and we assessed urban resilience with census data. In addition, the hierarchical factors contributing to urban resilience were highlighted on the basis of robustness analysis. This research provides constructive ideas for regional disaster reduction and contributes to the government capability to improve the urban resilience.","output":"Assessing Urban Resilience to Public Health Disaster Using The Rough Analytic Hierarchy Process Method: A Regional Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a brainstorming tool combined with pointing gestures to improve the brainstorming meeting experience for blind and visually impaired people (BVIP).

Additionally, we characterized by WGS the KPC-ST307-Kp isolates recovered in our hospital before and after CAZ/AVI therapy. Rectal colonization or infection by carbapenem-resistant KPC-3-Kp isolates (imipenem MIC 16 mg/L, meropenem MIC 8->16 mg/L) and CAZ/AVI-susceptible (CAZ/AVI MIC 1-2 mg/L) were first detected in three ICU patients admitted between March-2020 and July-2020. KPC-Kp isolates with increased CAZ/AVI MICs (8-32 mg/L) and carbapenem susceptibility (imipenem and meropenem MIC <1 mg/L) were recovered within 6-24 days after CAZ/AVI treatment. WGS confirmed that all KPC-Kp isolates belonged to the ST307 high-risk clone and carried identical antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. The presence of the novel blaKPC-46, blaKPC-66 and blaKPC-92 genes was confirmed in the Kp isolates with increased CAZ/AVI MICs and restored carbapenem activity.

We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurotrauma presentations in the first 3 months after shutdown throughout Pennsylvania. METHODS: The Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation was queried for registry data from the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcomes Study between March 12 and June 5 in each year from 2017 to 2020. RESULTS: After the COVID-19 shutdown, there was a 27% reduction in neurotrauma volume, from 2680 cases in 2017 to 2018 cases in 2020, and a 28.8% reduction in traumatic brain injury volume. There was no significant difference in neurotrauma phenotype incurred relative to total cases. Injury mechanism was less likely to be motor vehicle collision and more likely caused by falls, gunshot wound, and recreational vehicle accidents (P < 0.05). Location of injury was less likely on roads and public locations and more likely at indoor private locations (P < 0.05). The proportion of patients with neurotrauma with blood alcohol concentration >0.08 g/dL was reduced in 2020 (11.4% vs. 9.0%; P < 0.05). Mortality was higher during 2020 compared with pre-COVID years (7.7% vs. 6.4%; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During statewide shutdown, neurotrauma volume and alcohol-related trauma decreased and low-impact traumas and gunshot wounds increased, with a shift toward injuries occurring in private, indoor locations. These changes increased mortality.

Here we used network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification to explore the mechanisms whereby luteolin can benefit stroke recovery. The pharmacological and molecular properties of luteolin were obtained from Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. The potential targets of luteolin and ischemic stroke were collected from interrogating public databases.

The molecular target of our analysis was the GMC oxidoreductase from Penicillium expansum involved in the biosynthesis of patulin, a mycotoxin that can contaminate many foods, especially fruits and fruit-based products. The employed in silico/in vitro/in vivo assays described in our study proved the effectiveness of our strategy and in particular of two small molecules, 6-hydroxycoumarin (structurally related to umbelliferon, an already characterized patulin synthase inhibitor) and meticrane (an already approved drug) in reducing patulin accumulation. Our findings highly recommend the mentioned ligands to be subjected to further analysis for being used in the next future in place of other more toxic compounds, in postharvest treatments based on dipping or drenching methods. ABSTRACT: Flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD) dependent glucose methanol choline oxidoreductase (GMC oxidoreductase) is the terminal key enzyme of the patulin biosynthetic pathway. GMC oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidative ring closure of (E)-ascladiol to patulin. Currently, no protein involved in the patulin biosynthesis in Penicillium expansum has been experimentally characterized or solved by X-ray diffraction. Consequently, nothing is known about P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase substrate-binding site and mode of action. In the present investigation, a 3D comparative model for P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase has been described. Furthermore, a multistep computational approach was used to identify P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase residues involved in the FAD binding and in substrate recognition. Notably, the obtained 3D comparative model of P. expansum GMC oxidoreductase was used for performing a virtual screening of a chemical/drug library, which allowed to predict new GMC oxidoreductase high affinity ligands to be tested in in vitro/in vivo assays. In vitro assays performed in presence of 6-hydroxycoumarin and meticrane, among the highly affinity predicted binders, confirmed a dose-dependent inhibition (17C81%) of patulin production by 6-hydroxycoumarin (10 MC1 mM concentration range), whereas the approved drug meticrane inhibited patulin production by 43% already at 10 M. Furthermore, 6-hydroxycoumarin and meticrane caused a 60 and 41% reduction of patulin production, respectively, in vivo on apples at 100 g/wound.","output":"Targeting Penicillium expansum GMC Oxidoreductase with High Affinity Small Molecules for Reducing Patulin Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Smith-Waterman algorithm, which produces the optimal pairwise alignment between two sequences, is frequently used as a key component of fast heuristic read mapping and variation detection tools for next-generation sequencing data. Though various fast Smith-Waterman implementations are developed, they are either designed as monolithic protein database searching tools, which do not return detailed alignment, or are embedded into other tools. These issues make reusing these efficient Smith-Waterman implementations impractical. RESULTS: To facilitate easy integration of the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we wrote a C/C++ library, which extends Farrars Striped Smith-Waterman (SSW) to return alignment information in addition to the optimal Smith-Waterman score. In this library we developed a new method to generate the full optimal alignment results and a suboptimal score in linear space at little cost of efficiency. This improvement makes the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman become really useful in genomic applications. SSW is available both as a C/C++ software library, as well as a stand-alone alignment tool at: https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library.

The most significant factors in our all-patients models included: age over 80 (OR=5.78, p= 2.29x10(?24)) and hypertension (OR=1.89, p=1.26x10(?10)) having the highest impact on hospitalization, while Type 2 Diabetes was associated with all three outcomes (hospitalization: OR=1.48, p=1.39x10(?04); severe disease: OR=1.46, p=4.47x10(?09); mortality: OR=1.27, p=0.001). In race-specific models, COPD increased risk of hospitalization only in Non-Hispanics (NH)-Whites (OR=2.70, p=0.009). Obesity (BMI 30+) showed race-specific risk with severe disease NH-Whites (OR=1.48, p=0.038) and NH-Blacks (OR=1.77, p=0.025). For mortality, Cancer was the only risk factor in Hispanics (OR=1.97, p=0.043), and heart failure was only a risk in NH-Asians (OR=2.62, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE. Comorbidities were more influential on COVID-19 outcomes than social determinants, suggesting clinical factors are more predictive of adverse trajectory than social factors.","output":"Social and Clinical Determinants of COVID-19 Outcomes: Modeling Real-World Data from a Pandemic Epicenter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Specific respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, may cause smell and/or taste disorders (STDs) with increased frequency. The aim was to determine whether new-onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres. Consecutive patients positive for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups. New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77-165.4, P = 0.003)]. COVID-19 patients with new-onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID-19 patients without STDs (52.6  17.2 vs. 67.4  15.1, P < 0.001). Amongst COVID-19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction. The mean duration of STD was 7.5  3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4  2.3 days of onset. CONCLUSION: New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients; they usually had an acute onset and were commonly an initial manifestation. The use of STD assessment in anamnesis as a hint for COVID-19 and to support individuals' self-isolation in the current epidemic context is suggested.","output":"Acute-onset smell and taste disorders in the context of COVID-19: a pilot multicentre polymerase chain reaction based case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To compared the positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test and clinical characteristics of critical and general coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS Clinical data of 18 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First People's Hospital of Lianyungang City from February to March 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into general group (n = 11) and critical ill group (n = 7) according to the severity of the disease. The differences of gender, age, epidemiological characteristics, fever duration after admission, underlaying disease, positive rate of anal swab nucleic acid test at admission and two times of negative pharyngeal swab test were compared between the two groups. RESULTS There were no significant differences in gender, age, fever duration after admission or underlaying disease between the two groups. The number of anorectal swab positive cases in critically ill group was significantly higher than that in general group (cases: 4 vs. 1, P = 0.047). After two negative pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test, the number of anal swab positive cases in critical illness group was still higher than that in general group (cases: 2 vs. 0), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.137). The number of non-local infection in critical ill group was significantly higher than that in general group (cases: 4 vs. 0, P = 0.047). All of the 4 non-local infected patients had a history of living in Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS The patients with anorectal swab nucleic acid positive may have a more serious condition. It may be a risk to transfer ill patients out of the isolation ward by the criteria of only two times of negative pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test.

The use of resident trainees in telemedicine is one area of potential development and expansion. To date, however, training opportunities in this field have been limited, and residents may not be adequately prepared to provide high-quality telemedicine care. AIM: This study evaluates the impact of an adapted telemedicine Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) on telemedicine-specific training competencies of residents. SETTING: Primary Care Internal Medicine residents at a large urban academic hospital. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In March 2020, the New York University Grossman School of Medicine Primary Care program adapted its annual comprehensive OSCE to a telemedicine-based platform, to comply with distance learning and social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. A previously deployed in-person OSCE on the subject of a medical error was adapted to a telemedicine environment and deployed to 23 primary care residents. Both case-specific and core learning competencies were assessed, and additional observations were conducted on the impact of the telemedicine context on the encounter. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Three areas of telemedicine competency need were identified in the OSCE case: technical proficiency; virtual information gathering, including history, collateral information collection, and physical exam; and interpersonal communication skills, both verbal and nonverbal. Residents expressed enthusiasm for telemedicine training, but had concerns about their preparedness for telemedicine practice and the need for further competency and curricular development. DISCUSSION: Programs interested in building capacity among residents to perform telemedicine, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, can make significant impact in their trainees' comfort and preparedness by addressing key issues in technical proficiency, history and exam skills, and communication. Further research and curricular development in digital professionalism and digital empathy for trainees may also be beneficial.","output":"Building Telemedicine Capacity for Trainees During the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak: a Case Study and Lessons Learned"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Against a rapidly aging population, projections are done to size up the demand for long-term care (LTC) services for long-range policy planning These projections are typically focused on functional factors such as disability Recent studies indicate the importance of social factors, for example, socially isolated seniors living alone are more likely to be institutionalized, resulting in higher demand for LTC services This is one the first known studies to complete a 40-year projection of LTC demand based on disability and social isolation The primary micro dataset was the Retirement and Health Survey, Singapore&rsquo;s first nationally representative longitudinal study of noninstitutionalized older adults aged 45 to 85 with over 15,000 respondents Disability prevalence across the mild to severe spectrum is projected to increase five-fold over the next 40 years, and the number of socially isolated elders living alone is projected to grow four-fold Regression models of living arrangements revealed interesting ethnic differences: Malay elders are 2 6 times less likely to live alone than their Chinese counterparts, controlling for marital status, age, and housing type These projections provide a glimpse of the growing demand for LTC services for a rapidly aging Singapore and underscore the need to shore up community-based resources to enable seniors to age-in-place","output":"40-Year Projections of Disability and Social Isolation of Older Adults for Long-Range Policy Planning in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic of COVID-19 poses a public health danger to the Pacific island countries.

We compared demographic data, preoperative and postoperative length of stay (LOS), risk stratification using Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS) classification and outcomes in both periods. RESULTS: We observed a 66.7% decrease in our surgical volume (285  95 patients). Patients operated in the pre-pandemic period were older (911.3 [174.8 - 5953.8] days-old) compared to the pandemic period (275 days-old; P<0.05). When the case mix was compared between periods, the percentage of neonatal surgery was increased in the pandemic era (8%  21.1%; P<0.05), and the number of RACHS 1-2 surgeries decreased significantly (60.7  27.4%; P<0.05).

Globally, in 2019, 9.96 million people fell ill with TB, including 1.19 million children aged 0-14 years. Children from family contacts have the highest risk of TB. Testing for TB and COVID-19 for individual indications in children can be done simultaneously. This will provide significant benefits for the detection of two infectious diseases. The study of TB with pulmonary symptoms and TB without symptoms (asymptomatic) will be essential for rational screening. Objective: The study of 333 cases of symptomatic and asymptomatic pulmonary TB in children from family contacts of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases. METHODS The focus group included 74 children with symptomatic pulmonary TB and 259 children with asymptomatic pulmonary TB from family contacts. Analysis of history of disease, comorbidity, clinical, bacteriological, X-ray methods and statistical analysis (Student's t-test, 2-test) have been applied.RESULTSBoth groups did not differ by quantity of boys and girls. The group of children with symptomatic TB included 29 boys (39,2%) and 45 girls (60,8%). The group of children with asymptomatic TB included 128 boys (49,4%) and 131 girls (50,6%). Differences between groups is not valid (2=2,418;p=0,120). The average age of the children with symptomatic TB was 14,5  3,8 years, in children with asymptomatic TB - 13,8  4,7 years. Differences between groups is not valid ( p&gt;0,05).The frequency of excretion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the groups differed. The excretion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined in 36 children (48,6%) with symptomatic TB and 57 children (22,0%) with asymptomatic TB (2 = 20,295;p&lt;0,001).The frequency of lung cavities in the groups differed. Cavities were recorded in 24 children (32,4%) with symptomatic TB and 39 children (15,1%) with asymptomatic TB (2 = 11,327;p&lt;0,001). Drug resistance was observed in 7 children (9,5%) with symptomatic TB and 14 children (5,4%) with asymptomatic TB (2 = 1,601;p = 0,206). The difference is not significant. Comorbid diseases have been reported in 53 children (71,6%) with symptomatic TB and 188 children (72,6%) with asymptomatic TB (2 = 0,027;p = 0,870). The difference is not significant.CONCLUSIONSChildren with symptomatic TB from family contacts often had a more severe form of TB.

We hypothesize that a MAS model which considers rich spatial demographics, hourly mobility data and daily contagion information from the metropolitan area of Toronto can explain significant emerging behavior. To investigate this hypothesis we designed, with our modeling framework of choice, GAMA, an accurate environment which can be tuned to reproduce mobility and healthcare data, in our case coming from TomTom's API and Toronto's Open Data. We observed that some interesting contagion phenomena are directly influenced by mobility restrictions and curfew policies. We conclude that while our model is able to reproduce non-trivial emerging properties, large-scale simulation are needed to further investigate the role of different parameters. Finally, providing such an end-to-end model can be critical for policy-makers to compare their outcomes with past strategies in order to devise better plans for future measures.","output":"Optimizing Urban Mobility Restrictions: a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intravascular leiomyomatosis is a rare, benign tumour of myometrial smooth muscle.

The increase in cardiac biomarkers has been associated with a worse prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic value of Troponin-T (TNT) and natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients hospitalized for Covid-19. METHODS: This was a convenience sample of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Data were collected from medical records to assess the association of TnT and BNP measured in the first 24 hours of hospital admission with the combined outcome (CO) of death or need for mechanical ventilation. Univariate analysis was used to compare the groups with and without the CO. Cox's multivariate model was used to determine independent predictors of the CO. RESULTS: We evaluated 183 patients (age = 66.817 years, 65.6% of which were males). The time of follow-up was 7 days (range 1 to 39 days). The CO occurred in 24% of the patients. The median troponin-T and BNP levels were 0.011 and 0.041ng/dL (p <0.001); 64 and 198 pg/dL (p <0.001), respectively, for the groups without and with the CO. In the univariate analysis, in addition to TnT and BNP, age, presence of coronary disease, oxygen saturation, lymphocytes, D-dimer, t-CRP and creatinine, were different between groups with and without outcomes. In the bootstrap multivariate analysis, only TnT (1.12 [95% CI 1.03-1.47]) and t-CRP (1.04 [95% CI 1.00-1.10]) were independent predictors of the CO. CONCLUSION: In the first 24h of admission, TnT, but not BNP, was an independent marker of mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

Furthermore, the effects of an oral rehydration solution (ORS) mixed into milk replacer on the AER were determined. Acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was performed to estimate the AER. Sixty Holstein-Frisian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study and divided into groups as follows: healthy calves (H; n = 16), healthy calves fed with ORS (HORS; n = 14), diarrhoeic calves (D; n = 15) and diarrhoeic calves fed with ORS (DORS; n = 15). For the APAT, the calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen (AP)/kg body weight. Venous blood samples were collected before and after milk replacer and AP intake in 30-60 min intervals for 12 hr. During the APAT, no significant differences in median maximum acetaminophen concentration (Cmax ) were observed among all groups. Time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (Tmax ) in DORS (median 390 min, 25/75 quartiles: 300/480 min) was significantly higher compared with that in H (median: 270 min 25/75 quartiles: 210/315 min) and HORS (median: 300 min (25/75 quartiles: 240/360 min).

METHOD: A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called health-related literature while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called infection-related literature. The study period was from 1980 to 2019. RESULTS: The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature (n = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature (n = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature.

The insertion of five different connexins into the membrane of the ER was studied by synthesizing connexins in translation- competent cell lysates supplemented with pancreatic ER-derived microsomes, and by expressing connexins in vivo in several eucaryotic cell types. In addition, the subcellular distribution of the connexins was determined. In vitro-synthesis in the presence of microsomes resulted in the signal recognition particle-dependent membrane insertion of the connexins. The membrane insertion of all connexins was accompanied by an efficient proteolytic processing that was dependent on the microsome concentration. Endogenous unprocessed connexins were detectable in the microsomes used, indicating that the pancreatic microsomes serve as a competent recipient in vivo for unprocessed full length connexins. Although oriented with their amino terminus in the cytoplasm, the analysis of the cleavage reaction indicated that an unprecedented processing by signal peptidase resulted in the removal of an amino-terminal portion of the connexins. Variable amounts of similar connexin cleavage products were also identified in the ER membranes of connexin overexpressing cells. The amount generated correlated with the level of protein expression.

We analysed data from four ambient air quality stations over three years (January to May, 2018-2020) with pairwise comparisons, trend analysis, etc. Results indicated unprecedented reduction in the concentration of the air pollutants: nitrogen dioxide, NO2 (-48%), oxides of nitrogen, NOx (-53% to -90%), carbon monoxide, CO (-24% to -67%) and the particulate matter (-24% to -47% for particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 m, PM2.5; -17% to -20% for particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 m, PM10), as well as the reduction of the National Air Quality Index (NAQI). These reductions indicate an overall improvement of the ambient air quality due to restrictions on transportation, construction, and the industrial sectors during lockdown, even in an area considered less industrial. Despite the general decreasing trend of the concentration of various air pollutants from January to May, suggesting seasonal influences, the trend was intensified in the year 2020 due to the added effect of the lockdown measures. Comparison of results with those from larger and more industrialized cities suggests that the effects of lockdown are more variable, and focused on the levels of gaseous pollutants. Findings from this study demonstrate the far-reaching effects and implications of the COVID-19 lockdown on ambient air quality, even on less industrialized and less urbanized regions.","output":"Ambient air quality of a less industrialized region of India (Kerala) during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book chapter presents the review of COVID-19 and its status, as well as the scientific Analysis big data analytics with the help of machine learning.

METHODS MiRNA microarray analysis was used to profile microRNA expression levels in MDS and normal bone marrow. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to verify differentially expressed microRNAs. RESULTS MiRNA microarray analysis showed 96 significantly upregulated (eg, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-125b-5p) and 198 significantly downregulated (eg, miR-181a-2-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-550a-3p) microRNAs in MDS compared with normal bone marrow. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the microarray analysis: expression of six microRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-10a-5p) was significantly higher in MDS, while 3 microRNAs (miR-181a-2-3p, miR-124-3p, and miR-550a-3p) were significantly downregulated in MDS. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed microRNAs might participate in MDS pathogenesis by regulating hematopoiesis, leukocyte migration, leukocyte apoptotic process, and hematopoietic cell lineage. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicates that differentially expressed microRNAs might play a key role in MDS pathogenesis by regulating potential relevant functional and signaling pathways.

It is an essential step before patients returning home, and is usually carried out in specialised Follow-up and Rehabilitation Clinics. When discharged from hospital, patients with post-severe COVID-19 usually progress in their medical condition. However, they may remain frail and have a constant fear of possible deterioration leading to (re)hospitalisation and a return to baseline. Psychological support in this phase can reduce patients anxiety and increase their motivation to carry out daily rehabilitation activities. This support provides a stable and consistent basis for patients to focus on their progress, leaving the difficulties behind. Being aware of the improvements in their physical condition allows them to maintain their motivation to continue to be physically active. Psychological support during respiratory rehabilitation aims at preparing patients to return to the normal life they had before the disease. It is usually based on brief psychotherapies that focus on strengthening the patient's abilities through behavioural changes and through reducing risk behaviours.

Moreover, it is not known whether alterations in MOR are already present in subclinical depression and anxiety. In a large-scale retrospective cross-sectional study we pooled data from 135 (113 males and 22 females) healthy subjects whose brains MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) using an agonist radioligand [(11)C]carfentanil that has high affinity for MORs. Depressive and anxious symptomology was addressed with BDI-II and STAI-X questionnaires, respectively. Both anxiety and depression scores in the subclinical range were negatively associated with MOR availability in cortical and subcortical areas, notably in amygdala, hippocampus, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices.

Models of emotion processing emphasize the importance of bodily sensations to the experience of emotions. Since there have been no studies on whether emotion-associated bodily sensations are changed in IBD, we investigated the experience of bodily sensations related to valence and arousal, together with their links to emotional awareness, as one domain of interoceptive sensibility relevant to emotion processing. METHODS: Using a topographical self-report measure, 41 IBD patients in clinical remission and 44 healthy control (HC) participants were asked to indicate where and how intensely in their body they perceive changes when experiencing emotions of positive and negative valence, as well as relaxation and tension. Additionally, we used self-report questionnaires to assess emotional awareness as one domain of an individuals interoceptive sensibility, gastrointestinal-specific anxiety (GSA), and psychological distress. RESULTS: Patients with IBD reported higher emotional awareness but lower intensities of perceived changes in their bodily sensations related to valence and arousal of emotional processing. IBD patients reported less intense bodily activation during positive emotions and less intense bodily deactivation during negative emotional states in comparison to HC participants. Higher emotional awareness and psychological distress were linked to stronger experiences of emotion-related bodily sensations in IBD patients. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory bowel diseases patients exhibited alterations in how they link bodily sensations to their emotional experience. Such persistent changes can affect a patients wellbeing and are related to higher levels of anxiety and depression among IBD patients, even in remission.","output":"Is It a Gut Feeling?

Worldwide, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the availability of these resources, even in resource-rich healthcare systems such as Germanys. The present study aimed to determine the under-explored factors associated with hospital length of stay (LOS) in imported falciparum malaria to identify potential targets for improving management. This retrospective observational study used multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression with time to discharge as an endpoint for adults hospitalized between 2001 and 2015 with imported falciparum malaria in the Charit University Hospital, Berlin. The median LOS of the 535 cases enrolled was 3 days (inter-quartile range, IQR, 3C4 days). The likelihood of being discharged by day 3 strongly decreased with severe malaria (hazard ratio, HR, 0.274; 95% Confidence interval, 95%CI: 0.190C0.396) and by 40% with each additional presenting complication (HR, 0.595; 95%CI: 0.510C0.694). The 55 (10.3%) severe cases required a median LOS of 7 days (IQR, 5C12 days). In multivariate analysis, occurrence of shock (adjusted HR, aHR, 0.438; 95%CI 0.220C0.873), acute pulmonary oedema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (aHR, 0.450; 95%CI: 0.223C0.874), and the need for renal replacement therapy (aHR, 0.170; 95%CI: 0.063C0.461) were independently associated with LOS. All patients survived to discharge. This study illustrates that favourable outcomes can be achieved with high-standard care in imported falciparum malaria. Early recognition of disease severity together with targeted supportive care can lead to avoidance of manifest organ failure, thereby potentially decreasing LOS and alleviating pressure on bed capacities.","output":"Factors Associated with Prolonged Hospital Length of Stay in Adults with Imported Falciparum MalariaAn Observational Study from a Tertiary Care University Hospital in Berlin, Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to study the association between case rates and reductions in urban mobility in state capitals of Colombia.

We treat this crisis as a natural experiment to illustrate the importance of public transit in riders abilities to access essential destinations. We measured the impacts of riders forgoing transit through a survey of transportation barriers completed by more than 4,000 transit riders in Toronto and Vancouver (Canada). We used Heckman selection models to predict six dimensions of transport disadvantage and transport-related social exclusions captured in our survey. We then complemented model results with an analysis of survey comments describing barriers that individuals faced. Lack of access to alternative modes is the strongest predictor of a former rider experiencing transport disadvantage, particularly neighborhood walkability and vehicle ownership. Groups at risk of transport disadvantage before COVID-19, particularly women and people in poorer health, were also more likely to report difficulties while avoiding public transit. Barriers described by respondents included former supports no longer offering rides, gendered household car use dynamics, and lack of culturally specific or specialized amenities within walking distance.Policymakers should plan for a level of redundancy in transportation systems that enables residents to access essential destinations when unexpected service losses occur. Designing communities that enable residents to walk to those essential destinations will help reduce the burdens faced by transit riders during crises that render transit unfeasible. At the same time, planners championing active travel as an alternative to transit during such crises also need to devise solutions for former transit riders for whom active travel is ill suited, for example, due to physical challenges with carrying groceries or needing to chaperone children.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused marked disruptions in the delivery of surgical care worldwide. A thoughtful, structured approach to resuming surgical services is necessary as the impact of COVID-19 becomes better controlled. The Coronavirus Global Surgical Collaborative (CVGSC) sought to formulate, through rigorous scientific methodology, a consensus-based recommendations in collaboration with a multidisciplinary group of international experts and policy makers. METHODS: Recommendations were developed following a Delphi process. Domain topics were formulated and subsequently subdivided into questions pertinent to different aspects of surgical care in the COVID-19 crisis. Forty-four experts from 15 countries across four continents drafted statements based on the specific questions. Anonymous Delphi voting on the statements was performed in two rounds, as well as in a telepresence meeting. RESULTS: One hundred statements were formulated across 10 domains. The statements addressed terminology, impact on procedural services, patient/staff safety, managing a backlog of surgeries, methods to restart and sustain surgical services, education, and research. Eightythree of the statements were approved during the first round of Delphi voting, and 11 during the second round. A final telepresence meeting and discussion yielded acceptance of five other statements. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi process resulted in 99 recommendations. These consensus statements provide expert guidance, based on scientific methodology, for the safe resumption of surgical activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"International Delphi Expert Consensus on Safe Return to Surgical and Endoscopic Practice: from the Coronavirus Global Surgical Collaborative"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many localities instituted non-essential business closure orders, keeping individuals categorized as essential workers at the frontlines while sending their non-essential counterparts home We examine the extent to which being designated as an essential or non-essential worker impacts one's risk of being Covid-positive following the non- essential business closure order in Pennsylvania We also assess the intrahousehold transmission risk experienced by their cohabiting family members and roommates Using a difference-in- differences framework, we estimate that workers designated as essential have a 55% higher likelihood of being positive for Covid-19 than those classified as non-essential;in other words, non-essential workers experience a protective effect While members of the health care and social assistance subsector contribute significantly to this overall effect, it is not completely driven by them We also find evidence of intrahousehold transmission that differs in intensity by essential status Dependents cohabiting with an essential worker have a 17% higher likelihood of being Covid-positive compared to those cohabiting with a non-essential worker Roommates cohabiting with an essential worker experience a 38% increase in likelihood of being Covid-positive Analysis of households with a Covid-positive member suggests that intrahousehold transmission is an important mechanism","output":"The impact of the non-essential business closure policy on COVID-19 infection rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce robust anti-spike (S) antibody and CD4+ T cell responses.

Mining of the responding TFH T cell receptor repertoire revealed a strikingly immunodominant HLADPB1* 04-restricted response to S167-180 in individuals with this allele, which is among the most common HLA alleles in humans. Paired blood and lymph node specimens show that while circulating S-specific TFH cells peak one week after the second immunization, S-specific TFH persist at nearly constant frequencies for at least six months.

Nonstructural protein 9 (Nsp9) is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays a critical role in viral RNA transcription and replication. In this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV N protein is bound to Nsp9 by protein-protein interaction and that the contacting surface on Nsp9 is located in the two predicted -helixes formed by 48 residues at the C-terminal end of the protein. Mutagenesis analyses identified E646, E608, and E611 on Nsp9 and Q85 on the N protein as the pivotal residues participating in the N-Nsp9 interaction. By overexpressing the N protein binding fragment of Nsp9 in infected Marc-145 cells, the synthesis of viral RNAs, as well as the production of infectious progeny viruses, was dramatically inhibited, suggesting that Nsp9-N protein association is involved in the process of viral RNA production. In addition, we show that PRRSV N interacts with cellular RNA helicase DHX9 and redistributes the protein into the cytoplasm. Knockdown of DHX9 increased the ratio of short subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs); in contrast, DHX9 overexpression benefited the synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and the viral genomic RNA (gRNA). These results imply that DHX9 is recruited by the N protein in PRRSV infection to regulate viral RNA synthesis. We postulate that N and DHX9 may act as antiattenuation factors for the continuous elongation of nascent transcript during negative-strand RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE It is unclear whether the N protein of PRRSV is involved in regulation of the viral RNA production process. In this report, we demonstrate that the N protein of the arterivirus PRRSV participates in viral RNA replication and transcription through interacting with Nsp9 and its RdRp and recruiting cellular RNA helicase to promote the production of longer viral sgmRNAs and gRNA. Our data here provide some new insights into the discontinuous to continuous extension of PRRSV RNA synthesis and also offer a new potential anti-PRRSV strategy targeting the N-Nsp9 and/or N-DHX9 interaction.","output":"Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus Nucleocapsid Protein Interacts with Nsp9 and Cellular DHX9 To Regulate Viral RNA Synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Standard blood laboratory parameters may have diagnostic potential, if polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests are not available on time. We evaluated standard blood laboratory parameters of 655 COVID-19 patients suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, who underwent PCR testing in one of five hospitals in Vienna, Austria. We compared laboratory parameters, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between positive and negative PCR-tested patients and evaluated the ability of those parameters to distinguish between groups. Of the 590 patients (20-100years, 276 females and 314 males), 208 were PCR-positive. Positive compared to negative PCR-tested patients had significantly lower levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, monocytes, and thrombocytes;while significantly higher levels were detected with erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, C-reactive-protein, ferritin, activated-partial-thromboplastin-time, alanine-aminotransferase, aspartate-aminotransferase, lipase, creatine-kinase, and lactate-dehydrogenase. From all blood parameters, eosinophils, ferritin, leukocytes, and erythrocytes showed the highest ability to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative patients (area-under-curve: 72.3-79.4%). Leukopenia, eosinopenia, elevated erythrocytes, and hemoglobin were among the strongest markers regarding accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, and post-test probabilities. Our findings suggest that especially leukopenia, eosinopenia, as well as elevated erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and ferritin are helpful to distinguish between COVID-19 positive and negative tested patients.","output":"Standard Blood Laboratory Values As A Clinical Support Tool to Distinguish Between SARS-CoV-2 Positive and Negative Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare is an important part of life.

The article proposes new definitional statements of proportionate and disproportionate policy designs that vary according to the extent to which the main design properties are adjusted to low-quality information. It also explores distinct variations in a few policy characteristics resulting from over- and under-design. The policy characteristics examined here include economic efficiency, policy effectiveness, policy robustness; the space for making significant changes at a later stage when high-quality information becomes available; the potential consequences in terms of policy over- and under-reaction; and the political ramifications of these suboptimal designs for elected executives. With regard to the interaction between technical and political logics, the article posits that deliberate policy over- and under-design can be viewed as solutions to serious political problems faced by elected executives, especially in politically sensitive times.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants Electronic medical records for 152,225 chronic wounds from a network of 488 wound care clinics in 45 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Methods Wound and patient characteristics, the number of chronic wounds newly seen at the clinics, and 12-week healing rates were compared between the first two quarters of 2019 and 2020. Multivariable regression models were constructed to evaluate whether the pandemic was associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of 12-week wound healing after risk adjustment. Results During the pandemic, wound and patient characteristics did not change compared to the previous year. Case volume dropped as much as 40% in April 2020 but returned to the previous years level by June. No systematic changes in measures of care continuity were observed. Unadjusted 12-week healing rates remained stable at 0.502 in 2019 and 0.503 in 2020. Likewise, risk-adjusted 12-week healing rates were 0.504 and 0.505 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. States with stricter lockdowns saw a greater decline in case volume. However, the pandemic was not associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of 12-week wound healing in most states. The percent of wounds with one or more telehealth visits increased from 0.14% in 2019 to 1.04% in 2020. Conclusions and Implications Despite COVID-19 related disruptions, our results suggest that wound care clinics maintained standards of care and outcomes for patients who sought care. This positive result should not detract from the problem that the number of new wounds seen at the clinics dropped sharply. Further research should evaluate outcomes in patients with unattended chronic wounds. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of chronic wounds newly seen at clinics declined, especially in states with stricter lockdowns.

Material and Methods: We present a prospective study of liver transplant recipients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted for treatment to the department of First Clinic of Abdominal Surgery, Military Medical Academy, Sofia during 25.11.2020 04.01.2021. The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 infection from a naso-pharyngeal swab. COVID-19 severity is estimated as mild (oxygen saturation (SpO2) 94% on room air and no imaging findings of pneumonia), moderate (SpO2 94%, imaging suggestive of pneumonia), and severe (need for high flow oxygen supplementation). Results: Three liver transplant recipients with COVID-19 were admitted and treated in our department during 25.11.2020 04.01.2021. All of them were male, mean age of 51.33 years (47 - 59) and their liver transplantations were performed 13, 5, and 1.5 years before. In each of the three patients a different clinical form of the disease was registered mild (n=1), moderate (n=1), and severe (n=1). Only the patient with severe disease had comorbidities - hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The patients with mild and moderate disease received dual immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil while the one with severe disease - tacrolimus only. A dose reduction of tacrolimus was undertaken following serum level evaluation without changing the dose of the mycophenolate mofetil for those on dual therapy. The patient with severe disease died from respiratory failure leading to a case fatality rate of 33.3%. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and hospitalization where possible are essential for the prompt initiation of treatment, prevention of complications and development of severe forms of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients, especially in patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. During the course of treatment there may be a dose reduction of the immunosuppressive therapy but not discontinuation, especially of the calcineurin inhibitor in mono- or dual-therapy regimens.","output":"COVID-19 in Liver Transplant Recipients - Preliminary Experience of a Bulgarian Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, in the newly re-organized COVID-19 Hospitals, almost all surgical services have been shut down.

Participants include students aged 19-29 at the University of Nebraska at Kearney and older adults above the age of 60 residing in the community. First, we surveyed younger and older adults to determine their interest level in participating in an IGB Program. Both groups of participants rated their interest in different activities. The most popular activities among both groups included engaging in conversations, board games, and an exchange of skills. Neither of the groups was in favor of participating in free housing opportunities or sports-related activities. Response rates were high in young adults but low in older adults, due to lack of trust. Then, in a pilot study, we measured the feasibility and acceptability of the IGB Program. Older adults residing in independent dwellings, assisted living environments, nursing homes and members of community groups were invited to participate in the intergenerational program.

Several scientific contributions reported the potential relevance of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphism and susceptibility to viruses, such as SARS-CoV. In our study, we examined a population of coeliac subjects presenting the HLA haplotype DQ2 and/or DQ8. Our aim was to evaluate whether HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotype play a role in SARS-CoV-2-infection. The aim was also to evaluate the difficulty in following the gluten-free diet due to all the adversities produced by the pandemic, such as the food supply disruption, and the difficulties in managing the clinical follow-up. METHODS: 191 consecutive coeliac patients completed a questionnaire on their current clinical status, psychological effects, and management of the gluten-free diet experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and questions regarding possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Out of the 191 patients who participated in the study, 42 were full-blown coeliac and 149 were in remission. From the answers provided, 84.8% of patients declared that they no longer consider themselves vulnerable to COVID-19 as they suffer from coeliac disease; 94.2% of patients did not encounter any difficulties in managing the gluten-free diet or in acquiring specific foods and 64.9% of patients in our study underwent diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2. Out of this number, 31.5% did so due to contacts with subjects affected by COVID-19, 26.6% for work related reasons, 11.3% due to flu-like symptoms and 30.6% for other reasons.

An active surveillance system capable of detecting distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the deadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest (ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence chance. On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system should never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop, and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based real-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal to modulate inflow into the ROI.

Aims To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications, using electronic health records data, in a geographically defined population in London. Method Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6,309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time on the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and SLAM service use. Results Of 6,309 patients, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted HR = 2.62 (95% CI 1.73 - 3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted hazard ratio HR=1.76, 95% CI 1.14 - 2.72).

While the use of digital media has been greatly promoted by national governments and international authorities to maintain social contacts and healthy lifestyle behaviors, its increased access may also bear the risk of inappropriate or excessive use of internet-related resources. The present study, part of the COVID Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) study, aims at investigating the possible relationship between social isolation, the use of digital resources and the development of their problematic use. A cross sectional survey was carried out to explore the prevalence of internet addiction, excessive use of social media, problematic video gaming and binge watching, during Italian phase II (MayCJune 2020) and III (JuneCSeptember 2020) of the pandemic in 1385 individuals (62.5% female, mean age 32.5  12.9) mainly living in Central Italy (52.4%). Data were stratified according to phase II/III and three groups of Italian regions (northern, central and southern). Compared to the larger COMET study, most participants exhibited significant higher levels of severe-to-extremely-severe depressive symptoms (46.3% vs. 12.4%; p < 0.01) and extremely severe anxiety symptoms (77.8% vs. 7.5%; p < 0.01). We also observed a rise in problematic internet use and excessive gaming over time. Mediation analyses revealed that COVID-19-related general psychopathology, stress, anxiety, depression and social isolation play a significant role in the emergence of problematic internet use, social media addiction and problematic video gaming. Professional gamers and younger subjects emerged as sub-populations particularly at risk of developing digital addictions. If confirmed in larger and more homogenous samples, our findings may help in shedding light on possible preventive and treatment strategies for digital addictions.","output":"COVID-19-Related Social Isolation Predispose to Problematic Internet and Online Video Gaming Use in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its Member States have been heavily relying on staying at home and lock down measures to control the spread of the virus.

This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of BCG therapy among aged (>70) and younger patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: The central database of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were queried until August 4, 2021, by using \\"BCG,\\" \\"Bladder Cancer,\\" \\"AGE,\\" and \\"efficacy\\" keywords. After excluding duplicated results, titles and abstracts were evaluated by two independent reviewers. The exclusion criteria included non-English studies, conference abstracts, reviews, editorials, letters, and comments. Three main outcomes, disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS), were considered. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA (version 14; Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). RESULTS: From 1115 found documents, the 24 research articles were recruited in the systematic review, and 10 were the candidate for meta-analysis. The overall estimate of H.R. revealed that BCG therapy in those over age 70 is significantly associated with an improved risk of progression and cancer-specific death in studied patients. However, this association was not statistically significant for DFS (1.04 (95% CI: 0.85,1.26)).

In the last decade, the pace at which sustainable and resilient mobility strategies were developed grew significantly due to the spread of technologies (such as ITS systems) and digital platforms related to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS). These strategies might improve the overall efficiency of the transport system and reduce dependence on private cars in urban area. Moreover, the development of the demand responsive transport (DRT) is one of the solutions for planning end-to-end travel according to the transport needs. Actually DRT, such as the other shared modes, appears more convenient and capable to turn private car superfluous, reducing traffic congestion and noise and atmospheric pollution levels. After a review of the state of the art in literature, this paper shows the results of a descriptive and a preliminary analysis of DRT services in Italy. In particular, in the studied areas, the authors detected the type of service given and its national displacement, the category of users, the kind of stops, the fleet of vehicles and the presence of shared mobility services. Finally, the authors assessed the possibility to include these services within the Maas platforms suggesting some possible strategies for optimizing the implementation of intelligent mobility systems at Italian national level. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Developing Flexible Mobility On-Demand in the Era of Mobility as a Service: An Overview of the Italian Context Before and After Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although most patients receiving maintenance dialysis exhibit initial seroresponse to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination, concerns exist regarding the durability of this antibody response. This study evaluated seroresponse over time. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS This retrospective cohort study included patients on maintenance dialysis, from a midsize national dialysis provider, who received a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series and had at least one antibody titer checked after full vaccination. IgG spike antibodies (anti-spike IgG) titers were assessed monthly with routine laboratory tests after vaccination; the semiquantitative assay reported a range between zero and 20 Index. Descriptive analyses compared trends over time by history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccine type. Time-to-event analyses examined the outcome of loss of seroresponse (anti-spike IgG <1 Index or development of COVID-19). Cox regression adjusted for additional clinical characteristics. RESULTS Among 1870 patients receiving maintenance dialysis, 1569 had no prior COVID-19. Patients without prior COVID-19 had declining titers over time. Among 443 recipients of BNT162b2 (Pfizer), median (interquartile range) anti-spike IgG titer declined from 20 (5.89 to 20) in month 1 after full vaccination to 1.96 (0.60-5.88) by month 6. Among 778 recipients of mRNA-1273 (Moderna), anti-spike IgG titer declined from 20 (interquartile range, 20 to 20) in month 1 to 7.99 (2.61 to 20) by month 6. The 348 recipients of Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) had a lower titer response than recipients of an mRNA vaccine over all time periods. In time-to-event analyses, recipients of Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA-1273 had the shortest and longest time to loss of seroresponse, respectively. The maximum titer reached in the first 2 months after full vaccination was associated with durability of the anti-spike IgG seroresponse; patients with anti-spike IgG titer 1-19.99 had a shorter time to loss of seroresponse compared with patients with anti-spike IgG titer 20 (hazard ratio, 15.5; 95% confidence interval, 11.7 to 20.7).

We assess this question by analyzing emerging market decisions to tighten restrictions on capital outflows. While policymakers should be more likely to tighten restrictions to protect their economies as capital flow volatility (CFV) increases, investors view outflow controls as heterodox policies that violate investment contracts. We argue that the effect of CFV on outflow controls depends on the use of controls in peer markets. When peers are open, governments anticipate that controls will come at a high cost to their market reputations as heterodox measures send a negative signal to investors among a crowd of liberal peers. Conversely, when peers are closed, using controls should do less damage to an economys reputation. For 25 emerging markets from 1995C2015, we show that CFV is associated with outflow controls, but only when market peers are already closed, suggesting reputational concerns can limit policy autonomy.

Like influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be transmitted by contact, droplets, and fomites, and COVID-19 has a similar disease presentation to influenza. Here we present a case of influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection in a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. Case presentation: A 60-year-old man with ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) presented for worsening cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The patient first developed a mild fever (100 F) during hemodialysis three days prior to presentation and has been experiencing worsening flu-like symptoms, including fever of up to 101.6 F, non-productive cough, generalized abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and liquid green diarrhea. He lives alone at home with no known sick contacts and denies any recent travel or visits to healthcare facilities other than the local dialysis center. Rapid flu test was positive for influenza A. Procalcitonin was elevated at 5.21 ng/mL with a normal white blood cell (WBC) count. Computed tomography (CT) chest demonstrated multifocal areas of consolidation and extensive mediastinal and hilar adenopathy concerning for pneumonia. He was admitted to the biocontainment unit of Nebraska Medicine for concerns of possible COVID-19 and was started on oseltamivir for influenza and vancomycin/cefepime for the probable bacterial cause of his pneumonia and diarrhea. GI pathogen panel and C. diff toxin assay were negative. On the second day of admission, initial nasopharyngeal swab came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The patient received supportive care and resumed bedside hemodialysis in strict isolation, and eventually fully recovered from COVID-19.

This study aims at analysing clinical presentation on admission and the determinants associated with admission in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective hospital-based study, socio-demographic, clinical and biological characteristics, on admission, of adult COVID-19 hospitalized patients presenting from the community for their first admission were prospectively collected and analysed. Characteristics of patients hospitalized in medical ward to those admitted in ICU were compared using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square or Fisher exact test when appropriate. Univariate logistic regression was first used to identify variables on admission that were associated with the outcome i.e. admission to an ICU versus total hospital stay in a medical ward. Forward selection was then applied beginning with sex, age and temperature in the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 412 patients included, 325 were discharged and 87 died in hospital. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of ICU hospitalization with temperature (OR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.06-2.28] per degree Celsius increase), oxygen saturation <90% (OR, 12.45 [95% CI, 5.27-29.4]), abnormal lung auscultation on admission (OR, 3.58 [95% CI, 1.58-8.11]), elevated level of CRP (OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.29-5.66for CRP>100mg/L vs CRP<10mg/L). and monocytopenia (OR, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.4-7.68]) were also associated with increasing odds of ICU hospitalization. Older patients were less likely to be hospitalized in ICU (OR, 0.17 [95%CI, 0.05-0.51].

The purpose of this study was to compare urine organic acids profiles of ASD versus typically developing (TD) children to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and exploration of ASD etiology. METHODS This case control study was performed in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in collaboration with the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Aga Khan University, Pakistan. Midstream urine was collected in the first half of the day time before noon from the children with ASD diagnosed by a pediatric neurologist based on DSM-5 criteria and TD healthy controls from August 2019 to June 2021. The urine organic acids were analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. To identify potential biomarkers for ASD canonical linear discriminant analysis was carried out for the organic acids, quantified in comparison to an internal standard. RESULTS A total of 85 subjects were enrolled in the current study. The mean age of the ASD (n = 65) and TD groups (n = 20) was 4.5  2.3 and 6.4  2.2 years respectively with 72.3% males in the ASD group and 50% males in the TD group. Parental consanguinity was 47.7 and 30% in ASD and TD groups, respectively. The common clinical signs noted in children with ASD were developmental delay (70.8%), delayed language skills (66.2%), and inability to articulate sentences (56.9%). Discriminant analysis showed that 3-hydroxyisovalericc, homovanillic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, and indole acetic were significantly different between ASD and TD groups. The biochemical classification results reveal that 88.2% of cases were classified correctly into ASD& TD groups based on the urine organic acid profiles. CONCLUSION 3-hydroxy isovaleric acid, homovanillic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, and indole acetic were good discriminators between the two groups.

Being a parent in this situation was not easy for anyone, much less for parents of children with special needs. The shutting down of special education systems meant that parents lost a vital support network and had to be the sole full-time caregivers despite often lacking the skills to cope with this new and daunting situation. We interviewed parents and learned that the main difficulties faced by homebound autistic children stemmed from the change in routine, lack of special education services, limited physical space, and food- and sleep-related issues. Some children experienced worsening in behavioral, social, and developmental domains, yet others seemed to not only overcome the challenges of changing conditions but even benefit from them. The children's success or failure was directly related to how their parents coped. The key factors that enabled successful coping were the parents' ability to accommodate to the child's needs, their own creativeness and resourcefulness, and a generally positive outlook. The results of this analysis revealed that the best way to benefit autistic children caught up in drastic changes in their routine lifestyle is to invest in a strong support system for their parents.","output":"Core experiences of parents of children with autism during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with coarctation of the aorta have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (IA) and suffer subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) at younger ages than the general population. American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend IA screening, but appropriate age and interval of screening and its effectiveness remain a critical knowledge gap. METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance angiography screening for IA in patients with coarctation of the aorta, we developed and calibrated a Markov model to match published IA prevalence estimates. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Secondary outcomes included lifetime cumulative incidence of prophylactic IA treatment and mortality and SAH deaths prevented. Using a payer perspective, a lifetime horizon, and a willingness-to-pay of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, we applied a 3% annual discounting rate to costs and effects and performed 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In a simulated cohort of 10 000 patients, no screening resulted in a 10.1% lifetime incidence of SAH and 183 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years led to 978 prophylactic treatments for unruptured aneurysms, 19 procedure-related deaths, and 65 SAH-related deaths. Screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective compared with screening at ages 10 and 20 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $106 841/quality-adjusted life-year). Uncertainty in the outcome after aneurysm treatment and quality of life after SAH influenced the preferred screening strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, screening at ages 10, 20, and 30 years was cost-effective in 41% of simulations and at ages 10 and 20 in 59% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our model supports the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology recommendation to screen patients with coarctation of the aorta for IA and suggests screening at ages 10 and 20 or at 10, 20, and 30 years would extend life and be cost-effective.","output":"Screening for Intracranial Aneurysms in Coarctation of the Aorta: A Decision and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Risk assessment on a construction site is based on the probability and consequences of the accident.

It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US.

Recent studies indicate that modulating microglia/macrophage polarization and subsequent inflammatory response may be a potential adjunct therapy to recanalization. Annexin A1 (ANXA1) exerts potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving properties in models of cerebral I/R injury. However, whether ANXA1 modulates post-I/R-induced microglia/macrophage polarization has not yet been fully elucidated. METHODS: We retrospectively collected blood samples from AIS patients who underwent successful recanalization by EVT and analyzed ANXA1 levels longitudinally before and after EVT and correlation between ANXA1 levels and 3-month clinical outcomes. We also established a C57BL/6J mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R) and an in vitro model of oxygenCglucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) in BV2 microglia and HT22 neurons to explore the role of Ac2-26, a pharmacophore N-terminal peptide of ANXA1, in regulating the I/R-induced microglia/macrophage activation and polarization. RESULTS: The baseline levels of ANXA1 pre-EVT were significantly lower in 23 AIS patients, as compared with those of healthy controls. They were significantly increased to the levels found in controls 2C3 days post-EVT. The increased post-EVT levels of ANXA1 were positively correlated with 3-month clinical outcomes. In the mouse model, we then found that Ac2-26 administered at the start of reperfusion shifted microglia/macrophage polarization toward anti-inflammatory M2-phenotype in ischemic penumbra, thus alleviating bloodCbrain barrier leakage and neuronal apoptosis and improving outcomes at 3 days post-tMCAO/R. The protection was abrogated when mice received Ac2-26 together with WRW4, which is a specific antagonist of formyl peptide receptor type 2/lipoxin A4 receptor (FPR2/ALX). Furthermore, the interaction between Ac2-26 and FPR2/ALX receptor activated the 5 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). These in vivo findings were validated through in vitro experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Ac2-26 modulates microglial/macrophage polarization and alleviates subsequent cerebral inflammation by regulating the FPR2/ALX-dependent AMPK-mTOR pathway.

This study aimed to describe key patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes of a large U.S.-based cohort of patients hospitalized with COVD-19 using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients in the Optum De-identified COVID-19 EHR database who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a presumptive diagnosis between 20 February 2020 and 6 June 2020. We included hospitalizations that occurred 7 days prior to, or within 21 days after, COVID-19 diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients we describe the following: vital statistics and laboratory results on admission, relevant comorbidities (using diagnostic, procedural, and revenue codes), medications (NDC, HCPC codes), ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 76,819 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 16,780 of whom met inclusion criteria for COVID-related hospitalization. Over half the cohort was over age 50 (74.5%), overweight or obese (72.1%), or had hypertension (58.1%). At admission, 29.1% of patients presented with fever (>38 C) and 30.6% had low oxygen saturation (<90%). Among the 16,099 patients with complete hospital records, we observed that 58.9% had hypoxia, 23.4% had an ICU stay during hospitalization, 18.1% were ventilated, and 16.2% died. The median LOS was 6 days (IQR: 4, 11). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest descriptive study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States. We report summary statistics of key clinical outcomes that provide insights to better understand COVID-19 disease epidemiology.","output":"Descriptive epidemiology of 16,780 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While biomolecular condensates have emerged as an important biological phenomenon, mechanisms regulating their composition and the ways that viruses hijack these mechanisms remain unclear. The mosquito-borne alphaviruses cause a range of diseases from rashes and arthritis to encephalitis, and no licensed drugs are available for treatment or vaccines for prevention. The alphavirus virulence factor nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) suppresses the formation of stress granules (SGs)-a class of cytoplasmic condensates enriched with translation initiation factors and formed during the early stage of infection. nsP3 has a conserved N-terminal macrodomain that hydrolyzes ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and a C-terminal hypervariable domain that binds the essential SG component G3BP1. Here, we show that macrodomain hydrolase activity reduces the ADP-ribosylation of G3BP1, disassembles virus-induced SGs, and suppresses SG formation. Expression of nsP3 results in the formation of a distinct class of condensates that lack translation initiation factors but contain G3BP1 and other SG-associated RNA-binding proteins. Expression of ADP-ribosylhydrolase-deficient nsP3 results in condensates that retain translation initiation factors as well as RNA-binding proteins, similar to SGs. Therefore, our data reveal that ADP-ribosylation controls the composition of biomolecular condensates, specifically the localization of translation initiation factors, during alphavirus infection.","output":"Stress granule formation, disassembly, and composition are regulated by alphavirus ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the most recent global pandemic that has caused more than a million deaths around the world.

Spain has had one of the highest burdens of COVID-19 worldwide. During this period, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Burn Center (Barcelona) has faced a unique challenge: supporting the hospital response against COVID whilst continued offering an optimal care to the burn patient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of acute burn patients who received urgent health care or admission to the our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of burn patients who received urgent care and/or admission to our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain (Period 1: from March 14th to May 9th, 2020) and during the same period of the last year (Period 2: from March 14th to May 9th, 2019). Both groups were compared in order to find differences in the epidemiologic profile of burned patients. RESULTS: A total of 350 burns cases were analyzed. A 36% reduction in the number of emergency department visits was identified during Period 1. However, we found an increase in the rate of hospital admissions in Period 1 (20% of the burn cases) compared with Period 2 (13% of the burn cases). Seventy-six burn-related primary admissions were analyzed: 37 patients were admitted during Period 1 and 39 patients during Period 2. No differences were found between the two periods in the proportion of patients that underwent surgical treatment: 59.5% of patients admitted during Period 1 and 61.5% of patients admitted during Period 2. A statistically significant increase was noted in the rate of paediatric (aged 0-16 years old) admissions during Period 1 (40.54%, n = 15) compared to Period 2 (20.5%, n = 8). Among paediatric patients, an increase in the rate of surgical procedures was noted in Period 1 (47% of children), compared with Period 2 (37% of children). Proportion of patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit was higher among burn children admitted during period 1 (46.7%, n = 7) than those admitted during Period 2 (25%, n = 2). Among the 37 patients admitted during the lockdown period, two positive COVID-19 patients were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives an overview of the clinical and epidemiologic profile of burned patients during the stringent lockdown in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our data shows a stable trend in the number of burn-related admissions and burn related-surgeries during the confinement period. A significant increase in the rate of burn children admitted and an increase in the severity of injuries in this population is noted.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with anaemia, and to further explore the relationship between anaemia and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, a total of 222 confirmed patients admitted to Wuhan Ninth Hospital from December 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 were recruited, including 79 patients with anaemia and 143 patients without anaemia. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, disease progression and prognosis were collected and analyzed. Risk factors associated with the severe illness in COVID-19 were established by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULT: In our cohort, compared to patients without anaemia, patients with anaemia were more likely to have one or more comorbidities and severe COVID-19 illness. More patients demonstrated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and creatinine in anaemia group. Levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer, myoglobin, T-pro brain natriuretic peptide (T-pro-BNP) and urea nitrogen (BUN) in patients with anaemia were significantly higher than those without. In addition, the proportion of patients with dyspnoea, elevated CRP and PCT was positively associated with the severity of anaemia. The Odd Ratio (OR) of anaemia related to the severe condition of COVID-19 was 3.47(95% CI: 1.02-11.75, P=0.046) and 3.77 (95% CI:1.33-10.71, P=0.013) after adjustment for baseline date and laboratory indices, respectively.

METHODS: We performed an observational prospective cohort study of 24,769 healthcare workers from 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, enrolled between April 10, 2020 and June 30, 2021, and evaluated participant experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including testing, diagnosis with COVID-19, emotional experiences, burnout, and interest in vaccines and vaccine clinical trials. FINDINGS: After adjustment for professional role, medical history, and community characteristics, Black and Asian participants were less likely to receive SARS-CoV-2 viral testing (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 082 [070, 096], p=0012 and aOR 077 [067, 089], p<0001 respectively) than White participants. Hispanic participants were more likely to have evidence of COVID-19 infection (aOR 123 (100, 150, p=0048). Black and Asian participants were less likely to report interest in a COVID-19 vaccine (aOR 011 [005, 025], p<0001 and aOR 048 [027, 085] p=0012). Black participants were less likely to report interest in participating in a COVID-19 vaccine trial (aOR = 039 [028, 054], p<0001). Black participants were also less likely to report 3 or more daily emotional impacts of COVID-19 (aOR = 066 [053, 082], p=<0001).

We tested 2 lymphedema prevention interventions and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group-randomized trial at 38 cooperative group sites within the United States. METHODS Patients were recruited before breast surgery. Sites were randomly assigned to education-only (EO) lymphedema prevention or education plus exercise and physical therapy (LEAP). Lymphedema was defined as a 10% difference in arm volume at any time from baseline to 18 months postsurgery. HRQOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 4 lymphedema items (FACT-B+4). Longitudinal mixed model regression analysis, adjusting for key demographic and clinical variables, examined participants' HRQOL by intervention group and lymphedema status. RESULTS A total of 547 patients (56% LEAP) were enrolled and completed HRQOL assessments. The results revealed no differences between the interventions in preventing lymphedema (P = .37) or HRQOL (FACT-B+4 total score; P = .8777). At 18 months, the presence of lymphedema was associated with HRQOL at borderline significance (P = .0825). However, African American patients reported greater lymphedema symptoms (P = .0002) and better emotional functioning (P = .0335) than patients of other races or ethnicities. Lower HRQOL during the intervention was associated with younger age (P  .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >0 (P = .0002), 1 positive lymph nodes (P = .0009), having no education beyond high school (P < .0001), having undergone chemotherapy (P = .0242), and having had only axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy versus both (P = .0007). CONCLUSION The tested interventions did not differ in preventing lymphedema or in HRQOL outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 31 (20 male, 11 female) cases (with 38 eyes) who underwent secondary IAC and/or IVC between February 2010 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Thirteen (41.9%) cases had unilateral and 18 (58.1%) had bilateral RB. According to the International Classification of RB, 6 (15.8%) eyes had group B, 9 (23.7%) eyes had group C, 16 (42.1%) eyes had group D, and 7 (18.4%) eyes had group E RB at diagnosis. All patients underwent six-cycle intravenous chemotherapy as primary treatment and 8 eyes received external radiotherapy before IAC/IVC. Secondary IAC was performed in 21 (55.3%) eyes, IVC in 10 (26.3%) eyes, and IAC + IVC in 7 (18.4%) eyes. External radiotherapy was applied in 2 (5.3%) eyes after IAC/IVC, one of which was later enucleated. In total, 17 (44.7%) eyes undergoing secondary IAC/IVC treatments were enucleated. Metastasis and death were not observed in any case during the mean follow-up period of 59.3 (median 61, range: 10-98) months. DISCUSSION: Although 60.5% of the eyes undergoing IAC/IVC consisted of groups D and E RB, globe salvage and survival rates were 55.3% and 100.0%, respectively. External radiotherapy was required in 5.3% of the eyes after IAC/IVC. In conclusion, IAC and IVC are safe and effective treatment methods in eyes with RB unresponsive to other eye-preserving treatments and those demonstrating recurrence.","output":"Secondary intra-arterial chemotherapy and/or intravitreal chemotherapy as salvage treatment for retinoblastoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background There is a critical need for rapid viral infection diagnostics to enable prompt case identification in pandemic settings and support targeted antimicrobial prescribing. Methods Using untargeted high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we compared the admission serum metabolome of emergency department patients with viral infections including COVID-19, bacterial infections, inflammatory conditions, and healthy controls. Sera from an independent cohort of emergency department patients admitted with viral or bacterial infections underwent profiling to validate findings. Associations between whole-blood gene expression and the identified metabolite of interest were examined. Findings. 3'-Deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine (ddhC), a free base of the only known human antiviral small molecule ddhC-triphosphate (ddhCTP), was detected for the first time in serum. When comparing 60 viral to 101 non-viral cases in the discovery cohort, ddhC was the most differentially abundant metabolite, generating an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.954 (95% CI: 0.923-0.986). In the validation cohort, ddhC was again the most significantly differentially abundant metabolite when comparing 40 viral to 40 bacterial cases, generating an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI 0.708-0.915). Transcripts of viperin and CMPK2, enzymes responsible for ddhCTP synthesis, were amongst the five genes most highly correlated to ddhC abundance. Conclusions The antiviral precursor molecule ddhC is detectable in serum and an accurate marker for acute viral infection. Interferon-inducible genes viperin and CMPK2 are implicated in ddhC production in vivo. These findings highlight a future diagnostic role for ddhC in viral diagnosis, pandemic preparedness, and acute infection management.","output":"Antiviral metabolite 3'-Deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine is detectable in serum and identifies acute viral infections including COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent studies have revealed the unique virological characteristics of Omicron, the newest SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, such as pronounced resistance to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies, less efficient cleavage of the spike protein, and poor fusogenicity.

Here, we show that the representative characteristics of the Omicron spike are determined by its receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that the acquisition of the spike S375F mutation was closely associated with the explosive spread of Omicron in the human population. We further elucidate that the F375 residue forms an interprotomer pi-pi interaction with the H505 residue in another protomer in the spike trimer, which confers the attenuated spike cleavage efficiency and fusogenicity of Omicron.

We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with CPAP and determine predictors of CPAP response. Design This was a retrospective observational cohort study. Setting The study took place in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Royal Papworth Hospital (RPH) in Cambridge, UK. Patients We included all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who were transferred from neighbouring hospitals between 14th March and 6th May, 2020 for consideration of ventilatory support. Intervention We instituted the use of CPAP for all patients who arrived in RPH not intubated and were not making satisfactory progress on supplemental oxygen alone. Measurements and main results Of 33 self-ventilating patients included in this study, 22 (66.7%) were male and the mean age was 54  13.23 patients received CPAP. They were more hypoxaemic than those treated with oxygen alone (PaO2/FiO2 ratio;84.3  19.0 vs 170.0  46.0 mmHg, p = 0.001). There was a significant improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio 1C2 hours after CPAP initiation (167.4  49.0 from 84.3  19.0 mmHg, p = 0.001). 14 (61%) patients responded to CPAP and 9 required intubation. There was no difference between these two groups in terms of the severity of baseline hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio;84.5  16.0 vs 83.9  23.0 mmHg, p = 0.94) but CPAP responders had significantly lower C-reactive protein (CRP) (176  83 vs 274  63 mg/L, p = 0.007), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (30  47 vs 139  148 pg/mL, p = 0.037), and D-dimer (321  267 vs 941 + 1990 ng/mL, p = 0.003). CT pulmonary angiogram was performed in 6 out of 9 intubated patients and demonstrated pulmonary emboli in 5 of them. All patients were discharged from ICU and there were no fatalities. Conclusions In this cohort, CPAP was an effective treatment modality to improve hypoxaemia and prevent invasive ventilation in a substantial proportion of patients with severe respiratory failure. Accepting the small sample size, we also found raised biomarkers of inflammation (CRP and IL-6) and coagulopathy (D-Dimer) to be more useful predictors of CPAP responsiveness than the severity of hypoxaemia, and could help to guide intubation decisions in this clinical setting.","output":"Positive role of continuous positive airway pressure for intensive care unit patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia: A single centre experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globally there is a care crisis in terms of the quantity of care needed for an aging population and the quality of both the care provided and work conditions of those providing this care.

However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. RESULTS: Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers.

The results from Bayesian multi-model inference analyses showed that GRA and IU were more powerful predictors of fear responses than demographic variables. Moreover, the predictive power of these constructs was independent of general anxiety- and depression levels. Subsequent mediation analyses showed that the effects of GRA and IU were both direct and indirect via anxiety.

The location-based air pollution observations were converted to a raster surface using interpolation. The deaths and positive cases are reported so far were found highest in Mumbai (436 and 11394), followed by Ahmedabad (321 and 4991), Pune (129 and 2129), Kolkata (99 and 783), Indore (83 and 1699), Jaipur (53 and 1111), Ujjain (42 and 201), Surat (37 and 799), Vadodara (31 and 400), Chennai (23 and 2647), Bhopal (22 and 652), Thane (21 and 1889), respectively. Unlike the other studies, this study has not found any substantial association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences at the district level. Considering the number of confirmed cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) values estimated as 0.003 for PM2.5, 0.002 for PM10 and SO2, 0.001 for CO, and 0.0002 for NO2, respectively. This suggests an absolute no significant association between air pollution and COVID-19 incidences (both confirmed cases and death) in India. The same association was observed for the number of deaths as well. For COVID-19 confirmed cases, none of the five pollutants has exhibited any statistically significant association. Additionally, except the wind speed, the climate variables have no produced any statistically significant association with the COVID-19 incidences.","output":"COVID-19 incidences and its association with environmental quality: A country-level assessment in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is evidence that young people generally self-manage their mental health using self-care strategies, coping methods and other self-management techniques, which may better meet their needs or be preferable to attending specialist mental health services. LGBTQ+ young people are more likely than their peers to experience a mental health difficulty and may be less likely to draw on specialist support due to fears of discrimination. However, little is known about LGBTQ+ young peoples experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health. Using a multimodal qualitative design, 20 LGBTQ+ young people participated in a telephone interview or an online focus group. A semi-structured schedule was employed to address the research questions, which focussed on LGBTQ+ young peoples experiences and perceptions of self-managing their mental health, what they perceived to stop or help them to self-manage and any perceived challenges to self-management specifically relating to being LGBTQ+ . Reflexive thematic analysis yielded three key themes: (1) self-management strategies and process, (2) barriers to self-management and (3) facilitators to self-management. Participants most frequently mentioned self-management strategy was speaking to or meeting up with friends or a partner. Both barriers and facilitators to self-management were identified which participants perceived to relate to LGBTQ+ identity.

Prevention of epidemic rebound is a top priority of current works. However, information regarding post-discharge quarantine and surveillance of recovered patients with COVID-19 is scarce. Methods: This study followed up 337 patients with COVID-19 in a Wuhan East-West Lake Fangcang shelter hospital during the post-discharge quarantine. Demographic, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and chest computed tomography (CT) image, mental state, medication status, and nucleic acid test data were summarized and analyzed. Results: 21/337 (6.2%) patients were SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid re-positive, and 4 /337(1.2%) patients were suspected positive. The median day interval between the discharge to nucleic acid re-positivity was 7.5 days (IQR, 6C13), ranging from 6 to 13 days. Cough/expectoration are the most common symptoms, followed by chest congestion/dyspnea during the 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine. Risk factors of nucleic acid re-positivity including the number of lobes infiltration (odds ratio[OR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09C1.19), distribution (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.13C0.19), CT imaging feature of patchy shadowing accompanying with consolidation (OR, 9.36; 95% CI, 7.84C11.17), respiratory symptoms of cough accompanying with expectoration (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.28C1.52), and chest congestion accompanying by dyspnea (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28C1.57). Conclusion: The 2 weeks post-discharge quarantine may be an effective measure to prevent the outbreak from rebounding from the recovered patients. The second week is a critical period during post-discharge quarantine. Special attention should be paid to cough, expectoration, chest congestion, and dyspnea in recovered COVID-19 patients. A few recovered patients may prolong the quarantine based on clinical symptoms and signs and nucleic acid results in the 2 weeks of medical observation.","output":"Medium Term Follow-Up of 337 Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic creates a significant threat to global health.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 28 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 145 CT scans are collected. The lesions are detected automatically and the parameters including lesion volume (LeV/mL), lesion percentage to lung volume (LeV%), mean lesion density (MLeD/HU), low attenuation area lower than - 400HU (LAA-400%), and lesion weight (LM/mL*HU) are computed for quantification. The dynamic changes of lungs are traced from the day of initial symptoms to the day of discharge. The lesion distribution among the five lobes and the dynamic changes in each lobe are also analyzed. RESULTS: LeV%, MLeD, and LM reach peaks on days 9, 6 and 8, followed by a decrease trend in the next two weeks. LAA-400% (mostly the ground glass opacity) declines to the lowest on days 4-5, and then increases. The lesion is mostly seen in the bilateral lower lobes, followed by the left upper lobe, right upper lobe and right middle lobe (pa<a0.05). The right middle lobe is the earliest one (on days 6-7), while the right lower lobe is the latest one (on days 9-10) that reaches to peak among the five lobes.

We seek to understand if these pandemic-related behaviors impact subsequent mental health. METHODS: Daily online survey data were collected on adults during May/June 2020. Measures were of daily physical and virtual (online) contact with others; substance and media use; and indices of psychological striving, struggling and COVID-related worry. Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel analysis, dynamic within-person cross-lagged effects were separated from more static individual differences. RESULTS: In total, 1148 participants completed daily surveys [657 (57.2%) females, 484 (42.1%) males; mean age 40.6 (s.d. 12.4) years]. Daily increases in news consumed increased COVID-related worrying the next day [cross-lagged estimate = 0.034 (95% CI 0.018C0.049), FDR-adjusted p = 0.00005] and vice versa [0.03 (0.012C0.048), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0017]. Increased media consumption also exacerbated subsequent psychological struggling [0.064 (0.03C0.098), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0005]. There were no significant cross-lagged effects of daily changes in social distancing or virtual contact on later mental health. CONCLUSIONS: We delineate a cycle wherein a daily increase in media consumption results in a subsequent increase in COVID-related worries, which in turn increases daily media consumption. Moreover, the adverse impact of news extended to broader measures of psychological struggling. A similar dynamic did not unfold between the daily amount of physical or virtual contact and subsequent mental health.

Therefore, the food industry has an increasing tendency to apply the nutrients (like vitamins, essential fatty acids and minerals) and replace synthetic additives with natural bioactives (like phenolics and essential oils) to produce functional products. However, low dispersibility and shelf-stability as well as presenting unpleasant taste and odor are the most critical barriers for direct incorporation of these useful compounds into foods. In this context, nanoencapsulation has been proposed as a relatively new solution to overcome the mentioned limitations. However, fewer studies have focused on incorporating the bioactive-loaded nanocarriers into the food matrices. This study intends to help the development of functional food production by doing an exhaustive review on the incorporation of nanoencapsulated ingredients into the real food system and resulted interaction of nanocarriers and food products. According to the literature, incorporation of the nanoencapsulated bioactive ingredients into foods can be effectively used to enhance their stability during the processing and storage stage and their bioavailability as well as to delay lipid oxidation and microbial growth in food, without negatively affecting physicochemical, organoleptic and qualitative properties. However, some published results to date declared that food matrix might adversely affect the bioavailability and antimicrobial activity of nanoencapsulated ingredients.

However, animal studies demonstrate that high initial CPAP levels (12C15 cmH(2)O) which are then reduced (termed physiological based (PB)-CPAP), improve lung aeration without adversely affecting cardiovascular function. We investigated the feasibility of PB-CPAP and the effect in preterm infants at birth. Methods: Preterm infants (24C30 weeks gestation) were randomized to PB-CPAP or 5C8 cmH(2)O CPAP for the first 10 min after birth. PB-CPAP consisted of 15 cmH(2)O CPAP that was decreased when infants were stabilized (heart rate 100 bpm, SpO(2) 85%, FiO(2)  0.4, spontaneous breathing) to 8 cmH(2)O with steps of ~2/3 cmH(2)O/min. Primary outcomes were feasibility and SpO(2) in the first 5 min after birth. Secondary outcomes included physiological and breathing parameters and short-term neonatal outcomes. Planned enrollment was 42 infants. Results: The trial was stopped after enrolling 31 infants due to a low inclusion rate and recent changes in the local resuscitation guideline that conflict with the study protocol. Measurements were available for analysis in 28 infants (PB-CPAP n = 8, 5C8 cmH(2)O n = 20). Protocol deviations in the PB-CPAP group included one infant receiving 3 inflations with 15 cmH(2)O PEEP and two infants in which CPAP levels were decreased faster than described in the study protocol. In the 5C8 cmH(2)O CPAP group, three infants received 4, 10, and 12 cmH(2)O CPAP. During evaluations, caregivers indicated that the current PB-CPAP protocol was difficult to execute. The SpO(2) in the first 5 min after birth was not different [61 (49C70) vs. 64 (47C74), p = 0.973]. However, infants receiving PB-CPAP achieved higher heart rates [121 (111C130) vs. 97 (82C119) bpm, p = 0.016] and duration of mask ventilation was shorter [0:42 (0:34C2:22) vs. 2:58 (1:36C6:03) min, p = 0.020]. Infants in the PB-CPAP group required 6:36 (5:49-11:03) min to stabilize, compared to 9:57 (6:58C15:06) min in the 5C8 cmH2O CPAP group (p = 0.256). There were no differences in short-term outcomes. Conclusion: Stabilization of preterm infants with PB-CPAP is feasible but tailoring CPAP appeared challenging. PB-CPAP did not lead to higher SpO(2) but increased heart rate and shortened the duration of mask ventilation, which may reflect faster lung aeration.","output":"Feasibility and Effect of Physiological-Based CPAP in Preterm Infants at Birth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of individuals and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Predicting mortality among patients with COVID-19 who present with a spectrum of complications is very difficult, hindering the prognostication and management of the disease. We aimed to develop an accurate prediction model of COVID-19 mortality using unbiased computational methods, and identify the clinical features most predictive of this outcome. METHODS: In this prediction model development and validation study, we applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, NY, USA, to predict mortality. We analysed patient-level data captured in the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse database for individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had a health system encounter between March 9 and April 6, 2020. For initial analyses, we used patient data from March 9 to April 5, and randomly assigned (80:20) the patients to the development dataset or test dataset 1 (retrospective). Patient data for those with encounters on April 6, 2020, were used in test dataset 2 (prospective). We designed prediction models based on clinical features and patient characteristics during health system encounters to predict mortality using the development dataset. We assessed the resultant models in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score in the test datasets. FINDINGS: Using the development dataset (n=3841) and a systematic machine learning framework, we developed a COVID-19 mortality prediction model that showed high accuracy (AUC=091) when applied to test datasets of retrospective (n=961) and prospective (n=249) patients. This model was based on three clinical features: patient's age, minimum oxygen saturation over the course of their medical encounter, and type of patient encounter (inpatient vs outpatient and telehealth visits). INTERPRETATION: An accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality prediction model based on three features might have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and prognostication of patients affected by this disease. External validation of this prediction model in other populations is needed.

To investigate this potential, we redirected the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is normally unable to infect human cells, to human tumor cells by using a soluble receptor (soR)-based expression construct fused to an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor targeting moiety. Addition of this adapter protein to MHV allowed infection of otherwise nonsusceptible, EGF receptor (EGFR)-expressing cell cultures. We introduced the sequence encoding the adaptor protein soR-EGF into the MHV genome to generate a self-targeted virus capable of multiround infection. The resulting recombinant MHV was viable and had indeed acquired the ability to infect all glioblastoma cell lines tested in vitro. Infection of malignant human glioblastoma U87DeltaEGFR cells gave rise to release of progeny virus and efficient cell killing in vitro. To investigate the oncolytic capacity of the virus in vivo, we used an orthotopic U87DeltaEGFR xenograft mouse model. Treatment of mice bearing a lethal intracranial U87DeltaEGFR tumor by injection with MHVsoR-EGF significantly prolonged survival compared to phosphate-buffered saline-treated (P = 0.001) and control virus-treated (P = 0.004) animals, and no recurrent tumor load was observed.

OAA homologues bind high-mannose glycans on viral surface proteins, thereby interfering with viral entry into host cells. As such, OAA homologues have potential utility as antiviral agents, but a more detailed understanding of their structureCfunction relationships would enable us to develop improved constructs. Here, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of free and glycan-bound forms of Pseudomonas taiwanensis lectin (PTL), an OAA-family lectin consisting of two tandem repeats. Like other OAA-family lectins, PTL exhibited a -barrel-like structure with two symmetrically positioned glycan-binding sites at the opposite ends of the barrel. Upon glycan binding, the conformation of PTL undergoes a more significant change than expected from previous OAA structural analysis. Moreover, the electron density of the bound glycans suggested that the binding affinities are different at the two binding sites. Next, based on analysis of these structures, we used site-specific mutagenesis to create PTL constructs expected to increase the population with a conformation suitable for glycan binding. The engineered PTLs were examined for their antiviral activity against the influenza virus. Interestingly, some exhibited stronger activity compared with that of the parent PTL. We propose that our approach is effective for the generation of potential microbicides with enhanced antiviral activity.","output":"Lectins engineered to favor a glycan-binding conformation have enhanced antiviral activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus replication is closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the primary cellular organelle for protein synthesis, folding, and modification. ER stress is a common consequence in coronavirus-infected cells. However, how the virus-induced ER stress influences coronavirus replication and pathogenesis remains controversial. Here, we demonstrated that infection with the alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) induced ER stress and triggered the unfolded protein response (UPR) in vitro and in vivo, and ER stress negatively regulated TGEV replication in vitro Although TGEV infection activated all three UPR pathways (activating transcription factor 6 [ATF6], inositol-requiring enzyme 1 [IRE1], and protein kinase R-like ER kinase [PERK]), the virus-triggered UPR suppressed TGEV replication in both swine testicular (ST) and IPEC-J2 cells primarily through activation of the PERK-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) axis, as shown by functional studies with overexpression, small interfering RNA (siRNA), or specific chemical inhibitors. Moreover, we demonstrated that PERK-eIF2 axis-mediated inhibition of TGEV replication occurs through phosphorylated eIF2-induced overall attenuation of protein translation. In addition to direct inhibition of viral production, the PERK-eIF2 pathway activated NF-B and then facilitated type I IFN production, resulting in TGEV suppression. Taken together, our results suggest that the TGEV-triggered PERK-eIF2 pathway negatively regulates TGEV replication and represents a vital aspect of host innate responses to invading pathogens.IMPORTANCE The induction of ER stress is a common outcome in cells infected with coronaviruses. The UPR initiated by ER stress is actively involved in viral replication and modulates the host innate responses to the invading viruses, but these underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We show here that infection with the alphacoronavirus TGEV elicited ER stress in vitro and in vivo, and the UPR PERK-eIF2 branch was predominantly responsible for the suppression of TGEV replication by ER stress. Furthermore, the PERK-eIF2 axis inhibited TGEV replication through direct inhibition of viral proteins due to global translation inhibition and type I IFN induction. These findings highlight a critical role of the UPR PERK-eIF2 pathway in modulating host innate immunity and coronavirus replication.","output":"The PERK Arm of the Unfolded Protein Response Negatively Regulates Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus Replication by Suppressing Protein Translation and Promoting Type I Interferon Production."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and has since spread to 26 countries. All cases reported so far have either been in the Middle East or linked to the region through passenger air travel, with the largest outbreak outside KSA occurring in South Korea. Further international spread is likely due to the high travel volumes of global travel, as well as the occurrence of large annual mass gathering such as the Haj and Umrah pilgrimages that take place in the region. Methods: In this study, a transport network modelling framework was used to quantify the risk of MERS-CoV spreading internationally via air travellers. All regions connected to MERS-CoV affected countries via air travel are considered, and the countries at highest risk of travel-related importations of MERS-CoV were identified, ranked and compared with actual spread of MERS cases. Results: The model identifies all countries that have previously reported a travel acquired case to be in the top 50 at-risk countries. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the highest risk countries which have yet to report a case, and should be prepared for the possibility of (pilgrims and general) travellers returning infected with MERS-CoV. In addition, the UK, Egypt, Turkey and the USA are at risk of more cases. Conclusions: We have demonstrated a risk-analysis approach, using travel patterns, to prioritize countries at highest risk for MERS-CoV importations. In order to prevent global outbreaks such as the one seen in South Korea, it is critical for high-risk countries to be prepared and have appropriate screening and triage protocols in place to identify travel-related cases of MERS-CoV. The results from the model can be used by countries to prioritize their airport and hospital screening and triage protocols.","output":"Risk of global spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) via the air transport network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We compared complete blood count (CBC) with differential and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to emergency departments in Seattle, WA.

Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 has gained a novel spike protein S1CN-terminal domain (S1-NTD). In our CLuster ANalysis of Sequences (CLANS) analysis, SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S1-NTDs displayed a close relationship with OC43 and HKU1. However, in the complete and S1-NTD-free spike protein, SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 revealed closeness with MERS-CoV. Further, we have divided the S1-NTD of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses into three distinct types (Type-I to III S1-NTD) and the S1-NTD of viruses associated with SARS-CoVs into another three classes (Type-A to C S1-NTD) using CLANS and phylogenetic analyses. In particular, the results of our study indicate that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and BANAL-20-52 viruses carry Type-I-S1-NTD and other SARS-CoV-2-related-bat viruses have Type-II and III. In addition, it was revealed that the Pangolin-GX and Pangolin-Guangdong lineages inherited Type-I-like and TypeCIIClike S1-NTD, respectively. Then our CLANS study shows the potential for evolution of Type-I and Type-III S1-NTD from SARS-CoV-related viruses Type-A and Type-B S1-NTDs, respectively. Furthermore, our analysis clarifies the possibility that Type-II S1-NTDs may have evolved from Type-A-S1-NTD of SARS-CoV-related viruses through Type-I S1-NTDs. We also observed that BANAL-20-103, BANAL-20-236, and Pangolin-Guangdong-lineage viruses containing TypeCIIClike S1-NTD are very close to SARS-CoV-2 in spike genetic areas other than S1-NTD. Possibly, it suggests that the common ancestor spike gene of SARS-CoV-2/RaTG13/BANAL-20-52-like virus may have evolved by recombining the Pangolin-Guangdong/BANAL-20-103/BANAL-20-236-like spike gene to Pangolin-GX-like Type-I-like-S1-NTD in the unsampled bat or undiscovered intermediate host or possibly pangolin. These may then have evolved into SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and BANAL-20-52 virus spike genes by host jump mediated evolution. The potential function of the novel Type-I-S1-NTD and other types of S1-NTDs needs to be studied further to understand better its importance in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and for future pandemic preparedness.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 gained a novel spike protein S1CN-Terminal Domain (S1-NTD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent years, diabetes has evolved into a non-communicable disease pandemic with data showing that one out of ten adults in the world have diabetes. Among various factors that contribute to this rising trend in diabetes, one factor that is of paramount importance is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Maternal hyperglycemia sets off a vicious cycle that affects not only the mother and her child but also the generations to come. There are many criteria that are used for the diagnosis of GDM. Almost all of these criteria require the pregnant woman to be in the fasting state in order to perform an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In many parts of the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries, OGTT is a resource-intensive and technically demanding procedure. More often than not, pregnant women do not attend the antenatal clinic fasting. If they are asked to come fasting again for the OGTT, the drop-out rate is increased. Thus, for practical purposes, a test that is feasible on the ground is essential. In this paper, we emphasize a \\"single-test\\" procedure wherein a 75-gram oral glucose load is administered to the pregnant woman irrespective of whether she is in the fasting state or not, and plasma glucose is measured at two hours. A plasma glucose value  140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) at two hours is considered diagnostic of GDM. The single-test procedure was found to be a sustainable, cost-effective, evidence-based, and affordable test procedure for any society. It serves both as a screening test and a diagnostic test for GDM. Furthermore, we emphasize the need for universal screening of all pregnant women who attend the antenatal clinics to detect dysglycemia, especially in the early weeks of pregnancy when the impact on the growing fetus would be significant.","output":"Diagnosing Gestational Diabetes by a Single-Test Procedure Is a Propitious Step Towards Containing the Epidemic of Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

This lockdown affected significantly the atmospheric pollution levels due to the restrictions of human activities. In the present study, we investigate the evolution of air quality in the Auvergne-Rh?ne-Alpes region, focusing on nine atmospheric pollutants (NO2, NO, PM10, PM2.5, O3, VOC, CO, SO2, and isoprene). In Lyon, center of the region, the results indicated that NO2, NO, and CO levels were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in a decrease in road traffic by 80%. However, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 were increased by 105%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is explained by the dropping in NO and other gases linked to human activity, which consume ozone. Thus, the increase of solar radiation, sunshine, temperature, and humidity promoted the O3 formation during the lockdown. Besides, rising temperature enhances the BVOC emissions such as isoprene. In addition, volatile organic component (VOC) and SO2 remain almost stable and oxidation of these species leads to the formation of ozone and organic aerosol, which also explains the increase in PM during the lockdown.

The virus surface spike protein of SARS CoV-2 mediates viral entry into cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor on epithelial cells and promoting fusion. We find that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces ACE2 expression when it enters the lytic replicative cycle in epithelial cells. By using VSV particles pseudotyped with the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, we show that lytic EBV replication enhances ACE2-dependent SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. We find that the ACE2 promoter contains response elements for Zta, an EBV transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV entry into the lytic cycle of replication. Zta preferentially acts on methylated promoters, allowing it to reactivate epigenetically silenced EBV promoters from latency. By using promoter assays, we show that Zta directly activates methylated ACE2 promoters. Infection of normal oral keratinocytes with EBV leads to lytic replication in some of the infected cells, induces ACE2 expression and enhances SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. These data suggest that subclinical EBV replication and lytic gene expression in epithelial cells, which is ubiquitous in the human population, may enhance the efficiency and extent of SARS CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells by transcriptionally activating ACE2 and increasing its cell surface expression.ImportanceSARS CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has caused a pandemic leading to millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Identifying the factors governing susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 is important in order to develop strategies to prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. We show that Epstein-Barr virus, which infects and persists in >90% of adult humans, increases susceptibility of epithelial cells to infection by SARS CoV-2. EBV, when it reactivates from latency or infects epithelial cells, increases expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS CoV-2, enhancing infection by SARS CoV-2.

The chronic pain associated with diagnosed patients may include heavy medical expenditure along with the physical and mental suffering they undergo. Usually, unbearable amounts of medical expenses are incurred, to improve or sustain the health condition of the patient. Consequently, the heavy financial burden tends to push households from a comfortable or secure life, or even from bad to worse, towards the probability of becoming poor. Hence, this study is conducted to identify the impact chronic illnesses have on poverty using data from a national survey referred as the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), with data gathered by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka in 2016. As such, this study is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, declaring the originality of the study based on data collected from the local arena. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity, in the age category of 40C65, having an educational level of tertiary level or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. Moreover, it was inferred that, if a person is deprived from access to basic education in the level of education, lives in the rural or estate sector, or suffers from a brain disease, cancer, heart disease or kidney disease, he is highly likely to be poor. Some insights concluded from this Sri Lankan case study can also be applied in the context of other developing countries, to minimise chronic illnesses and thereby the probability of falling into poverty.","output":"Do chronic illnesses and poverty go hand in hand?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: No therapy is approved for COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to assess the role of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard of care treatment. Methods: This retrospective, observational cohort study included adults (18 years) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were admitted to tertiary care centres in Bologna and Reggio Emilia, Italy, between Feb 21 and March 24, 2020, and a tertiary care centre in Modena, Italy, between Feb 21 and April 30, 2020. All patients were treated with the standard of care (ie, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, antiretrovirals, and low molecular weight heparin), and a non-randomly selected subset of patients also received tocilizumab. Tocilizumab was given either intravenously at 8 mg/kg bodyweight (up to a maximum of 800 mg) in two infusions, 12 h apart, or subcutaneously at 162 mg administered in two simultaneous doses, one in each thigh (ie, 324 mg in total), when the intravenous formulation was unavailable. The primary endpoint was a composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and baseline Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Findings: Of 1351 patients admitted, 544 (40%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and were included in the study. 57 (16%) of 365 patients in the standard care group needed mechanical ventilation, compared with 33 (18%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab (p=041; 16 [18%] of 88 patients treated intravenously and 17 [19%] of 91 patients treated subcutaneously). 73 (20%) patients in the standard care group died, compared with 13 (7%; p&lt;00001) patients treated with tocilizumab (six [7%] treated intravenously and seven [8%] treated subcutaneously). After adjustment for sex, age, recruiting centre, duration of symptoms, and SOFA score, tocilizumab treatment was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 061, 95% CI 040C092; p=0020). 24 (13%) of 179 patients treated with tocilizumab were diagnosed with new infections, versus 14 (4%) of 365 patients treated with standard of care alone (p&lt;00001). Interpretation: Treatment with tocilizumab, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously, might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Sensing the level and distributions of impurities help in the control of building systems and mitigate long term health risks. Rapid detection of infectious diseases in large public areas like airports and train stations may help limit exposure and aid in reducing the spread of the disease. Complete coverage by sensors to account for any release scenario of chemical or biological warfare agents may provide the opportunity to develop isolation and evacuation plans that mitigate the impact of the attack. All these scenarios involve strategic placement of sensors to promptly detect and rapidly respond. This paper presents a data driven sensor placement algorithm based on a dynamical systems approach. The approach utilizes the finite dimensional Perron-Frobenius (PF) concept. The PF operator (or the Markov matrix) is used to construct an observability gramian that naturally incorporates sensor accuracy, location constraints, and sensing constraints. The algorithm determines the response times, sensor coverage maps, and the number of sensors needed. The utility of the procedure is illustrated using four examples: a literature example of the flow field inside an aircraft cabin and three air flow fields in different geometries. The effect of the constraints on the response times for different sensor placement scenarios is investigated. Knowledge of the response time and coverage of the multiple sensors aides in the design of mechanical systems and response mechanisms. The methodology provides a simple process for place sensors in a building, analyze the sensor coverage maps and response time necessary during extreme events, as well as evaluate indoor air quality. The theory established in this paper also allows for future work in topics related to construction of classical estimator problems for the sensors, real-time contaminant transport, and development of agent dispersion, contaminant isolation/removal, and evacuation strategies.","output":"A methodology for optimal placement of sensors in enclosed environments: A dynamical systems approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of our study was to describe patients with the p.D12Y variant (previously reported as D11Y) in SOD1 disclosing heterogeneous clinicopathological features.

We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30 days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant performance using the validation set. RESULTS: We analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34-0.35) for scores above four points.

Material and Methods: Sixty C19W (41M;age 539 yrs) admitted to Humanitas Research Hospital during the 2nd and 3rd outbreaks in Italy were consecutively enrolled at the time of hospital discharge (T0). Work Ability (WA) was assessed by the Work Ability Index (WAI) questionnaire after one month (T1) from hospital discharge. At T0, C19W were asked to retrospectively complete an additional questionnaire to assess their WA before COVID19 (PRE). The WAI score accounting for seven domains, ranges from 0 to 49 and provides a stratification in four WA categories. In the present study, we assessed the total WAI score at PRE and T1, in 33 C19W. Data are expressed as meanDS. The present study was approved by the Internal Review Board (#2742/2020). Results and conclusion: At PRE the WAI total score was 41.95.7 corresponding to good category work ability while at T1 was significantly lower (35.65.6;p<0.0001) corresponding to medium category work ability. Similar changes were observed in the WA domains except in the one exploring the Prognosis of WA 2 years from now.

METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients initially seen from January 2015 to December 2017 who experienced ovarian cancer recurrence during first clinical remission. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were performed to compare differences in detection methods and in patient and disease characteristics. RESULTS Among 147 patients who met our inclusion criteria, there were no recurrences detected by physical examination alone. Forty-six (31%) patients had recurrence first detected by tumor marker, 81 (55%) by radiographic scan, 17 (12%) by presentation of new symptoms, and 3 (2%) by biopsies taken during non-oncological surgery. One hundred and eleven patients (75%) had multiple positive findings at the time of recurrence. Of all 147 patients, 48 (33%) had symptoms, 21 (14%) had physical examination findings, 106 (72%) had increases in tumor markers, and 141 (96%) had changes on imaging. CONCLUSIONS In-person physical examination was not a primary means of detection for ovarian cancer recurrence for any patient. Substituting in-person visits for virtual visits that include patient-reported symptoms, alongside a regular surveillance protocol that includes tumor marker testing and imaging, may be a suitable approach for the detection of ovarian cancer recurrence while also reducing patient inconvenience and risks to health.","output":"Ovarian cancer recurrence detection may not require in-person physical examination: an MSK team ovary study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explores the impact of COVID-19, crude oil price, US economic policy uncertainty, baltic dry index, and the stock market volatility on the US bank indices.

In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor efficacies of the natural lipids palmitic acid (PA), sphingomyelin (SM), ceramide (Cer) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on breast cancer cells. All tested lipids reduced the malignancy of breast cancer cells in vitro by impairing cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness. PA showed superior anti-tumor properties, as it additionally impaired cancer cell viability by inducing apoptosis, without affecting healthy cells. Co-culture experiments further demonstrated that Cer and PA reduced the immunosuppressive phenotype of M2 macrophages and the M2 macrophage-promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration of breast cancer cells. At the molecular level, this coincided with the up-regulation of E-cadherin.

SCO-267 was orally administered to mice, which were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD), a mouse model for NAFLD. An oral dose of SCO-267 increased levels of circulating glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 in CDAHFD-fed mice. In a chronic dose experiment, effects of SCO-267 were compared with those of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (alogliptin) and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin). SCO-267 decreased liver triglyceride content, weight, and collagen content, and plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels without affecting food intake or glucose levels in CDAHFD-fed mice. Furthermore, SCO-267 decreased levels of liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), markers of oxidative stress.

When properly designed, fully synthetic routes can easily address these shortcomings(2).

This article will review developments from the past decade in attempt to build on existing knowledge. It will highlight clinical performance and limitations while reviewing developments on recognized procedures; it will also provide insight into novel approaches incorporated in response to clinical demand (e.g. C. auris and antifungal resistance) or technological advances (e.g. next-generation sequencing). RECENT FINDINGS: Limited methodological standardization and, until recently, unavailability of commercial options have hindered the integration of molecular diagnostics for yeasts. The development of certain, novel commercial methods has received considerable evaluation allowing a greater understanding of individual assay performance, but widespread multicentre evaluation of most commercial kits is lacking. The detection of emerging pathogens (e.g. C. auris) has been enhanced by the development of molecular tests. Molecular methods are providing a better understanding of the mycobiome, mechanisms of resistance and epidemiology/phylogeny. SUMMARY: Despite over two decades of use, the incorporation of molecular methods to enhance the diagnosis of yeast infections remains limited to certain specialist centres. While the development of commercial tests will provide stimulus for broader application, further validation and reduced costs are required. Over the same period of time, Aspergillus PCR has become more widely accepted driven by international efforts to standardize methodology; it is critical that yeast PCR follows suit. Next-generation sequencing will provide significant information on the mycobiome, antifungal resistance mechanism and even broad-range detection directly from the specimen, which may be critical for the molecular detection of yeasts other than Candida species, which is currently limited.","output":"Molecular Diagnosis of Yeast Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter stages a broad introduction to the overarching dearth of Asian literary and cultural texts in the field of memory and trauma studies in the contemporary framing of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to assess the causal effect of lipid-lowering drugs (HMGCR inhibitiors, PCSK9 inhibitiors, and NPC1L1 inhibitior) on COVID-19 outcomes using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. METHODS: We used two kinds of genetic instruments to proxy the exposure of lipid-lowering drugs, including expression quantitative trait loci of drugs target genes, and genetic variants within or nearby drugs target genes associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol from genome-wide association study). Summary-data-based MR (SMR) and inverse-variance-weighted MR (IVW-MR) were used to calculate the effect estimates. RESULTS: SMR analysis found that a higher expression of HMGCR was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06C1.81). Similarly, IVW-MR analysis observed a positive association between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.00C1.74).

It was found that data predominantly originated from single-center institutions (n = 25/29) and only two studies performed external validation. The median TRIPOD adherence was 0.48, indicating insufficient quality of reporting among surveyed studies.

The examined characteristics include perceived joy, stress, effort/fatigue, isolation, inclusiveness, and collaboration/interaction. Background The transition to emergency distance education had a large socio-emotional impact on teachers. Recent evidence certifies an increase in mental health issues like stress and load. Studies also recognized online teaching barriers including difficulties in communication and interaction with students. This study focuses on the examination of the socio-emotional characteristics of distance education as perceived by primary and secondary education teachers in Greece. The study also investigates differences between primary and secondary education, teaching disciplines, and the role of individual factors like gender, age, and experience. Methodology The study used a mixed-method research design with closed-ended and open-ended questions on a sample of 845 teachers of primary and secondary education in Greece. The closed-ended questionnaire consisted of 19 items of socioemotional DE characteristics, measured in a 5-point bipolar format. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)was conducted on 16 items, indicating three components: (a) effort/fatigue, (b) inclusiveness, and (c) collaboration/interactivity. A single-item scale was considered for joy, fatigue, stress, and isolation. The finalized measurement model was evaluated in terms of item loadings, reliability of measures, convergent, and discriminant validity, with the help of the SmartPLS software. Descriptive statistics and percentages were calculated with the help of SPSS software. Because of the non-normal distribution of the data, non-parametric methods of Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis were performed to examine significant differences in teacher groups. The qualitative part of the analysis was conducted on text data received from two open-ended questions, on a sample of 602 cases. The identified qualitative constructs were investigated through content thematic analysis focusing on the identification of the socio-emotional codes and references, excluding non-relevant themes and cases. Contribution The findings of the study contribute towards the deeper understanding of the teachers' psychological or emotional state during the early stage of the Covid-19 emergency DE, as well as on the role of individual and other factors like gender, age, teaching stage, and teaching subject. The results can be leveraged during or after the pandemic, to design pedagogical or psychological practices and strategies to encourage and facilitate the teachers' transition to DE. Findings A measurement model of the teachers' perceived socio-emotional characteristics towards emergency distance education was developed and validated. The model includes the components of: (a) effort/fatigue, (b) inclusiveness, (c) collaboration/interactivity, (d) isolation, (e) joy, and (f) stress. The quantitative results indicated that teachers experienced increased levels of fatigue, and perceived DE as difficult and time-consuming. Teachers of primary education reported significantly lower levels of perceived collaboration/interaction than secondary teachers. Female teachers reported significantly higher scores of both joy and stress, while the youngest age groups expressed the highest scores of joy. The teaching subject also revealed differences in fatigue. Through qualitative analysis, this study also identified several socio-emotional thematic codes revealing the teachers' difficulties in interaction and communication with students as well as a set of emotional attributes like fatigue, joy, and stress. Recommendations for Practitioners Teachers should modify their face-to-face teaching material and adjust it to online teaching principles, avoiding future load and frustration. Different approaches should be implemented in primary and secondary education and indifferent teaching disciplines. Also, teachers should be trained on DE-oriented digital skills, ICT competencies, and socio-emotional skills, e.g., by receiving psychological and socio-emotional support from experts. Strategies to decrease fatigue and stress, especially in synchronous teaching should be traced by schools and educators. Recommendations for Researchers The findings provide theoretical evidence on the teachers' socio-emotional attitude towards DE and their experiences in the first stages of the emergency remote education due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Impact on Society This research highlights the perceived DE characteristics and the barriers to online teaching during Covid-19. Schools, educators, and society should collaborate to provide awareness and opportunities for successful distance education practices. Future Research The survey is based on individual self-reported measures, and this restricts the deeper understanding of the findings. Hence, future research should extend this work by using different methods of data collection like for instance observations, course recordings, interviews, or focus groups.","output":"Socio-emotional Characteristics of Emergency Distance Teaching: a Mixed-method Investigation in Greece"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has upended healthcare systems worldwide and led to an inevitable decrease in liver transplantation (LT) activity.

In the analyses, the significance level was set at 0.05. The results show that men have higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, and academic self-efficacy than women do (p < 0.01); high levels of psychological distress correlate with high levels of anxiety (r = 0.580, p < 0.01) and low levels of satisfaction with studies (r = C0.178, p < 0.01) and academic self-efficacy (r = ?0.348, p < 0.01); high levels of anxiety correlate with low levels of satisfaction with studies (r = ?0.122, p < 0.01) and academic self-efficacy (r = C0.192, p < 0.01); and high levels of academic self-efficacy correlate with high levels of satisfaction with studies (r = 0.429, p < 0.01).

METHODS: Fifty-six CRAB isolates were tested for synergy between meropenem, gentamicin and ampicillin/sulbactam. MICs were determined by broth microdilution. Synergism was tested using chequerboard analysis, followed by a time-kill curve. Additionally, minimum biofilm eradication concentration was determined and the antibiofilm activity of the combinations was evaluated by MTT assay and biomass reduction. A test kit was developed for routine laboratory testing to detect synergism. RESULTS: All CRAB isolates were resistant to gentamicin and ampicillin/sulbactam. Chequerboard synergism occurred against 75% of the isolates. Meropenema+aampicillin/sulbactam was the most frequent combination with synergism (69%), followed by ampicillin/sulbactama+agentamicin (64%) and meropenema+agentamicin (51%).

Weight gain and sub-optimal dietary choices are common in young adults, and social media may be a potential tool to facilitate and support healthier choices. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review of studies examining social media use for nutrition-related outcomes in young adults. Seven databases [EBscohost, ERIC, ProQuest Central, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Emerald] were systematically searched; 1225 abstracts were screened, and 47 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Study designs included both quantitative, such as experimental and observational studies, and qualitative, such as focus groups and interviews, approaches. Quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Quantitative and qualitative results were examined separately, and then synthesized. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included although their use of social media was highly variable. The main purpose of social media was to provide information and social support to participants. In the nine randomized controlled trials, social media was used as one aspect of a multi-faceted intervention. Interventions had a positive statistically significant impact on nutritional outcomes in 1/9 trials. Engagement with the social media component of interventions varied, from 3 to 69%. Young adults appear to be open to receiving healthy eating and recipe tips through social media, however, they are reluctant to share personal weight-related information on their online social networks. CONCLUSIONS Information-dissemination is now an acceptable use of social media by young adults.

This adaptation of TAB for dense manifolds of states (TAB-DMS) is systematically improvable by increasing the number of computed approximate eigenstates. Application to a series of one-dimensional model problems demonstrates that TAB-DMS can be accurate when even a very modest number of approximate eigenstates are computed (four in all models tested here).

Nevertheless, these kidneys have the potential to fully recover. Tubular regeneration following acute kidney injury is driven by the regenerative potential of tubular cells originating from a tubular stem cell pool. We investigated urinary sediments of acute kidney injury transplanted patients and compared it to those of non-transplanted patients. Thereby we discovered tubular cell agglomerates, which have not been described in vivo. We hypothesized that these so-called nephrospheres were associated with recovery from acute kidney injury. METHODS Urine sediment of 45 kidney-transplanted and 19 non-transplanted individuals was investigated. Nephrospheres were isolated and stained for several molecular markers including aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and calcium sensing receptor (CASR). Nephrospheres were cultured to examine their growth behavior in vitro. In addition, quantitative PCR for CASR, AQP1, and podocin (NPHS2) was performed. RESULTS Nephrospheres were excreted in the urine of 17 kidney-transplant recipients 7 days after onset of acute kidney injury and were detectable over several days until kidney function was recovered to baseline creatinine levels. None were found in the urine of non-transplanted individuals. Nephrospheres were either AQP1+/CASR+ or AQP1-/CASR+ and could be cultured for 27 days. Mitotic cells could still be visualized after 17 days in culture. Quantitative PCR detected AQP1 in both kidney-transplanted and non-transplanted individuals during the phase of creatinine decline. As a limitation qPCR was only performed for the entire urinary sediment. CONCLUSIONS Nephrospheres are three dimensional tubular cell agglomerates which appeared in urine of kidney transplant recipients recovering from acute kidney injury. Appearance of nephrospheres in urine was independent of the duration after kidney transplantation. Nephrospheres proliferated in cell culture and kept expressing kidney specific marker.

The world-wide plague caused by the COVID-19 virus precipitated the first global police event presenting an occasion for researchers and scholars to apply existing theory and empirical understanding to extra-ordinary circumstances. Consideration of the politics of the police during the plague reveals a tectonic shift in the world system. The transnational and comparative study of police and policing reveals the contours of the emerging system of world power all the more clearly in a moment of crisis. The pandemic panic presents an historical moment during which, figuratively speaking, policing power crystalizes and can be seen clearly. On the global stage, in response to the pandemic panic authoritarian and totalitarian policing practices are demonstrated alongside those in putative democracies. Emerging and observable practices of rule by law are antithetical to democratic policing in the general social interest, and rule of law rhetoric justifying militarized law enforcement action in many places continues to bring police into further disrepute. The coming era will continue to be a time where, in most places the strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they mustas the ancient historian Thucydides observed in the aftermath of the fratricidal Peloponnesian War more than two millennia ago.

The Spike 614G variant subsequently increased in frequency in many locations throughout the world. Global patterns of dispersal of Spike 614G are suggestive of a selective advantage of this variant, however the origin of Spike 614G is associated with early colonization events in Europe and subsequent radiations to the rest of the world. Increasing frequency of 614G may therefore be due to a random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of Spike 614G at the level of an individual country, the United Kingdom, using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected by COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium. Using phylogenetic analysis, we identify Spike 614G and 614D clades with unique origins in the UK and from these we extrapolate and compare growth rates of co-circulating transmission clusters. We find that Spike 614G clusters are introduced in the UK later on average than 614D clusters and grow to larger size after adjusting for time of introduction. Phylodynamic analysis does not show a significant increase in growth rates for clusters with the 614G variant, but population genetic modelling indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We also investigate the potential influence of Spike 614D versus G on virulence by matching a subset of records to clinical data on patient outcomes. We do not find any indication that patients infected with the Spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 mortality, but younger patients have slightly increased odds of 614G carriage. Despite the availability of a very large data set, well represented by both Spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of higher transmission rate for 614G, but significant differences in growth, size, and composition of these lineages indicate a need for continued study.","output":"Evaluating the effects of SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation D614G on transmissibility and pathogenicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this literature review is to identify the effects of social isolation and lonliness on persons with dementia and to highlight interventions for private homes and long-term care facilities It includes articles published in the last 5 years for a total of 45 articles Social isolation and/or lonliness is linked to reduced quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and psychotropic drug use in people living with demential Interventions, including physical activity, should be individualized and patient centered","output":"Social Isolation in Dementia: The Effects of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology in stroke rehabilitation. VR is defined as a type of computer-user interface that implements real-time simulation of an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities. In a stroke population, VR interventions have been shown to enhance motor, cognitive, and psychological recovery when utilized as a rehabilitation adjunct. VR has also demonstrated noninferiority to usual care therapies for stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The proposed pilot study aims to (1) determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program and (2) estimate the initial clinical efficacy (effect size) associated with the VR platform using apps for pain distraction and upper extremity exercise for poststroke neurologic recovery. METHODS: This study will be conducted in the Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Rehabilitation Program at the James A Haley Veterans Hospital. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 10 clinical staff members to assess the feasibility of the VR platform from the clinician perspective. A prospective within-subject pretest-posttest pilot design will be used to examine the tolerability of the VR platform and the clinical outcomes (ie, upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, pain severity) in 10 veteran inpatients. A VR platform consisting of commercially available pain distraction and upper extremity apps will be available at the participants bedside for daily use during their inpatient stay (approximately 4-6 weeks). Clinician interviews will be analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Cohen d effect sizes with corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated for upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain. The proportion of participants who achieve minimal clinically important difference after using the VR platform will be calculated for each clinical outcome. RESULTS: This study was selected for funding in August 2020. Institutional review board approval was received in October 2020. The project start date was December 2020. The United States Department has issued a moratorium on in-person research activities secondary to COVID-19. Data collection will commence once this moratorium is lifted. CONCLUSIONS: Our next step is to conduct a large multi-site clinical trial that will incorporate the lessons learned from this pilot feasibility study to test the efficacy of a VR intervention in inpatient rehabilitation and transition to home environments. When VR is used in patients rooms, it serves to provide additional therapy and may reduce clinician burden. VR also presents an opportunity similar to home-based practice exercises. VR can be implemented in both clinical settings and peoples own homes, where engagement in ongoing self-management approaches is often most challenging. This unique experience offers the potential for seamless transition from inpatient rehabilitation to the home.

These often cause clinical deterioration, and potentially preventable admissions. Remote home monitoring of vital signs using internet-of-things technology can identify risk factors for these events - something particular pertinent during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present data from an on-going UK Dementia Research Institute and Technology Integrated Health Management (DRI-TIHM) project. We aim to define algorithms that generate automated alerts, like the hospital-based NEWS system (Morgan, 1997, Clin Intensive Car), and provide more proactive care for PwD. METHOD: PwD recorded their systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), heart rate (HR), temperature (BTM), bodyweight (BW) and oxygen saturation (Sats) daily (figure 1) and data were collected centrally. A 'monitoring team' followed algorithms in response to alerts and advised medical attention if required. Events such as infections, were logged and correlated with the data. The dataset was then used to calculate the number of alerts that would have been raised if different thresholds were used. RESULT: 52 PwD living at home were included. Patients had a range of dementia diagnoses, most commonly Alzheimer's disease. In total, 89,894 measurements were collected over 556 days (figure 2). During the pandemic, a sub-group were given Sats probes and these produced a significant number of false positive results (figure 4f). On sub-group analysis, PwD with Parkinson's disease dementia had significantly lower SBP and DBP (p=0.004 and p=0.01 respectively, Mann-Whitney U) (figure 3a), one of whom suffered from repeated falls (figure 3b). Pilot data were used to set alert thresholds. Average values and number of alerts for each domain are shown (table 1). We then modelled the effect of different thresholds, based on NEWS, to the number of alerts generated (figure 4, table 2). This is informative in optimising sensitivity and specificity of alerts whilst considering the burden on the monitoring service. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring can be implemented for PwD. These data can be used to generate clinical alerts that may signify adverse medical outcomes. The thresholds need to be adjusted to optimise efficiency in the context of varying reliability of home monitoring devices. ? 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.","output":"Home monitoring of vital signs and generation of alerts in a cohort of people living with dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts have faced the challenge of convincing people to change their everyday habits.

Many barriers to remote service delivery were eliminated, effectively creating a new generation of telepractitioners. This study chronicles changes in speech-language pathology clinicians' use and perceptions of telehealth with pediatric populations. Method The Telehealth Services: Pediatric Provider Survey was created in multiple steps and then distributed broadly through social media and professional community sites. Respondents were speech-language pathologists and speech-language pathology assistants in a variety of employment settings from across the country and abroad who were serving primarily pediatric clients (n = 269). Survey questions sought to capture changes in speech-language pathology clinicians' experiences with and perceptions of telehealth before, during, and predictions after the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses identified factors that influenced the use of telehealth services before and after March 2020 (COVID-19). Results Survey results documented the dramatic increase in telehealth use from before March 2020 to October 2020. The reasons pediatric speech-language pathology clinicians used telehealth during the pandemic were mostly a result of employer mandates or lowering infection risk for both client and clinician; however, over time, pediatric speech-language pathology clinicians increased their telehealth proficiency and discovered the benefits of telehealth. Conclusion The adoption of telehealth and the rapid improvement in proficiency is a testament to the resiliency of providers and has long-term effects on the use of telehealth into the future.

This research attempts to contribute to automated waste composition gauging by harnessing a valuable dataset from Hong Kong. Firstly, visual features, called visual inert probability (VIP), characterizing inert and non-inert materials are extracted from 1127 photos of waste bulks using a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, these visual features together with easy-to-obtain physical features (e.g., weight and depth) are fed to a tailor-made support vector machine (SVM) model to determine waste composition as measured by the proportions of inert and non-inert materials. The visual-physical feature hybrid model achieved a waste composition gauging accuracy of 94% in the experiments. This high performance implies that the model, with proper adaption and integration, could replace human inspectors to smooth the operation of the waste disposal facilities.","output":"\\"Looking beneath the surface\\": A visual-physical feature hybrid approach for unattended gauging of construction waste composition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and generally have higher mortality rate.

Finding the perfect match has always been the ultimate goal. However, many factors affect obtaining that perfect match. In the past, we would have each attending physician review around 20 to 50 Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications and rank them into three categories: high, middle, or low. Depending on their ranking, the applicant would be invited for an interview. After the interview, the applicants files (ERAS and interview) would be reviewed and ranked by the faculty as a group. This was time-consuming and fraught with too much subjectivity and minimal objectivity. We, therefore, sought to find a way to assess and rank applicants in a more objective and less time-consuming manner. By creating a customizable scoring tool, we were able to screen applicants to our pulmonary/critical care fellowship program in an efficient and a more objective manner. Objectives: A customizable scoring tool was developed weighting components in the ERAS and interview process, allowing residency/fellowship programs to create a final rank list consistent with the programs desired applicants. Methods: Two hundred and sixty pulmonary/critical care fellowship applications were reviewed from 2013 to 2018. In 2018, we used our new scoring rubric to create a rank list and rescore previous applicants. The traditional and new lists were compared to the final rank list submitted to the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP) for 2018. We wanted to ascertain which scoring method correlated best with the final rank list submitted to the NRMP. We obtained feedback from eight faculty members who had reviewed applicants with both scoring tools. Results: The novel customizable scoring tool positively correlated with the final rank list submitted to the NRMP (r= 0.86). The novel tool showed a better correlation to the final rank list than the traditional method. Faculties (6/6, 100%) responded positively to the new tool. Conclusions: Our new customizable tool has allowed us to create a final rank list that is efficient and more focused on our facultys desired applicants.

Unlike its peptidase activity, GPIase activity is weakly inhibited by the tightly binding ACE inhibitor and not inactivated by substitutions of core amino acid residues for the peptidase activity, suggesting that the active site elements for GPIase differ from those for peptidase activity. ACE shed various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, and the process was accelerated by the lipid raft disruptor filipin. The released products carried portions of the GPI anchor, indicating cleavage within the GPI moiety. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatographyCmass spectrometry predicted the cleavage site at the mannose-mannose linkage. GPI-anchored proteins such as TESP5 and PH-20 were released from the sperm membrane of wild-type mice but not in Ace knockout sperm in vivo.

Infection of healthcare workers with SARS-CoV-2 poses a potential risk of infection for other healthcare workers, patients and their families. The viral load measure in the sample is determined as the cycle threshold (Ct) with the RT-qPCR method. It has been reported that the RT-qPCR Ct value may be related to the severity and potential contagiousness of the infection. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the relationships between socio-demographic factors, COVID-19 symptoms and Ct value in SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR positive healthcare workers. METHODS: In this study, 300 healthcare workers with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test was performed from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples with Bio-speedy SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR (Bioeksen, Turkey) kit. The RT-qPCR Ct value results of healthcare staff patients were classified as low, medium and high, socio-demographic characteristics and the risk of viral spread was evaluated. RESULTS: The rate of those who showed at least one symptom among the 300 health personnel included in the study was 88.3% (n=265) and the most common symptoms were muscle-joint pain 39.7%, fatigue 33% and sore throat 30.7%. The median RT-qPCR Ct value was determined as 23.17(19.3-29.4) and Ct value was found to be low (<24.0) in 59% of healthcare personnel. In addition, the Ct value of the personnel working in the administrative units was found to be lower than those working in the COVID-19 polyclinic, service and intensive care unit (p=0.020). Those who had fever and at least one of the COVID-19 symptom (fever, cough, respiratory distress) group had a lower Ct value than those who did not (p=0.008, p=0.019, respectively). When the possible source of transmission was evaluated, it was determined that 22% of the health personnel were infected during patient care, 21% from other health personnel and 23.3% from non-hospital sources. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results have shown that most of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission seen in healthcare workers occurs within the hospital, but more viral load is exposed in out-of-hospital contacts. In addition, it has been observed that administrative personnel who do not have contact with patients can be a potential source of transmission. This situation has reaffirmed that PPE usage rules should be followed in order to reduce the risk of transmission in healthcare personnel and that personnel working outside the clinic should follow the mask and distance rules during their contact with their colleagues. It was determined that the Ct value was lower (higher viral load) in the presence of any of the symptoms of fever, cough, respiratory distress and fatigue in healthcare workers. In the presence of these symptoms, PCR testing of healthcare workers and taking necessary isolation measures until the test result is obtained will reduce the possibility of transmission.","output":"Evaluation of real-time PCR cycle threshold value, clinical and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, quarantine has been used to \\"flatten the curve\\" and slow the spread of the disease.

We theoretically prove that if quarantines are declared at the right moment, high-degree nodes are disproportionately in the Removed state, which is a form of targeted immunization. Even if quarantines are declared too early, subsequent waves of infection spread slower than the first waves. This leads us to propose an opening and closing strategy aiming at immunizing the graph while infecting the minimum number of individuals, guaranteeing the population is now robust to future infections.

Patients are often asymptomatic and have normal examinations at the time of evaluation. Thus, diagnosis depends heavily on eliciting key features from the history. Overreliance on symptom quality descriptions commonly leads to misdiagnosis. The goal of this article is to provide the reader with a straightforward approach to the diagnosis and management of conditions that cause episodic spontaneous dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS Consensus diagnostic criteria have been established for vestibular migraine, Mnire disease, vestibular paroxysmia, and hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo. Vertigo has been recognized as a common symptom in vertebrobasilar ischemia, cardiogenic dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Treatment recommendations for vestibular migraine still lack high-quality evidence, but controlled trials are occurring. SUMMARY The evaluation should start with a detailed description of the episodes from the patient and any observers. Rather than focusing first on whether the symptom quality is most consistent with vertigo, dizziness, lightheadedness, or unsteadiness, the clinician should clarify the timing (episode frequency and duration), possible triggers or circumstances (eg, position changes, upright posture), and accompanying symptoms. History should identify any auditory symptoms, migraine features, posterior circulation ischemic symptoms, vascular risk factors, clues for anxiety, and potentially relevant medications. Carefully selected testing can help secure the diagnosis, but excessive and indiscriminate testing can lead to more confusion. Treatments for these conditions are vastly different, so an accurate diagnosis is critical.","output":"Episodic Spontaneous Dizziness."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of a new acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the 2019-nCOV disease (COVID-19), has caused a pandemic and a global health crisis. Rapid human-to-human transmission, even from asymptomatic individuals, has led to the quick spread of the virus worldwide, causing a wide range of clinical manifestations from cold-like symptoms to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan injury, and even death. Therefore, using rapid and accurate diagnostic methods to identify the virus and subsequently select appropriate and effective treatments can help improvement of patients and control the pandemic. So far, various treatment regimens along with prophylactic vaccines have been developed to manage COVID-19-infected patients. Among these, antibody-based therapies, including neutralizing antibodies (against different parts of the virus), polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, plasma therapy, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) have shown promising outcomes in accelerating and improving the treatment process of patients, avoiding the viral spreading widely, and managing the pandemic.

However, the effect of the drug on the duration of infectious viral shedding and viral mutations is unknown. In this study, we investigated the clinical efficacy of REGN-CoV2 treatment in patients with mild to moderate disease and compared its antiviral effects against different strains of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Viral culture and PCR testing were performed on the pharyngeal swabs collected from 28 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted and treated at Hiroshima University Hospital during the study period. Of these, 23 patients were treated with REGN-CoV2. The patients were classified into the REGN-CoV2(+) and REGN-CoV2(-) groups, and the clinical course was compared between the groups. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of REGN-CoV2 against the isolated virus strains were determined. RESULTS: After treatment with REGN-CoV2, the virus culture positivity rate was greatly reduced. The time to negative viral culture was significantly shorter in the REGN-CoV2(+) group than in the REGN-CoV2(-) group. In vitro evaluation of REGN-CoV2 against isolated virus strains also showed efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: REGN-CoV2 treatment was effective in patients with mild COVID-19 and could shorten the period of infectious viral shedding. This may be an important factor in preventing the spread of infection. It may be possible to revise the isolation period for patients with mild disease treated with REGN-CoV2.","output":"Duration of infectious viral shedding in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 treated with REGN-CoV2()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe aspects found on HRCT scans of the chest in patients infected with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the HRCT scans of 71 patients (38 females and 33 males) with H1N1 infection, confirmed through laboratory tests, between July and September of 2009. The HRCT scans were interpreted by two thoracic radiologists independently, and in case of disagreement, the decisions were made by consensus. RESULTS: The most common HRCT findings were ground-glass opacities (85%), consolidation (64%), or a combination of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (58%). Other findings were airspace nodules (25%), bronchial wall thickening (25%), interlobular septal thickening (21%), crazy-paving pattern (15%), perilobular pattern (3%), and air trapping (3%). The findings were frequently bilateral (89%), with a random distribution (68%). Pleural effusion, when observed, was typically minimal. No lymphadenopathy was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The most common findings were ground-glass opacities and consolidations, or a combination of both. Involvement was commonly bilateral with no axial or craniocaudal predominance in the distribution. Although the major tomographic findings in H1N1 infection are nonspecific, it is important to recognize such findings in order to include infection with the H1N1 virus in the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms.","output":"Influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia: HRCT findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents recommendations determined to assist logistic companies in conceiving an efficient B2B implementation policy with the aim of enhancing market competitiveness, especially in time of intensified market competition.

RECENT FINDINGS: Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy.

We compared the qualitative (positive/negative) and semi-quantitative (cycle threshold, Ct) results. Following discordant analysis, all but one non-vortexed sample had the same qualitative result as the vortexed sample. 27.4 % of samples were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Comparison of Ct values revealed an apparent reduction in human cellular nucleic acid in the non-vortexed samples (mean Ct values of 24.0 and 26.5 for vortexed and non-vortexed samples, respectively, p < 0.0001) and increased Ct values for non-vortexed samples using a laboratory-developed SARS-CoV-2 assay (mean Ct values of 4.1 and 4.2 for vortexed and non-vortexed samples, respectively; p < 0.0001), but this was not observed for a more automated commercial SARS-CoV-2 assay (mean Ct values of 15.2 for both vortexed and non-vortexed samples, respectively; p = 0.68).

Statins have well-established anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and immuno-modulatory effects. They may also influence viral entry into human cells. METHODS: A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Statins interact with several different signaling pathways to exert their anti-inflammatory and vasculoprotective effects. They also variably affect cholesterol content of cell membranes and interfere with certain coronavirus enzymes involved in receptor-binding. Both these actions may influence SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Statins also upregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on cell surfaces which may promote viral entry into the cells but at the same time, may minimize tissue injury through production of angiotensin [1-7]. The net impact of these different effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis is not clear. However, the retrospective clinical studies have shown that statin use is potentially associated with lower risk of developing severe illness and mortality and a faster time to recovery in patients with COVID-19.

The recession of 2020 is considered preconditioned (regardless of the COVID-19 repercussions), as the duration of the business cycle since 2008 was approaching the maximum duration of the Juglar cycle (11 years) and signs of a downturn were appearing in 2018. The feature of the second medium-term cycle is outlined - mainly recovery rather than net economic growth, which justifies identification of the Eurozone development since 2008 as the lost decade. An attempt is made to identify long waves in the development of the Eurozone GBS, possible timeframes thereof are hypothesized using GDP per capita as well as labor productivity growth rates. Period of 1996-2011 is suggested as an ascending wave, period of 2012-2019 (and later) - as a descending wave. The conclusion is made on the relatively less favorable Eurozone GBS in the second decade of the XXI century within both the second medium-term cycle and the long wave. The problem (crisis) of competitiveness of the integration bloc as a main factor of such a dynamics is outlined. In this regard a modification of the medium-term reproduction cycle in the second decade of the XXI century is revealed on the basis of the Eurozone member states GBS analysis. The modification consists in a low representativeness of industrial (and manufacturing) production index as an indicator for identifying the phases of the medium-term cycle, and in extraordinary patterns of the industry (and its manufacturing part) dynamics, which result in completion of the medium term cycle without the index reaching its pre-crisis levels in a number of Eurozone countries. This new normality calls forth to reconsider to some extent such GBS theoretical categories as cycle boundaries and peak. In conclusion, forecasts are made regarding the end of the current descending long wave in the mid-2020s and possible GBS improvement within the medium-term cycle in this period subject to reasonable economic policy aimed at tackling the Eurozone competitiveness crisis.","output":"Eurozone General Business Situation: Results of 20 Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We used a Sioutas personal cascade impactor sampler (PCIS) to screen for SARS-CoV-2 in a car driven by a COVID-19 patient.

Outcomes of ICU and non-ICU patients were compared, and a simple nomogram for predicting the probability of ICU transfer after hospital admission was developed based on initial laboratory data using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences in laboratory indices were observed between patients admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted. Several independent predictors of ICU transfer in COVID-19 patients were identified including older age (&#8805;65 years) (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.02), hypertension (HR = 2.65), neutrophil count (HR = 1.11), procalcitonin level (HR = 3.67), prothrombin time (HR = 1.28), and D-dimer level (HR = 1.25). The lymphocyte count and albumin level were negatively associated with mortality (HR = 0.08 and 0.86, respectively).

Sensor fusion using multiple sensors has been employed to compensate for the shortcomings of each sensor in SLAM. However, the sensor cost cannot be ignored when considering its practical usage. Therefore, this study aims at realizing a high-precision SLAM using a sensor switching system, combining multiple low-cost sensors. The sensor switching system consists of a low-cost Lidar SLAM and a monocular localization. Since a low-cost Lidar has a short laser range, degeneracy often occurs due to the fact that they cannot capture features while building maps. The proposed system uses localization data from monocular localization to ensure precision in regions where degeneracy occurs. The proposed system was evaluated through the simulation assuming the museum environment where the degeneracy occurred. The accuracy of the robot trajectory and the built map proved the effectiveness of the proposed system.","output":"Short-range Lidar SLAM utilizing localization data of monocular localization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created disruptions and stressors which may have influenced alcohol consumption frequency trends. Varying COVID-19 health burden and alcohol policies may have contributed to different consumption trends between states. The aim of this study is to assess trends in alcohol consumption and moderation by state of residence. METHODS: We examined trends in adult drinking days, during the first wave of the pandemic (March 10 to June 8) using longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study (N = 6,172 unique participants; N = 28,059 observations). Because state mandates were responsive to disease burden, we modeled the interaction of time by COVID-19 burden, defined as whether the state had the median (or higher) daily incidence of COVID-19 cases on the survey date, and state random effects. We controlled for individual sociodemographics, perceived personal/familial COVID-19 burden, mental health symptomology, and risk avoidance. RESULTS: Drinking days increased throughout the duration (incidence risk ratio [IRR] for drinking per increase in one calendar day = 1.003, 95% CI 1.001, 1.004); trends were heterogeneous by disease burden, with individuals living in states with lower COVID-19 burden increasing (IRR = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003, 1.007) faster than those living in states with higher COVID-19 burden (IRR = 1.000, 95% CI 0.998, 1.002).

By evaluating the street thermal environment of a city alongside an assessment of those communities that are the most vulnerable to the effects of heat, we can prioritise areas in which heat mitigation interventions are most needed. In this paper, we propose a new approach for policy makers to determine where to delegate limited resources for heat mitigation with most effective outcomes for the communities. We use eye-level street panorama images and community profiles to provide a bottom-up, human-centred perspective of the city scale assessment, highlighting the situation of urban tree shade provision throughout the streets in comparison with environmental and social-economic status. The approach leverages multiple sources of spatial data including satellite thermal images, Google street view (GSV) images, land use and demographic census data. A deep learning model was developed to automate the classification of streetscape types and percentages at the street- and eye-view level. The methodology is metrics based and scalable which provides a data driven assessment of heat-related vulnerability. The findings of this study first contribute to sustainable development by developing a method to identify geographical areas or neighbourhoods that require heat mitigation; and enforce policies improving tree shade on routes, as a heat adaptation strategy, which will lead to increasing active travel and produce significant health benefits for residents.

Molecular adjuvants targeting pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) could improve and broaden the efficacy and durability of vaccine responses. Native SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates various PRRs, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. We hypothesized that targeting PRRs using molecular adjuvants on nanoparticles (NPs) along with a stabilized spike protein antigen could stimulate broad and efficient immune responses. Adjuvants targeting TLR4 (MPLA), TLR7/8 (R848), TLR9 (CpG), and RIG-I (PUUC) delivered on degradable polymer NPs were combined with the S1 subunit of spike protein and assessed in vitro with isogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions (isoMLRs). For in vivo studies, the adjuvant-NPs were combined with stabilized spike protein or spike-conjugated NPs and assessed using a two-dose intranasal or intramuscular vaccination model in mice. Combination adjuvant-NPs simultaneously targeting TLR and RIG-I receptors (MPLA+PUUC, CpG+PUUC, and R848+PUUC) differentially induced T cell proliferation and increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion by APCs in vitro. When delivered intranasally, MPLA+PUUC NPs enhanced CD4(+)CD44(+) activated memory T cell responses against spike protein in the lungs while MPLA NPs increased anti-spike IgA in the bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid and IgG in the blood. Following intramuscular delivery, PUUC NPs induced strong humoral immune responses, characterized by increases in anti-spike IgG in the blood and germinal center B cell populations (GL7(+) and BCL6(+) B cells) in the draining lymph nodes (dLNs). MPLA+PUUC NPs further boosted spike protein-neutralizing antibody titers and T follicular helper cell populations in the dLNs.

Pigs represent an important animal reservoir for influenza virus infection of human populations and are also naturally infected by coronaviruses, an important group of viruses, which includes the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. Studies on both innate and adaptative immune responses of pigs to influenza virus and coronaviruses contribute, therefore, to a better control of these infections in their natural hosts and will be briefly reviewed in this article. Pro\\\\inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor\\\\ (TNF\\\\), and interleukin\\\\6 (IL\\\\6), were found in lung secretions of influenza virus infected pigs, and correlated with the intensity of clinical signs, whereas prior vaccination against influenza strongly reduced the production of infectious virus and cytokines in the lungs upon challenge, which was associated with clinical protection. An early type I IFN production was also found in coronavirus infected pigs, including at mucosal sites. IFN induction by coronavirus is shown to involve interaction between a viral glycoprotein and a leukocyte subset, likely equivalent to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, present in the mucosae and associated lymphoid tissues. Given the IFN mediated antiviral and immunomodulatory effects, the use of IFN or IFN inducers may prove an efficient strategy for a better control of influenza virus and coronavirus infections in pigs. Because influenza and coronaviruses target mucosal surfaces, adaptative immune responses have to be characterized at mucosal sites. Thus, nasal and pulmonary antibody responses were analyzed in influenza virus infected or vaccinated pigs showing short\\\\lived, but potentially protective local IgA and IgG antibody (Ab) responses. Interestingly, primary influenza virus infection induced long\\\\lived increase of lung CD8(+) T cells and local lymphoproliferative responses. Pigs infected by a respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) showed virus\\\\specific IgG Ab\\\\secreting cells in the bronchial lymph nodes, whereas the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) induced more IgA Ab\\\\secreting cells in gut tissues, which illustrates the importance of the route of antigen administration for inducing local immune effector mechanisms.

METHODS: We aimed to examine the learning outcomes of a newly adopted anatomy educational approach by 1) comparing academic achievement between the blended learning group (the 2020 class, 108 students) and the traditional classroom learning group (the 2019 class, 104 students), and 2) an online questionnaire survey on student preference on the learning method and reasons of preference. RESULTS: The average anatomy examination scores of the 2020 class, who took online lectures and blended dissection laboratories, were significantly higher than those of the 2019 class, who participated in an offline lecture and dissection laboratories. The questionnaire survey revealed that students preferred online lectures over traditional large group lecture-based teaching because it allowed them to acquire increased self-study time, study according to their individual learning styles, and repeatedly review lecture videos.

Methods Secondary attack rates (SARs) for schools and day-care centres were calculated using data from state-wide mandatory notification of SARS-CoV-2 index cases in educational institutions and additional information on routine contact tracing and PCR-testing. Findings From August to December 2020, every sixth of overall 784 independent index cases caused a transmission in educational institutions (risk 0.17, 95% CI 0.14-0.19). In a subgroup, monitoring of 14,594 institutional high-risk contacts (89% PCR-tested) of 441 index cases revealed 196 secondary cases (SAR 1.34%, 1.16-1.54). Transmission was more likely from teachers than from students/children (incidence risk ratio [IRR] 3.17, 1.79-5.59), and from index cases in day-care centres (IRR 3.23, 1.76-5.91) than from those in secondary schools. In 748 index cases, teachers caused four times more secondary cases than children (1.08 vs. 0.25 secondary cases per index, IRR 4.39, 2.67-7.21). This difference was mainly due to common transmission from teacher index cases to teacher contacts (mean secondary cases 0.56 teacher to teacher vs. 0.04 child to teacher, IRR 13.3, 6.6-26.7). Interpretation In educational institutions, the risk of contacts to a confirmed COVID-19 case for infection is one percent, but varies depending on type of institution and index case.

These asparagines are not essential for surface display of pre-fusogenic envelope. Instead, substitution of these residues dramatically disrupts membrane fusion. Our data indicate that, through electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, the asparagine residues promote assembly and profoundly stabilize the fusion-active structures that are required for viral envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Moreover, the BLV TM structure also reveals a charge-surrounded hydrophobic pocket on the central coiled coil and interactions with basic residues that cluster around this pocket are critical to membrane fusion and form a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are common among class-1 fusion proteins, suggesting that small molecules that specifically target such motifs should prevent assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and be of value as therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.","output":"Charge-Surrounded Pockets and Electrostatic Interactions with Small Ions Modulate the Activity of Retroviral Fusion Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lithium imposes several cellular effects allegedly through multiple physiological mechanisms.

The novel isolate, under laboratory-scale conditions, produced the highest yield (561.3  0.3 mg/kg fermented agar) of antimicrobial compounds in modified ISP-4 agar at pH 6.5, temperature 35 C, inoculum 5% v/w, agar 1.5% w/v, and an incubation period of 7 days. The two major compounds, K(1) and K(2), were isolated from fermented medium and identified as Actinomycin X(2) and Actinomycin D, respectively, based on their structural analysis. The antimicrobial screening showed that Actinomycin X(2) had the highest antimicrobial activity compared to Actinomycin D, and the actinomycins-mixture (X(2):D, 1:1, w/w) against MRSA and non-MRSA Gram-positive test bacteria, at 5 g/disc concentrations. The MIC of Actinomycin X(2) ranged from 1.56C12.5 g/ml for non-MRSA and 3.125C12.5 g/ml for MRSA test bacteria. An in-silico molecular docking demonstrated isoleucyl tRNA synthetase as the most-favored antimicrobial protein target for both actinomycins, X(2) and D, while the penicillin-binding protein-1a, was the least-favorable target-protein.

We describe the first experience with combined use of genetic expression profiling (GEP) and donor-derived cell-free DNA (-cfDNA) testing in Canada as part of a quality improvement project to minimize patient risk during the COVID pandemic. Methods Adult outpatients at least 6 months after HT were screened from May 2021 to July 2021 to have their routine EMBx replaced by a combination of GEP and -cfDNA. Demographics, modification of immunosuppression (IS) and outcomes (hospital admission, rejection, and need for EMBx) were collected. Results Among 90 patients, 31 (33%) were enrolled, and 37 non-invasive tests were performed. The median time after HT was 2 years and patients were predominantly Caucasian (52%) and male (68%). 53% had a history of acute cellular rejection during the first year and 32% had cardiac allograft vasculopathy. Of the tests performed, 23 (60%) were - GEP / - -cfDNA, 10 (27%) were + GEP / - -cfDNA, 4 (11%) were - GEP / + -cfDNA and none were + GEP / + -cfDNA. Being bridged with a VAD (OR = 5.5, p=0.034) and a history of a previously treated CMV (OR = 16.0, p=0.003) were associated with a positive GEP and a negative -cfDNA result. Having received a COVID vaccine in the last 3 months did not affect GEP results (GEP was positive in 23.8% after vaccination vs 33.3% in non-vaccinated patients, p=0.690; average GEP score 29.8 vs 30.7, p=0.673). The 4 patients with a + -cfDNA (range 0.19 - 0.81%) underwent an EMBx with no significant cellular or antibody mediated rejection, thus avoiding 89% of the EMBx. No unscheduled clinic visits, emergency department or hospital admissions were recorded. After non-invasive testing, the IS was reduced in 16 cases (43.2%). IS was reduced in in 59% of patients with negative concordant tests (- GEP / - -cfDNA), 30% in patients with + GEP / - -cfDNA and no reduction in IS occurred in those with + -cfDNA. Conclusion The combination of GEP and -cfDNA for rejection surveillance allowed for a marked reduction in EMBx (89%) and for a personalized downtitration of IS without adverse events in the short term. The use of non-invasive rejection surveillance testing was an effective strategy to avoid hospital contact for HT recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Poke Not Prod: First Canadian Experience Using Donor-Derived Cell Free DNA to Replace Endomyocardial Biopsy During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The RBD (receptor binding domain) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus S (spike) protein mediates the viral cell attachment and serves as a promising target for therapeutics development.

However, such restrictions could precipitate unintended negative consequences on lifestyle behaviors. The main objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of unhealthy behavior changes during the COVID-19 lockdown among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey of adults residing in the UAE was carried out during lockdown (n = 2060). Using a multi-component questionnaire, the collected data included questions regarding the following lifestyle changes: Increased dietary intake, increased weight, decreased physical activity, decreased sleep, and increased smoking. An unhealthy lifestyle change score was calculated based on the number of unhealthy lifestyle changes each participant reported. In addition, sociodemographic and living conditions information was collected. Descriptive statistics as well as simple and multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine the prevalence and determinants of the unhealthy lifestyle changes considered in this study. Results: Among the unhealthy lifestyle changes examined, increased food intake was the most common (31.8%), followed by decreased physical activity (30%), increased weight (29.4%), decreased sleep (20.8%), and increased smoking (21%). In addition to identifying the correlates of each of the aforementioned lifestyle changes, the results of the multiple regression linear analyses revealed the following correlates for the overall unhealthy lifestyle change score: females ( = 0.32, CI: 0.22; 0.42), living in an apartment ( = 0.12, CI: 0.003; 0.23) and being overweight/obese ( = 0.24, CI: 0.15; 0.32) had higher scores, while older adults (>40 years) had lower scores ( = ?0.23, CI: ?0.34; ?0.12). Conclusions: The COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a high prevalence of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and practices among UAE residents.

To move beyond description, we need to hypothesise about how structural and social factors may cause health outcomes. In this paper, we examine the construction of health over the life course through the lens of influential theoretical work. Based on concepts developed by scholars from different disciplines, we propose a novel framework for research on social-to-biological processes which may be important contributors to health inequalities. We define two broad sets of mechanisms that may help understand how socially structured exposures become embodied: mechanisms of exogenous and endogenous origin. We describe the embodiment dynamic framework, its uses and how it may be combined with an intersectional approach to examine how intermeshed oppressions affect social exposures which may be expressed biologically. We explain the usefulness of this framework as a tool for carrying out research and providing scientific evidence to challenge genetic essentialism, often used to dismiss social inequalities in health.","output":"Framework for understanding health inequalities over the life course: the embodiment dynamic and biological mechanisms of exogenous and endogenous origin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mutations in the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 are the major concern as they might lead to drug/vaccine resistance. In the host cell, the virus largely depends on the main protease (Mpro ) to regulate infection hence it is one of the most attractive targets for inhibitor design. However, >19,000 mutations in the Mpro have already been reported. The mutations encompassing 282 amino acid positions and these \\"hotspots\\" might change the Mpro structure, activity and potentially delay therapeutic strategies targeting Mpro . Thus, here we identified 24 mutational \\"coldspots\\" where mutations have not been observed. We compared the structure-function relationship of these coldspots with several SARS-CoV2 Mpro X-ray crystal structures. We found that three coldspot residues (Leu141, Phe185, and Gln192) help to form the active site, while seven (Gly2, Arg4, Tyr126, Lys137, Leu141, Leu286, and Leu287) contribute to dimer formation that is required for Mpro activity. The surface of the dimer interface is more resistant to mutations compared to the active site. Interestingly, most of the coldspots are found in three clusters and forms conserved patterns when compared with other coronaviruses. Importantly, several conserved coldspots are available on the surface of the active site and at the dimer interface for targeting. The identification and short list of these coldspots offers a new perspective to target the SARS-CoV2 Mpro while avoiding mutation-based drug resistance.","output":"Identification of mutation resistance coldspots for targeting the SARS-CoV2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) initiative to meet the needs for COVID-19 diagnostic and surveillance testing, and to speed its innovation in the development, commercialization, and implementation of new technologies and approaches.

The first clinical symptoms of each patient were collected and their first chest CT images were observed by dividing them into 4 groups according to age: junior, young, middle-age, and senior. Results: Comorbidities are more common in the senior group. Cluster onset is more common in junior group and senior group. Older patients have shown higher incidence with the highest clinical classification of severe or critical in these 4 groups. Senior patients have a higher incidence of large/multiple ground-glass opacity (GGO). Junior patients are mostly negative for chest CT or involve only one lobe of the lung. While in elderly patients, older patients have a higher incidence of involvement of 4 or 5 lung lobes. The frequency of lobe involvement also has significant differences in 4 different age groups.

Therefore it was not clear either how the pandemic would impact the healthcare system. As a result it was initially predicted that the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark would overwhelm the healthcare system and thus both the diagnosis and treatment of other hospital patients were compromised for an extended period. AIM: To develop a mathematical model, which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected persons, for early estimation of the epidemic's course, its Infection Fatality Rate and the healthcare system load in Denmark, both retrospectively and prospectively. METHODS: The SEIRS (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) model including deaths outside hospitals and separate assessments of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (based on seroprevalence) with different immunological memories. Optimal model parameters are in part identified by Monte Carlo based Least Square Error methods while micro-outbreaks are modeled by noise and explored in Monte Carlo simulations. Estimates for infected population sizes are obtained by using a quasi steady state method. RESULTS: The calculations and simulations made by the model were shown to fit with the observed development of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. The antibody prevalence in the general population in May 2020 was 1.37%, which yields a relative frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of 1 to 5.2. Due to the large asymptomatic population, the Infection Mortality Rate was only 0.4%. However, with no non-pharmacological restrictions the COVID-19 death toll was calculated to have more than doubled the national average yearly deaths within a year. The transmission rate a0 was 5.4 in the initial free epidemic period, 0.4 in the lock-down period and 0.8-1.0 in the successive re-opening periods through August 2020. The large asymptomatic population made the termination of the epidemic difficult and micro-outbreaks occurred when the country re-opened. The estimated infected population size July 15 to August 15 was 2,100 and 12,200 for October 1-20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the model show, that COVID-19 has a low Infection Fatality Rate because the majority of infected persons are either asymptomatic or with few symptoms. A minority of the infected persons, therefore, requires hospitalization. That means that for a given infection pressure of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected there will be a lower pressure on the capacity of the health care system than previously predicted. Further the epidemic will be difficult to terminate since about 84% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic but still contagious. The model may be useful if a major infection wave occurs in the autumn-winter season as it could make robust estimates both for the scale of an ongoing expanding epidemic and for the expected load on the healthcare system. The simulation may also be useful to evaluate different testing strategies based on estimated infected population sizes. The model can be adjusted and scaled to other regions and countries, which is illustrated with Spain and USA.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in Denmark, February through October 2020: Nature of the past epidemic and how it may develop in the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Providing appropriate care for people suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus is a significant global challenge. Many individuals who become infected have pre-existing conditions that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative about individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Accurately determining how comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision. Methods: To assess the interaction of patient comorbidities with COVID-19 severity and mortality we performed a meta-analysis of the published global literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated COVID-19 global dataset. Results: Our meta-analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictor of mortality, in terms of symptom-comorbidity combinations, it was observed that Pneumonia-Hypertension, Pneumonia-Diabetes and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-Hypertension showed the most significant effects on COVID-19 mortality.

Many expressed emotions in the social media, yet little research has been conducted on the emotional experience of these clinicians. Objective We aimed to understand the range of emotions expressed by clinicians through various media outlets. Methods A qualitative dimensional analysis was used with the goal of breaking down the concept of clinician distress into its smallest parts, including attributes, interconnections, context, process, and implications and then reconstructing the concept with a new and clearer understanding. Search strategy centered around data written in the clinician's voice through published editorials, commentaries, and opinion pieces from January 1, 2020 through July 22, 2020. Total records of the combined searches resulted in 545 editorials; after deduplication and full text review, 10 journal editorials and 24 newspaper editorials were included in analysis. Results A narrative of clinician distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among American clinicians emerged, grounded by the perspective of a clinician's perceptions of clinical care in the context of an ever-changing present and uncertain future, where a clinician recognizes within themselves one of the following conditions: an emotional response or a conflict in tandem with a significant role change resulting in a process of the inability to feel and act according to one's values due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the ultimate consequence of clinician distress. Impact This study adds to the concept of clinician distress: expanding the understanding of clinician distress during a global pandemic through published work written by clinicians themselves, including the emotional aspects of caring for patients, developing a new framework for understanding clinician distress by analyzing clinicians own written words, and exploring real-time distress through a novel qualitative method to better understand the clinicians experiences.","output":"The Ever-Changing Present & Uncertain Future: Clinician Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Dimensional Analysis (GP754)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, governments have turned their attention to digital contact tracing. In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the worlds leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres. While privacy is certainly an important value, its centrality in the debate on digital contact tracing may blind us to these broader societal harms and unwittingly pave the way for ever more sphere transgressions.","output":"Blind-sided by privacy?

In addition, inequality in social determinants of health (SDOH), dictated by economic stability, education access and quality, healthcare access and quality, neighborhoods and built environment, and social and community context have only added to disparities in morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. However, the relationship between SDOH and LOS in COVID-19 patients with multimorbidity is poorly characterized. Analyzing the effect SDOH have on LOS can help identify patients at high risk for prolonged hospitalization and allow prioritization of treatment and supportive measures to promote safe and expeditious discharge. Methods This study was a multicenter, retrospective analysis of adult patients with multimorbidity who were hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary outcome was to determine the LOS in these patients. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the role that SDOH play in LOS. Poisson regression analyses were performed to examine associations between individual SDOH and LOS. Results A total of 370 patients were included with a median age of 65 years (IQR 55-74), of which 57% were female and 77% were African American.

Because of the increasing prevalence of IBD in newly industrialized countries such as those in Asia, the Middle East, and South America, there is mounting interest in elucidating the gut microbiota of these populations. We present a comprehensive analysis of several IBD-related biomarkers and gut microbiota profiles and functions of a unique population of patients with IBD and healthy patients from Kazan (Republic of Tatarstan, Russia). METHODS: Blood and fecal IBD biomarkers, serum cytokines, and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content were profiled. Finally, fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota whole-genome sequencing confirmed the presence of classic IBD dysbiotic features at the phylum level, with increased abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria and decreased abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. At the genus level, the abundance of both fermentative (SCFA-producing and hydrogen (H2)-releasing) and hydrogenotrophic (H2-consuming) microbes was affected in patients with IBD. This imbalance was confirmed by the decreased abundance of SCFA species in the feces of patients with IBD and the change in anaerobic index, which mirrors the redox status of the intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses highlighted how IBD-related dysbiotic microbiota-which are generally mainly linked to SCFA imbalance-may affect other important metabolic pathways, such as H2 metabolism, that are critical for host physiology and disease development.","output":"Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Associated Changes in the Gut: Focus on Kazan Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an abrupt but accelerated shift to e-learning worldwide. Education in a post-pandemic world has to amalgamate the advantages of e-learning with important pedagogical goals associated with in-person teaching. Although various advanced technologies are present at our fingertips today, we are still unable to use their full potential in teaching and learning. In this regard, mobile VR technology is both cost-efficient, versatile and engaging for students. Developing countries have more smartphone users than developed countries, implying that developing countries, like Malaysia, should utilize mobile or cellphones more significantly. With that in mind, we propose here a pre-protocol to investigate learner motivation and levels of engagement for e-learning with smartphone-integrated VR, based on their VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning styles. Proposed methodology: This study intends to use a minimum sample of 30 students from the same age group under the K-12 (particularly grade 9-12) belonging to STEM curriculum. The Google Cardboard VR set will be used as the prime technology for its affordability, easy build feature and variety of available vendors. A mixed-method (survey and activity log/tracking) for data collection is suggested to find the degree of engagement and motivation of the learners learning in the mobile VR-assisted e-learning context. The students will be taught a topic using the mobile VR and then be assessed through simple classroom quizzes to assess how well they grasped the concept. The data collected through activity logs (while teaching the topic in mobile VR) and questionnaires will be mapped to each individual learner and organized in a data repository. Further visualization, analysis and investigation will be performed using Smart PLS, Python or R language. Conclusions: The study aims to provide context for smartphone and software companies to develop technologies that could facilitate learner engagement during the post-pandemic state.","output":"Post-pandemic e-learning: a pre-protocol to assess the integration of mobile VR and its effect on VARK learning styles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this cross-sectional study is to analyze the changes in physical activity (PA) practice of a sample of 2099 French adults, mostly females, who answered an online questionnaire during the first COVID-19 lockdown (MarchCMay 2020).

Multinomial logistic regressions were performed to compare the variations of PA with all the variables identified. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 88. Among people who practiced PAs before the first lockdown, the probability to keep practicing PAs is higher among those with a lower level of education, among housewives and retirees and among those who lived in cities of 10,000C19,999 inhabitants. For those who did not practice PAs before the social distancing, the probability of starting to practice is greater in those with a lower level of education and for those who suffered from a chronic disease.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the risk by age, tumour type and treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients. MethodsSystematic review by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for articles published in English up to June 14, 2021 of SARS-CoV-2 infection in >10 patients with malignant disease. Outcomes included factors in patients with malignant disease that may predict a poor outcome from COVID-19 compared to patients without malignant disease, including patient demographics, tumour subtype and cancer treatments. A meta-analysis was performed using random effects model. Results81 studies were included, totalling 61,532 cancer patients. Haematological malignancies comprised 22.1% (9,672 of 43,676) of cases. Relative risk (RR) of mortality when age and sex matched was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.46-1.95; p<0.001; I2=51%). RR of mortality, versus non-cancer patients, was associated with decreasing age (exp(b)0.96; 95% CI, 0.922-0.994; p=0.028) but not male sex (exp(b)1.89; 95% CI, 0.222-6.366; p=0.83). RR of mortality in those with haematological malignancies versus non-cancer control was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.53-2.95; I2=0.0%). Compared to other cancers, increased risk of death was seen for lung (RR 1.68, 95% CI, 1.45-1.94; p<0.001), genitourinary (RR 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.24; p=0.059) and haematological malignancies (RR 1.42; 95% CI, 1.31-1.54; p<0.001). Breast (RR 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.71; p<0.001) and gynaecological cancers (RR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93; p=0.009) had lower risk of death. Receipt of chemotherapy had greatest overall pooled mortality risk of 30% (95% CI, 25-36%; I2=86.97%) and endocrine therapy the lowest at 11% (95% CI, 6-16%; I2=70.7%). ConclusionsCancer patients, particularly younger cancer patients, appear at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 compared to non-cancer patients. Differences in outcomes were seen based on tumour types and treatment. Highlights- To our knowledge this is the largest review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 in cancer patients with insights into tumour types and therapies. - In unadjusted analysis cancer doubles the risk of COVID-19 related mortality. This decreased when adjusted for age and sex. - Younger cancer patients have the highest risk of mortality when compared to non-cancer COVID-19 patient of a similar age. - Patients with lung, genitourinary and haematological malignancies are at increased risk of mortality, breast and gynaecological cancers are at lower risk. - Patients on chemotherapy have the highest pooled mortality risk with those on endocrine therapy the lowest.","output":"A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the global data involving 61,532 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been more than a year since the coronavirus (COVID-19) engulfed the whole world, disturbing the daily routine, bringing down the economies, and killing two million people across the globe at the time of writing.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients with a clinical history indicative of HSR to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID\\\\19 vaccine. The allergological workup included skin testing (STs) and BAT with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the vaccine. In those with negative allergy assessments, the administration of the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID\\\\19 vaccine was offered. RESULTS: Seventeen adults were included. Eleven cases (64.7%) tested negative in the allergological workup and tolerated the re\\\\administration of the second dose of the vaccine and considered non\\\\allergic.

METHODS: We analysed residual sera from ambulatory patients for IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein with a semiquantitative commercial ELISA. Weighted seroprevalence (overall and by age category and sex) and seroincidence during seven consecutive periods were estimated for the Belgian population while accommodating test-specific sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: The weighted overall seroprevalence initially increased from 1.8% (95% credible interval (CrI): 1.0C2.6) to 5.3% (95% CrI: 4.2C6.4), implying a seroincidence of 3.4% (95% CrI: 2.4C4.6) between the first and second collection period over a period of 3 weeks during lockdown (start lockdown mid-March 2020). Thereafter, seroprevalence stabilised, however, significant decreases were observed when comparing the third with the fifth, sixth and seventh period, resulting in negative seroincidence estimates after lockdown was lifted. We estimated for the last collection period mid-October 2020 a weighted overall seroprevalence of 4.2% (95% CrI: 3.1C5.2).

Zhang's ?in house? dissection videos were also provided to the class of 2023 throughout their training. A survey was conducted to sample students? perspectives regarding these learning modalities, and 65/260 students responded. Sixty (60%) percent considered the in-person dissection most ideal, whereas 40% thought that approaches using Visible Body, with or without prosections (20% each) as the most effective approach. Of the supplemental learning resources, 47% selected Acland's Video Atlas, 37% Zhang's in-house dissection videos, and 12% the Visible Body as most helpful. Moore's Clinical Oriented Anatomy is the required textbook in our course. Surprisingly, 57% of students responding to the survey did not read it, 25% only rarely read it, and 16% read it only when they looked for answers to specific questions. Only 2% of the class read most of the chapters in this textbook. When asked for a recommendation for future anatomy education, 67% of students advised hands-on dissection combined with prosection and 16% advised hands-on dissection only. Interestingly, 18% of the students responding advised approaches that omit in-person hands-on dissection. In summary, the traditional in-person cadaveric dissection is still considered the most effective learning approach by the majority of students at SKMC, but students who do not prefer in-person hands-on dissection should be taken into consideration.

The importance of the role of recombination is far less evident for the RNA-based genomes that occur in most plant viruses and in many animal viruses. RNA recombination has been shown to promote the evolutionary variation of picornaviruses(1C4), it is involved in the creation of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of positive- and negative-strand viruses(5C9) and is implicated in the synthesis of the messenger RNAs of influenza virus(10) and coronavirus(11). However, RNA recombination has not been found to date in viruses that infect plants. In fact, the lack of DI RNAs and the inability to demonstrate recombination in mixedly infected plants has been regarded as evidence that plants do not support recombination of viral RNAs. Here we provide the first molecular evidence for recombination of plant viral RNA. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plus-stranded, tripartite-genome virus of monocots, we show that a deletion in the 3 end region of a single BMV RNA genomic component can be repaired during the development of infection by recombination with the homologous region of either of the two remaining wild-type BMV RNA components. This result clearly shows that plant viruses have available powerful recombinatory mechanisms that previously were thought to exist only in animal hosts, thus they are able to adapt and diversify in a manner comparable to animal viruses. Moreover, our observation suggests an increased versatility of viruses for use as vectors in introducing new genes into plants.","output":"Genetic recombination between RNA components of a multipartite plant virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on stroke care has been reported, but no data exist on the influence of the lockdown on medication adherence to antithrombotic treatment for stroke prevention.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis using data from the ongoing MAAESTRO study, in which stroke patients with atrial fibrillation electronically monitor their adherence to DOAC treatment. Eligible patients for this analysis had at least four weeks of adherence data prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Three adherence metrics (taking adherence, timing adherence, drug holidays) were calculated and compared descriptively. RESULTS: The analysis included eight patients (median age 81.5 years, IQR 74.8-84.5). Five patients had a pre-lockdown taking adherence over 90% (mean 96.8%  2.9), with no change during lockdown, high timing adherence in both periods and no drug holidays. The remaining three patients had pre-lockdown taking and timing adherence below 90%. Of those, two patients showed a moderate decline either in taking or timing adherence compared to pre-lockdown. One showed a substantial increase in taking and timing adherence during lockdown (both + 25.8%).

Thymoquinone (TQ), the main active ingredient of black seed oil, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and anticoagulant activities. TQ also increases the activity and number of cytokine suppressors, lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages, and it has demonstrated antiviral potential against a number of viruses, including murine cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and other coronaviruses. Recently, TQ has demonstrated notable antiviral activity against a SARSCoV-2 strain isolated from Egyptian patients and, interestingly, molecular docking studies have also shown that TQ could potentially inhibit COVID-19 development through binding to the receptor-binding domain on the spike and envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which may hinder virus entry into the host cell and inhibit its ion channel and pore forming activity. Other studies have shown that TQ may have an inhibitory effect on SARS CoV2 proteases, which could diminish viral replication, and it has also demonstrated good antagonism to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, allowing it to interfere with virus uptake into the host cell. Several studies have also noted its potential protective capability against numerous chronic diseases and conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, asthma, renal dysfunction and malignancy.

EXPERIMENTAL: We fabricated cationic solid lipid nanoparticles using PLGA and dimethyl-dioctadecyl-ammonium bromide (DDAB), followed by loading of model antigen OVA (antigen ovalbumin, OVA(257-264)) to form an OVA@DDAB/PLGA nano-vaccine. And we investigated the intracellular signaling pathway in dendritic cells in vitro and antigen transport pathway and immune response in vivo mediated by an OVA@DDAB/PLGA nano-vaccine. RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that the antigen uptake of BMDCs after nanovaccine incubation was two times higher than pure OVA or OVA@Al at 12 h. The BMDCs were well activated by p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, the nano-vaccine induced antigen escape from lysosome into cytoplasm with 10 times increased cross-presentation activity than those of OVA or OVA@Al. Regarding the transport of antigen into draining lymph nodes (LNs), the nano-vaccine could rapidly transfer antigen to LNs by passive lymphatic drainage and active DC transport. The antigen(+) cells in inguinal/popliteal LNs for the nano-vaccine were increased over two folds comparing to OVA@Al and OVA at 12 h. Moreover, the antigen of nano-vaccine stayed in LNs for over 7 days, germinal center formation over two folds higher than those of OVA@Al and OVA. After immunization, the nano-vaccine induced a much higher ratio of IgG2c/IgG1 than OVA@Al. It also effectively activated CD4(+) T, CD8(+) T and B cells for immune memory with a strong cellular response. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that DDAB/PLGA NP was a potent platform to improve vaccine immunogenicity by p38 signaling pathway in BMDCs, enhancing transport of antigens to LNs, and higher immunity response.

We searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for all studies that reported the prevalence of smell and/or taste deficits in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Forty-two studies reporting on 23,353 patients qualified and were subjected to a systematic review and meta-analysis.

We examined the effects of age, disease severity, and ethnicity on chemosensory dysfunction. The effect of age did not reach significance, but anosmia/hypogeusia decreased with disease severity, and ethnicity was highly significant: Caucasians had a 3-6 times higher prevalence of chemosensory deficits than East Asians. The finding of ethnic differences points to genetic, ethnicity-specific differences of the virus-binding entry proteins in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds as the most likely explanation, with major implications for infectivity, diagnosis and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Prevalence of Chemosensory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Reveals Significant Ethnic Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Little evidence appears to exist for the use of anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, after non-response to treatment with corticosteroids alone or combined with tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate hyperinflammatory state. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was carried out involving 143 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate hyperinflammation. They received standard therapy along with pulses of methylprednisolone (group 1) or methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab (group 2), with the possibility of receiving anakinra (group 3) according to protocol. The aim of this study was to assess the role of anakinra in the clinical course (death, admission to the intensive care ward) during the first 60 days after the first corticosteroid pulse. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics as well as infectious complications were also analyzed. RESULTS: 74 patients (51.7%) in group 1, 59 (41.3%) patients in group 2, and 10 patients (7%) in group 3 were included. 8 patients (10.8%) in group 1 died, 6 (10.2%) in group 2, and 0 (0%) in group 3. After adjustment for age and clinical severity indices, treatment with anakinra was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.518, 95% CI 0.265-0.910; p = 0.0437). Patients in group 3 had a lower mean CD4 count after 3 days of treatment. No patients in this group presented infectious complications.

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, diseases associated with sequelae of COVID-19, or long COVID, also include serious long-term mental and cognitive changes, including the condition recently termed brain fog. Hypoxia in the microenvironment of select brain areas may benefit the reproductive capacity of the virus. It is possible that in areas of cerebral hypoxia, neuronal cell energy metabolism may become compromised after integration of the viral genome, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction. Because of their need for constant high metabolism, cerebral tissues require an immediate and constant supply of oxygen. In hypoxic conditions, neurons with the highest oxygen demand become dysfunctional. The resulting cognitive impairment benefits viral spread, as infected individuals exhibit behaviors that reduce protection against infection. The effects of compromised mitochondrial function may also be an evolutionary advantage for SARS-CoV-2 in terms of host interaction. A high viral load in patients with COVID-19 that involves the CNS results in the compromise of neurons with high-level energy metabolism. Therefore, we propose that selective neuronal mitochondrial targeting in SARS-CoV-2 infection affects cognitive processes to induce brain fog and results in behavioral changes that favor viral propagation. Cognitive changes associated with COVID-19 will have increasing significance for patient diagnosis, prognosis, and long-term care.","output":"Selective Neuronal Mitochondrial Targeting in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Affects Cognitive Processes to Induce Brain Fog and Results in Behavioral Changes that Favor Viral Survival"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To provide the latest insight on the rare vulvar and vaginal malignancies, able to impact on clinical practice, and to outline new potential research developments.

SUMMARY In the evaluation of lymph node status, ultrasound has demonstrated promising results because of high predictive value, low risk and low cost. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography is confirmed to be reliable and should be prospectively investigated for its potential applications in radiomics, whilst Fusion-US could allow a precision guidance in diagnostics and interventional procedures. Regarding interventional procedure, surgery is becoming less invasive with the aim to increase quality of life; in carefully selected patients it would be possible to overcome the current strict criteria in the use of sentinel node biopsy. Future research should focus on potential target therapy, on the basis of tumor-specific biological features.Rare cancers should be referred to experienced centers with a high case flow, able to offer a full range of diagnostic and therapeutical options and a multidisciplinary approach.

There are several other clinical challenges for treatment of co-infected patients including: expense, pill burden, toxicity, and malabsorption that further necessitate the search for new drugs that may be effective against both pathogens simultaneously. The anti-helminthic niclosamide has been shown to have activity against a laboratory strain of Mtb in liquid culture while bacteriostatic activity against non-replicating M. abscessus was also recently described. Here we extend these findings to further demonstrate that niclosamide inhibits mycobacterial growth in infected human macrophages and mediates potent bacteriostatic activity against the virulent Mtb Beijing strain. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that niclosamide inhibits HIV replication in human macrophages and Jurkat T cells through post-integration effects on pro-virus transcription. The dual antiviral and anti-mycobacterial activity was further observed in an in vitro model of HIV and Mtb co-infection using human primary monocyte-derived macrophages.

Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that rapid recruitment of neutrophils from the vascular channel to sites of infection leads to swarm and neutrophil extracellular trap formation but does not prevent IBC formation. Subsequently, we tracked bacterial growth dynamics in individual IBCs through two cycles of antibiotic administration interspersed with recovery periods which revealed that the elimination of bacteria within IBCs by the antibiotic was delayed, and in some instances, did not occur at all. During the recovery period, rapid proliferation in a significant fraction of IBCs reseeded new foci of infection through bacterial shedding and host cell exfoliation.

To identify protective immunity, optimization of the chemiluminescent reduction neutralizing test (CRNT) is critical. Whether commercial antibody tests have comparable accuracy is unknown. Serum samples were obtained from COVID-19 patients (n = 74), SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative (n = 179), and suspected healthy individuals (n = 229) before SARS-CoV-2 variants had been detected locally. The convalescent phase was defined as the period after day 10 from disease onset or the episode of close contact. The CRNT using pseudotyped viruses displaying the wild-type (WT) spike protein and a commercial anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody test were assayed. Serology for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants was also assayed. Both tests concurred for symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the convalescent phase. They clearly differentiated between patients and suspected healthy individuals (sensitivity: 95.8% and 100%, respectively; specificity: 99.1% and 100%, respectively). Anti-RBD antibody test results correlated with neutralizing titers (r = 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22C0.38). Compared with the WT, lower CRNT values were observed for the variants. Of the samples with 100 U/mL by the anti-RBD antibody test, 77.8% and 88.9% showed 50% neutralization against the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 variants, respectively. Exceeding 100 U/mL in the anti-RBD antibody test was associated with neutralization of variants (P < 0.01). The CRNT and commercial anti-RBD antibody test effectively classified convalescent COVID-19 patients. Strong positive results with the anti-RBD antibody test can reflect neutralizing activity against emerging variants.

For individual host cells, the yield of virus progeny spanned a relatively narrow range (10-1000 infectious particles per cell) compared with the million-fold difference in size between the smallest and largest cells. Furthermore, healthy and infected host cells were remarkably similar in the time they needed to multiply themselves or their virus progeny.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 831 adult COVID-19 patients (68.5% Black) who presented to the emergency departments of four academic hospitals, March 1, 2020CMay 31, 2020. The primary outcome was risk of hospitalization among Blacks vs. non-Blacks. Secondary outcomes were mortality and acute kidney injury, among hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The crude odds of hospitalization were not different in Black vs. non-Black patients; however, with adjustment for age, Blacks had 55% higher odds of hospitalization. Mortality differed most in the model adjusted for age alone. Acute kidney injury was more common in the Black hospitalized patients, regardless of adjustment. Stratified analyses suggested that disparities in the risk of hospitalization and of in-hospital acute kidney injury were highest in the youngest patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that Black and non-Black patients presenting to the emergency department with COVID-19 had similar risks of hospitalization and, of those who were hospitalized, similar mortality when adjusted for multiple factors. Blacks had higher risk of acute kidney injury. Our results suggest that examination of disparities without exploration of the individual effects of age and comorbidities may mask important patterns.

Histological pattern was not homogeneous, as three different case clusters could be evidenced, which were mirrored in clinical and radiological features: cluster one (chronic fibrosing) characterised by post-infection progression of pre-existing interstitial pneumonias; cluster two (acute/subacute injury) characterised by different types and grades of lung injury, ranging from organising pneumonia and fibrosing NSIP to diffuse alveolar damage; cluster three (vascular changes) characterised by diffuse vascular increase, dilatation and distortion (capillaries and venules) within otherwise normal parenchyma. Clusters two and three were characterised by immunophenotypical changes similar to those observed in early/mild covid-19 pneumonias (abnormal expression of STAT3 in hyperplastic pneumocytes and PD-L1, IDO and STAT3 in endothelial cells). This is the first study correlating histological/immunohistochemical patterns with clinical and radiological pictures of patients with post-COVID lung disease. Different phenotypes with potential different underlying pathogenic mechanisms have been identified.","output":"Clinical, radiological, and pathological findings in patients with persistent lung disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is an attempt to estimate the risk of infection importation and exportation by travelers. Two countries are considered: one disease-free country and one visited or source country with a running endemic or epidemic infectious disease. Two models are considered. In the first model (disease importation), susceptible individuals travel from their disease-free home country to the endemic country and come back after some weeks. The risk of infection spreading in their home country is then estimated supposing the visitors are submitted to the same force of infection as the local population but do not contribute to it. In the second model (disease exportation), it is calculated the probability that an individual from the endemic (or epidemic) country travels to a disease-free country in the condition of latent infected and eventually introduces the infection there. The input of both models is the force of infection at the visited/source country, assumed known. The models are deterministic, but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented as an appendix. The models are exemplified with two distinct real situations: the risk of dengue importation from Thailand to Europe and the risk of Ebola exportation from Liberia to the USA.","output":"Modeling Importations and Exportations of Infectious Diseases via Travelers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents a critical analysis of the relationship between work and subjectivity, based on reflections regarding experiences of dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemic in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

A geographical detector technique was then used to investigate the impacts of hospital level, type, distance from the infection source, and other external indicators of HCW infections. FINDINGS: The number of daily HCW infections over time in Wuhan followed a log-normal distribution, with its mean observed on January 23(rd), 2020, and a standard deviation of 10.8 days. The implementation of high-impact measures, such as the lockdown of the city, may have increased the probability of HCW infections in the short term, especially for those in the outer ring of Wuhan. The infection of HCWs in Wuhan exhibited clear spatial heterogeneity. The number of HCW infections was higher in the central city and lower in the outer city. CONCLUSION: HCW infections displayed significant spatial autocorrelation and dependence. Factor analysis revealed that hospital level and type had an even greater impact on HCW infections; third-class and general hospitals closer to infection sources were correlated with especially high risks of infection.","output":"Spatiotemporal characteristics and factor analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting how the risk of pathogen spillover changes over space is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as human or wildlife vaccination. However, due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust predictions is challenging. Recent efforts to overcome this obstacle have capitalized on machine learning to predict spillover risk. Past approaches combine infection data from both humans and reservoir to train models that assess risk across broad geographical regions. In doing so, these models blend data sources that separately describe pathogen risk posed by the reservoir and the realized rate of spillover into the human population. We develop a novel approach that models as separate stages: 1) the contributions of spillover risk from the reservoir and pathogen distribution, and 2) the resulting incidence of pathogen in the human population. Our methodology allows for a rigorous assessment of whether forecasts of spillover risk can reliably predict the realized spillover rate into humans, as measured by seroprevalence. In addition to providing a rigorous cross-validation of risk predictions, this methodology could shed light on human habits that modulate or amplify the resultant spillover. We apply our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that poses a high threat of emergence in West Africa. The resulting framework is the first forecast to quantify the extent to which predictions of spillover risk from the reservoir explain regional variation in human seroprevalence. We use predictions generated by the model to revise existing estimates for the annual number of new human Lassa infections. Our model predicts that between 935,200 C 3,928,000 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year, an estimate that exceeds current conventional wisdom. Author Summary The 2019 emergence of SARS-2 coronavirus is a grim reminder of the threat animal-borne pathogens pose to human health. Even prior to SARS-2, the spillover of so-called zoonotic pathogens was a persistent problem, with pathogens such as Ebola and Lassa regularly but unpredictably causing outbreaks. Machine-learning models that can anticipate when and where animal-to-human virus transmission is most likely to occur could help guide surveillance effort, as well as preemptive countermeasures to pandemics, like information campaigns or vaccination programs. We develop a novel machine learning framework that uses data-sets describing the distribution of a virus within its host and the range of its animal host, along with human immunity data, to infer rates of animal-to-human transmission across a focal region. By training the model on data from the animal host, our framework allows rigorous validation of spillover predictions on human data. We apply our framework to Lassa fever, a viral disease of West Africa that is spread to humans by rodents, and update estimates of symptomatic and asymptomatic Lassa virus infections in humans. Our results suggest that Nigeria is most at risk for the emergence of new strains of Lassa virus, and therefore should be prioritized for outbreak-surveillance.","output":"Bridging the gap: Using reservoir ecology and human serosurveys to estimate Lassa virus incidence in West Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines nonresident parents' contact with their children in Hungary during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our results show that the mean number of measured direct contacts per visitor was nine persons and this can be reduced substantially by appropriate hygiene practices. A comparison of two versions of ventilation with different air exchange rates and different airflows found that the system which performed worst allowed a ten-fold increase in the number of individuals exposed to infectious aerosols. The overall burden of infections resulting from indoor mass gatherings depends largely on the quality of the ventilation system and the hygiene practices.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters target cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor via its spike (S) glycoprotein. We used molecular docking-based virtual screening approaches to categorize potential antagonists, halting ACE2-spike interactions by utilizing 450 FDA-approved chemical compounds. Three drug candidates (i.e., anidulafungin, lopinavir, and indinavir) were selected, which show high binding affinity toward the ACE2 receptor. The conformational stability of selected docked complexes was analyzed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulation trajectories were assessed and monitored for ACE2 deviation, residue fluctuation, the radius of gyration, solvent accessible surface area, and free energy landscapes. The inhibitory activities of the selected compounds were eventually tested in-vitro using Vero and HEK-ACE2 cells. Interestingly, besides inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein induced syncytia formation, anidulafungin and lopinavir also blocked S-pseudotyped particle entry into target cells. Altogether, anidulafungin and lopinavir are ranked the most effective among all the tested drugs against ACE2 receptor-S glycoprotein interaction.

An abnormal and overactivated inflammatory response is occasionally elicited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this hyperinflammation is associated with worse prognosis of COVID-19. Theoretically, one would expect patients with asthma to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering their increased susceptibility to common respiratory virus-associated exacerbations. Surprisingly, current data do not consistently suggest an increased prevalence of asthma among patients with COVID-19. Considering the high global prevalence of asthma, the characteristics of the disease and/or their conventional therapy might play a role in their potential defense against COVID-19. This may be attributed to the T helper type 2 immune response predominantly seen in patients with asthma. Likewise, asthma therapeutics, including corticosteroids and biologics, may in fact benefit the patients with asthma by alleviating the development of hyperinflammation. On the other hand, elevated IL-17 levels are characteristically seen in a subset of asthma patients with severe disease as well as in patients with COVID-19. Targeting the IL-17 pathway as a treatment strategy could plausibly alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 and asthma demonstrating a predominant T helper type 17 response.

We explored whether UK residents with more frequent or supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during March-August 2020, and potential factors moderating the relationship. METHODS: A convenience sample of UK dwelling participants aged a18 in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about face-to-face and phone/video social contact frequency, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9. Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern, perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency. RESULTS: In 71 117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15), those with high perceived social support scored 1.836 (1.801-1.871) points lower on PHQ-9 than those with low support. Daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower depressive symptoms (0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225-0.290) and 0.117 (0.080-0.154), respectively) compared to no contact. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability. CONCLUSIONS: We found during lockdown that those with higher quality or more face-to-face or phone/video contact had fewer depressive symptoms.

Medication management or engagement with in-person counseling services may be hindered by logistical and financial barriers. Telehealth may provide an alternative mechanism for continued engagement. This study aimed to evaluate the association between telehealth encounters and time to discontinuation of buprenorphine treatment when compared to traditional in-person visits and to evaluate potential effect modification by rural-urban designation and in-person and telehealth combination treatment. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of Veterans diagnosed with OUD and treated with buprenorphine across all facilities within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) between 2008 and 2017. Exposures were telehealth and in-person encounters for substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health, treated as time-varying covariates. The primary outcome was treatment discontinuation, evaluated as 14 days of absence of medication from initiation through 1 year. RESULTS: Compared to in-person encounters, treatment discontinuation was lower for telehealth for SUD (aHR: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.60, 0.78) and mental health (aHR: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.62, 0.76).

It is required for the safe reuse of contaminated medical, laboratory, and personal protective equipment, and for the safe handling of biological samples. Heat treatment is a common decontamination method, notably used for viruses. We show that for liquid specimens (here, solution of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture medium), the virus inactivation rate under heat treatment at 70C can vary by almost two orders of magnitude depending on the treatment procedure, from a half-life of 0.86 min (95% credible interval [CI] 0.09, 1.77) in closed vials in a heat block to 37.04 min (95% CI 12.64, 869.82) in uncovered plates in a dry oven. These findings suggest a critical role of evaporation in virus inactivation via dry heat. Placing samples in open or uncovered containers may dramatically reduce the speed and efficacy of heat treatment for virus inactivation. Given these findings, we reviewed the literature on temperature-dependent coronavirus stability and found that specimen container types, along with whether they are closed, covered, or uncovered, are rarely reported in the scientific literature. Heat-treatment procedures must be fully specified when reporting experimental studies to facilitate result interpretation and reproducibility, and must be carefully considered when developing decontamination guidelines. IMPORTANCE Heat is a powerful weapon against most infectious agents. It is widely used for decontamination of medical, laboratory, and personal protective equipment, and for biological samples. There are many methods of heat treatment, and methodological details can affect speed and efficacy of decontamination. We applied four different heat-treatment procedures to liquid specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that the container used to store specimens during decontamination can substantially affect inactivation rate; for a given initial level of contamination, decontamination time can vary from a few minutes in closed vials to several hours in uncovered plates. Reviewing the literature, we found that container choices and heat treatment methods are only rarely reported explicitly in methods sections. Our study shows that careful consideration of heat-treatment procedurein particular the choice of specimen container and whether it is coveredcan make results more consistent across studies, improve decontamination practice, and provide insight into the mechanisms of virus inactivation.","output":"Heat-Treated Virus Inactivation Rate Depends Strongly on Treatment Procedure: Illustration with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous research differentiated between emotional loneliness (perceived lack of emotional connection with others) and social loneliness (perceived lack of a broader social network).

Sarana dan prasarana tersebut berupa pedestrian, toilet umum, ruang terbuka publik, halte transportasi publik, zebra cross, dan pos jaga. Perempuan secara umum, dan pekerja perempuan khusus, memiliki karakteristik khas, yang menjadikan mereka peka terhadap hal-hal tertentu yang dapat mengganggu rasa aman dan nyaman mereka. Sementara, karena karakteristiknya tersebut, mereka juga rentan menjadi korban tindak kejahatan dan pelecehan seksual. Para pekerja perempuan yang karena tuntutan pekerjaannya mengharuskan mereka pulang larut malam paling rentan terhadap tindakan kejahatan tersebut. Sistem keamanan, termasuk pencahayaan kawasan yang memadai, penting untuk menjaga para pekerja perempuan. Karena itu, desain ruang publik di kawasan SCBD juga memperhatikan kebutuhan akan keamanan dan kenyamanan bagi berbagai tingkatan pekerja perempuan tersebut. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk me-review sistem keamanan yang berjalan saat ini di kawasan SCBD, pandangan pekerja perempuan terhadap sistem keamanan tersebut, dan merumuskan arah perbaikan ke depan. Penelitian ini adalah penelitian kualitatif dengan metode studi kasus. Karena penelitian dikerjakan pada masa pandemi COVID-19, sebagian proses pengumpulan data dilakukan secara online.

The proportion of female to male workers in SCBD is relatively equal, around 47% and 53%. In supporting activities in the area, there has sharing public facilities and infrastructure. The facilities and infrastructure include pedestrians, public toilets, public open area, bus stop, zebra cross, and guardhouse. Women in general and female workers in particular have unique characteristics which made them feelings, they will be sensitive to certain things that can disturb their feelings of security and comfort. Those characteristics also make them vulnerable to crime, including sexual harassment. This especially true for female workers who come home late at night. Security systems, including the lighting system of the area, are among the most important conditions for female workers. Therefore, in the design of public space at SCBD the need for secure and comfortable spaces for all categories and levels of female workers was also considered. The purpose of this study is to review the appropriate security system in the area, opinion of female workers toward the system, and to formulate future improvement directions. This research is a qualitative research with case study method. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, part of the data collection process was conducted online. Finding of the study reveal that there are several things that are not fulfilled by the SCBD management with respect to the needs for secure and comfortable public spaces for female workers. In the future, it is expected that SCBD management will be more sensitive to the specific collective needs and aspiration of female.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to characterize the coping styles and psychosocial distress of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate lasting sequalae on both mothers and infants. Here we use latent profile analysis to examine patterns of behavioral coping strategies associated with risk and resiliency to adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Leveraging a large U.S. sample of perinatal women (N = 2,876 pregnant women, N = 1,536 postpartum women), we identified four behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies: (1) passive-coping, characterized by primarily engaging in high levels of screen time, social media use, and eating comfort foods;(2) active-coping, characterized by primarily engaging in high levels of self-care, social support, and limiting media exposure;(3) low-coping, characterized by low levels of all coping strategies;(4) high-coping, characterized by high levels of both active and passive coping strategies. Critically, we found that passive-coping phenotypes were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety and worsening stress and energy levels in both pregnant and postpartum women. Supplementing passive coping strategies with high levels of active coping strategies (the high-coping profile) lessened adverse outcomes in postpartum women. These behavioral coping phenotypes highlight potential risk and protective factors for perinatal women, which is critical in helping to identify and treat perinatal women most at risk for experiencing mood and affective disorders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Behavioral coping phenotypes and psychosocial outcomes in a national U.S. sample of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Ancient societies recognized the needs of sanitation, food safety, workers health, and medical care to protect against disease and to promote well-being and civic prosperity.

In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and highly suspicious patients with compatible chest computed tomography features. Cardiac injury was defined as a rise of serum high sensitivity cardiac Troponin-I level above 99th percentile (men: > 26 ng/mL, women: > 11 ng/mL). A total of 386 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Cardiac injury was present among 115 (29.8%) of the study population. The development of cardiac injury was significantly associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to those with normal troponin levels (40.9% vs 11.1%, p value < 0.001). It was shown that patients with cardiac injury had a significantly lower survival rate after a median follow-up of 18 days from symptom onset (p log-rank < 0.001). It was further demonstrated in the multivariable analysis that cardiac injury could possibly increase the risk of short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (HR = 1.811, p-value = 0.023). Additionally, preexisting cardiovascular disease, malignancy, blood oxygen saturation < 90%, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia at presentation were independently associated with a greater risk of developing cardiac injury. Development of cardiac injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality and poor in-hospital outcomes. Additionally, it was shown that development of cardiac injury was associated with a lower short-term survival rate compared to patients without myocardial damage and could independently increase the risk of short-term mortality by nearly two-fold.","output":"The association between cardiac injury and outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the role of primary care facilities and their support measures in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify challenges to achieving publicCprivate cooperation in South Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four leading experts were selected and recruited to participate in this iterative web-based Delphi study. An open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect the expert panel's views in the first round. In the second round, the panel was asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement with individual items gleaned from qualitative content analysis of views expressed in the first round. The participants were offered the opportunity to reevaluate and correct their initial responses in subsequent rounds. Responses in the second and following rounds were analyzed using quantitative descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The first and second rounds were completed by 54.2% (n=13/24) and 58.3% (n=14/24) of the selected panel, respectively, while 10 out of these 14 participants completed the third round. The panel cited in-person essential medical services, telehealth for fever/respiratory symptoms, surveillance for influenzae-like illness, and minimization of spread to staff as important and appropriate roles of primary care, which are urgent and feasible during a pandemic. Regarding conditions/support for these roles, the panel indicated that institutional support and funding for separate areas, workforce, and telehealth, along with public-private collaborative governance, are urgent, but not feasible.

The authors used turnover theory to empirically examine factors that influence faculty engagement, including both aspirational and attrition-related career intentions. METHODS: Using a convergent, mixed methods design, the authors surveyed 284 faculty at a large Midwestern public universitys school of medicine in Fall 2015, Fall 2016, and Spring 2017. The studys questionnaire included a series of scales which informed three outcome variables (promotion aspirations, leadership aspirations, and intent to leave the organization) and four groups (role strain, workCfamily conflict, organizational commitment and support, and departmental commitment and support) of predictor variables, all of which have been previously validated with medical faculty populations. The scales were followed by open-ended questions which allowed respondents to further elaborate on their experiences in their organization related to each outcome variable. The authors used a hierarchical multiple regression model to assess the effect of each of the four groups of predictor variables on the outcome variables and then employed an iterative thematic analysis of open-ended responses to further elucidate facultys reported experiences. RESULTS: Organizational commitment and support were significantly associated with facultys promotion aspirations, leadership aspirations, and intentions to leave the organization. Thematic analysis of participant responses to open-ended questions further revealed the specific career development support faculty desired, mainly, streamlined and transparent promotion and leadership processes; clear guidance to maneuver these processes; holistic professional development opportunities; feeling valued; and supports for clinical and administrative tasks.

In this population-based retrospective cohort, we describe the association of ethnicity, socioeconomic and family key worker status with incidence and severity of Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). SETTING: Evelina London Children's Hospital (ELCH), the tertiary paediatric hospital for the South Thames Retrieval Service (STRS) region. PARTICIPANTS: 70 children with PIMS-TS admitted 14 February 2020-2 June 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence and crude ORs are presented, comparing ethnicity and socioeconomic status of our cohort and the catchment population, using census data and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). Regression is used to estimate the association of ethnicity and IMD with admission duration and requirement for intensive care, inotropes and ventilation. RESULTS: Incidence was significantly higher in children from black (25.0 cases per 100 000 population), Asian (6.4/100 000) and other (17.8/100 000) ethnic groups, compared with 1.6/100 000 in white ethnic groups (ORs 15.7, 4.0 and 11.2, respectively). Incidence was higher in the three most deprived quintiles compared with the least deprived quintile (eg, 8.1/100 000 in quintile 1 vs 1.6/100 000 in quintile 5, OR 5.2).

We repurposed covers for ultrasound transducers or endoscopic cameras to prevent surface and ambient air contamination. RESULTS: In our bronchoscopy simulation model, we noticed extensive aerosol generation, droplet spread and surface contamination. Exposure of health-care workers and contamination of surfaces can be efficiently reduced by repurposing covers for ultrasound transducers or endoscopic cameras to seal the tube opening during bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated patients.

A quarterly survey administered one year post-enrollment collected similar data. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8) and the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) were administered with the last follow-up survey after August 2019. Chart reviews ed VWD type information. The association of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with depression or anxiety was assessed using Chi-square tests for categorical variables, as well as logistic regression models with stepwise selection. Results: We analyzed data from 77 participants who completed both baseline and last follow-up surveys. Mean age was 34.2 (standard deviation (SD)=18.8) years, 74.0% were adults 18 years, 79.2% were female, 60.8% had Type 1/low VWF, and 3.9% had Type 3 VWD. Mean age at VWD diagnosis was 13.9 (SD=13.2) years. Overall reported depression rate was 63.4%, and 58.3% for anxiety (values 10 on either PHQ-8 or GAD-7). Proportion of those with depression (75% vs. 62%) or anxiety (58% vs. 58%) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were not significantly different. Persons with low VWF had higher rates of depression (86.7%) or anxiety (69.2%) as compared to those with type 1 VWD (55.3% for depression, 52.8% for anxiety) or types 2 and 3 (62.5%, 60.9%, p=0.10, not significant (NS) for depression and p=0.56, NS for anxiety, respectively). Females reported a higher rate of anxiety (61.4%) than males (46.7%, p=0.30, NS). When compared to individuals who rated their general health as the same or better than 3-months ago, those who rated their health as worse had significantly higher rates of depression (92.3% vs. 57.8%, p=0.02) and anxiety (83.3% vs. 53.3%, p=0.05). Participants with chronic pain reported a significantly higher depression rate (81.6% vs. 36.8%, p=0.0003). Those who reported having joint problems also reported depression at a significantly higher rate (82.4% vs. 48.8%, p=0.002) or anxiety (74.1% vs. 46.3%, p=0.02) than those without joint problems. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that among adults or parents of pediatric patients, being single or not with a partner was the most important variable associated with depression (odds ratio (OR)=7.0, confidence interval (CI): 1.7-29.0), followed by having joint problems (OR=6.3, CI=2.0-20.1). The most important variable associated with anxiety was being a youth aged 12-18 years old (OR=6.7, CI=1.6-26.9), followed by being single or not with a partner (OR=10.8, CI=2.5-47.5), or having worse health compared to 3-months prior (OR=12.3, CI=1.3-116.2). Mean covariates adjusted EQ index scores were lower among persons with depression (0.75standard error (SE) 0.03 vs. 0.830.04, p=0.06 NS) or anxiety (0.750.03 vs. 0.820.04, p=0.7 NS) than among those without depression or anxiety. As compared to individuals without depression or anxiety, mean covariates adjusted EQ VAS was significantly lower in persons with depression (68.73.1 vs. 77.64.2, p=0.03), but not among those with anxiety (69.33.7 vs. 71.34.3, p=0.66 NS). Conclusions: Our study revealed higher rates of major depression and anxiety in thi VWD sample than the general US population. Depression had a significant negative impact on HRQoL. Mental health screening is imperative for persons with VWD, especially those with low VWF, chronic pain or joint problems. Special attention should be paid to women and youth. This study underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach in the comprehensive care of patients seen at HTCs.

How the pandemic affects the employment of PWD and employers has yet to be determined. We aimed to investigate the employment consequences of the pandemic as experienced by PWD and employers. The research questions were: (1) What employment effects do PWD experience, and what business changes do employers encounter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) What challenges have PWD encountered during the pandemic? Methods Cross-sectional online surveys of 733 PWD and 67 employers in the Midwestern United States. Results Compared to non-disabled peers, PWD encountered more challenges in employment during the pandemic. We found high percentages of both employers and PWD experiencing employment changes and business shutdown during the pandemic. For PWD whose employment was not affected, 14.6% of the participants (n = 107) expected a loss of income and worried about the economic uncertainty of the pandemic. Unemployment for PWD is high due to illness or disability, being laid-off or furloughed, business reductions, and not feeling safe to work. However, only about 18.6% of unemployed PWD (n = 16) received pay or benefits for the time they were not working even though more than half filed for unemployment benefits. Conclusions The pandemic adversely affected employment of PWD as reported by workers and employers. Findings parallel the experience of the non-disabled workforce, but reveal vulnerabilities that reflect disability consequences and the need for job accommodations. Results reveal emergent needs for policy supports to reduce the disparities experienced by PWD in the workplace.

Thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin is recommended by current guidelines, but evidence is still weak. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin on hospital mortality in patients admitted for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of enoxaparin on intensive care admission and hospital length-of-stay were evaluated as secondary outcomes. METHODS: Observational cohort study, with data collected from patients admitted to Poliambulanza Foundation with positive real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 from 20th February to 10th May 2020. Multivariate logistic regression with overlap weight propensity score was used to model hospital mortality and intensive care admission, hospital length-of-stay was analyzed with a multivariate Poisson regression. Seven hundred and ninety nine (57%) patients who received enoxaparin at least once during the hospitalization were included in the enoxaparin cohort, 604 (43%) patients who did not were included in the control cohort. FINDINGS: At the adjusted analysis enoxaparin was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (Odds Ratio 053, 95% C.I. 040C070) compared with no enoxaparin treatment. Hospital length-of-stay was longer for patients treated with enoxaparin (Incidence Rate Ratios 145, 95% C.I. 136C154). Enoxaparin treatment was associated with reduced risk of intensive care admission at the adjusted analysis (Odds Ratio 048, 95% C.I. 032C069). INTERPRETATION: This study shows that treatment with enoxaparin during hospital stay is associated with a lower death rate and, while results from randomized clinical trials are still pending, this study supports the use of thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin in all patients admitted for COVID-19. Moreover, when enoxaparin is used on the wards, it reduces the risk of Intensive Care Unit admission.","output":"Thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin is associated with a lower death rate in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study assessed resilience at work, burnout, secondary trauma, and compassion satisfaction among social workers in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (May to June 2020). A convenience sample of 332 social workers (291 women (87.6%)) filled out an online, structured questionnaire that included demographics, a professional quality of life scale (ProQOL) (including three subscales), and resilience at work (RAW) (including seven subscales). The overall mean of the RAW was medium (M = 71, SD  8.9) compared to standardized scores. The mean scores of two of the subscales of the RAW, maintaining perspective and staying healthy, were low. The mean scores of the sub-scales of ProQOL were: compassion satisfaction was close to the 50th percentile (M = 48.25); burnout (M = 30.18) and secondary trauma (M = 26.27) were below the 25th percentile. Significant low to medium positive associations were found between all the dependent variables, except for staying healthy. A negative association was identified between compassion satisfaction and burnout, as well as between compassion satisfaction and secondary trauma. High levels of compassion satisfaction and contentment, low levels of secondary trauma, and having a managerial position were predicted to be 40% of the RAW. Lower levels of maintaining perspective, secondary trauma, and being younger predicted 27% of burnout. Higher levels of finding your calling, living authentically, maintaining perspective, interacting cooperatively, being older, and not being a manager predicted 58% of compassion satisfaction. Lower levels of burnout, maintaining perspective, and being younger predicted 36% of secondary trauma.

This study aims to explore the levels of dispositional optimism, resilience and psychological well-being in the sociodemographic and economic situation produced during the state of alarm and to investigate the resilience mediation between optimism and psychological well-being. The sample included 566 volunteers from Spain (73.5% women; M = 40.2 years, SD = 12.8). An ad hoc questionnaire was applied to request socioeconomic data and dispositional optimism (LOT-R). Resilience and psychological well-being were, respectively, evaluated by the Ryff scale and the Wagnild and Young scale. The results show that older and people with higher educational levels are more optimistic and have better psychological well-being. Well-being is also greater in married, divorced and widowed people and in those who have lived in outdoor spaces. However, those with spaced housing were more optimistic. Finally, it was found that the most optimistic people have better psychological well-being and that this is increased by the mediation process exercised by the ability to overcome adversity, provided age and educational level are controlled. It can be concluded that the design of preventive programs focused on improving strengths, positive emotions and skills in the population would be convenient to protect mental health.","output":"Confinement Situation of the Spanish Population during the Health Crisis of COVID-19: Resilience Mediation Process in the Relationship of Dispositional Optimism and Psychological Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This conceptual paper illustrates the issues, aims and significance of the ongoing study on the mental health of parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the role of digital technology that helps sustain well-being among parents of children with ASD.

METHODS: In this RCT, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients aged 18-85 years with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 symptoms <8 days were recruited. A total of 176 eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CDCM or placebo. Three rinses daily were performed for 7 days. Saliva sampling was performed on day 1 at 9 a.m. (T1), 1 p.m. (T2) and 6 p.m. (T3). On the following 6 days, one sample was taken at 3 p.m. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that, over the course of one day, CDCM was significantly more effective than placebo 4 hours after the first dose (p=0.036), with a median percentage (log10 copies/mL) decrease T1-T2 of -12.58% [-29.55% - -0.16%]. The second dose maintained the low median value for the CDCM (3.08 log(10) copies/mL [0 - 4.19]), compared to placebo (3.31 [1.18 - 4.75]). At day 7, there was still a greater median percentage (log(10) copies/mL) decrease in salivary viral load over time in the CDCM group (-58.62% [-100% - -34.36%]) compared to placebo group (-50.62% [-100% - -27.66%]). These results were confirmed by the per-protocol analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This trial supports the relevance of using CDCM on day 1 (4 hours after the initial dose) to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva. For long term effect (7 days), CDMC appears to provide a modest benefit compared to placebo in reducing viral load in saliva.","output":"Use of an antiviral mouthwash as a barrier measure in the sars-cov-2 transmission in adults with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke often leads to arm disability and reduced responsiveness to stimuli on the other side of the body. Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is made by skeletal muscle during infancy but levels drop postnatally and into adulthood. It is essential for the survival and wiring-up of sensory afferents from muscle. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into the affected triceps brachii forelimb muscle improves sensorimotor recovery after ischemic stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move this therapy one step nearer to the clinic, we set out to test the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after ischemic cortical stroke in adult rats. To simulate a clinically-feasible time-to-treat, twenty-four hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into triceps brachii for four weeks using implanted minipumps. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory deficits on the affected forearm. There was no evidence of forepaw sensitivity to cold stimuli after stroke or NT3 treatment. MRI confirmed that treatment did not induce neuroprotection. Functional MRI during low threshold electrical stimulation of the affected forearm showed an increase in peri-infarct BOLD signal with time in both stroke groups and indicated that neurotrophin-3 did not further increase peri-infarct BOLD signal. Rather, NT3 induced spinal neuroplasticity including sprouting of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways. Neurophysiology showed that NT3 treatment increased functional connectivity between the corticospinal tracts and spinal circuits controlling muscles on the treated side. After intravenous injection, radiolabelled NT3 crossed from bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in adult mice with or without strokes. Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of neurotrophin-3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral, high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.","output":"Corticospinal neuroplasticity and sensorimotor recovery in rats treated by infusion of neurotrophin-3 into disabled forelimb muscles started 24 h after stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 has had dramatic consequences on the world population in morbidity and mortality and socially.

Several lines of evidence suggest geriatric syndromes need to be assessed but little is known on their relative effect on the 30-day survival after ICU admission. The primary aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of frailty, cognition decline and activity of daily life in addition to the presence of comorbidity and polypharmacy and to assess their influence on 30-day survival. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with 242 ICUs from 22 countries. Patients 80 years or above acutely admitted over a six months period to an ICU between May 2018 and May 2019 were included. In addition to common patients characteristics and disease severity, we collected information on specific geriatric syndromes as potential predictive factors for 30-day survival, frailty (Clinical Frailty scale) with a CFS > 4 defining frail patients, cognitive impairment (informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE) with IQCODE  3.5 defining cognitive decline, and disability (measured the activity of daily life with the Katz index) with ADL  4 defining disability. A Principal Component Analysis to identify co-linearity between geriatric syndromes was performed and from this a multivariable model was built with all geriatric information or only one: CFS, IQCODE or ADL. Akaikes information criterion across imputations was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of our models. RESULTS: We included 3920 patients with a median age of 84 years (IQR: 81C87), 53.3% males). 80% received at least one organ support. The median ICU length of stay was 3.88 days (IQR: 1.83C8). The ICU and 30-day survival were 72.5% and 61.2% respectively. The geriatric conditions were median (IQR): CFS: 4 (3C6); IQCODE: 3.19 (3C3.69); ADL: 6 (4C6); Comorbidity and Polypharmacy score (CPS): 10 (7C14). CFS, ADL and IQCODE were closely correlated. The multivariable analysis identified predictors of 1-month mortality (HR; 95% CI): Age (per 1 year increase): 1.02 (1.C1.03, p = 0.01), ICU admission diagnosis, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) (per point): 1.15 (1.14C1.17, p < 0.0001) and CFS (per point): 1.1 (1.05C1.15, p < 0.001). CFS remained an independent factor after inclusion of life-sustaining treatment limitation in the model. CONCLUSION: We confirm that frailty assessment using the CFS is able to predict short-term mortality in elderly patients admitted to ICU. Other geriatric syndromes do not add improvement to the prediction model. Since CFS is easy to measure, it should be routinely collected for all elderly ICU patients in particular in connection to advance care plans, and should be used in decision making.

Resolving conflicts with conspecifics over valuable resources is an essential task for animals, and this takes an unusual form in mantis shrimp due to their powerful raptorial appendages. Decades of field and laboratory research have provided key insights into the natural agonistic interactions of diverse mantis shrimp species, including how they use their raptorial weapons against one another in telson sparring matches over cavities. These insights provided the foundation for functional morphologists, biomechanists, and engineers to work through different levels of organization: from the kinematics of how the appendages move, to the elastic mechanisms that power the strike, and down to the structure, composition, and material properties that transmit and protect against high-impact forces. Completing this narrative are studies on the defensive telson and how this structure is biomechanically matched to the weapon and the role it plays in ritualized fighting. The biomechanical understanding of the weapon and defense in mantis shrimp has, in turn, enabled a better understanding of whether mantis shrimp assess one another during contests and encouraged questions of evolutionary drivers on both the arsenal and behavior. Altogether, the body of research focused on mantis shrimp has presented perhaps the most comprehensive understanding of fighting, weapons, and defenses among crustaceans, from morphology and biomechanics to behavior and evolution. While this multi-level analysis of ritualized fighting in mantis shrimp is comprehensive, we implore the need to include additional levels of analysis to obtain a truly holistic understanding of this and other crustacean agonistic interactions. Specifically, both molting and environmental conditions are often missing from the narrative, yet they greatly affect crustacean weapons, defenses, and behavior. Applying this approach more broadly would generate a similarly profound understanding of how crustaceans carry out a variety of important tasks in diverse habitats.","output":"From telson to attack in mantis shrimp: bridging biomechanics and behavior in crustacean contests."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nurses are known to be at an increased risk of death by suicide, and recent studies have found links between nurse suicide, substance use, mental health issues, and job problems.

These actions engendered a storm of controversy as decisions relating to the virus quickly became tinged with political considerations, and this public dissent eroded the legitimacy of executive government. This Note discusses the trade-offs between democratic legitimacy and technocratic agility in executive emergency lawmaking. Drawing on a fifty-state survey, this Note shows how although drafters of these statutes attempted to balance executive power with legislative constraint, the statutes did not anticipate a long-duration, complex emergency like COVID-19. The statutes therefore generally do not allow substantive input by the legislature, and this has resulted in judicial showdowns and legislative pushback, eroding the legitimacy of executive action and more importantly endangering responses to future emergencies. This Note argues that in order to maintain robust and effective emergency power statutes in all states for future similar emergencies, states should revise the emergency power statutes to include more substantive legislative input, while retaining as much executive agility as possible. This Note suggests a model for such a revision to state statutes, inspired by the Congressional Review Act.","output":"Binding the Bound: State Executive Emergency Powers and Democratic Legitimacy in the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We have observed that critically ill patients with COVID-19 are in an extreme hypermetabolic state. This may be a major contributing factor to the extraordinary ventilatory and oxygenation demands seen in these patients. We aimed to quantify the extent of the hypermetabolic state and report the clinical effect of the use of hypothermia to decrease the metabolic demand in these patients. METHODS: Mild hypothermia was applied on four critically ill patients with COVID-19 for 48 hours. Metabolic rates, carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption were measured by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: The average resting energy expenditure (REE) was 299% of predicted. Mild hypothermia decreased the REE on average of 27.0% with resultant declines in CO(2) production (VCO(2)) and oxygen consumption (VO(2)) by 29.2% and 25.7%, respectively. This decrease in VCO(2) and VO(2) was clinically manifested as improvements in hypercapnia (average of 19.1% decrease in pCO(2) levels) and oxygenation (average of 50.4% increase in pO(2)).

The aim of this study was to characterize epidemiological trends and evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of SR and MA Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective observational overview study was conducted on medicine and health sciences SR and MA in Ethiopia that accessed through PubMed, PsycInfo, EMBASE databases and additional manual searching. SR and MA based on primary human studies associated with the Ethiopian population irrespective of the place of publication and authors affiliation and published until March 16, 2021 were included. Title/abstract and full-text screening were conducted in duplicate using EndNote and Covidence semiautometed reference management tools. Data extraction tool was developed by the author using PRISMA and AMSTAR-2 as a guide. We summarized background characteristics, and methodological and reporting qualities using frequencies with percentages and median with range. Two-tailed Chi-Square and Fisher Exact tests used for catergorical variables and Kruskal-Walis test for quantitative variables at alpha level 0.05 were used to compare the difference in background characterstics between SR and MA as well as across the publication years over time. All the analysis was done using R version 4.0.2 for macOS. Results: Of the 3,125 total records initially identified, 349 articles (48 (13.75%) SR, and 301 (86.25%) MA) were included in our analyses. We observed a dramatic increase in publications with nearly three-quarters of SR and MA (73.9%) published after 2018. More than nine out of ten (92.8%) SR and MA included only observational studies and infectious disease, was the most researched (20.9%) subject area. Number of authors, number of affiliations, publication year, protocol registration, number of primary studies, number of references, citation counts and journal quality were significantly different between SR and MA. Both SR and MA had a low methodological and reporting quality Even though there was improvement in registering protocols, searching databases, and transparently reporting search strategy. Conclusions: The production of SR and MA in Ethiopia has been increased over time, especially during the last three years. There is a promising trend of improvement in methodological and reporting quality even though there is much more to do.

METHODS: Electron microscopy was used to evaluate the pulmonary pathologies of postmortem lung sections from three patients who died from infection with SARS-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new member of the Coronaviridae family. RESULTS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was predominant in all three patients. The early exudative stage was characterized principally by edema and extravasation of red blood cells into the alveolar space with injury to the alveolar epithelial cells; this was followed by detachment, apoptosis, and necrosis of type I and II pneumocytes. The capillaries exhibited congestion, exposure of the basement membrane from denuded endothelial cells, platelet adhesion, fibrin thrombi, and rupture of the capillary walls. The proliferative stage was characterized by pronounced proliferation of type II alveolar pneumocytes and multinucleated giant cells. The cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 was observed both in degenerated type II pneumocytes and freely circulating in the alveoli, with components from virions, macrophages, lymphocytes, and cellular debris. CONCLUSIONS: Viral particles consistent with the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 were observed mainly in degenerated pneumocytes, in the endothelium, or freely circulating in the alveoli.

Following World Health Organization (WHO) and health care authorities around the World recommendations, all elective surgeries from benign diagnose procedures must be postponed and imperatively continue working on emergent and oncological urgent pathologies. Surgical elective treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is not considered as a priority. During BPH endoscopic surgeries, urine and blood are mixed with the irrigation liquid implying a risk of viral presence. Furthermore, a steam and smoke bubble is being accumulated inside the bladder implying the risk of splashing and aerosols. The risks of other viral infections have been identified during endourological procedures and they are related to splashing events. Several studies observed 33-100% of splashing on goggles. All BPH endoscopic procedures must be postponed. In case of complete urinary obstruction, this event can be adequately treated by urethral or suprapubic catheter under local anesthesia. As soon as local COVID-19 prevalence decreases, endourological procedures could be restarted. As protocols are being validating around the World to redeem elective surgeries, a symptomatic obstructed patient could be operated knowing his COVID-19 status with a molecular PCR, a cleaned epidemiological interview with a normal preoperative protocol. If patient is COVID-19+, surgery must be delayed until complete recovery, because mortality could increase as Lei from Wuhan describes.

Such widely penetrating impacts cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied concerns and sentiments among them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the concerns, sentiments, and disparities of various population groups during the COVID-19 pandemic through a cross-sectional study conducted via large-scale Twitter data mining infoveillance. METHODS: This study consisted of three steps: first, tweets posted during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments, and emotions were extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; third, multiple analyses were conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments, and disparities among population groups during the pandemic. Overall, this study implemented a quick, effective, and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities during a public health event. The source code developed in this study was released for free public use at GitHub. RESULTS: A total of 1,015,655 original English tweets posted from August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following results. Organizations were significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.48, 95% CI 3.39-3.58) and expressed more fear and depression emotions than individuals. Females were less concerned about COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) and expressed less fear and depression emotions than males. Among all age groups (ie, &#8804;18, 19-29, 30-39, and &#8805;40 years of age), the attention ORs of COVID-19 fear and depression increased significantly with age. It is worth noting that not all females paid less attention to COVID-19 than males. In the age group of 40 years or older, females were more concerned than males, especially regarding the economic and education topics. In addition, males 40 years or older and 18 years or younger were the least positive. Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern across all population groups. CONCLUSIONS: Through large-scale Twitter data mining, this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for different population groups. In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of each population group during the pandemic or any other major event for better informed public health research and interventions.","output":"Understanding Concerns, Sentiments, and Disparities Among Population Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic Via Twitter Data Mining: Large-scale Cross-sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide.

Knowledge on the types and frequency of respiratory viruses affecting school-children is important in determining the role of schools in transmission in the community and identifying targets for interventions. Methods: We conducted a one-year (term-time) surveillance of respiratory viruses in a rural primary school in Kilifi County, coastal Kenya between May 2017 and April 2018. A sample of 60 students with symptoms of ARI were targeted for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collection weekly. Swabs were screened for 15 respiratory virus targets using real time PCR diagnostics. Data from respiratory virus surveillance at the local primary healthcare facility was used for comparison. Results: Overall, 469 students aged 2-19 years were followed up for 220 days. A total of 1726 samples were collected from 325 symptomatic students; median age of 7 years (IQR 5-11). At least one virus target was detected in 384 (22%) of the samples with a frequency of 288 (16.7%) for rhinovirus, 47 (2.7%) parainfluenza virus, 35 (2.0%) coronavirus, 15 (0.9%) adenovirus, 11 (0.6%) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 5 (0.3%) influenza virus.

Furthermore, Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States of America was a staunch Twitter user who almost religiously used the platform for communicating to the public, more than and even some times in place of the regular established main stream media channels such as radio and television broadcasts and long standing processes such as white house press conferences and media releases. The study was conducted on tweets from the entire 4 years of Trump's presidency with a focus on the biggest crisis during his presidency: The COVID-19 global pandemic which lead to the only, and exceptionally short-lived, rally around the flag effect for his presidency.Ultimately, the study found that sentiment towards the president on Twitter did not mimic the nation's sentiment toward the president except for a brief moment during the peak of the rally around the flag effect;which is not enough for obtaining situational awareness nor for acting decisively in a timely manner that is in accordance with public sentiment. This result is to be expected, as while Twitter remains one of the dominate social media sites in the United States, it's users do not accurately reflect the demographics of the nation. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Political Approval Ratings for Situational Awareness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: For a number of reasons, persons with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19. AIMS: This study explored the influence of congregate setting on testing positive for COVID-19 among adults with IDD in Ontario. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: 833 home care recipients with IDD were included, 204 were tested at least once for COVID-19. These data were linked to the homecare assessment data. The association between living in a congregate setting and receiving a positive COVID-19 test was explored using a logistic regression model among the total sample and those tested for COVID-19. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: 77 individuals tested positive for COVID-19 (9.24 %). Congregate setting, age, aggression, and mobility were significantly associated with receiving a positive COVID-19 test in the total sample. Among the subgroup, congregate setting and age were significant. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Adults with IDD have an increased risk for positive COVID-19 tests at younger ages than other high-risk populations, such as elderly persons. These findings confirm the vulnerability of adults with IDD living in group settings to COVID-19. As such, they should be prioritized when COVID-19 prevention and public health strategies, including vaccination and boosters, are introduced.","output":"Short Report: The influence of congregate setting on positive COVID-19 tests among a high-risk sample of adults with intellectual and developmental disability in Ontario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in women.

Public health surveillance and health care delivery systems now continuously generate massive amounts of data that could be leveraged to enable both screening of cardiovascular risk and implementation of tailored preventive interventions across a woman's life span. However, health care providers, clinical guidelines committees, and health policy experts are not yet sufficiently equipped to optimize the collection of data on women, use or interpret these data, or develop approaches to targeting interventions.

Satellite-based (Sentinel-2) water quality analysis before and during lockdown was performed for seven selected locations spread across the entire stretch of the Ganges (RishikeshCDimond Harbour). Results revealed that due to the lockdown, the water quality of the Ganges improved with reference to specific water quality parameters, but the improvements were region specific. Along the entire stretch of Ganges, only the Haridwar site showed improvement to an extent of being potable as per the threshold set by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi, India. A 55% decline in turbidity at that site during the lockdown was attributed to the abrupt halt in pilgrimage activities. Absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter which is an indicator of organic pollution declined all along the Ganges stretch with a maximum decline at the downstream location of Diamond Harbour. Restricted discharge of industrial effluent, urban pollution, sewage from hotels, lodges, and spiritual dwellings along the Ganges are some of the reasons behind such declines. No significant change in the geographic trend of chlorophyll-a was observed. The findings of this study highlight the importance of regular monitoring of the changes in the Ganges water quality using Sentinel-2 data to further isolate the anthropogenic impact, as India continues the phase-wise opening amidst the pandemic.","output":"Water quality assessment of the Ganges River during COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundStaff strive to deliver high-quality care in demanding settings, and though keen and motivated, are often short on time, support, or skills to engage in quality improvement (QI) activities. There is a perceived notion that, though there are QI opportunities for senior medical and nursing staff, these are less accessible to allied health care professionals. Experience and feedback have shown that formal support for developing QI skills is often fragmented, difficult to access and as a result, QI can be seen as a tick-box exercise or undertaken only if mandated as essential for progression.ObjectivesOur aim was to develop QI capability amongst multi-professional staff thereby empowering individuals and teams to drive a culture of continuous improvement.MethodsWe set up QI Hub in 2018 to enable multi-professional staff to develop QI capability, by providing shared learning, collaboration, and individual mentorship. Hub is multi-disciplinary and open to everyone within the Trust.The format consists of a structured and comprehensive QI educational programme providing fortnightly, dedicated teaching on key QI methodologies including Model for improvement, Process map, Lean, and patient involvement. Each session is followed by individualised, practical face-to-face workshops with mentors, covering projects, ABCD, and action learning sets. Our faculty come from different specialties, providing effective communication and shared, collaborative QI. Each cohort runs for 4 months.Due to restrictions during COVID, staff were struggling to undertake or receive support for QI projects. We adapted the program to deliver it remotely since May 2020, with fortnightly sessions of dedicated online QI teaching, mentorship, and virtual workshops.Surveys were conducted for individual sessions, at end of each cohort and after one year of completion.ResultsQI Hub has been running successfully for 2 years and we have supported 70 QI projects with over 80 participants.Hub was popular with 72% representation from multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. Majority of the participants had no previous experience of QI. 96% reported increased confidence in undertaking QI. Participants described Hub as enlightening, empowering, and feeling valued.Hub has supported personal growth and career progression and alumni have taken on senior management roles and led further QI projects. 100% would recommend us to their colleagues.Feedback using Likert survey revealed that 95% participants reported individual sessions as highly satisfactory, workshops useful and support from faculty was valued. We continued to deliver QI training and support remotely without affecting the quality of training. 96% rated the virtual sessions very good and workshops were deemed valuable.QI projects have led to improvements in patient safety and outcomes including streamlining of care, medication safety, reduced Los, and better patient experience. These were presented at Trust, national and international meetings.ConclusionsQI Hub has enabled multi-professional staff to undertake high-quality QI projects and empowered them to deliver continuous improvements for patients throughout the pandemic. We have demonstrated that an effective QI programme can be delivered virtually in the current climate to ensure that the improvements and support systems for QI are sustained.","output":"Surviving and thriving C creating a culture of improvement during COVID"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Network pharmacology combines drug and disease targets with biological information networks based on the integrity and systematicness of the interactions between drugs and disease targets. This study aims to explore the molecular basis of Hanshi Zufei formula for treatment of COVID-19 based on network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. METHODS: Using TCMSP, the chemical constituents and molecular targets of Atractylodis Rhizoma, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Pogostemonis Herba, Tsaoko Fructus, Ephedrae Herba, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, and Arecae Semen were investigated. The predicted targets of novel coronavirus were screened using the NCBI and GeneCards databases. To further screen the drug-disease core targets network, the corresponding target proteins were queried using multiple databases (Biogrid, DIP, and HPRD), a protein interaction network graph was constructed, and the network topology was analyzed. The molecular docking studies were also performed between the networks top 15 compounds and the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and angiotensin conversion enzyme II (ACE2). RESULTS: The herb-active ingredient-target network contained nine drugs, 86 compounds, and 49 drug-disease targets. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis resulted in 1566 GO items (P < 0.05), among which 1438 were biological process items, 35 were cell composition items, and 93 were molecular function items. Fourteen signal pathways were obtained by enrichment screening of the KEGG pathway database (P < 0.05). The molecular docking results showed that the affinity of the core active compounds with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase was better than for the other compounds. CONCLUSION: Several core compounds can regulate multiple signaling pathways by binding with 3CL hydrolase and ACE2, which might contribute to the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Exploration of hanshi zufei prescription for treatment of COVID-19 based on network pharmacology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral agent of COVID-19, the disease at the center of the current global pandemic. While knowledge of highly structured regions is integral for mechanistic insights into the viral infection cycle, very little is known about the location and folding stability of functional elements within the massive, a30kb SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In this study, we analyze the folding stability of this RNA genome relative to the structural landscape of other well-known viral RNAs. We present an in-silico pipeline to predict regions of high base pair content across long genomes and to pinpoint hotspots of well-defined RNA structures, a method that allows for direct comparisons of RNA structural complexity within the several domains in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We report that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic propensity for stable RNA folding is exceptional among RNA viruses, superseding even that of HCV, one of the most structured viral RNAs in nature. Furthermore, our analysis suggests varying levels of RNA structure across genomic functional regions, with accessory and structural ORFs containing the highest structural density in the viral genome. Finally, we take a step further to examine how individual RNA structures formed by these ORFs are affected by the differences in genomic and subgenomic contexts, which given the technical difficulty of experimentally separating cellular mixtures of sgRNA from gRNA, is a unique advantage of our in-silico pipeline. The resulting findings provide a useful roadmap for planning focused empirical studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology, and a preliminary guide for exploring potential SARS-CoV-2 RNA drug targets.Importance The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 is among the largest and most complex viral genomes, and yet its RNA structural features remain relatively unexplored. Since RNA elements guide function in most RNA viruses, and they represent potential drug targets, it is essential to chart the architectural features of SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint regions that merit focused study. Here we show that RNA folding stability of SARS-CoV-2 genome is exceptional among viral genomes and we develop a method to directly compare levels of predicted secondary structure across SARS-CoV-2 domains. Remarkably, we find that coding regions display the highest structural propensity in the genome, forming motifs that differ between the genomic and subgenomic contexts. Our approach provides an attractive strategy to rapidly screen for candidate structured regions based on base pairing potential and provides a readily interpretable roadmap to guide functional studies of RNA viruses and other pharmacologically relevant RNA transcripts.","output":"The global and local distribution of RNA structure throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic also called for the teaching of practical skills to develop teaching formats outside of classroom teaching.

Method: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study including all neonates from a National Registry supported by Iranian Maternal and Neonatal Network (IMaN). Since February 2020 till February 2021, data of neonates under 28 days who were diagnosed with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been registered in this network were collected. General data including epidemiological, clinical outcomes and infection-related information were collected. Results: : In our retrospective study, data of 4015 neonates admitted to hospital all over the country and reported in IMAN is included. Totally 3725 PCR tests were performed (92.8% of admitted neonates) and from these neonates 825 (20.5%) showed positive PCR test. There were no differences between gender, weight and gestational age in neonates with positive and negative PCR test. Neonatal clinical findings were dependent to the type of admission. Respiratory distress was the most common sign in neonates, who were admitted immediately after birth (63.9%), and who were transferred from another hospital (17%);however in those who were admitted after one to several days after discharge (19.1%), the most common sign were sepsis like syndrome (31.8%) and fever (27.4%). Almost 50% of admitted neonate\`s mothers had positive PCR test (25% during pregnancy and 24.3% after delivery).

With a spatial method and multiple sources of data, this research demonstrates the uneven impact of the lockdown policy and public transit system in shaping local pandemic outcomes. Census tracts with people spending more time at home have lower infection and death rates, while those with a higher density of transit stations have higher infection and death rates. Residential profile matters and census tracts with a higher concentration of disadvantaged population, such as Blacks, Hispanics, poor and elderly people, and people with no health insurance, have higher infection and death rates. Spatial analyses identify clusters where the lockdown policy was not effective and census tracts that share similar pandemic characteristics.

This paper examines the strategies used by management in response to austerity in the three public hospitals and their effect on organisational functioning. METHODS: We used a comparative qualitative case study approach, collecting data using a combination of in-depth interviews with managers, and focus group discussion and interviews with shop stewards and staff. RESULTS: Austerity, imposed by the introduction of a provincial cost containment committee, has led to a reduction in staff, benefits, shortages of equipment and delayed procurement and recruitment processes. Managers in the first hospital maintained training on labour relations for staff and managers, they jointly planned how to cope with reduced staff and initiated a new forum for HR and finance staff. These strategies improved the way actors engaged, enabling them to resolve problems. Good communication ensured that staff understood what was within the hospitals control and what was not. A second hospital relied on absorptive strategies, such as asking staff to do more with less. The result was resistance, and greater use of sick leave. Some staff gave their own money to help feed patients but were angry at management for putting them in this difficult position. Leadership in the third hospital did not manage actors well either; help from the Governments Expanded Public Works Programme was rejected by the unions, managers did not attend meetings as they felt their contributions were not listened to. Poor communication meant that the managers and staff did not understand what was within the hospitals control and what was not; a misunderstanding led to a physical fight between managers. CONCLUSION: Organisational resilience in the face of austerity requires leaders to manage different stakeholders well. Hospital managers who promote democratic or participatory leadership and management, open communication, teamwork and trust among all stakeholders will lead better functioning organisations. A special focus should be placed on such practices to develop the resilience of health systems organisations.","output":"Austerity, resilience and the management of actors in public hospitals: a qualitative study from South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic initially had a smaller impact on Taiwan than on most other industrialized countries. However, an outbreak in late April 2021 led to a sharp surge in cases from mid-May 2021. Patient involvement in the health technology assessment (HTA) process, however, was not much affected by this; virtual meetings were implemented. This descriptive paper presents an overview of patient involvement in the HTA process in Taiwan via the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) online submission platform, participation in appraisal committees, education programs, and cooperation with patients' organizations, and outlines its progress and challenges. The National Health Insurance Act, amended in 2013, protects patients' rights and invites them to voice their opinions, which are then presented to the relevant authority. Based on this act, various mechanisms have been developed to involve patients, caregivers, and patient organizations in both the HTA and the reimbursement process. Prior to the Pharmaceutical Benefit and Reimbursement Scheme (PBRS) Joint Committee meeting, the NHIA built an online platform that allows patients to submit their opinions, which are then incorporated into the HTA reports. The results are also discussed with patient representatives, following which the related documents are published on the NHIA website. From May 2015 to December 2020, 30 patients' insights were published before the PBRS Joint Committee meetings. Of these, 19 (63%) were related to oncology cases. In Taiwan, approaches to fostering patient engagement include the use of a platform for patients' and patients groups' input, among others. Although patient engagement is important for understanding the needs of the target patient population, challenges in ensuring timely patient engagement and provision of relevant resources remain.

Data come from the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 061 Study, a cohort study of BMSM recruited in 6 U.S. cities (Atlanta, GA, Boston, MA, Los Angeles, CA, New York, NY, San Francisco, CA, and Washington DC). Participants completed baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up interviews. A convenience sample of 1553 BMSM was recruited between July 2009 and October 2010 of whom 1155 returned for a follow-up interview 12 months later. Accounting for previous police interaction, poverty, psychopathology, drug use, and alcohol use, we estimated associations between recent police harassment reported at the 6 month follow-up interview and 12 month outcomes including psychosocial vulnerability (elevated racial/sexual identity incongruence), psychological distress (being distressed by experiences of racism and/or homophobia), and depression. About 60% of men reported experiencing police harassment between the baseline and 6-month interview due to their race and/or sexuality. Adjusted analyses suggested police harassment was independently associated with a 10.81 (95% CI: 7.97, 13.66) point increase and 8.68 (95% CI: 6.06, 11.30) point increase in distress due to experienced racism and distress due to experienced homophobia scores, respectively. Police harassment perceived to be dually motivated predicted disproportionate levels of distress. Police harassment is prevalent and associated with negative influences on psychosocial vulnerability and psychological distress among BMSM.

They are relevant for not only general purpose programming languages, but also for many domain specific languages. Bugs in compilers can potentially render all programs at risk. It is thus crucial that compilers are systematically tested, if not verified. Recently, a number of efforts have been made to formalise and standardise programming language semantics, which can be applied to verify the correctness of the respective compilers. In this work, we present a novel specification-based testing method named SpecTest to better utilise these semantics for testing. By applying an executable semantics as test oracle, SpecTest can discover deep semantic errors in compilers. Compared to existing approaches, SpecTest is built upon a novel test coverage criterion called semantic coverage which brings together mutation testing and fuzzing to specifically target less tested language features. We apply SpecTest to systematically test two compilers, i.e., the Java compiler and the Solidity compiler. SpecTest improves the semantic coverage of both compilers considerably and reveals multiple previously unknown bugs.","output":"SpecTest: Specification-Based Compiler Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional teaching suggests that corticosteroids should be avoided during acute infectious episodes for fear of compromising the immune response.

Under normal circumstances, School Feeding Programs (SFPs) can help to ensure child food security. In the wake of the pandemic, policy makers worldwide have been challenged to adapt national SFPs to provide nutritional support to children (and indirectly to their families) during extended school closures. Most national SFPs implemented contingency plans to ensure continued nutritional support for children. In Israel, where SFPs were largely suspended during long periods of mandated school closing, there was a loss of 30C50% of feeding days for the ~ 454,000 children enrolled in the program. The lack of emergency contingency planning and failure to maintain Israeli SFPs during school closures reveals longstanding structural policy flaws that hindered coordination between relevant ministries and authorities and impeded the mobilization of funds and existing programs to meet the emergent need. The school feeding law does not identify child food security as an explicit aim, there are no benchmarks for monitoring and evaluating the program to ensure that the food aid reaches the children most in need, even routinely, and the Ministry of Education had no obligation to maintain the program and to marshal data on the participants that could be acted upon in the emergency. Moreover, because Israeli SFPs are selective, in other words, implemented according to community risk (low-income, high poverty rate) and geographical factors, attendant stigma and financial burdens can make participation in the program less attractive to families and communities that need them the most. We argue that Israel should make urgent, long-term improvements to the SFPs as follows: First, eliminating childhood food insecurity should be made an explicit goal of legislation in the broader context of national social, health, and nutritional goals, and this includes ensuring SFPs are maintained during emergencies. Second, the government should assume responsibility for the routine assessment and data collection on food insecurity among Israeli children. Third, SFPs should be subjected to rigorous independent program evaluation. Finally, a universal SFP providing nutritious diets would likely improve the health of all Israeli children, across all socioeconomic backgrounds. These steps to guarantee that Israeli children have food to realize their full physical and cognitive potential would emphasize Israels firm commitment to support multiple dimensions of health, educational achievement, and societal values, to combat the complex and long-term consequences of the pandemic, and to prepare for the next one.","output":"Child food insecurity in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: urgent need for policy evaluation and reform in Israels school feeding programs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is the worst healthcare emergency of this century, and its impact on pediatrics and neonatology is still largely unknown.

Feeding increased serum levels of LPS, which is known to induce multiple genes in immune cells. Notably, LPS together with insulin potently induced IL-10 in macrophages, which could also be detected in the postprandial portal vein in vivo. In cultured hepatocytes, physiological levels of insulin alone did not suppress gluconeogenic gene expression, although when added together with medium from macrophages stimulated with LPS and insulin, they were markedly suppressed. This suppression was not seen in medium from macrophages of IL-10 knockout mice, showing this to be an IL-10 dependent process. Plasma glucose concentration ad libitum was elevated in mice injected with adenovirus encoding shRNA targeting the IL-10 receptor, and the normal postprandial suppression of gluconeogenic genes in liver was compromised, showing the importance of the IL-10 signal in postprandial glucose metabolism. Furthermore, myeloid-specific knockout of Akt1 and Akt2 resulted in similar phenotypes that were rescued by incrementing mTOR signaling, pointing to an Akt-mTOR dependent mechanism. As whole-body deficiency of IL-10 has been reported to decrease body weight and increase insulin sensitivity, we assessed the effect of myeloid deficiency of IL-10 by conducting bone marrow transfer from IL-10 knockout mice to wild type mice. While these phenotypes were recapitulated, postprandial glucose production was not improved despite markedly increased whole-body insulin sensitivity. These results pointed to the differential actions of myeloid IL-10 where baseline production maintains normal body weight, while postprandial increases in the hepatic-portal system suppresses hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression, collectively showing the need for context-dependent administration of IL-10 based therapies.

Viral transmission occurs directly or indirectly via fomites. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment after sequential oronasal infections of specified pathogen-free cats with two FCV field strains in a research facility. Replicating virus was detected in saliva swabs from all ten cats after the first and in four out of ten cats after the second FCV exposure using virus isolation to identify FCV shedders. In the environment, where cleaning, but no disinfection took place, FCV viral RNA was detectable using RT-qPCR on all tested items and surfaces, including cat hair. However, only very limited evidence was found of replicating virus using virus isolation. Viral RNA remained demonstrable for at least 28 days after shedding had ceased in all cats. Disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate (and Incidin(TM) Plus) and barrier measures were effective in that no viral RNA was detectable outside the cat rooms.

METHODS A 41-question survey was distributed from June to September 2020 to members of the Society of Breast Imaging and the National Consortium of Breast Centers. Psychological distress and financial loss scores were calculated on the basis of survey responses and compared across gender and age subgroups. A multivariate logistic model was used to identify factors associated with psychological distress scores. RESULTS A total of 628 surveys were completed (18% response rate); the mean respondent age was 52  10 years, and 79% were women. Anxiety was reported by 68% of respondents, followed by sadness (41%), sleep problems (36%), anger (25%), and depression (23%). A higher psychological distress score correlated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; P = .001), younger age (OR, 0.8 per SD; P = .005), and a higher financial loss score (OR, 1.4; P < .0001). Participants whose practices had not initiated wellness efforts specific to COVID-19 (54%) had higher psychological distress scores (OR, 1.4; P = .03). Of those with children at home, 38% reported increased childcare needs, higher in women than men (40% vs 29%, P < .001). Thirty-seven percent reported that childcare needs had adversely affected their jobs, which correlated with higher psychological distress scores (OR, 2.2-3.3; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Psychological distress was highest among younger and female respondents and those with greater pandemic-specific childcare needs and financial loss. Practice-initiated COVID-19-specific wellness efforts were associated with decreased psychological distress. Policies are needed to mitigate pandemic-specific burnout and worsening gender disparities.","output":"COVID-19 and Breast Radiologist Wellness: Impact of Gender, Financial Loss and Childcare Need"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Together with metabolites, proteins, and lipid components, the EV cargo consists of DNA and RNA nucleotide sequence species, which are part of the intracellular communication network regulating specific cellular processes and provoking distinct target cell responses. The extracellular vesicle (EV) nucleotide sequence cargo molecules are often investigated in association with a particular pathology and may provide an insight into the physiological and pathological processes in hard-to-access organs and tissues. The diversity and biological function of EV nucleotide sequences are distinct regarding EV subgroups and differ in tissue- and cell-released EVs. EV DNA is present mainly in apoptotic bodies, while there are different species of EV RNAs in all subgroups of EVs. A limited sample volume of unique human liquid biopsy provides a small amount of EVs with limited isolated DNA and RNA, which can be a challenging factor for EV nucleotide sequence analysis, while the additional difficulty is technical variability of molecular nucleotide detection. Every EV study is challenged with its first step of the EV isolation procedure, which determines the EVs purity, yield, and diameter range and has an impact on the EVs downstream analysis with a significant impact on the final result. The gold standard EV isolation procedure with ultracentrifugation provides a low output and not highly pure isolated EVs, while modern techniques increase EVs yield and purity. Different EV DNA and RNA detection techniques include the PCR procedure for nucleotide sequence replication of the molecules of interest, which can undergo a small-input EV DNA or RNA material. The nucleotide sequence detection approaches with their advantages and disadvantages should be considered to appropriately address the study problem and to extract specific EV nucleotide sequence information with the detection using qPCR or next-generation sequencing. Advanced next-generation sequencing techniques allow the detection of total EV genomic or transcriptomic data even at the single-molecule resolution and thus, offering a sensitive and accurate EV DNA or RNA biomarker detection. Additionally, with the processes where the EV genomic or transcriptomic data profiles are compared to identify characteristic EV differences in specific conditions, novel biomarkers could be discovered. Therefore, a suitable differential expression analysis is crucial to define the EV DNA or RNA differences between conditions under investigation. Further bioinformatics analysis can predict molecular cell targets and identify targeted and affected cellular pathways. The prediction target tools with functional studies are essential to help specify the role of the investigated EV-targeted nucleotide sequences in health and disease and support further development of EV-related therapeutics.

Its critical to explore the relationship between weather variables and the spread of the COVID-19 for understanding seasonality and the possibility of future outbreaks, developing early warning systems, infection control methods, and public health measures. However, the influence of weather change on COVID-19 edidemic is still an emerging research field, and there is still relatively limited literature available. Objectives: Our study aims to explore the causal relationship between weather conditions and COVID-19 epidemic, the regional heterogeneity of the influence of weathner conditions in east-middle-west and coastal-inland, the moderating effect of diurnal temperature difference, public health measures, and public opinion on the influence of weather conditions on the epidemic to investigate the effects of these factors on the intensity of weather conditions. Methods: : First, we theoretically explain the influence mechanism of weather conditions on the epidemic based on the epidemiological triangle model. Then, we collect COVID-19-related prefecture-daily panel data in mainland China from January 1, 2020, to February 19, apply two-way fixed effect model of multiple linear regression, and also take into account other influencing factors such as population movement, public health interventions of the local government, economic and social conditions, to explore the causal relationship between weather conditions and the COVID-19 epidemic. Results: : It is found that first, there is a conditional negative linear relationship between the weather conditions and the epidemic. When the average temperature is greater than -7, there is a significant negative causal relationship between the average temperature and the growth rate of the confirmed cases. Similarly, when the relative humidity is greater than 46%, the increase in the relative humidity significantly contain the epidemic. However, when the average temperature is less than -7 or the relative humidity is less than 46%, the effect of weather conditions is not significant. Further, from the perspective of weather conditions, prefecture-level administrative regions such as Chifeng, Zhangjiakou, and Ulanqab are more conducive to the outbreak of the epidemic in winter. Then, weather conditions have a greater influence in the east than in the middle and western regions, and it is better in coastal region than in the inland. Finally, increasing diurnal temperature differences will improve the impact of weather conditions on the confirmed cases. In dry and cold regions, higher diurnal temperature differences will increase the risk of spread of the disease;Strict public health measures and good public opinion can mitigate the adverse effects of cold and dry weather on the spread of the epidemic. Discussion: In future research, it can adopt more detailed investigation methods. Under the legal framework of privacy protection, questionnaire surveys can be carried out with patients' consent to draw more accurate conclusions. At the same time, in terms of the mechanism of the role of weather variables, more in-depth interdisciplinary cooperation with epidemiologists is needed to study the specific impact of weather conditions on the survivability of the COVID-19 virus and the immunity of susceptible populations to obtain a clearer picture and compelling conclusions.","output":"Do Weather Conditions Affect COVID-19 Epidemic?

Due to these risks, patients are encouraged to avoid clinics and instead use Telemedicine for safer consultations and diagnoses. In March, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice titled Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 Nationwide Public Health Emergency (the Notification). The Notification relaxes the enforcement of privacy and security safeguards established by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) until further notice, in order to facilitate the transition to telehealth services for the broader purpose of promoting public health during the pandemic. Specifically, covered healthcare providers can use telehealth to provide all services that, in their professional judgment, they believe can be provided through telehealth. If providers make good faith efforts to provide the most timely and accessible care possible, they will not be subject to penalties for breaching the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.

We explored ways to deal with the coronavirus stressor and psychological outcomes among physicians and nurses. Subjects and methods: 124 healthcare workers in General Hospital Nasice (Croatia) were invited to participate in a study by performing within the period of March 26 to April 6 2020 questionnaire collected information on socio-demographic characteristics and living conditions that may be risk factors for covid-19 concern, Short form health survey-36, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC;consisting of 8 subscales: Confrontive Coping, Distancing, Self-Controlling, Seeking Social Support, Accepting Responsibility, Escape-Avoidance, Planful Problem Solving, Positive Reappraisal). Results: 11% health workers reports moderate to very-severe depression, 17% moderate to extremely-severe anxiety and 10% for moderate to extremely-severe stress. 67% of medical staff are worried. No statistically significant differences in the scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were found between nurses and physicians, but differences were found on Escape-Avoidance and Positive Reappraisal subscales. Nurses use significantly more avoiding coping style and positive reappraisal than doctors. Seeking social support is more pronounced in those over 40 years old, while those under 40 use more avoidable stress management techniques.

Design: Retrospective cohort. Setting: Two emergency departments in Detroit, Michigan, United States, during a local coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak (March 2020 to April 2020). Patients: Emergency department patients receiving lung ultrasound for clinical suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period. Interventions: None, observational analysis only. Measurements and Main Results: By a reference standard of serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, 42 patients were coronavirus disease 2019 positive, 16 negative, and eight untested (test results lost, died prior to testing, and/or did not meet hospital guidelines for rationing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests). Thirty-three percent, 44%, 38%, and 17% had mortality, ICU admission, intubation, and venous or arterial thromboembolism, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% CIs were calculated for five lung ultrasound patterns coded by a blinded reviewer and chest radiograph. Chest radiograph had area under the curve = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54-0.79), 74% sensitivity (95% CI, 48-93%), and 53% specificity (95% CI, 32-75%). Two lung ultrasound patterns had a statistically significant area under the curve: symmetric bilateral pulmonary edema (area under the curve, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50-0.64), and a nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern (edema in superior lung &#8805; inferior lung and no pleural effusion; area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). Chest radiograph plus the nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern showed a statistically improved area under the curve (0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.90) compared to either alone, but at the ideal cutoff had sensitivity and specificity equivalent to nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema only (69% and 77%, respectively). The strongest combination of clinical, chest radiograph, and lung ultrasound factors for diagnosis was nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern with temperature and oxygen saturation (area under the curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94; sensitivity = 77% [58-93%]; specificity = 76% [53-94%] at the ideal cutoff), which was superior to chest radiograph alone. Conclusions: Lung ultrasound diagnosed severe presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 with similar sensitivity to chest radiograph, CT, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (on first testing) and improved specificity compared to chest radiograph. Diagnostically useful lung ultrasound patterns differed from those hypothesized by previous, nonanalytical, reports (case series and expert opinion), and should be evaluated in a rigorous prospective study.","output":"Point-of-Care Lung Ultrasound for Detecting Severe Presentations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in the Emergency Department: A Retrospective Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The circular economy model offers great opportunities to companies, as it not only allows them to capture additional value from their products and materials, but also reduce the fluctuations of price-related risks and material supply These risks are present in all kind of businesses not based on the circular economy The circular economy also enables economic growth without the need for more resources This is because each unit has a higher value as a result of recycling and reuse of products and materials after use Following this circular economics framework, the Polytechnic University of Madrid (Universidad Politcnica de Madrid, UPM) has adopted strategies aimed at improving the circularity of products In particular, this article provides the result of obtaining recycled PLA filament from waste originating from university 3D FFF (fused filament fabrication) printers and waste generated by Coronamakers in the production of visors and parts for PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment) during the lockdown period of COVID-19 in Spain This filament is used in the production of 3D printed parts that university students use in their classes, so the circular loop is closed The obtained score of Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) of this material has been calculated, indicating its high level of circularity","output":"Evaluation of the Circularity of Recycled PLA Filaments for 3D Printers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a unique global experience, arousing both exclusionary nationalistic and inclusionary responses of solidarity. This article aims to explore the discursive and linguistic means by which the COVID-19 pandemic, as a macro-event, has been translated into local micro-events. The analysis studies the global pandemic through the initial statements of 29 leading political actors across four continents. The aim is to examine discursive constructions of solidarity and nationalism through the social representation of inclusion/exclusion of in-, out-, and affiliated groups. The comparative analysis is based on the theoretical and methodological framework of the socio-cognitive approach to critical discourse analysis and is informed by argumentation theory and nationalism studies. The results of our analysis suggest that leaders have constructed the virus as the main outgroup through the metaphors of the pandemic-as-war and the pandemic-as-movement which have entered the national space. Faced with this threat, these speeches have discursively constructed the nation-as-a-team as the main in-group and prioritized (1) a vertical type of solidarity based on nationhood and according to governmental plans;(2) exclusionary solidarity against rule-breakers;(3) horizontal solidarity that is both intergenerational and among family members, and (4) transnational solidarity. It is not by chance that the world stands as a relevant affiliated group that needs to forcibly collaborate in order to face the main outgroup, the virus itself. A major consensus has been found in constructing the out-group. In contrast, the linguistic and discursive constructions of in-groups and their affiliates display a greater variation, depending upon the prevalent discursive practices and social context within different countries.","output":"Constructing collective identities and solidarity in premiers early speeches on COVID-19: a global perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest living bird, with a big production and economical potencial of meat, leather and feathers.

The Supporting Prescribing in Older Adults with Multimorbidity in Irish Primary Care (SPPiRE) trial aimed to investigate the effect of a general practitioner (GP)-delivered, individualised medication review in reducing polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) in community-dwelling older patients with multimorbidity in primary care. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) set in 51 GP practices throughout the Republic of Ireland. A total of 404 patients, aged 65 years with complex multimorbidity, defined as being prescribed 15 regular medicines, were recruited from April 2017 and followed up until October 2020. Furthermore, 26 intervention GP practices received access to the SPPiRE website where they completed an educational module and used a template for an individualised patient medication review that identified PIP, opportunities for deprescribing, and patient priorities for care. A total of 25 control GP practices delivered usual care. An independent blinded pharmacist assessed primary outcome measures that were the number of medicines and the proportion of patients with any PIP (from a predefined list of 34 indicators based predominantly on the STOPP/START version 2 criteria). We performed an intention-to-treat analysis using multilevel modelling. Recruited participants had substantial disease and treatment burden at baseline with a mean of 17.37 (standard deviation [SD] 3.50) medicines. At 6-month follow-up, both intervention and control groups had reductions in the numbers of medicines with a small but significantly greater reduction in the intervention group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.899 to 0.999, p = 0.045). There was no significant effect on the odds of having at least 1 PIP in the intervention versus control group (odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI: 0.140 to 1.064, p = 0.066). Adverse events recorded included mortality, emergency department (ED) presentations, and adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWEs), and there was no evidence of harm. Less than 2% of drug withdrawals in the intervention group led to a reported ADWE. Due to the inability to electronically extract data, primary outcomes were measured at just 2 time points, and this is the main limitation of this work. CONCLUSIONS: The SPPiRE intervention resulted in a small but significant reduction in the number of medicines but no evidence of a clear effect on PIP. This reduction in significant polypharmacy may have more of an impact at a population rather than individual patient level.

METHODS: A narrative review of the published research literature was undertaken, highlighting major empirical findings emerging during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Interactions among biological, behavioral, and societal processes were prominent across all regions of the globe during the first year of the COVID-19 emergency. Affective, cognitive, behavioral, socioeconomic, and technological factors all played a significant role in the spread of infection, response precautions, and outcomes of mitigation efforts. Affective symptoms, suicidality, and cognitive dysfunction have been widely described consequences of the infection, the economic fallout, and the necessary public health mitigation measures themselves. The impact of COVID-19 may be especially serious for those living with severe mental illness and/or chronic medical diseases, given the confluence of several adverse factors in a manner that appears to have syndemic potential.

Here, he reviews the published and unpublished data about lormetazepam dependence and proposes explanations for contradictory views from other authors. On this basis and in contrast to class labeling from regulatory bodies and WHO, the author comes to the conclusion that use of lormetazepam definitely carries a lower risk of inducing dependence and causing abuse than most other benzodiazepines. This applies as well to Sedalam?, the new i.v. application form of lormetazepam, which is much better tolerated than propofol. Because of its pharmacokinetic properties and because all its effects can be fully antagonized with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, this innovative intravenous application form of lormetazepam provides an excellent method for premedication, symptomatic treatment of excitation and anxiety in the context of surgical or diagnostic procedures including outpatient interventions and for basic sedation during anesthesia.","output":"Dependence liability of lormetazepam: are all benzodiazepines equal?

This association has been reported in several clinical series, mainly from China. There is a consistent trend towards a decreased number of hospital admissions of stroke patients during the pandemic. There are no population-based data available on incident stroke in individuals with COVID-19. SUMMARY: In this review, we report on increased rates and severe prognosis of ischemic stroke among individuals with COVID-19, probably explained by hypercoagulability and inflammation, documented since the early phase of disease.We confirm the presence of falling rates of new ischemic stroke admissions in hospitals, probably due to social consequences of the pandemic: fear to be infected or not adequately treated in the hospital.

Whether SARS-CoV-2 S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based vaccines could fill this gap has been debated, especially with regards to its suitability to protect against emerging viral variants of concern. Given a predominance for elicitation of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target RBD following natural infection or vaccination, a key biomarker of protection, there is merit for selection of RBD as a sole vaccine immunogen. With its high-yielding production and manufacturing potential, RBD-based vaccines offer an abundance of temperature-stable doses at an affordable cost.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main keywords based on network centrality, subgroups (clusters) of keyword networks by using a cohesion analysis method, and the main theme of child and adolescent cancer survivorCrelated research abstracts through topic modeling. This study also aims to label the subgroups by comparing the results of the cohesion and topic modeling. METHODS: A text network analysis method and topic modeling were used to explore the main trends in child and adolescent cancer survivor research by structuring a network of keyword (semantic morphemes) co-occurrence in the abstracts of articles published in 5 major web-based databases from 2016 to 2020. A total of 1677 child and adolescent cancer survivorCrelated studies were used for data analyses. Data selection, processing, and analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: The top 5 keywords in terms of degree and eigenvector centrality were risk, control interval, radiation, childhood cancer treatment, and diagnosis. Of the 1677 studies used for data analyses, cluster 1 included 780 (46.51%) documents under risk management, cluster 2 contained 557 (33.21%) articles under health-related QOL and supportive care, and cluster 3 consisted of 340 (20.27%) studies under cancer treatment and complications.

Based on this distinction, we sketch the common and unique social functions that different tactics are tailored to serve and describe information-processing mechanisms that potentially underlie decisions concerning how to intervene against offences. We propose that decision rules guiding direct and indirect tactics should weigh information about the benefits of changing others' behaviour versus the costs of potential retaliation. Based on a synthesis of existing evidence, we highlight the role of situational, relational and emotional factors in motivating distinct punishment tactics. We suggest that delineating between direct and indirect tactics can inform debates about the prevalence and functions of punishment and the reputational consequences of third-party intervention against offences.

Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structureCactivity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligandCreceptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds.

Anticipating a need for such therapies during the pandemic, our center created a targeted protocol for ECMO therapy in COVID-19 patients that allows us to provide this life-saving therapy to our sickest patients without overburdening already stretched resources or excessively exposing healthcare staff to infection risk. METHODS: As a major regional referral program, we used the framework of our well-established ECMO service-line to outline specific team structures, modified patient eligibility criteria, cannulation strategies, and management protocols for the COVID-19 ECMO program. RESULTS: During the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in Massachusetts, 6 patients were placed on VV ECMO for refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure. The median (interquartile range) age was 47 years (43-53) with most patients being male (83%) and obese (67%). All cannulations were performed at the bedside in the intensive care unit in patients who had undergone a trial of rescue therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome including lung protective ventilation, paralysis, prone positioning, and inhaled nitric oxide. At the time of this report, 83% (5/6) of the patients are still alive with 1 death on ECMO, attributed to hemorrhagic stroke. 67% of patients (4/6) have been successfully decannulated, including 2 that have been successfully extubated and one who was discharged from the hospital. The median duration of VV ECMO therapy for patients who have been decannulated is 12 days (4-18 days). CONCLUSIONS: This is 1 the first case series describing VV ECMO outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our initial data suggest that VV ECMO can be successfully utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with advanced respiratory failure.","output":"Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Respiratory Failure in COVID-19 Patients: Early Experience From a Major Academic Medical Center in North America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Genus Tricosporon consists of basidiomycetous yeast that form a part of the human microbiota.They cause an array of human diseases, both in imunocompetant and immunocompromised patients.

For example, for glucocorticoids (GC), which are used continuously in a majority of patients, there are no evidence-based recommendations for initiation, tapering, and cessation in the treatment of SLE. Even today, GC are without alternatives in acute situations, especially organ- or life-threatening ones. However, due to the known long-term adverse effects, the role of GC is viewed increasingly critically.

The baseline leukocyte count, neutrophil count and hemoglobin was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors, while the reverse was true of lymphocyte count, platelet, PaO2/FiO2, CD3+ count and CD4+ count. The percentage of neutrophil count > 6.3*109/L in death group was significantly higher than that in survival group, and multivariate logistic regression showed neutrophil count was independently associated with mortality.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Vizient Clinical Data Base and included hospital discharges from April 1 to July 31 2020 with ICD-10 codes for AIS and EVT. The primary outcome was in-hospital death and the secondary outcome was favorable discharge, defined as discharge home or to acute rehabilitation. We compared patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to those without. As a sensitivity analysis, we compared COVID-19 AIS patients who did not undergo EVT to those who did, to balance potential adverse events inherent to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We identified 3165 AIS patients who received EVT during April to July 2020, in which COVID-19 was confirmed in 104 (3.3%). Comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with younger age, male sex, diabetes, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, intubation, acute coronary syndrome, acute renal failure, and longer hospital and intensive care unit length of stay. The rate of in-hospital death was 12.4% without COVID-19 vs 29.8% with COVID-19 (P<0.001). In mixed-effects logistic regression that accounted for patient clustering by hospital, comorbid COVID-19 increased the odds of in-hospital death over four-fold (OR 4.48, 95% CI 3.02 to 6.165). Comorbid COVID-19 was also associated with lower odds of a favorable discharge (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.61). In the sensitivity analysis, comparing AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT (n=2139) to the AIS EVT patients with COVID-19, there was no difference in the rate of in-hospital death (30.6% vs 29.8%, P=0.868), and AIS EVT patients had a higher rate of favorable discharge (32.4% vs 47.1%, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: In AIS patients treated with EVT, comorbid COVID-19 infection was associated with in-hospital death and a lower odds of favorable discharge compared with patients without COVID-19, but not compared with AIS patients with COVID-19 who did not undergo EVT. AIS EVT patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, have systemic complications, and almost twice as likely to be black and over three times as likely to be Hispanic.","output":"Endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19: prevalence, demographics, and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The vaccination campaign against the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) started on 8 December 2020 in UK, after the approval of BNT162b2 by the Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) [...].","output":"Who Is Really at Risk for Anaphylaxis Due to COVID-19 Vaccine?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systems thinking approaches can benefit the occupational vocal health of vocally reliant workers.

Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely qualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further, publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a multi-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into analysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover, adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.","output":"The Vaccine Supply Chain: A Call for Resilience Analytics to Support COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 (SARS-Cov-2) is spreading around the globe in a highly contagious manner.

METHODS: : In this living systematic review and meta-analyses, we searched seven electronic databases for cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies on psychological problems on COVID-19 patients from Jan 1, 2020 to Oct 7, 2020. The primary outcome was prevalence of various psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, somatization, and fear. We pooled data for prevalence with their 95% confidence interval (CI) using random effect models and assessed the study quality based on the 11-item checklist recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. RESULTS: : Fourty-four studies, including studies from China(35), Italy(2), Iran(2), India(1), Korea(1), Ecuador(1), Switzerland(1), Germany(1), were identified by comprising a total of 8587 completed questionnaires and 38 studies for meta-analyses. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), insomnia, somatization, and fear in patients with COVID-19 was 16.6% (10.1%-23.1%), 37.7% (29.3%-46.2%), 41.5% (9.3%-73.7%), 68.3% (48.6%-88.0%), 36.5% (20.2%-52.8%), 47.6% (9.4%-85.7%), respectively.

Breech strike was reported at a higher rate than body strike in all survey years. Reported annual incidence of breech strike ranged from 2.2 to 4.7% of sheep nationally with minor differences between ewes and lambs. The incidence of body strike ranged from 1.0 to 7.1% with higher incidence in younger sheep in all years. The use of fixed time routine preventative chemical treatments increased during the survey period (43%, 46% and 66%, in 2003, 2011 and 2018 respectively) with dicyclanil (54%-58%) and cyromazine (23-36%) the main insecticides used for control since 2011. The use of the Mules operation (mulesing) to remove skin wrinkles from the breech area as a preventative modification did not change between 2011 and 2018 (47% in both), however, the use of pain relief at mulesing of replacement ewe lambs increased substantially between 2011 (59%) and 2018 (87%). The most commonly used methods to assist with flystrike control were timing of crutching (clipping of wool from susceptible areas) and shearing, with few respondents destroying maggots from treated sheep (21-26%) and very low use of fly traps (5-8%). Phenotypic selection of ewes for reduced susceptibility to flystrike based on visual traits was practiced by 61% of respondents in 2011 and 56% in 2018. Selection of rams for reduced susceptibility using estimated breeding values increased from 10% in 2011 to 17% in 2018. Breeding for resistance was the most commonly nominated (21%) most important change made to flystrike management in 2018.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2010 and September 2015, 16 patients (11 men and 5 women) underwent direct stenting of acute arterial occlusions. All patients had contraindication for surgical revascularization or catheter-directed thrombolysis. According to SVS/ISCVS Classification, six patients had IIa and ten patients IIb ALLI. The occlusions were located in CIA, EIA, SFA, or popliteal artery. Mean follow-up time with clinical examination and color Duplex ultrasonography was 37.6 months (range 1-72). We analyzed the technical and clinical outcomes of the procedures, as well the complications and patency rates. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in all patients (16/16) and there was significant clinical improvement in 15 patients. There was neither distal embolization nor procedure-related complications. During the 6 years of follow-up, four patients died due to non-procedure-related causes and there were two minor and one major amputations. The primary patency rates and the amputation-free survival rates were 93.7 and 87% at 1 year, 75.2 and 71.2% at 3 years, and 75.2 and 62.3%, respectively, at 6 years.

Based on an ethnographic analysis of the food itineraries of a group of people in a situation of precarity, this article examines their lived experiences under the pressure of having to meet daily food needs. The results show that gender differences are significant in terms of the strategies adopted, particularly in the forms of acquisition and preparation, places of consumption and support networks. Given that women are largely responsible for feeding the household, they are the ones most often managing the attendant difficulties. In situations where access to food depends on diverse and irregular sources, they engage in practices that both protect the family groups basic need to eat and sometimes compromise their own health, eating less than is usual and/or sufficient, skipping meals or even, on occasion, going hungry. The study concludes that providing food involves a crucial set of knowledge and skills for social reproduction that is not incorporated into existing emergency programs, with specific actions to avoid gender inequality likewise being omitted. The article proposes that both issues be discussed and taken into account in health and social policy. This study analyzes a subject that has scarcely been addressed in Spain. The challenge in investigating food insecurity from a gender approach is not only to make visible the crucial roles of women in food security and their contribution to it but also to show how the process of precarization manifests itself unequally across households.","output":"Food Itineraries in the Context of Crisis in Catalonia (Spain): Intersections between Precarization, Food Insecurity and Gender"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The existence of specific rabies virus (RV) glycoprotein (G) binding sites on the surfaces of neuroblastoma cells is demonstrated.

Attachment to mouse neuroblastoma NG108-15 cells is abolished by previous treatment of Gcvs-Sf2 cells with anti-G antibody. Substitutions for lysine at position 330 and for arginine at position 333 in RV G greatly reduce interaction between Gcvs-Sf21 cells and NG108-15 cells.

Flamand, and C. Tuffereau, J. Virol. 72:273-278, 1998) after intramuscular inoculation into a mouse. Furthermore, infection of NG108-15 cells by RV but not by vesicular stomatitis virus leads to a reduction of the number of binding sites at the neuronal-cell surface.

Although COVID-19 is mostly a respiratory disease, it can cause kidney and multiorgan failure in some cases. We believe that by sharing information about the course and effects of COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant recipients receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy our understanding will improve. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2020 and October 2021, COVID-19 was researched in kidney transplant recipients under the age of 20 years who were followed at the Baskent University Transplantation Center. We documented the clinical characteristics and prognosis of pediatric kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Our study group included 23 patients with COVID-19 infection from 215 pediatric kidney transplant recipients. The mean age of the patients was 14.6  4.7 years; there were 9 female patients. The mean follow-up time posttransplant was 62.3  43.2 months. In 13 patients (56.5%), fever was the most frequent symptom. Most patients (n = 18, 78%) had minor symptoms and recovered completely after receiving supportive treatment. Four patients (17%) required hospitalization. One was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 1 week after being treated with rituximab for acute antibody-mediated rejection. That patient died because of significant lung disease and multiorgan failure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that most of our pediatric transplant recipients had mild symptoms of COVID-19, we believe that particular caution should be observed in patients who have recently received intensive immunosuppressive medications. As a result of potential new vaccines, national immunization programs, and the emergence of novel virus strains, the clinical picture may change in the future.

The number of respiratory syncytial virus-A-positive cases was 6 (10.7%) in women and 14 (17.5%) in men. Two (3.5%) of the women were positive for parainfluenza-3, and 6 of the men were positive for influenza-B. The number of human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-positive women and men was 6 (10.7%) and 6 (7.5%), respectively. Rhinovirus caused 14.2% and 10% of the cases in men and women, respectively.

Essential workers have reported sleep disturbances since the COVID-19 pandemic onset, which may jeopardize their health and safety. The aims of this project were to assess sleep health among Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) workers, examine potential differences between worker types, and describe the self-perceived impact of COVID-19 on workers' workload and sleep. METHODS: Through an academic-practice partnership, this needs assessment used a cross-sectional design that collected self-report data during fall 2020 from CCRC workers. Guided by the Workplace Health Model, survey questions included work characteristics, sleep health, and COVID-19 impact on sleep and workload. FINDINGS: Ninety-four respondents completed the survey across multiple departments. Respondents (n = 34, 36.2%) reported sleeping below recommended hours on workdays. The majority scored above the population mean on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement (PROMIS) measures of sleep disturbance (n = 52, 55.3%), sleep-related impairment (n = 49, 52.1%), and fatigue (n = 49, 52.1%). Differences in workday total sleep time and fatigue were noted among shift workers versus nonshift workers, with shift workers reporting less sleep and more fatigue. Shorter sleep duration was noted among respondents working shifts 10 or more hours compared with those working 8 hours. Pandemic-related workload increase was reported by 22.3% (n = 21) of respondents, with 17% (n = 16) noting more than one type of workload change. Since COVID-19 onset, 36.2% (n = 34) reported no sleep changes and 35.1% (n = 33) reported sleeping less.

We aimed to compare projected COVID-19 mortality under four different strategies for the prioritisation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: We developed a coupled socialCepidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in which social and epidemiological dynamics interact with one another. We modelled how population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions responds to case incidence. In the model, schools and workplaces are also closed and reopened on the basis of reported cases. The model was parameterised with data on COVID-19 cases and mortality, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, population mobility, and demography from Ontario, Canada (population 145 million). Disease progression parameters came from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological literature. We assumed a vaccine with 75% efficacy against disease and transmissibility. We compared vaccinating those aged 60 years and older first (oldest-first strategy), vaccinating those younger than 20 years first (youngest-first strategy), vaccinating uniformly by age (uniform strategy), and a novel contact-based strategy. The latter three strategies interrupt transmission, whereas the first targets a vulnerable group to reduce disease. Vaccination rates ranged from 05% to 5% of the population per week, beginning on either Jan 1 or Sept 1, 2021. FINDINGS: Case notifications, non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence, and lockdown undergo successive waves that interact with the timing of the vaccine programme to determine the relative effectiveness of the four strategies. Transmission-interrupting strategies become relatively more effective with time as herd immunity builds. The model predicts that, in the absence of vaccination, 72 000 deaths (95% credible interval 40 000C122 000) would occur in Ontario from Jan 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, and at a vaccination rate of 15% of the population per week, the oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 908% on average (followed by 895% in the uniform, 889% in the contact-based, and 882% in the youngest-first strategies). 60 000 deaths (31 000C108 000) would occur from Sept 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, in the absence of vaccination, and the contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 926% on average (followed by 921% in the uniform, 910% in the oldest-first, and 883% in the youngest-first strategies) at a vaccination rate of 15% of the population per week. INTERPRETATION: The most effective vaccination strategy for reducing mortality due to COVID-19 depends on the time course of the pandemic in the population. For later vaccination start dates, use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission might prevent more deaths than prioritising vulnerable age groups.

In spite of United States Food and Drug Administration's recent assent of remdesivir as the only approved agent for COVID-19, there is limited information available about the physicochemical, metabolism, transport, pharmacokinetic (PK), and drug-drug interaction (DDI) properties of this drug. The objective of this in silico simulation work was to simulate the biopharmaceutical and DDI behavior of remdesivir and characterize remdesivir PK properties in special populations which are highly affected by COVID-19. METHODS: The Spatial Data File format structures of remdesivir prodrug (GS-5734) and nucleoside core (GS-441524) were obtained from the PubChem database to upload into the GastroPlus software 9.8 version (Simulations Plus Inc., USA). The Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) Predictor and PKPlus modules of GastroPlus were used to simulate physicochemical and PK properties, respectively, in healthy and predisposed patients. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling of GastroPlus was used to simulate different patient populations based on age, weight, liver function, and renal function status. Subsequently, these data were used in the Drug-Drug Interaction module to simulate drug interaction potential of remdesivir with other COVID-19 drug regimens and with agents used for comorbidities. RESULTS: Remdesivir nucleoside core (GS-441524) is more hydrophilic than the inactive prodrug (GS-5734) with nucleoside core demonstrating better water solubility. GS-5734, but not GS-441524, is predicted to be metabolized by CYP3A4. Remdesivir is bioavailable and its clearance is achieved through hepatic and renal routes. Differential effects of renal function, liver function, weight, or age were observed on the PK profile of remdesivir. DDI simulation study of remdesivir with perpetrator drugs for comorbidities indicate that carbamazepine, phenytoin, amiodarone, voriconazole, diltiazem, and verapamil have the potential for strong interactions with victim remdesivir, whereas agents used for COVID-19 treatment such as chloroquine and ritonavir can cause weak and strong interactions, respectively, with remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: GS-5734 (inactive prodrug) appears to be a superior remdesivir derivative due to its hepatic stability, optimum hydrophilic/lipophilic balance, and disposition properties. Remdesivir disposition can potentially be affected by different physiological and pathological conditions, and by drug interactions from COVID-19 drug regimens and agents used for comorbidities.","output":"Simulation of Remdesivir Pharmacokinetics and Its Drug Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The relation between urbanization and pandemics is not new.

Purpose To prospectively assess pulmonary sequelae and explore the risk factors for lung fibrotic-like changes on six-month follow-up chest CT of survivors of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods 114 patients (80[70%] men; mean age, 5412 years) were studied prospectively. Initial and follow-up CT scans were obtained on 1711 days and 17520 days respectively after symptom onset. Lung changes (opacification, consolidation, reticulation, and fibrotic-like changes) and CT extent scores (score per lobe, 0-5; maximum score, 25) were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups: group#1 presence and group#2 absence of CT evidence of fibrotic-like changes (traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, and/or honeycombing) based on their six-month follow-up CT. Between-group differences were assessed by Fisher's exact test, two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like changes. Results On follow-up CT, evidence of fibrotic-like changes was observed in 40/114 (35%) of patients (group#1), while the remaining 74/114 (65%) patients (group#2) showed either complete radiological resolution (43/114, 38%) or residual ground-glass opacification or interstitial thickening (31/114, 27%).

Surprisingly, however, KKxx and KxKxx motifs bind differently, with their lysine residues transposed at the binding patches. We derive rules for retrieval motif recognition from key structural features: the reversed binding modes, the recognition of the C-terminal carboxylate group which enforces lysine positional context, and the tolerance of the acidic patches for non-lysine residues.","output":"Rules for the recognition of dilysine retrieval motifs by coatomer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) are an evolving trend in the medical field. The acceptance of digital tools is high, and the need is growing. OBJECTIVE: Young adults (18-40 years) confronted with a cancer diagnosis present unique needs and require special care. They often have a strong affinity and are familiar with modern technology. On that account, we implemented a web-based symptom and quality of life (QoL) assessment to address patients' attitudes and willingness to use mHealth tools. The study also aims to evaluate sociodemographic parameters that could influence patients' opinions. METHODS: A total of 380 young patients aged 18-40 treated with radiotherapy between 2002 and 2017 were included in the trial. We assessed QoL via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core 30 (EORTC C30) questionnaire and added general questions about mHealth technology. The added questions inquired patients' opinions regarding general aspects, including technical advances in medicine, mobile and app assistance during cancer treatment, data transfer, and app-specific features. The survey was conducted for 12 months. Participation was voluntary and pseudonymized; prior written consent was obtained. RESULTS: We achieved a participation rate of 57.6% (219/380) and a completion rate of 50.2% (110/219). The median age was 33 years (range 18-40). Of all participants, 89.1% (98/110) considered new technologies in medicine as positive; 10.9% (12/110) answered with neutral. Nearly all patients (96.4%, 106/110) stated that they would send further data via a web-based platform. Of all, 96.4% (106/110) considered the provided pseudonymization of their data as safe. We further asked the patients if they would use a mobile app for symptom and QoL assessment similar to the present web-based system: 74.5% (82/110) answered with yes and 25.5% (28/110) said they would not use a mobile app in the future. We tested the willingness to use an app on several sociodemographic parameters, such as age, gender, education, health insurance status, and cancer-related parameters: tumor stage, time since radiation treatment, and treatment intention. None of these parameters correlated with app use in this group of young adults. Patients who were generally positive regarding using an app rated several possible functions of a future app. The 3 most requested features were appointment reminders (89.0%, 73/82), contact overview of all involved clinics and physicians (87%, 71/82), and making an appointment via app (78%, 64/82). CONCLUSIONS: eHealth and mHealth tools should be available as an integrated part of a comprehensive cancer care approach. It provides automated, thorough documentation of health parameters during therapy and follow-up for doctors, medical staff, and tumor patients to optimize treatment. With this study, we could show that young adults are the ideal patient population to use eHealth/mHealth tools. Such tools offer further digital support and improve the patients' need for constant QoL during cancer care.","output":"Web-Based Patient Self-Reported Outcome After Radiotherapy in Adolescents and Young Adults With Cancer: Survey on Acceptance of Digital Tools"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid\\\\19 has forced academic institutions around the world to shift toward the digital platform for teaching.

According to the quality indicators recommended by Sociedad Espa?ola de Medicina Intensiva Crtica y Unidades Coronarias, and due to the importance of prone position (PP) as a treatment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is fundamental to keep accurate record of serious adverse events occurring during the prone position procedure and its posterior analysis. Objectives To establish fulfilment of the Sociedad Espa?ola de Medicina Intensiva Crtica y Unidades Coronarias standards of quality according to the register of serious complications. To identify the incidence of serious complications registered as well as to identify possible factors related to these complications. Method Retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study, polyvalent ICU (16 beds). Study population Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with PP (January 2012CDecember 2013). Study variables PP recording, accidental extubation, removal of catheters, decubitus ulcers (DU), ETT obstruction, urgency of the procedure, hours in PP, nutritional intake, type of feeding tube, food regurgitation/retention and use of prokinetics/muscle relaxant. Results The study sample comprised 38 cases, with an adequate record of complications in 92.1% of the cases. DU were the only serious complication recorded, with a 25.7% incidence. Possible factors related to DU: more hours in PP in patients developing DU (p =0.067). Less incidence of DU in well-nourished patients (p =0.577). 82.9% of patients were not appropriately nourished. Conclusions The percentage of records duly completed is very high. The presence of DU (grade 1C2 mostly) is to be noted.

METHODS: Five hospitals in Xi'an province have been selected as research centers. Full-term infants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited from these centers between January 1 and February 28, 2019. The feeding situation at 10 days, 42 days, 3 months, and 6 months after birth were investigated. A self-designed breastfeeding questionnaire was used for investigation and follow-up. SPSS 22.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the data. RESULTS: The exclusive breastfeeding rate of full-term infants on days 10 and 42 and at months three and six after birth was 61.38%, 54.78%, 48.83%, and 38.78%, respectively, with a decreasing trend over time. During breastfeeding within 48 h after delivery, 1,653 cases (91.83%) of puerpera had different grades of pain, including 1,325 cases (80.16%) of mild discomfort, 321 cases (19.42%) of moderate pain, and seven cases (0.42%) of severe pain. Within 24C48 h postpartum, 1,607 (89.27%) mothers faced problems related to postpartum breastfeeding. Among them, 694 (43,19%) neonates could not be fed effectively; 665 (41.38%) mothers had wound pain and had inconvenience to turn over; 598 (37.21%) neonates were difficult to wake up; 439 (27.32%) mothers had incorrect feeding posture; 181 (11.26%) mothers experienced other problems. The Cox risk regression model showed that weight gain during pregnancy was higher than the recommended standard. Living in suburban counties was a risk factor of exclusive breastfeeding for full-term infants. Participation in breastfeeding courses during pregnancy, feeding more than eight times daily after delivery, were the protective factors of exclusive breastfeeding for full-term infants. CONCLUSION: The body weight gain of parturients should be controlled within a reasonable range during pregnancy. Parturients were encouraged by medical staff to participate in breastfeeding courses or watch the breastfeeding process during pregnancy to increase their self-confidence and improve the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for full-term infants. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the publicity of breastfeeding in suburban areas to promote breastfeeding.","output":"The Influencing Factors of Breastfeeding for Full-Term Singleton Within Six Months of Birth in Xi'an Before the Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has become clear that COVID-19 can lead to neuropsychiatric complications.

In July 2020, the first prison system case of COVID-19 was notified in Zimbabwe. Subsequently, the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services released their COVID-19 operational plan. The purpose of the study was to assess preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in selected prisons in Zimbabwe. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A multi-method situation assessment of COVID-19 preparedness was conducted across three Zimbabwean prisons. The World Health Organization checklist to evaluate preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in prisons was administered to frontline health managers. Information garnered was further explored during site observation and in multi-stakeholder key informant interviews with policymakers, prison health directorate, frontline health-care professionals, officers in charge and non-governmental organizations (n = 26); focus group discussions with correctional officers (n = 18); and male/female prisoners (n = 36). Data was triangulated and analyzed using content thematic analysis. FINDINGS Outdated infrastructure, severe congestion, interrupted water supply and inadequate hygiene and sanitation were conducive to ill-health and spread of disease. Health professionals had been well-trained regarding COVID-19 disease control measures. COVID-19 awareness among prisoners was generally adequate. There was no routine COVID-19 testing in place, beyond thermo scanning. Access to health care was good, but standards were hindered by inadequate medicines and personnel protective equipment supply. Isolation measures were compromised by accommodation capacity issues. Flow of prison entries constituted a transmission risk. Social distancing was impossible during meals and at night.

The importance of water as a parameter affecting virion stability and inactivation has been recognized across disciplinary areas. The large number of virus species, differences in spreading, likelihood of foodborne infections, unknown infective doses, and difficulties of infective virus quantification are often limiting experimental approaches to establish accurate data required for detailed understanding of virions stability and inactivation kinetics in various foods. Furthermore, non-foodborne viruses, as shown by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic, may spread within the food chain. Traditional food engineering benefits from kinetic data on effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on virion inactivation. The stability of enteric viruses, human norovirus (HuNoV), and hepatitis A (HAV) virions in food materials and their resistance against inactivation in traditional food processing and preservation is well recognized. It appears that temperature-dependence of virus inactivation is less affected by virus strains than differences in temperature and RH sensitivity of individual virus species. Pathogenic viruses are stable at low temperatures typical of food storage conditions. A significant change in activation energy above typical protein denaturation temperatures suggests a rapid inactivation of virions. Furthermore, virus inactivation mechanisms seem to vary according to temperature. Although little is known on the effects of water on virions resistance during food processing and storage, dehydration, low RH conditions, and freezing stabilize virions. Enveloped virions tend to have a high stability at low RH, but low temperature and high RH may also stabilize such virions on metal and other surfaces for several days. Food engineering has contributed to significant developments in stabilization of nutrients, flavors, and sensitive components in food materials which provides a knowledge base for development of technologies to inactivate virions in foods and environment. Novel food processing, particularly high pressure processing (HPP) and cold plasma technologies, seem to provide efficient means for virion inactivation and food quality retention prior to packaging or food preservation by traditional technologies.","output":"Water and Pathogenic Viruses InactivationFood Engineering Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionCholangioscopy with electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) is an evolving service to treat choledocholithiasis refractory to standard ERCP and is included in the BSG guidelines. We aimed to assess the safety, efficacy and implications of a new tertiary Spyglass EHL service for treatment of refractory gallstone disease.MethodsA review of prospectively collected data was performed for all EHL Spyglass procedures performed from 01.12.2018 to 31.12.2019 at St Thomas Hospital. Procedural duration was determined by the time between first and last fluoroscopic image taken. Stone burden was assessed by examination of fluoroscopic images. ERCP Spyglass DS1 and Autolith Touch II EHL Generator was used for all procedures.Results57 Spyglass EHL procedures were performed between January 2018 and December 2019 on 40 patients (75% females, 25% males with a mean age of 65). All cases had failed stone clearance at standard ERCP prior to this. Mean diameter of the largest stone was 1.83cm with a range of 1-3.5cm. All stones were < 2cm in patients who achieved ductal clearance in 1 procedure.Out of 40 patients, 9 were excluded as they were awaiting further EHL for duct clearance. 31/31 (100%) achieved ductal clearance at the last procedure. Ductal clearance was achieved with 1 EHL session in 11/31(35.5%), 2 EHL sessions in 11/31(35.5%), 3 EHL sessions in 7/31(23%) and 4 sessions in 2/31(6%). There was no correlation between number of stones and number or duration of EHL sessions.The average number of shocks used in one EHL was 1600 shocks. Average time spent on one EHL was 78 minutes. In 2018, 37.1 hours were used for Spyglass EHL in total (this does not include diagnostic Spyglass procedures).Documented complications occurred in 2/57(3.5%) procedures;1 peri-pancreatic abscess with necrotic nodes and 1 lingual haematoma secondary to intubation. There were no reported cases of pancreatitis or 30 day mortality.ConclusionsCholangioscopy with EHL is an effective treatment for refractory choledocolithiasis, achieving 100% ductal clearance, with a low rate of complications.

Our feasibility trial showed that Calmer worked 50% better than no treatment and no differently from our standard of care, facilitated tucking (FT), for reducing pain scores during a heel lance in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. OBJECTIVE: We compared the effects of Calmer on regional cerebral hemodynamic activity during a noxious stimulation to FT. METHODS: During a clinically required heel lance, we measured frontal cortex tissue oxygenation in a subsample of 29 preterm infants (27C33 weeks gestational age) from our larger randomized controlled trial. Infants were randomized to either FT (n = 16) or Calmer treatment (n = 12). The outcome measure, obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy, was a change in the tissue oxygenation index (TSI) across study phases (Baseline, Heel Lance, Recovery; median duration 517 seconds [421C906 seconds]). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between groups in the median TSI during any of the study phases. In response to the heel lance, 7 infants (27.6%) had a TSI that dipped below the 60% threshold (3 in the Calmer group 25% and 4 in the FT group 25%); none below 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Infants on Calmer maintained normal regional cerebral oxygen levels (55%C85%) no differently from infants receiving a human touch intervention during blood collection. Parental skin-to-skin holding is one of the most effective strategies to relieve procedural pain in preterm infants.

METHODS: The study was conducted on samples received from various collection centres in different districts of Odisha as well as from patients attending the screening clinic or admitted in COVID ward of the hospital. Nasal/nasopharyngeal/throat swabs received in viral transport media in cold chain were subjected to RT-PCR testing in a Biosafety Laboratory level-2 by including uniform volume of 4 units (samples) per pool. All confirmed and probable positive pools in screening assay were de-convoluted and individual samples tested for confirmatory assay. RESULT: Inclusion of an additional criteria of probable positive pool (Ct value >35 with non-sigmoid amplification curve or showing a line of amplification towards the end of the cycle) yielded 39 (15.5%) more true positive samples out of a total of 251 positive samples that would otherwise have been missed if only the classical criteria of positive (Ct within 35 with proper sigmoid curve) had been considered.

METHODS: This research answers two questions: What are the characteristics of successful MIHTs? Why are those characteristics important to MIHT success in large-scale emergency situations? Using a Grounded Theory approach, 30 interviews were conducted soliciting perspectives from the broadest range of healthcare professionals who had experiences working in and leading MIHTs. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants broadly across: contexts where MIHTs work; military branches; ranks; genders; and healthcare professions.

A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21). The false-positive results and the observed cross-reactivity between MERS-CoV and other circulating human coronavirus necessitate more detailed evaluation of available serological assays.","output":"Comparative Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Medical and dental students are the future of health workforce and a potential volunteer pool in the COVID-19 crises.

Given the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic many changes were rapidly adopted and were not substantiated by robust evidence. This study aimed to describe the changes adopted internationally to chemotherapy services, which may be used to guide future changes to treatment delivery. METHODS: A survey was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT). It comprised 22 questions and examined the strategies implemented during the pandemic to prioritise and protect patients receiving SACT and the participants' professional opinion of the strategies employed. The survey was available in English, Spanish and French and was distributed via professional bodies. RESULTS: 129 responses were obtained from healthcare professionals working across 17 different countries. 45% of institutions had to implement treatment prioritisation strategies and all hospitals implemented changes in the delivery of treatment, including: reduction in treatments (69%), using less immunosuppressive agents (50%), allowing treatment breaks (14%) and switching to oral therapies (45%). Virtual clinic visits were perceived by participants as the most effective strategy to protect patients. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has forced chemotherapy healthcare professionals to adopt new ways of working by reducing health interactions. Many areas of research are needed following this period, including understanding patients' perceptions of risks to treatment, utilisation of oral treatments and the impact of treatment breaks on cancer outcomes.","output":"Global changes to the chemotherapy service during the covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fast testing can help mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

To achieve that, in the present study, we propose the optimized ventilation mechanism and design for the fastest removal of pathogen-laden aerosol using numerical simulations. We quantitatively evaluated the aerosol removal performance of various ventilation configurations (combinations of air exhaust and supply ducts), and found that the key mechanism is to form the coherent (preferentially upward) airflow structure to surround the respiratory flow containing the aerosol cluster.

The disease affects healthy young adults and commonly has a benign course, however, if complications such as macular edema or ischemia appears, treatment should be instituted immediately to avoid poor prognosis. CASE REPORT: A 40-year old white male patient consulted for a slight decrease in the sensitivity of the visual field in his left eye (OS). Visual acuities (VA) were 20/20 in both eyes. OS fundus examination showed dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, disc edema, and retinal hemorrhages. The patient was diagnosed with papillophlebitis. OS VA decreased to 20/200 due to macular edema, and he was treated with a intravitreal dexamethasone implant. An exhaustive and interdisciplinary exploration process was performed, identifying a recent disease and recovery of Covid-19 as the only factor of inflammation and coagulation alteration. Other systemic diseases were excluded. We also describe a rapid decrease in disc and macular edema after intravitreal dexametasone injection, which could support the inflammatory hypothesis. CONCLUSION: The importance of this case lies in the possible association of papillophlebitis with the new Covid-19 disease. We believe that the inflammatory reaction and the coagulation alteration present in our patient due to Sars-Cov2 coronavirus may have acted as risk factors for the development of papillophlebitis.","output":"Papillophlebitis in a COVID-19 patient: Inflammation and hypercoagulable state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spectrum of disease produced by Aspergillus species ranges from allergic syndromes to chronic pulmonary conditions and invasive infections.

This study examines the use of retracted publications in the field of pharmacy, describes characteristics of retracted publications cited by systematic reviews, and discusses factors associated with citation likelihood. METHODS: Using data from Retraction Watch, we identified retracted publications in the pharmacy field. We identified all articles citing these retracted publications in Web of Science and Scopus and limited results to systematic reviews. We classified the retraction reason, determined whether the citation occurred before or after retraction, and analyzed factors associated with the likelihood of systematic reviews citing a retracted publication. RESULTS: Of 1,396 retracted publications, 283 were cited 1,096 times in systematic reviews. Most (65.0%) (712/1096) citations occurred before retraction. Citations were most often to items retracted due to data falsification or manipulation (39.2%), followed by items retracted due to ethical misconduct including plagiarism (30.4%), or concerns about or errors in data or methods (26.2%). Compared to those not cited in systematic reviews, cited items were significantly more likely to be retracted due to data falsification and manipulation, were published in high impact factor journals, and had longer delays between publication and retraction.

The etiological agent of this disease has been identified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing has been scarce, leading to a highly selective criteria to administer the test. These factors have led to a standard of care mandating a rule out process of other infectious etiologies prior to testing for COVID-19. This highlighted the unpreparedness of the global healthcare infrastructure. We present a case of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A virus, and Haemophilus Influenza bacteremia infections. CASE PRESENTATION: 88 year old female with medical history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, COPD, VTE, presented to the hospital with fever and dyspnea for one week. Patient had been compliant with social distancing. Initial workup revealed a positive Influenza A and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. Inflammatory markers were elevated, including Ferritin, C-reactive protein, Interleukin-6, Lactate Dehydrogenase and D-dimer. Due to continued hypoxia, patient was intubated. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR was found to be positive. Blood cultures were also positive for Haemophilus Influenza. A course of Oseltamivir, Hydroxychloroquine and Ceftriaxone was completed. She responded well to therapy and was ultimately extubated on day nine. Patient was discharged making a full recovery. DISCUSSION: We highlight a case of SARS-CoV-2 with not only influenza A co-infection, but a Haemophilus influenza bacteremia of presumed respiratory source. Literature confirms that the most common superimposed bacterial infections related to Influenza A are bacterial pneumonias secondary to S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae;and co-infection with Influenza A tends to be the most deadly. Rates of severe infection and mortality are highest in those aged greater than 65 and with co-morbidities. As SARS-CoV-2 is still a novel coronavirus being studied, there is limited literature regarding co-infection, however there are several case reports of influenza A coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. A positive influenza screen does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 result does not preclude the development of bacterial superinfection. There is certainly a benefit in continued management of both influenza and potential coverage for bacterial causes until appropriate testing is obtained. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the probable underdiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 given the under-reported rate of co-infections with other respiratory viruses. We recommend that clinicians take into consideration the likelihood of co-infection of pathogens along with SARS-CoV-2, both viral and bacterial. We also recommend higher volume testing for SARS-CoV-2, especially during this pandemic, as it will be crucial for not only controlling the spread, but improving clinical management.

Additional significant influences have recently been demonstrated in the literature. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) used for GDM diagnosis has sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity, thus often results in GDM misdiagnoses. Comprehensive screening of risk factors may allow more targeted monitoring and more accurate diagnoses, preventing the devastating consequences of untreated or misdiagnosed GDM. We aimed to develop a comprehensive online questionnaire of GDM risk factors and triangulate it with the OGTT and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) parameters to better evaluate GDM risk and diagnosis. METHODS: Pregnant women participating in two studies on the use of CGM for GDM were invited to complete the online questionnaire. A risk score, based on published literature, was calculated for each participant response and compared with the OGTT result. A total risk score (TRS) was then calculated as a normalised sum of all risk factors. Triangulation of OGTT, TRS and CGM score of variability (CGMSV) was analysed to expand evaluation of OGTT results. RESULTS: Fifty one women completed the questionnaire; 29 were identified as high-risk for GDM. High-risk ethnic background (p < 0.01), advanced age, a family diabetic history (p < 0.05) were associated with a positive OGTT result. The triangulation analysis (n = 45) revealed six (13%) probable misdiagnoses (both TRS and CGMSV discordant with OGTT), consisting of one probable false positive and five probable false negative by OGTT results. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified pregnant women at high risk of developing GDM based on an extended evaluation of risk factors. Triangulation of TRS, OGTT and CGMSV suggested potential misdiagnoses of the OGTT. Future studies to explore the correlation between TRS, CGMSV and pregnancy outcomes as well as additional GDM pregnancy biomarkers and outcomes to efficiently evaluate OGTT results are needed.

Next generation cDNA sequencing methods have laid the foundation of our current understanding of the antibody repertoire, but these methods share one major limitation in that they target the antibody-producing B-cells, rather than the functional secreted product in bodily fluids. Mass spectrometry-based methods offer an opportunity to bridge this gap between antibody repertoire profiling and bulk serological assays, as they can access antibody sequence information straight from the secreted polypeptide products.

We compared the number of presentations in 2020 during the national state of emergency, i.e. from March 16 to June 11, with numbers from 2018 and 2019. Presentations were stratified using localized New York University Emergency Department Algorithm (NYU-EDA) to evaluate changes in presentations with different acuity levels. RESULTS: A total of 27,526 presentations were observed. Compared to previous two years, total daily presentations were reduced by 23% (from 113 to 87, p < .001). In NYU-EDA classes, Non-Emergent visits were reduced the most by 42% (from 18 to 10, p < .001). Emergent presentations were reduced by 19 to 28% depending on the subgroup (p < .001).

Music-based interventions, when personalized and added to daily caregiving routines, have been shown to reduce occurrences or severity of these undesirable symptoms. In this study, family caregivers learned to implement music interventions to mitigate the impact of challenging behaviors. METHOD: We present the results of interim analyses of the results for the first group of participants in a study of a psychoeducational, music-based intervention for family caregivers. Eighteen NYC-based family caregivers participated in a 6-week program either in person (pre-COVID) or online with a music therapist. Following each weekly one-hour workshop, caregivers were asked to utilize music interventions such as singing during care, listening to personalized playlists on Spotify, or facilitating music and movement with their care recipient. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire was used to measure twelve neuropsychiatric domains and measure caregiver distress before and after the 6-week intervention. Paired sample t-tests were used to measure change in these outcomes for caregiver and care recipient. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used to estimate the relationship between symptoms of dementia and caregiver distress. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in both neuropsychiatric domains in care recipients from before (M= 12.23  6.26) the six-week program to after (7.83  3.51), p =.028, and in caregiver distress prior (M=14.88  9.36) to after (8.68  5.95), p =.03. The symptoms most reported to contribute to caregiver distress were irritability (n=12), night-time behaviors (n=12), and agitation (n=11). Neuropsychiatric symptoms and caregiver distress were found to be strongly correlated, r (16) =.64, p=.004. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results of this ongoing study indicate that caregivers who implement music-based interventions can both reduce undesirable symptoms of dementia and thereby their own distress. ? 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.","output":"The use of music at home reduces symptoms of dementia and caregiver distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drug discovery and development is a lengthy and expensive process.

As the United Kingdom (UK) leaves the European Union, an understanding of the migration trends and possible influences are important to inform future planning. AIM: To examine trends in the profile of UK registered dentists in the context of key events and policy changes from 2000 to 2020. METHOD: Data were obtained from the General Dental Council via annual reports, and under 'freedom of information' communications; details of policy initiatives were obtained from the government and professional websites. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period (2000-2019), the number of registered dentists increased from 31,325 to 42,469, a net increase of 36% (11,144 dentists), the majority of whom were international graduates (58%; n = 6,416) such that by December 2019, 28% of all registered dentists had qualified outside of the UK. Similarly, regarding new registrants, there were increases of graduates from UK (18%), EEA countries (214%) and, via the Overseas Registration Examination route (621%); and a decrease from countries with bilateral agreements for recognition (43%), in line with changes in health and immigration policies. CONCLUSIONS: International dental graduates increasingly contribute to the UK dental workforce and there is an urgent need for research into dentist migration and retention in the UK in support of patient access to dental care. IMPACT: The United Kingdom (UK) dental workforce is increasingly reliant on international dental graduates representing 28% of current registrants compared with 18% in 2000. Health policies and immigration policies were the main drivers that influenced dental workforce migration to the UK along with wider events, such as EU expansions, global recession and Brexit.

For example, they are often called upon to support civilian authorities in humanitarian crises and to provide routine healthcare for civilians. Furthermore, military personnel are a unique population in a health security context, as they are highly mobile and often deploy to austere settings domestically and internationally, which may increase exposure to infectious diseases. Despite the role of militaries, few studies have systematically evaluated the involvement of militaries in global health security activities, including the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). To address this shortcoming, we analyzed Joint External Evaluation (JEE) mission reports (n=91) and National Action Plans for Health Security (n=11) that had been completed as of October 2019 (n=91) to determine the extent to which military organizations have been involved in the evaluation process, country military contributions to health security are accounted for, and specific recommendations are provided for the country's military. For JEE reports, military involvement was highest for the \\"Respond\\" core area (73%) but much lower for the Prevent (36%) and Detect (30%) core areas. Similarly, 73% of NAPHS documents mentioned military involvement in the Respond core area, compared to 27% and 36% for Prevent and Detect, respectively. Additionally, only 26% of JEE reports provide recommendations for the military in any of the core areas. Our results indicate the need to more fully incorporate military roles and contributions into the GHSA framework and other health security activities in order to improve national capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats.","output":"Military participation in health security: analysis of Joint External Evaluation mission reports and National Action Plans for Health Security"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is a protease necessary for viral polyprotein processing and maturation.

Human genetic factors, including polymorphisms, serve pivotal roles in the high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the stubbornly progressing sickness seen in a small but significant percentage of infected people; however, but these factors remain ill-defined. A total of 288 COVID-19 patients and 288 controls were genotyped for TMPRSS2 polymorphisms using both restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR techniques. Different genotypes of TMPRSS2 polymorphisms were compared in terms of disease susceptibility and mortality. The statistical analysis showed that minor alleles of all studied variants statistically increased the risk of COVID-19, except for the rs75603675 C > A variant. The T allele of rs12329760 conferred an increased risk of COVID-19. Moreover, the AG/AC/TT/AG combination of genotypes significantly enhanced the risk of COVID-19 in our population. Different haplotypes of rs17854725/rs75603675/rs12329760/rs4303795 polymorphisms, including GACA, GACG, GATG, GATA, AATA, ACCG, ACTG, ACTA, GCCA, and GCTG, were found to be associated with increased risk of the disease (odds ratio > 1). Regarding the clinical and paraclinical characteristics, a statistically significant difference was found between non-severe and severe forms except for gender, platelet, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and underlying diseases. In addition, case genotypes of TMPRSS2 rs17854725 A > G, rs12329760 C > T, and rs4303795 A > G were significantly different regarding severe and non-severe forms of the disease (P-value < 0.001). Specifically, death was more frequent in carriers of the AG genotype of rs17854725 A > G (P-value = 0.022). Patients who carry the minor alleles of the four studied TMPRSS2 variants were rather vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.

Although scholars suggest that such policies may produce negative effects on public emotions, the existing research is limited because it only provides a cross-sectional snapshot of the effect of lockdown policies in small and local samples. Using large-scale longitudinal cross-country data, the current study aims to gain a better understanding of the dynamic effect of lockdown policies on public emotions and their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Drawing on a large-scale longitudinal data from multiple sources, the study employs fixed-effects models to analyze the association between lagged lockdown policy stringency and public negative emotions among 120 countries from February to July 2020 (N = 9,141 country-day observations). The bootstrapping mediation test is used to examine the mediation effects of increased population mobility in residential areas. RESULTS: The results show a statistically significant and positive association between lagged lockdown policy stringency and general public negative emotion (standardized coefficient = 0.32, CI = 0.30C0.35, p < 0.001). This pattern remains similar to other specific negative emotions, such as depression, anxiety, hopelessness, and helplessness. Moreover, the negative health effects of lockdown policy stringency are significantly mediated by increased mobility in residential areas (51C74% points, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings confirm that stringent lockdown policies have a negative effect on public emotions via confining population mobility residential areas. To tackle the COVID-19, future public health policies should pay more attention to the unintended negative consequences of lockdown measures on public emotions.","output":"Exploring the Longitudinal Relationship Between Lockdown Policy Stringency and Public Negative Emotions Among 120 Countries During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediating Role of Population Mobility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of fetal growth restriction and gender on cerebral oxygenation in preterm neonates during the first 3 days of life.

We examined hospitalization prior to death as a function of 4 factors: community (defined as all non-nursing home residents) vs. nursing home residence, age in years (<70, 70-79, 80-89, [a?]90), gender, and month of death (1st wave: March-April [peak], May, June-July 2020 [nadir], 2nd wave: August-October 2020). Results - A total of 3,114 people with confirmed COVID-19 died in Ontario from March to October, 2020 (Table 1), of whom 1,354 (43.5%) were hospitalized prior to death (median: 9 days before death, interquartile range: 4-19). Among nursing home decedents (N=2000), 22.4% were admitted to hospital prior to death, but this varied substantially from a low of 15.5% in March-April (peak of wave 1) to a high of 41.2% in June-July (nadir of wave 1). Among community-dwelling decedents (N=1,114), admission to acute care was higher (81.4%) and remained relatively stable throughout the first and second waves. Similar temporal trends for nursing home versus community decedents were apparent in age-stratified analyses (Figure 1). Women who died were less likely to have been hospitalized compared to men in both community (80% women vs 84% men) and nursing home (21% women vs 24% men) settings. Discussion - Only a minority of Ontario nursing home residents who died of COVID-19 were hospitalized prior to death, and that there were substantial temporal variations, with hospitalizations reaching their lowest point when overall COVID-19 incidence peaked in mid-April, 2020. While many nursing home residents had pre-pandemic advance directives precluding hospitalization, the low admission rate observed in March-April 2020 (15.5%) was inconsistent with both higher admission rates in subsequent months (>30%), and comparatively stable rates among community-dwelling adults. Our findings substantiate reports suggesting that hospitalizations for nursing home residents with COVID-19 were low during the peak of the pandemics first wave in Canada, which may have contributed to the particularly high concentration of COVID-19 mortality in Ontarios nursing homes.","output":"Temporal Variations in the Intensity of Care Provided to Community and Nursing Home Residents Who Died of COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective A rapidly developing scenario like a pandemic requires the prompt production of high-quality systematic reviews, which can be automated using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We evaluated the application of AI tools in COVID-19 evidence syntheses. Study design After prospective registration of the review protocol, we automated the download of all open-access COVID-19 systematic reviews in the COVID-19 Living Overview of Evidence database, indexed them for AI-related keywords, and located those that used AI tools. We compared their journals JCR Impact Factor, citations per month, screening workloads, completion times (from pre-registration to preprint or submission to a journal) and AMSTAR-2 methodology assessments (maximum score 13 points) with a set of publication date matched control reviews without AI. Results Of the 3999 COVID-19 reviews, 28 (0.7%, 95% CI 0.47-1.03%) made use of AI. On average, compared to controls (n=64), AI reviews were published in journals with higher Impact Factors (median 8.9 vs 3.5, p<0.001), and screened more abstracts per author (302.2 vs 140.3, p=0.009) and per included study (189.0 vs 365.8, p<0.001) while inspecting less full texts per author (5.3 vs 14.0, p=0.005).

This study evaluates the feasibility of mask chips for the soil reinforcement, through triaxial tests on samples mixed with complete decomposed granite (CDG) and mask chips (0%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1%, 5% by volume). The experimental results show that adding a moderate volumetric amount of mask chips (0.3%C1%) improves the soil strength, especially under high confining pressure. The optimum volumetric content of mask chips obtained by this study is 0.5%, raising the peak shear strength up to 22.3% under the confining stress of 120 kPa. When the volumetric content of mask chips exceeds the optimum value, the peak shear strength decreases accordingly. A limited amount of mask chips also increases the elastic modulus and makes the volumetric response more dilative. By contrast, excessive mask chips create additional voids and shift the strong soil-mask contacts to weak mask-mask contacts. The laser scanning microscope (LSM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images on the typical samples demonstrate the microstructure of mask fibers interlocking with soil particles, highly supporting the macro-scale mechanical behavior.","output":"Experimental study on the monotonic mechanical behavior of completely decomposed granite soil reinforced by disposable face-mask chips"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, an outbreak of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, and has rapidly spread worldwide Previously, discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients met the criteria of China's pneumonia diagnosis and treatment program of novel coronavirus infection (trial version 7) for cure of viral infection Nevertheless, positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 has been found again in several cured COVID-19 patients, leading to conflicts with current criteria Here, we report clinically cured cases with positive results only in anal swabs, and investigate the clinical value of anal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection","output":"Anal swab as a potentially optimal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection to evaluate hospital discharge of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In India, the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic has grown to 17,00000 cases and around 38,000 deaths up to 30th July, 2020 The impacts of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in India were studied using modified age-structured stochastic and deterministic mathematical models Methods: A compartmental susceptible (S)-infected (symptomatic) (IS) infected (asymptomatic) (IN) recovered (R) i e , SISINR model is developed, in which the flow of individuals through compartments is modeled using a set of differential equations The outbreak of the novel COVID-19 pandemic is critically evaluated from all major angles using base, education, vaccination and education and vaccination models based on the modified SISINR transmission network model for their simulations in MATLAB and peak of infected cases (both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases) as well as end of pandemic is predicted in each case Result: The numerical investigations are done for both stochastic and deterministic studies using the modified SISINR transmission network model for effective prediction about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in India The progress of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in India is estimated for various scenarios by varying the basic reproduction numbers from mean to extremes (general assumptions and strategies are inculcated through contact tracing based on the values of contact ratio operated for the basic reproduction numbers, 'R0') The efficacy and potential of the education programs and vaccination programs were established with the published datasets through a validation studies Furthermore, the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 pandemic is predicted for majorly affected cities in India on the basis of different reproduction numbers 'R0' Conclusion: The report presented herewith could be referred to revise the government policies to (a) implement mitigatory measures such as the practice of social distancing, partial city lockdown across the nation, etc , (b) implement a 100% daily number of tests to the susceptible population of the nation, (c) improve hospital facilities and the novel COVID-19 wards, (d) improve the recovery rate with the effective implementation of base, education, vaccination and education and vaccination model to attain the equilibrium stage of pandemic at the earliest and (e) meet the objective of preventing the outbreak of the novel COVID-19 pandemic through the effective implementation of control and prevention strategies across the nation","output":"Stochastic and deterministic mathematical modeling and simulation to evaluate the novel COVID-19 pandemic control measures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The pandemic spread of COVID-19 has caused worldwide implications on societies and economies.

It should be noticed that the main marathon races are performed in large cities, where air quality varies considerably. It is well established that breathing polluted air results in a number of harmful effects to the human body. However, there have been no studies to show the impact of marathon run performance on the amount of the deposition of varied fractions of airborne particulate matter (PM) in the respiratory tract of runners. This is why the present study sought to determine the impact of marathon run performance in the air of varying quality on the deposition of the PM(1), PM(2.5), PM(10) in the respiratory tract in humans. METHODS: The PM(1), PM(2.5) and PM(10) deposition was determined in an average runner (with marathon performance time 4 h: 30 min) and in an elite marathon runner (with marathon performance time 2 h: 00 min) at rest, and during a marathon race, based on own measurements of the PM content in the air and the size-resolved DF(d) profile concept. RESULTS: We have shown that breathing air containing 50 g m(?3) PM(10) (a borderline value according to the 2006 WHO standard - still valid) at minute ventilation (V(E)) equal to 8 L min(?1) when at rest, resulted in PM(10)deposition rate of approximately 9 g h(?1), but a marathon run of an average marathon runner with the V(E) = 62 L min(?1) increased the deposition rate up to 45 g h(?1). In the elite runner, marathon run with the V(E)= 115 L min(?1) increased PM(10) deposition rate to 83 g h(?1). Interestingly, breathing the air containing 50 g m(?3)of PM(10) at the V(E) = 115 L min(?1)by the elite marathon runner during the race resulted in the same PM(10)deposition rate as the breathing highly polluted air containing as much as 466 g m(?3) of PM(10) when at rest. Furthermore, the total PM(10) deposition in the respiratory tract during a marathon race in average runners is about 22% greater (203 / 166 = 1.22) than in elite runners. According to our calculations, the concentration of PM(10)in the air during a marathon race that would allow one not to exceed the PM(10) deposition rate of 9 g h(?1)should be lower than 10 g m(?3) in the case of an average runner, and it should be lower than 5.5 g m(?3) in the case of an elite runner. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a marathon run drastically increases the rate of deposition of the airborne PM in the respiratory tract of the runners, as a consequence of the huge V(E) generated during the race. A decrease of the PM content in the air attenuates this rate. Based on our calculations, we postulate that the PM(10) content in the air during a clean air marathon run, involving elite marathon runners, should be below 5.5 g m(?3).","output":"Marathon race performance increases the amount of particulate matter deposited in the respiratory system of runners: an incentive for clean air marathon runs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Projections that 60 transformative cell and gene therapies could be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within 10 years underscore an urgent need to modernize the newborn screening (NBS) system. This study convened expert stakeholders to assess challenges to the NBS system and propose solutions for its modernization. METHODS: NBS stakeholders (researchers, clinicians, state NBS leaders, advocates, industry professionals, and current/former advisory committee members) participated in one of five mixed-stakeholder panel discussions. Prior to panels, participants completed a survey in which they reviewed and ranked NBS challenges generated from relevant literature. During panels, participants deliberated on challenges and explored potential solutions. Pre-panel survey data were analyzed descriptively. Data from panel discussions were analyzed using a rapid qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Median scores of the ranked challenges (1 = most important) reveal the top three most important barriers to address: critical missing data for NBS decision-making (Median = 2), burden on state NBS laboratories (Median = 3), and the amount of time required for state-level implementation of screening for new conditions (Median = 4). Panel discussions were rooted in recurring themes: the infants well-being should be the focal point; the transformative therapy pipeline, although undeniably positive for individuals with rare diseases, is a threat to NBS capacity; decisions about modernizing NBS should be evidence-based; additional financial support is required but not sufficient for modernization; and modernization will require participation of multiple NBS stakeholders. This final overarching theme is reported in depth, including expertise, coordination, and collaboration challenges facing NBS and novel approaches to oversight, partnership, and coordination that were suggested by participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study engaged representatives from multiple stakeholder groups to generate potential solutions to challenges facing NBS in the United States. These solutions provide a rich starting point for policy makers and other stakeholders who desire to maximize the impact of new transformative therapies for babies, families, and society.

As COVID-19 immunizations continue, with possible booster vaccines upcoming, this study offers timing considerations and potential follow-up recommendations for breast imaging after vaccination. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients (pts) who received at least one COVID-19 vaccine prior to screening (SM) or diagnostic mammography (DM) at Mayo Clinic Florida between January 15 to May 31, 2021. Vaccine-related information was queried by mammography technologists. Adenopathy was assessed by interpreting radiologists and follow-up studies were collated. Mammogram adenopathy included single enlarged node, multiple enlarged nodes, and adenopathy with soft tissue stranding. Ultrasound adenopathy included mildly prominent nodes with preserved fatty hila to rounded nodes with apparent loss of a fatty hilum. Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between days from vaccine and adenopathy. Results: Of 2349 pts, 34 (1.4%) had adenopathy (DM=6;SM=28) and 3 (0.1%) were symptomatic. Presence of axillary symptoms was associated with abnormal imaging (p<0.001) with an odds ratio of 33 in multivariable model. Median time after vaccine for pts with adenopathy was significantly shorter at S 14 days compared to 33 days for pts without adenopathy (p<0.001). Incidence of adenopathy decreased as days from vaccine increased (3.4% for 0-14 days, 2.1% for 15-28 days, and 0.4% for > 28 days, p<0.001). After adjusting for being symptomatic, days from vaccine still had a significant impact on finding mammographic adenopathy (for each day after vaccine, OR=0.96, p<0.001). No significant difference was seen based on age (p=0.66), vaccine brand (p=0.66), vaccine dose (p=0.18). ROC analysis to identify a cutoff value for presence/absence of adenopathy was 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.81) at 22.5 days following vaccination. Additional imaging with mammogram and/or ultrasound was requested for 31 pts. These included no follow-up (n=4, 12.9%), repeat ultrasound with or without mammogram in 1-3 months (n=26, 83.9%), and biopsy (n=1, 3.2%, pt with ipsilateral breast cancer with negative results, presumably vaccine induced). To date, all pts who underwent surveillance imaging demonstrated normalization of lymph node appearance. The median time for abnormal imaging related to adenopathy to return to BI-RADS 1 or 2 was 84 (range 13-157) days. Conclusion: The incidence of COVID-19 vaccine-induced adenopathy in this study (1.4%) appeared to be lower than self-reported axillary swelling in COVID-19 vaccine trials (16%) but is still higher than the reported incidence of adenopathy on an otherwise normal SM (0.02-0.04%). The incidence of adenopathy decreased significantly over time and was not present in most pts 28 days after the vaccine. In patients with abnormal adenopathy, followup imaging showed resolution of vaccine-induced adenopathy in most patients by 3 months.","output":"Incidence and time to resolution of axillary adenopathy on mammography after COVID-19 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effects of the COVID-19 shocks in the Japanese labor market vary across workers of different age groups, genders, employment types, education levels, occupations, and industries We document heterogeneous changes in employment and earnings in response to the COVID-19 shocks, observed in various data sources during the initial months after the onset of the pandemic in Japan We then feed these shocks into a life-cycle model of heterogeneous agents to quantify welfare consequences of the COVID-19 shocks In each dimension of the heterogeneity, the shocks are amplified for those who earned less prior to the crisis Contingent workers are hit harder than regular workers, younger workers than older workers, females than males, and workers engaged in social and non-flexible jobs than those in ordinary and flexible jobs The most severely hurt by the COVID-19 shocks has been a group of female, contingent, low-skilled workers, engaged in social and non-flexible jobs and without a spouse of a different group ? 2020 Elsevier Inc","output":"Who suffers from the COVID-19 shocks?

To illustrate each theme, recent case studies are cited and case studies are performed on COVID-19 to demonstrate selected models.","output":"Review of Geospatial Technology for Infectious Disease Surveillance_ Use Case on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Brazilian distribution electricity market by applying a socioeconomic regulatory model called Optimized Tariff Model. The model quantifies the impact of the pandemic on the consumers quality of life and also on the economic performance of power distribution companies. Results indicate that both consumers and power distribution companies have been significantly affected in Brazil, especially companies that did not have access to the public policy proposed by the government, as they exhibited economic losses of more than 1 (GR$) in total. After analyzing the impact of the new coronavirus and the actions of the government in this context, an alternative mitigation measure (public policy) is proposed based on the Optimized Tariff Model and its feasibility examined. The alternative mitigation measure is also compared to the public policy proposed by the government and proved to be advantageous in some respects such as making bank loans unnecessary.","output":"Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Brazilian distribution electricity market based on a socioeconomic regulatory model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a reported incidence ranging from <5% to >25%. Proposed aetiologies include hypovolemia, hemodynamic disturbance and inflammation but also specific factors like direct viral invasion, microvascular thrombosis, and altered regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. To date, there are no confirmed specific therapies, and prevention and management of AKI should follow established guidelines. Novel therapies specifically targeting COVID-19 related pathologies are under investigation. The incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is variable, ranging from 0-37%. In a pandemic, RRT practice is likely to be determined by the number of patients, availability of machines, consumables and staff, clinical expertise, and acceptable alternatives. Close collaboration between critical care and renal services is essential. In this article, we describe the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated AKI, outline current management and suggest strategies to provide RRT during a pandemic when resources may be scarce.","output":"What every Intensivist should know about COVID-19 associated acute kidney injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A reverse vaccinology system, Vaxign, was used to identify and select a subset of five African Swine Fever (ASF) antigens that were successfully purified from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells and produced in Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) viral vectors.

Notably, sera from the vaccinees were positive by immunofluorescence on ASFV (Georgia 2007/1)-infected primary macrophages. Although MVA-vectored p72, CD2v, and EP153R failed to induce antibody responses, interferon-gamma (IFN-(+)) spot forming cell responses against all three antigens were detected one week post-boost. The highest IFN-(+) spot forming cell responses were detected against p72 in pigs primed with MVA-p72 and boosted with the recombinant p72. Antigen-specific (p12, p72, CD2v, and EP153R) T-cell proliferative responses were also detected post-boost.

In the suspension test, SAHW-62 could decrease the viral titer of both AIV and IBV by more than 1000 times within 30 s. With the dropping technique, IBV on carriers showed high resistance to SAHW, while AIV on plastic carrier was inactivated to an effective level (a?3 log virus reduction) within 1 min. With the wiping technique, SAHW-62 could inactivate both AIV and IBV on wiped plastic carriers to an effective level within 30 s. However, SAHW-220 could not inactivate IBV in the wiping rayon sheet to an effective level.

We conducted 10 in depth interviews with adults (24-38 years) with a self-reported eating disorder during lockdown. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. We identified core themes related to social restrictions (social isolation, changes in accountability to others, and increased responsibility for self and others), functional restrictions (lack of routine and structure, a need to intentionally plan activity, a desire for secrecy particularly around food shopping) and restrictions in access to mental health services. Overall, the impact of the lockdown was experienced as a catalyst for either increased disordered eating behaviours or for a drive for recovery, depending on individual circumstances going into these restrictions.

However, the number of cases continues to increase in developing countries at a faster rate due to community and cluster transmission. The severity of this epidemic made it a pandemic as it progressed to over 200 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), governments, and national disease control and prevention units worked together to break the chain and are working to contain the catastrophic impact of COVID\\\\19. They formulated and recommended various guidelines like social distancing, frequent hand washing, and social distancing to inhibit the spread of the virus. WHO also advised that the general population and medical personnel wear face masks, face shields, gloves, and aprons. As a result, this waste category has substantially increased and, if not disposed of properly, may cause the infection or help to catalyze COVID\\\\19. In developing countries, poor solid waste management may aggravate chances of spreading COVID\\\\19. Sustainable solid waste management is a critical parameter for the health, wellbeing, and development of society. The measures adopted to contain and restrict the spread of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic and minimize the degrees of freedom in commercial events affected solid waste management considerably. During this crucial time, the services provided by waste management agencies and personnel are invaluable and these services help to prevent the improper disposal of waste, which may lead to health risks due to the spread of COVID.

Methods Data were drawn from the Clinical Emergency Department Registry, including 164 ED sites across 35 states participating in the registry with complete data from January 2019 through November 15, 2020. Overall ED visit counts, as well as for specific emergency medical conditions identified by International Classification of Disease-10 code (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation, and venous thromboembolisms), were tabulated. We plotted biweekly visit counts overall and across specific geographic regions. Results The largest declines in visit counts occurred early in the pandemic with a nadir in April 46% lower than the 2019 monthly average. By November, overall ED visit counts had increased, but were 23% lower than pre-pandemic levels. The proportion of all ED visits that were for the select emergency conditions increased early in the pandemic, however total visit counts for acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease have remained lower in 2020 compared to 2019. Despite considerable geographic and temporal variation in the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall pattern of ED visits observed was similar across regions and time. Conclusion The persistent decline in ED visits for these time-sensitive emergency conditions raises the concern that COVID-19 may continue to impede patients from seeking essential care.

Method: Cross-sectional survey conducted online on registered practising ophthalmologists of India, post lockdown at the start of elective surgeries (20th to 25th May, 2020). The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress was assessed by DASS -21 questionnaire. DASS -Subscales: DASS- D (depression), DASS- A (anxiety) and DASS-S (stress) and grading of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analysed. Results: A total of 144 ophthalmologists aged 29-72 years responded to online survey. Of all participants, 94 (64.2%) of ophthalmologists suffered from mental health problems. Seventy six (52.7%) ophthalmologists had depression and anxiety whereas 20 (14%) reported stress. Women ophthalmologists scored highest total DASS mean score and DASS-stress mean score (p = .04 and p = .03). Results of DASS-D and DASS-A showed female preponderance (men vs women 42.5% vs 61.5%, p = .02; 42.5% vs 60%, p = .04). Severity of symptoms revealed that ophthalmologists above 40 years of age with more than 10 years' experienced severe stress (p = .005). Comprehensive ophthalmologists presented with severe stress and ophthalmologists practicing speciality with severe anxiety.

The assays' specificity was assessed in 130 non-CoVID-19 pneumonia patients. Using the microarray, NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies continuously displayed higher detection rates during acute CoVID-19 than S1- and S2-specific ones. S1-specific IgG antibodies, however, reached higher peak values. Until the 26th day post-symptom onset, all patients developed IgG responses against S1, S2, and NCP. Although detection rates by ELISAs/CLIAs generally resembled those of the microarray, corresponding to the target antigen, sensitivities and specificities varied among all tests. Notably, patients with more severe CoVID-19 displayed higher IgG and IgA levels, but this difference was mainly observed with S1-specific immunoassays. In patients with high SARS-CoV-2 levels in the lower respiratory tract, we observed high detection rates of IgG and total Ig immunoassays with a particular rise of S1-specific IgG antibodies when viral concentrations in the tracheal aspirate subsequently declined over time. In summary, our study demonstrates that differences in sensitivity among commercial immunoassays during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are only partly related to the target antigen. Importantly, our data indicate that NCP-specific IgA and IgG antibodies are detected earlier, while higher S1-specific IgA antibody levels occur in severely ill patients.","output":"Assessment of S1-, S2-, and NCP-Specific IgM, IgA, and IgG Antibody Kinetics in Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection by a Microarray and Twelve Other Immunoassays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract There has been a significant reduction of elective surgeries including creation of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) during the ongoing pandemic by the surgeons.

In analyzing large number of data, labelling process can be an intricate task and expert dependent. This study aims to explore COVID-19 pandemic sentiment by using clustering approach. The data is obtained by crawling COVID-19 related posts from Twitter. The crawled data is pre-processed, and terms are extracted by using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique is then used to reduce irrelevant features. K-means algorithm is employed to cluster the tweets into k clusters. The results of each cluster are plotted using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) technique and lexicon-based sentiment analysis has been applied to discover sentiments of these clusters. The results showed relatively 9 clusters were obtained with different topics ranging highest score of 83.25% positivity and 16.75% of negativity are reported.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The outcomes of interest of this literature review were mental health, suicide, deliberate self-harm (DSH) and violence. Exposures of interest were TOOC, TIPA or a partial or indirect measure of either. In total, 14 studies were included. An abbreviated review methodology was used because of time constraints. FINDINGS: There was consistent evidence of an association between lower TOOC and TIPA and worse mental health and higher suicide risk. Limited evidence suggests a link between TOOC and DSH. No evidence was identified regarding the relationship between TOOC/TIPA and violence. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: A lack of longitudinal studies prevents conclusions regarding causality. Significant heterogeneity of mental health outcomes limits the comparability of studies. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of TOOC and TIPA on adverse mental outcomes for prisoners when designing prison regimes, including during urgent adaptation of such regimes in response to Covid-19. They are likely to be of interest to practitioners and policymakers concerned with prison regime design.

Using a nationwide retrospective cohort, we assessed inpatient outcomes following brain tumor craniotomy at SNHs in the United States. METHODS: We identified all craniotomy procedures in the National Inpatient Sample from 2002C2011 for brain tumors: glioma, metastasis, meningioma, and vestibular schwannoma. Safety-net burden was calculated as the number of Medicaid plus uninsured admissions divided by total admissions. Hospitals in the top quartile of burden were defined as SNHs. The association between SNH status and in-hospital mortality, discharge disposition, complications, hospital-acquired conditions (HACs), length of stay (LOS), and costs were assessed. Multivariate regression adjusted for patient, hospital, and severity characteristics. RESULTS: 304,719 admissions were analyzed. The most common subtype was glioma (43.8%). Of 1,206 unique hospitals, 242 were SNHs. SNH admissions were more likely to be non-white (P < .001), low income (P < .001), and have higher severity scores (P = .034). Mortality rates were higher at SNHs for metastasis admissions (odds ratio [OR] = 1.48, P = .025), and SNHs had higher complication rates for meningioma (OR = 1.34, P = .003) and all tumor types combined (OR = 1.17, P = .034). However, there were no differences at SNHs for discharge disposition or HACs. LOS and hospital costs were elevated at SNHs for all subtypes, culminating in a 10% and 9% increase in LOS and costs for the overall population, respectively (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: SNHs demonstrated poorer inpatient outcomes for brain tumor craniotomy.

Such an adjustment is commonly made based on a combination of performance measures (eg, in-game scores) and physiological measurements, which provide insight into the players psychological state. However, although many prototypes of affective games have been presented and many studies have shown that physiological measurements allow more accurate classification of the players psychological state than performance measures, few studies have examined whether dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) based on physiological measurements (which requires additional sensors) results in a better user experience than performance-based DDA or manual difficulty adjustment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare five DDA methods in an affective exergame: manual (player-controlled), random, performance-based, personality-performanceCbased, and physiology-personality-performanceCbased (all-data). METHODS: A total of 50 participants (N=50) were divided into five groups, corresponding to the five DDA methods. They played an exergame version of Pong for 18 minutes, starting at a medium difficulty; every 2 minutes, two game difficulty parameters (ball speed and paddle size) were adjusted using the participants assigned DDA method. The DDA rules for the performance-based, personality-performanceCbased, and all-data groups were developed based on data from a previous open-loop study. Seven physiological responses were recorded throughout the sessions, and participants self-reported their preferred changes to difficulty every 2 minutes. After playing the game, participants reported their in-game experience using two questionnaires: the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and the Flow Experience Measure. RESULTS: Although the all-data method resulted in the most accurate changes to ball speed and paddle size (defined as the percentage match between DDA choice and participants preference), no significant differences between DDA methods were found on the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and Flow Experience Measure. When the data from all four automated DDA methods were pooled together, the accuracy of changes in ball speed was significantly correlated with players enjoyment (r=0.38) and pressure (r=0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Although our study is limited by the use of a between-subjects design and may not generalize to other exergame designs, the results do not currently support the inclusion of physiological measurements in affective exergames, as they did not result in an improved user experience. As the accuracy of difficulty changes is correlated with user experience, the results support the development of more effective DDA methods. However, they show that the inclusion of physiological measurements does not guarantee a better user experience even if it yields promising results in offline cross-validation.","output":"User Experience With Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Methods for an Affective Exergame: Comparative Laboratory-Based Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim and objective: Chemosensitive disorders are being reported increasingly in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. An attempt to document the incidence of this variation in the perception of taste, smell, salivation, and burning sensation in the mouth as well as mouth ulcerations in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Materials and methods: A single-institution short-term observational study was conducted on chemosensitive complaints like ageusia, anosmia, decreased salivation, oral ulcers, and burning sensation in the mouth, in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Results: Among 201 patients, 25.9% of patients reported a loss of smell while 33.3% of patients reported alteration in taste. 27.9% of patients reported decreased salivation, while ulcer findings were only in 1.5% and burning sensation in 1% of the patients. Conclusion: Clinicians should suspect infection of SARS-CoV-2 in such patients, to avoid missing diagnosis or misdiagnosis of these patients which could lead to further transmission and spread of the disease. Clinical significance: Loss of smell and taste seems to be more common in COVID-19 patients as compared to other chemosensitive disorders like ulcers in the mouth or burning sensation or decreased salivation. ?

Such traditional agroforestry systems can foster a variety of benefits; besides positive livelihood implications baobab can particularly address food security objectives due to its highly nutritious fruits. However, many bottlenecks persist inhibiting the broader potential of indigenous trees in farming systems and their increased utilisation and commercialisation. We suggest that traditional farming systems with baobab trees can be advanced by stimulating the emergence of local markets for baobab products while promoting businesses and innovations aimed at meeting the arising market demand. Increasing the perceived value of local agroforestry products in combination with facilitating additional commercialisation pathways will in turn lead to food security and livelihood benefits. Using a multi-stakeholder approach such considerations were put into practice in Kilifi, Kenya, by initiating a community-based enterprise development producing high-quality baobab powder and oil. Initial results demonstrate behavioural changes, an improved practical knowhow with regard to baobab management and utilisation, and an increased consumption of baobab, which may already contribute to food security objectives. Baobab is increasingly seen as a valuable resource as opposed to food for the poor and a tree possessed by evil spirits. This may lay the groundwork for further value addition activities and enterprise development in the communities. With baobab being a common, yet so far underutilised feature of local farming systems in Kilifi, activities based on its increasing commercialisation can be complementary and easily integrable to prevailing livelihood strategies.","output":"Using a multi-stakeholder approach to increase value for traditional agroforestry systems: the case of baobab (Adansonia digitata L.) in Kilifi, Kenya"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to review the roles that community pharmacists in the United States (US) can play to support public health measures during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic (COVID-19).

We aimed to estimate in near real time the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this modelling study, we developed a method to reconstruct the proportion of adults who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the proportion of infections being detected, using the joint analysis of age-stratified seroprevalence, hospitalisation, and case data, with deconvolution methods. We developed our method on a dataset consisting of seroprevalence estimates from 9782 participants (aged &#8805;20 years) in the two worst affected regions of France in May, 2020, and applied our approach to the 13 French metropolitan regions over the period March, 2020, to January, 2021. We validated our method externally using data from a national seroprevalence study done between May and June, 2020. FINDINGS: We estimate that 57% (95% CI 51-64) of adults in metropolitan France had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by May 11, 2020. This proportion remained stable until August, 2020, and increased to 149% (132-169) by Jan 15, 2021. With 265% (234-298) of adult residents having been infected in ?le-de-France (Paris region) compared with 51% (45-58) in Brittany by January, 2021, regional variations remained large (coefficient of variation [CV] 050) although less so than in May, 2020 (CV 074). The proportion infected was twice as high (204%, 156-263) in 20-49-year-olds than in individuals aged 50 years or older (97%, 69-141). 402% (343-463) of infections in adults were detected in June to August, 2020, compared with 493% (429-559) in November, 2020, to January, 2021. Our regional estimates of seroprevalence were strongly correlated with the external validation dataset (coefficient of correlation 089).

As we write, infection rates are currently at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary viral target is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predicts that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results and finds additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In view of sparse data on how the perception of the undergraduate educational environment (EE) is affected by the pandemic, we sought to compare the ratings of EE and learning processes (motivation, engagement, equipping, appreciation of psychiatry) between the 2020 (during pandemic) and 2019 (before pandemic) cohorts of students, and examined how the perception of the EE would influence overall experience within the psychiatry rotation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The DREEM (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure) was administered to fourth-year medical undergraduate students undergoing a psychiatry rotation in 2020 during the pandemic and these ratings were compared with those of the preceding cohort in 2019. Students also completed five additional items evaluating various learning processes and overall rating of the posting. Relationships between the DREEM scores, learning processes, and overall effectiveness of rotation were assessed using correlation and mediational analyses. RESULTS: Altogether, 84 (response rate 93.3%) and 269 (response rate 89.7%) medical undergraduates participated in the study from 2020 and 2019 cohorts, respectively. The 2020 cohort had higher scores on the total DREEM (p = 0.032), academic self-perception DREEM subscale (p = 0.002), felt more engaged (p = 0.043) and better equipped (p = 0.003) compared with the 2019 cohort. Overall, DREEM and subdomain scores correlated significantly with specific learning processes. The direct effect of total DREEM and overall rating of psychiatry posting was significant in mediational analyses.
