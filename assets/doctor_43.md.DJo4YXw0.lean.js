OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Racial and ethnic disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations predate COVID-19. In order to identify and address healthcare disparities exacerbated by the pandemic, we examined whether and to what extent the pandemic affected numbers of potentially avoidable hospitalizations by race and ethnicity. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: This single-center pre-post study of 904 patients at UCLA included all patients admitted to an internal medicine service for an ambulatory care sensitive condition (ACSC) between March-August of 2020 (post) and March-August of 2019 (pre). We measured the change in number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (defined per the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines) stratified by race and ethnicity. We calculated 95% CIs for the number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations using a cluster bootstrap procedure, clustering at the level of patients. We inverted the bootstrap CIs to calculate p-values for overall changes within racial/ethnic groups as well as differential changes between groups. Patients with missing or unspecified racial/ethnic data were excluded (n=1,003; 7.8%). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Between March 1 and August 31, 2020, 347 out of 4,838 hospitalizations (7.2%) were potentially avoidable, compared to 557 out of 6,248 (8.9%) during the same 6-months of 2019. Reductions in potentially avoidable hospitalizations among Non-Hispanic White (-50.3%; 95% CI, -60.9 - -41.2; p<0.001) and Latinx (-32.3%; 95% CI, -59.8 - -12.2%, p<0.001) patients were statistically significant, whereas reductions among African American (-8.0%; 95% CI, -39.9 - +16.2) and Asian (-16.1%; 95% CI, -75.7 - +20.4) patients were not statistically different from 0%. The relative differences in magnitudes of reduction were only statistically significant between African American and non-Hispanic White patients (-50.3% v. -8.0%; 95% CI as above; p=0.015). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Racial disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic at this large urban health system. Healthcare leaders, researchers, and policy makers should focus on efforts to prevent a post-pandemic resurgence of low-value hospitalizations in ways that do not further widen disparities.","output":"13693 Racial Disparities in Potentially Avoidable Hospitalizations During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of six international and mature online learners studying on an undergraduate psychology course to identify barriers and facilitators to studying online.

Online interviews with six demographically diverse participants were conducted and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The overarching theme was 'the balancing act of online learners', which consisted of three major themes (and respective subthemes): (1) 'identity as an online learner' ('in today's world, we're all very busy'), (2) 'access to resources' ('importance of location' and 'comparing online to on-campus teaching and learning'), and (3) 'changing nature of social interactions' ('tutors as a crutch' and 'peer-to-peer interactions').

We first developed a 21-item questionnaire called Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP), which had a reliable four-factor structure, and measured attitudes towards open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities. We then used the ATOPP to explore attitudes of Croatian scientists (n = 541) towards these topics, and to assess the association of their attitudes with their open science practices and demographic information. Overall, Croatian scientists attitudes towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median (Md) score of 3.3 out of max 5 on the scale score. We also found no gender (P = 0.995) or field differences (P = 0.523) in their attitudes. However, attitudes of scientist who previously engaged in open peer-review or preprinting were higher than of scientists that did not (Md 3.5 vs. 3.3, P<0.001, and Md 3.6 vs 3.3, P<0.001, respectively).

There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account. Although the existence of a chronically infected population still remains largely hypothetical, we believe that our results provide tentative evidence to consider a chronically infected population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","output":"Assessing the potential impact of transmission during prolonged viral shedding on the effect of lockdown relaxation on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In July 2020, four months into the disruption of normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, we assessed the institutional climate within the School of Medicine.

PhD students work hard, but the number of hours spent on research-related activities has declined during the pandemic. The students are worried about the pandemics impact on their research productivity, consequent delays in their graduation, and diminished future job prospects. Many late stage PhD students feel they do not have adequate time or resources to plan for their future careers. Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression are prevalent in 51% of the students, based on answers to standardized questions. Most students report they have strong mentoring relationships with their faculty advisors and like their programs, but they identify to a lesser extent with the medical school as a whole. Faculty think highly of their graduate students and are also worried about the pandemics impact upon productivity and the welfare of students. Students are interested in access to an Ombuds office, which is currently being organized by the medical school.

Currently, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms, clinical course, and prognostic implications of comorbid COVID-19 in patients with GBS. We reviewed COVID-19-associated GBS case reports published since the outbreak of the pandemic, with a database search up to August 2020, including a manual search of the reference lists for additional relevant cases. Fifty-one (51) case reports of COVID-19 patients (aged 23C84 years) diagnosed with GBS in 11 different countries were included in this review. The results revealed atypical manifestations of GBS, including para-infectious profiles and onset of GBS without antecedent COVID-19 symptoms. Although all tested patients had signs of neuroinflammation, none had SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and only four (4) patients had antiganglioside antibodies. The majority had a 1- to 10-day time interval between the onset of COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, and many had a poor outcome, with 20 out of the 51 (39.2%) requiring mechanical ventilation, and two deaths within 12 to 24 h. The atypical manifestations of COVID-19-associated GBS, especially the para-infectious profile and short time interval between the onset of the COVID-19 and GBS symptoms, increase the likelihood of symptom overlap, which can complicate the treatment and result in worsened disease progression and/or higher mortality rates.

Furthermore, the molecular regulation of neutrophil fate and function at the viral infected sites is largely elusive. Here we report that BCL6 deficiency in myeloid cells exhibited drastically enhanced host resistance to severe influenza A virus (IAV) infection. In contrast to the notion that BCL6 functions to suppress innate inflammation, we find that myeloid BCL6 deficiency diminished lung inflammation without affecting viral loads. Using a series of Cre-transgenic, reporter, and knockout mouse lines, we demonstrate that BCL6 deficiency in neutrophils, but not in monocytes or lung macrophages, attenuated host inflammation and morbidity following IAV infection. Mechanistically, BCL6 bound to the neutrophil gene loci involved in cellular apoptosis in cells specifically at the site of infection. As such, BCL6 disruption resulted in increased expression of apoptotic genes in neutrophils in the respiratory tract, but not in the circulation or bone marrow. Consequently, BCL6 deficiency promoted tissue neutrophil apoptosis. Partial neutrophil depletion led to diminished pulmonary inflammation and decreased host morbidity. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of BCL6 in modulating neutrophil apoptosis at the site of infection for the regulation of host disease development following viral infection. Furthermore, our studies indicate that tissue-specific regulation of neutrophil survival modulates host inflammation and tissue immunopathology during acute respiratory viral infection.","output":"BCL6 modulates tissue neutrophil survival and exacerbates pulmonary inflammation following influenza virus infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present here an evidence-based review of the utility, timing, and indications for laboratory test use in the domains of inflammation, cardiology, hematology, nephrology and co-infection for clinicians managing the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

METHODS/CASE REPORT: Routine and earlier diagnostic data along demographic information were extracted for total of 21,672 subsequent presentations. Along conventional statistics, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) were applied to predict COVID-19 from pre-pandemic control. Three feature sets were prepared, and performance evaluated through stratified 10-fold cross validation. With differing predominance of COVID-19, multiple test sets were created and predictive efficiency was evaluated to simulate real-fashion performance against fluctuating course of pandemic. Models validation was also inducted in prospective manner on independent dataset, equating framework forecasting to conclusions from PCR. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): RBF model attained superior cross entropy error 20.761(7.883) and 20.782(3.991) for Q-Flags and Routine Items respectively while MLP outperformed for cell population data (CPD) parameters with value of 6.968(1.259) for training(testing).

Materials and Methods: This was an online, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, that was conducted from 21st March to 30 March 2020. We included undergraduate students of the University of Aleppo (Syria). The questionnaire consisted of three sections: Demographics ,knowledge and behaviours . Every participant's knowledge was scored from 0-13 depending on the number of correct answers in the knowledge section. The correctness was judged depending on WHO recommendations at the time of questionnaire administration. P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among this well-educated and predominantly medical and health-related students, 682 (45.4%) students had a good knowledge level, which is somehow disappointing. The current study shows that 1st year students and non-medical specialties students and smokers had significantly lower knowledge levels than others. On contrary, residing with less people -which may indicate a higher socioeconomic status-, was associated with a higher knowledge level. We also found that commitment to preventive measures was in general satisfying and correlated significantly with knowledge level and gender in most cases. Conclusion: Junior students, non-medical specialties, smokers and those who live with high number of people are vulnerable to less knowledge level and awareness campaigns should concentrate on them. Increasing awareness is useful to increase commitment to preventive measures, and groups that have less adherence to preventive measures, as described in detail, should be taken into consideration while designing public health responses.

Besides, on December 2019, a new virus known as coronavirus appeared, that its rapid prevalence caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider it a pandemic. As a potential drug for controlling or treating these two undesired diseases at the cellular level, chloroquine and its derivatives are being investigated, although they possess side effects, which must be reduced for effective and safe treatments. With respect to the importance of this medicine, the current research aimed to calculate the solubility of chloroquine in supercritical carbon dioxide, and evaluated effect of pressure and temperature on the solubility. The pressure varied between 120 and 400 bar, and temperatures between 308 and 338 K were set for the measurements. The experimental results revealed that the solubility of chloroquine lies between 1.64  10(?5) to 8.92  10(?4) (mole fraction) with different functionality to temperature and pressure. Although the solubility was indicated to be strong function of pressure and temperature, the effect of temperature was more profound and complicated. A crossover pressure point was found in the solubility measurements, which indicated similar behaviour to an inflection point. For the pressures higher than the crossover point, the temperature indicated direct effect on the solubility of chloroquine. On the other hand, for pressures less than the crossover point, temperature enhancement led to a reduction in the solubility of chloroquine. Moreover, the obtained solubility results were correlated via semi-empirical density-based thermodynamic correlations. Five correlations were studied including: Kumar & Johnston, Mendez-Santiago-Teja, Chrastil, Bartle et al., and Garlapati & Madras. The best performance was obtained for Mendez-Santiago-Teja's correlation in terms of average absolute relative deviation percent (12.0%), while the other examined models showed almost the same performance for prediction of chloroquine solubility.","output":"Chloroquine (antimalaria medication with anti SARS-CoV activity) solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reviews and notices are provided on 23 books, published over the years 2017C2020.

METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE was conducted, utilising various term combinations. Studies that assessed any respiratory function parameter during the re-evaluation of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and were published as full-text articles in English are included in this review. RESULTS: Amongst 183 articles initially retrieved, 8 fulfilled the criteria and were included in this review; they involved a total of 341 adult patients. Four were retrospective studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a randomised control trial and two were case reports/case series. The follow-up time ranged from 1 month since symptom onset to 3 months after discharge. The most frequent abnormality was reduced lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO), followed by a restrictive pattern. Other findings are the lack of resting hypoxemia, the reduced respiratory muscle strength and the decreased exercise capacity, although relative data are extremely limited. CONCLUSION: Patients who recovered from COVID-19 present with abnormal respiratory function at short-term follow-up, mainly with reduced lung diffusion and a restrictive pattern.

More than one hundred years ago, the concept of bone marrow transplantation was proposed to treat human diseases. During the last five decades, this concept became a reality first in hematology and later for orthopaedic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: These advances were possible due to the comprehension of the three major components of bone marrow: the fat part, the haematologic part, and the stroma part. Each part has a different history, but the three parts are linked in physiology as in history. RESULTS: During many centuries, bone marrow was considered just as food; however, one hundred years ago, the concept of bone marrow transplantation to treat humans was proposed by the French physician Brown-Squard. During the last five decades, this concept became a reality first in haematology and later for orthopaedic diseases. Transferring what was known from experimental animal models to humans was met with many challenges, the atomic bomb research, and many deaths. Yet through the recognition and subsequent understanding of fundamental processes, medical resiliency, and the determination of a few pioneers, local bone marrow transplantation in orthopaedic surgery became a therapeutic option first for a limited number of diseases and patients. Over the last two decades, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been the focus of intense research by acadaemia and industry due to their unique features. MSCs can be easily isolated and expanded through in vitro culture by taking full advantage of their self-renewing capacity. In addition, MSCs exert immunomodulatory effects and can be differentiated into various lineages, which makes them highly attractive for clinical applications in cell-based therapies.

The facility is related to the possession of the required tools and knowledge to utilize the technology, alongside the significant effect on ease of use and usefulness. When adequately provided, the ease and benefit of using Google Classroom are maximally felt when distance learning is ongoing. Consequently, the ease of use positively influenced the benefits of the platform as its features were simple and benefited the students during the learning process. The usefulness of Google Classroom also had a positive influence on attitude towards the platform, and this variable finally determined the intention to use, which was significantly influenced by the perceived usefulness of e-learning.

This study reviewed the characteristics and outcomes of individuals who attended the centre for COVID-19 testing. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study collected epidemiological and clinical data. The primary outcome was a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected at the centre. The relationships of clinical characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 positive test results were assessed by multivariable binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1258 attendees included in the analysis, 86 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (positivity rate=6.84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.57%-8.37%). Of these 86 individuals, 40 (46.5%) were aged 15 to 24 years and 81 (94.2%) had a history of recent travel. Symptoms were reported by 86.0% and 96.3% of individuals with positive and negative test results, respectively. The clinical characteristics most strongly associated with a positive test result were anosmia (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=8.30; 95% CI=1.12-127.09) and fever ORadj=1.32; 95% CI=1.02-3.28). CONCLUSION: The temporary test centre successfully helped identify individuals with COVID-19 who exhibited mild disease symptoms.

Tracheal allotransplantation maintains cartilage and epithelium viability but requires immunosuppression because of epithelial immunogenicity. We aimed to obtain an epithelium-decellularized allograft that maintains cartilage viability and to evaluate long-term outcomes of such allografts implanted on dog backs without immunosuppressants. METHODS Twenty-five tracheas harvested from mongrel dogs were used to explore the period of epithelium decellularization by combined use of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and an organ preservation solution and to assess the chondrocyte viability and immunogenicity of the tracheas after decellularization. Sixteen epithelium-decellularized tracheal allografts and 10 fresh tracheal segments (6 cm long) were implanted in 26 beagles for durations of 10 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were used to evaluate the morphology, viability, and immune rejection of the allografts. Safranin-O staining was used to detect glycosaminoglycans. RESULTS The epithelium disappeared after 24 hours of decellularization. At 72 hours, almost no nuclei remained in the mucosa, while the mean survival rate of chondrocytes was 88.1%. Histological analysis demonstrated that the allograft retained intact tracheal rings and viable cartilage after heterotopic implantation for 1 year, with no immunological rejection. There were no significant differences in the glycosaminoglycan contents among the implanted epithelium-decellularized allografts. CONCLUSIONS Epithelium-decellularized tracheal allografts with chondrocyte viability can be achieved by combined use of a detergent and organ preservation solution, which showed satisfactory cartilage viability and structural integrity after long-term heterotopic transplantation. Further studies on orthotopic transplantation are needed to assess the feasibility of allografts in reconstructing long segmental tracheal defects.","output":"De-Epithelialized Heterotopic Tracheal Allografts without Immunosuppressants in Dogs: Long-Term Results for Cartilage Viability and Structural Integrity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new pandemic infectious disease that originated in China.

We sought to identify alterations to established conventional evidence-based management of acute severe ulcerative colitis during the early COVID-19 pandemic, the effect on outcomes, and any associations with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: The PROTECT-ASUC study was a multicentre, observational, case-control study in 60 acute secondary care hospitals throughout the UK. We included adults (&#8805;18 years) with either ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel disease unclassified, who presented with acute severe ulcerative colitis and fulfilled the Truelove and Witts criteria. Cases and controls were identified as either admitted or managed in emergency ambulatory care settings between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period cohort), or between Jan 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019 (historical control cohort), respectively. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or colectomy. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04411784. FINDINGS: We included 782 patients (398 in the pandemic period cohort and 384 in the historical control cohort) who met the Truelove and Witts criteria for acute severe ulcerative colitis. The proportion of patients receiving rescue therapy (including primary induction) or surgery was higher during the pandemic period than in the historical period (217 [55%] of 393 patients vs 159 [42%] of 380 patients; p=000024) and the time to rescue therapy was shorter in the pandemic cohort than in the historical cohort (p=00026). This difference was driven by a greater use of rescue and primary induction therapies with biologicals, ciclosporin, or tofacitinib in the COVID-19 pandemic period cohort than in the historical control period cohort (177 [46%] of 387 patients in the COVID-19 cohort vs 134 [36%] of 373 patients in the historical cohort; p=00064). During the pandemic, more patients received ambulatory (outpatient) intravenous steroids (51 [13%] of 385 patients vs 19 [5%] of 360 patients; p=000023). Fewer patients received thiopurines (29 [7%] of 398 patients vs 46 [12%] of 384; p=0029) and 5-aminosalicylic acids (67 [17%] of 398 patients vs 98 [26%] of 384; p=00037) during the pandemic than in the historical control period. Colectomy rates were similar between the pandemic and historical control groups (64 [16%] of 389 vs 50 [13%] of 375; p=026); however, laparoscopic surgery was less frequently performed during the pandemic period (34 [53%] of 64] vs 38 [76%] of 50; p=0018). Five (2%) of 253 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during hospital treatment. Two (2%) of 103 patients re-tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the 3-month follow-up were positive 5 days and 12 days, respectively, after discharge from index admission. Both recovered without serious outcomes. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic altered practice patterns of gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons in the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis but was associated with similar outcomes to a historical cohort. Despite continued use of high-dose corticosteroids and biologicals, the incidence of COVID-19 within 3 months was low and not associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

Therefore, the safety of NSAIDs is still questioned. Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases from December 2019 to January 2021 to examine use prevalence for NSAIDs in general, as well as associated COVID-19 risk and outcomes. This study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019132063) Results: We included 25 studies with a total of 101,215 COVID-19 patients. The use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients reached 19%. Exposure to NSAIDs was not associated with significantly increased risk of developing COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR]=0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-1.24; I2=82%), hospitalization (OR=1.06, 95%CI: 0.76-1.48; I2=81%), mechanical ventilation (OR=0.71, 95%CI: 0.47-1.06; I2=38%), and length of hospital stay. Moreover, use of NSAIDs was significantly associated with better outcomes, including severity of COVID-19 (OR=0.79, 95%CI: 71-0.89; I2=0%) and death (OR=0.68, 95%CI: 0.52-0.89; I2=85%) in patients with COVID-19. Regarding safety outcomes, exposure to NSAIDs was associated with increased risk of stroke (OR=2.32, 95%CI: 1.04-5.2; I2=0%), but not with myocardial infraction (OR=1.49; p=0.66; I2=0%), overt thrombosis (OR=0.76, p=0.50; I2=28%) and major bleeding (p=0.61). Conclusion: Based on current evidence, exposure to NSAIDs is not linked to increased odds or exacerbation of COVID-19 in the general COVID-19 population. Furthermore, administration of NSAIDs might have better outcomes and survival benefits in the general COVID-19 population, although potentially increasing the risk of stroke. Use of NSAIDs might be safe and beneficial in COVID-19.

MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, urine and blood routine tests and other laboratory parameters of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Union Hospital. Findings178 patients, admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were included in this study. No patient (0 [0%]) presented increased serum creatinine (Scr), and 5 (2.8%) patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating few cases with \\"kidney dysfunction\\".

However, this effect depends on several factors. We found that using an elevation training mask during low-intensity aerobic exercise causes an IOP rise. PURPOSE To assess the influence of wearing an elevation training mask (ETM) on IOP during low-intensity endurance training. METHODS 16 physically active young adults (age=23.92.9?y) cycled during 30 minutes at 10% of maximal power production with and without an ETM in two different days and randomized order. A rebound tonometer was used to measure IOP at baseline, after a warm-up of 5 minutes, during cycling (6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 minutes), and recovery (5 and 10 minutes) by rebound tonometry. RESULTS The use of an ETM significantly affects the IOP behaviour during exercise (P<0.001, p2=0.66). In the ETM condition, there was an IOP increment during exercise (P<0.001, p2=0.28) whereas an IOP-lowering effect was observed in the control condition (P<0.001, p2=0.41). Post-hoc comparisons showed that there were greater IOP values during exercise in the ETM condition in comparison to the control condition (average IOP difference=3.72.2?mmHg; corrected P values<0.01, and Cohens ds >1.10, in all cases). CONCLUSION Low-intensity endurance exercise causes an increment in IOP when it is performed wearing an ETM and a decrease in IOP when the air flow is not restricted (control condition). Therefore, the ETM should be discouraged during low-intensity endurance exercise for individuals who need to reduce IOP levels (e.g., glaucoma patients or those at risk). However, the external validity of these results needs to be addressed in future studies with the inclusion of glaucoma patients.","output":"Effects of Wearing the Elevation Training Mask During Low-intensity Cycling Exercise on Intraocular Pressure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonclinical studies are fundamental for the development of inhaled drugs, as for any drug product, and for successful translation to clinical practice They include in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies and are intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of the inhaled drug beneficial and detrimental effects To date, animal models cannot be circumvented during drug development programs, acting as surrogates of humans to predict inhaled drug response, fate and toxicity Herein, we review the animal models used during the different development stages of inhaled pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals, highlighting their strengths and limitations","output":"Correlation and clinical relevance of animal models for inhaled pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The course of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) might be determined by certain comorbidities (e.g. diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases) and advanced age.

Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients.

METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study at a 776-bed tertiary care urban academic medical center. Adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 (nasopharyngeal swab testing positive by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay) from March 8, 2020, to June 14, 2020, were included. Clinical information including the presence of comorbid conditions (according to the Charlson Weighted Index of Comorbidity (CWIC)), initial vital signs, admission laboratory markers and management data were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 565 hospitalized patients, 172 patients died for a case fatality rate of 30.4%. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 64.4 (16.2) years, and 294 (52.0%) were male. The patients who died were significantly older (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [14.1] years vs 61.7 [16.1] years; P < 0.0001), more likely to have congestive heart failure (35 [20.3%] vs 47 [12.0%]; P = 0.009), dementia (47 [27.3%] vs 48 [12.2%]; P < 0.0001), hemiplegia (18 [10.5%] vs 18 [4.8%]; P = 0.01) and a diagnosis of malignancy (16 [9.3%] vs 18 [4.6%]; P = 0.03).From multivariable analysis, factors associated with an increased odds of death were age greater than 60 years (OR = 2.2, P = 0.003), CWIC score (OR = 1.1, P = 0.023), qSOFA (OR = 1.7, P < 0.0001), WBC counts (OR = 1.1, P = 0.002), lymphocytopenia (OR = 2.0, P = 0.003), thrombocytopenia (OR = 1.9, P = 0.019), albumin (OR = 0.6, P = 0.014), and AST levels (OR = 2.0, P = 0.004) on admission.

Knowing these risk factors may help identify patients who would benefit from close observations and early interventions.","output":"Clinical Features and Risk Factors for In-Hospital Mortality From COVID-19 Infection at a Tertiary Care Medical Center, at the Onset of the US COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging pandemics call for unique health communication and education strategies in which public health agencies need to satisfy the public's information needs about possible risks while preventing risk exaggeration and dramatization. As a route to providing a framework for understanding public information behaviors in response to an emerging pandemic, this study examined the characteristics of communicative behaviors of social media audiences in response to Ebola outbreak news. Grounded in the social amplification of risks framework, this study adds to an understanding of information behaviors of online audiences by showing empirical differences in audience engagement with online health information. The data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Facebook channel. The final data set included 809 CDC posts and 35,916 audience comments. The analysis identified the differences in audience information behaviors in response to an emerging pandemic, Ebola, and health promotion posts. While the CDC had fewer posts on Ebola than health promotion topics, the former received more attention from active page users. Furthermore, audience members who actively engaged with Ebola news had a small overlap with those who engaged with non-Ebola information during the same period. Overall, this study demonstrated that information behavior and audience engagement is topic dependent. Furthermore, audiences who commented on news about an emerging pandemic were homogenous and varied in their degree of information amplification.","output":"Health Risk Information Engagement and Amplification on Social Media."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Finding significant events, which follow a specific pattern, is an essential task in sequential rule mining. While the significance of a rule often is based on conditions like a maximum amount of time [1], or a minimum distance between patterns [2], the area between these two extremes is rarely analyzed. This paper aims at the discovery of partially-ordered sequential rules which satisfy a given correlation gap constraint. Applying this constraint to the support threshold determines a more relevant rule, among other parameters. We also require it in sparse datasets, where long sequences with many distinct events exist. This setting can be found in online product configurators, where the basis is an unstructured process that combines both high-level and fine-grained configuration steps. In general, our novel approach SCORER-Gap can be applied to procedures with a high variability of events.By focusing on the gap size between antecedent and consequent of a rule, we show that usually, the resulting vast number of rules gets highly reduced while keeping the flexibility between a minimum and a maximum distance in between. To implement our novel approach, we use an in-mining setup, namely RuleGrowth [1] to which we attach the correlation gap constraint as mentioned above. The code is available on [3]. For an extensive analysis of application areas, we use three real-world datasets consisting of different characteristics. We start with a Covid19 genome sequence representing a highly dense dataset. Additionally, an industrial database and the clickstream of a Hungarian news website (Kosarak) are used as representatives for increasingly sparse datasets.SCORER-Gap shows a high percentual reduction in the number of rules in the resulting ruleset while slightly increasing accuracy in a train and test setting. Furthermore, a high proportion of recommendation rules differs between RuleGrowth and SCORER-Gap. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"SCORER-Gap: Sequentially Correlated Rules for Event Recommendation Considering Gap Size"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alcohol-associated liver disease is the leading cause of chronic liver disease. We hypothesized that the expression of specific coding genes is critical for the progression of alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) from compensated to decompensated states. For the discovery phase, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of 16 peripheral blood RNA samples, 4 healthy controls (HCs) and 12 patients with AC. The DEGs from the discovery cohort were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a separate cohort of 17 HCs and 48 patients with AC (17 Child-Pugh A, 16 Child-Pugh B, and 15 Child-Pugh C). We observed that the numbers of differentially expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were more pronounced with worsening disease severity. Pathway analysis for differentially expressed genes for patients with Child-Pugh A demonstrated genes involved innate immune responses; those in Child-Pugh B belonged to genes related to oxidation and alternative splicing; those in Child-Pugh C related to methylation, acetylation, and alternative splicing. We found significant differences in the expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) and ribonucleoprotein, PTB binding 1 (RAVER1) in peripheral blood of those who died during the follow-up when compared to those who survived. Conclusion: Unique mRNAs that may implicate disease progression in patients with AC were identified by using a transcriptomic approach.

GC group (median daily prednisone-equivalent dose: 53.36 mg (IQR 30.00, 80.04)) had greatest CBG differences compared to controls at dinner (25469 vs. 18463 mg/dL, P<0.001) and bedtime (26072 vs. 18255 mg/dL, P<0.001). In GC group, dinner CBG was 30% higher than lunch (25469 vs. 19977 mg/dL, P<0.001) when similar lispro to controls given at lunch.

Besides, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 disease forced many people to work from their homes. However, existing residential apartment buildings (ERABs) had been designed for accommodation but not for office works. Low-quality visual environments in ERABs, which have no shading controls on their windows, are evident in tropical climates with extremely high solar radiation. Thus, interior retrofit is significant to provide visual comfort for users in ERABs with low flexibility for modification of their facades. Different interior design variables were simulated by the Radiance-based program to analyse daylighting in a closed-plan room. Before the simulation experiments, field measurement of daylight was performed under a tropical sky to validate the results, and the findings revealed significant Pearson correlations. This paper showed that ERABs are confronting extremely high indoor daylight quantity, up to 10,228 lx, and low quality with intolerable glare. An adjustable model of internal shading, including an integrated Venetian blind with a horizontal light shelf and the window films, was proposed to improve quantitative and qualitative performances of daylighting in tropical regions. This dynamic model could be adjusted to various positions based on daylighting conditions in the buildings. By comparing the simulation results of this model with the base model, indoor illuminance levels could successfully reduce from 32% to 86%;Illuminance Uniformity Ratio (IUR) and Target Daylight Illuminance (TDI) significantly improved up to 180% and 300%, respectively;Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) and CIE Glare Index (CGI) changed from intolerable to imperceptible status. Accordingly, the proposed model can considerably improve daylight quantity and quality in the test room during different times. This study concludes that the dynamic model of internal shadings could provide efficient daylighting, by decreasing the extremely high indoor illuminance and glare in the ERABs in tropical climates. ? 2021 WITPress.

To expand the application of image forensics technology, forgery detection for certificate images that can directly represent peoples rights and interests is investigated in this paper. Variable tampered region scales and diverse manipulation types are two typical characteristics in fake certificate images. To tackle this task, a novel method called Multi-level Feature Attention Network (MFAN) is proposed. MFAN is built following the encoderCdecoder network structure. In order to extract features with rich scale information in the encoder, on the one hand, we employ Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) on the final layer of a pre-trained residual network to capture the contextual information at different scales; on the other hand, low-level features are concatenated to ensure the sensibility to small targets. Furthermore, the resulting multi-level features are recalibrated on channels for irrelevant information suppression and enhancing the tampered regions, guiding the MFAN to adapt to diverse manipulation traces. In the decoder module, the attentive feature maps are convoluted and unsampled to effectively generate the prediction mask. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art forensics methods.","output":"MFAN: Multi-Level Features Attention Network for Fake Certificate Image Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Rapid and specific diagnostic tests are essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to allow prompt isolation and early treatment initiation if necessary. Currently, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 testing but are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings with poor access to laboratory infrastructure. Point of care (POC) testing may be more feasible in resource-limited settings because POC testing is cost-effective, easy to perform, results are rapid, and they can be performed at all levels of healthcare by health professionals with minimal training. To ensure equitable access, it is important that SARS-CoV-2 testing is optimised through well-established supply chain management (SCM). Here we outline a protocol for a scoping review aimed at mapping literature on SCM for POC testing in resource limited settings to guide both future research and the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 POC diagnostics. Method: ology This scoping review will be guided by an adapted version of the Arksey and OMalley methodological framework. We will search the Medline Ovid, Medline EBSCO, Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science and EBSCOHost databases. We will search gray literature in the form of dissertations/theses, conference proceedings, websites of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation and government reports. We will include articles reporting evidence published since inception. Language restrictions will not be applied. We will use a search summary table to test the effectiveness of the search strategy. Two reviewers will screen eligible studies using a tool developed for this scoping review. The quality of the included studies will be appraised using the mixed method appraisal tool (MMAT) version 2018. Discussion: The proposed scoping review will gather relevant studies on SCM systems for POC diagnostics services globally. We anticipate that this reviews findings will guide future research on SCM systems for POC diagnostics services in resource-limited settings. The results will be published in a scientific journal, presented at relevant conferences and form part of workshops with key stakeholders involved in SCM systems for POC diagnostics services.","output":"A Scoping Review Protocol for Supply Chain Management Systems for Point of Care Diagnostics Services: Optimising COVID-19 Testing Capacity in Resource-limited Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article quantifies the rate at which women archaeologists are present and retained in university departments Drawing on publicly available data, we examine gender representation in (1) doctorates earned between 2002C2003 and 2016C2017;(2) Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant applications and awards at the doctoral to senior levels between 2003 and 2017;(3) tenure-stream faculty at Canadian universities in 2019;and (4) placement of Canadian PhDs in the United States These data demonstrate that women today represent two-thirds of all Canadian doctorates in archaeology, but only one-third of Canadian tenure-stream faculty, although not all archaeologists choose an academic career In the last 15 years, women with Canadian PhDs have been hired into tenure-track positions in Canada at rates statistically lower than men, but at higher rates in the United States Women apply for SSHRC archaeology grants in equal proportion to their presence, but men are awarded at a slightly higher rate We end by discussing the possible reasons for this gendered attrition, including a chilly climatethat is, subtle practices that stereotype, exclude, and devalue women, as well as inhospitable working environments, particularly for primary caregivers We warn that the current COVID-19 pandemic is likely to exacerbate these existing inequalities","output":"A Leaky Pipeline and Chilly Climate in Archaeology in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of unaccompanied minors (UAMs) arriving in the European Union (EU) has been increasing dramatically over recent years resulting in the formulation of EU policy directives around safeguarding and well-being. Notably, the majority of UAMs enter Europe irregularly through two main gateways to the European continent: via Italy, using the Central Mediterranean Sea route;or through Greece, transiting through the Eastern Mediterranean route from Turkey, mostly via sea. Profiles of UAMs travelling via the two different routes are significantly diverse, reflecting Italys and Greeces geographical proximity to North Africa and the Middle East, respectively. Although Italy has witnessed a decline since 2018 (Todaro and Romano 2019), the two countries have faced a significant increase in UAMs, and this has required a considerable reorganisation of the reception systems and, more generally, of their welfare systems. However, difficulties in securing adequate reception for UAMs seeking protection have persisted in both countries. Through an analysis of the impact of the pandemic on the Italian and Greek reception systems and social interventions with UAMs, we utilised a multiple embedded case study approach within a comparative analysis, to identify key changes in the main services which should be guaranteed to minorsnamely, hosting/housing, guardianship, foster care, family/relatives reunification, school integration, language, job training for care leaving, and preparation for leaving care after 18 years (Di Rosa 2017;Buchanan and Kallinikaki 2018;Barn et al. 2020). Against a background of critical reviews of the main issues related to policies and reported social work practice in a context of COVID-19 precarity, set within a wider EU framework, this paper contributes to the literature with an analysis of the current situation and the tightening of the conditions of reception, inclusion and integration that await UAMs in these gateway countries today.

Owing to a shortage of geriatric teams and the vast number of older adults diagnosed with cancer each year, a web-based geriatric assessment may improve access to geriatric assessment for older adults. We systematically reviewed the literature to obtain the latest evidence for the design of our web-based geriatric assessment tool Comprehensive Health Assessment for My Plan. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to probe the following questions: what is the impact of providing health test results to older adults in a web-based environment without the presence of a health care provider for patient-centered outcomes, including satisfaction, perceived harm, empowerment, quality of life, and health care use (eg, hospitalization, physician visits, emergency room visits, and costs), and what recommendations do older adults and developers have for designing future apps or websites for older adults? METHODS This systematic review was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) statement. Studies were limited to publications in English that examined a web-based tool that provided test results to older adults (aged 65 years) without the presence of a health care provider. A health sciences librarian performed the search on November 29, 2019, on the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2018. The findings are summarized narratively and in tabular format. RESULTS A total of 26,898 titles and abstracts were screened by 2 independent reviewers, of which 94 studies were selected for a full-text review, and 9 studies were included in this review. There were only 2 randomized controlled trials of high quality that explored the effects of receiving health care results on the web via eHealth tools for older adults or provided evidence-based recommendations for designing such tools. Older adults were generally satisfied with receiving screening results via eHealth tools, and several studies suggested that receiving health screening results electronically improved participants' quality of life. However, user interfaces that were not designed with older adults in mind and older adults' lack of confidence in navigating eHealth tools proved challenging to eHealth uptake and use. All 9 studies included in this systematic review made recommendations on how to design eHealth tools that are intuitive and useful for older adults. CONCLUSIONS eHealth tools should incorporate specific elements to ensure usability for older adults.

In addition, COVID-19 is associated with serious cardiac manifestations, potentially placing additional demand on limited regional services at a time of diminished visiting metropolitan support with restricted travel. Inter-hospital transfer is currently challenging as receiving centres enact pandemic protocols, creating potential delays, and cardiovascular resources are diverted to increasing intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency department (ED) capacity. Regional and rural centres have limited staff resources, placing cardiac services at risk in the event of staff infection or quarantine during the pandemic.

Our investigations show that when $R_0>1$, the system has an endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable. When $R_c<R_0<1$, the epidemic system exhibits bistable dynamics. That is, the system has backward bifurcation and the disease cannot be eradicated. In order to eradicate the disease, we must ensure that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than $R_c$. The basic reinfection number is obtained to measure the reinfection force, which turns out to be a new tipping point for disease dynamics.

Once in contact with the skin, the pen is a potential source of bacterial transmission and subsequent infections after ACLR. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this study was to assess whether the skin marking pen is a fomite for contamination during arthroscopic ACLR. We hypothesized that there would be a difference in the rate of culture-positive pens between control pens and the study pens used to delineate the proposed skin incision. Study Design Controlled laboratory study. Methods Twenty surgical marking pens were collected prospectively from patients undergoing ACLR over a 12-month period. All patients underwent standard preoperative sterile preparation and draping procedures. Proposed incisions were marked with a new sterile pen, and the pen tip was immediately sent for a 5-day inoculation in broth and agar. Negative controls (unopened new pen) and positive controls (used to mark the skin incisions preoperatively) were also cultured. Additionally, blank culture dishes were observed during the growth process. All pens were removed from the surgical field before incision, and new marking pens were used when needed during the procedure. Results Three of the 20 study pens (15%) demonstrated positive growth. All 3 pens grew species of Staphylococcus. None of the negative controls demonstrated growth, 6 of the 12 positive controls showed growth, and none of the blank dishes exhibited growth. Conclusion This study found a 15% rate of surgical marking pen contamination by Staphylococcus during ACLR. It is recommended that the skin marking pen not be used for any further steps of the surgical case and be discarded once used. Clinical Relevance Infections after ACLR are rare but may result in significant morbidity, and all measures to reduce them should be pursued.

To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID(50) assay within 24 h. These findings underline the importance of appropriate handling of contaminated PPE during and following use in high-risk settings and provide interesting insight into the potential utility of cotton in limiting COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Stability of SARS-CoV-2 on critical personal protective equipment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Equitable access to contraception is critical for reproductive autonomy. Using cross-sectional data from the DocStyles survey administered SeptemberCOctober 2020 (68% response rate), we compared changes in family planning-related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed service provision issues among 1063 U.S. physicians whose practice provided family planning services just before the pandemic. About one-fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic: long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) placement (16%); LARC removal (17%); providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) in advance (18%); and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or replacement (20%). Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic initiated these services during the pandemic: telehealth for contraception initiation (43%); telehealth for contraception continuation (48%); and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit (36%). While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey completion than at any point during the pandemic, about one-third still reported fewer adult females seeking care (37%) and technical challenges with telehealth (32%). Discontinuation of key family planning services during the COVID-19 pandemic may limit contraception access and impede reproductive autonomy. Implementing healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the need for in-person visits (e.g., telehealth for contraception, providing or prescribing ECPs in advance) may decrease disruptions in care.

Larger umbilical incisions enable better manipulation of forceps, extraction of larger surgical specimens, and easier exteriorization of the intestine for anastomosis. We have pursued an incision of the small pediatric umbilicus that allows for enlargement of the orifice of the abdominal opening with preservation of the natural umbilical profile. This article aims to present a new umbilical incision technique and describe the outcomes. METHODS We devised a new umbilical incision technique for reduced port surgery in pediatric patients. Our incision is made in an inverted Y shape (Benz incision), allowing for access port device insertion. The Benz incision technique was applied between November 2010 and May 2014 and was retrospectively studied. RESULTS Seventy-five patients underwent Benz incisions. The median age of all patients was 6 years 6 months (range, 26 days to 18 years), and the median body weight was 21.7 kg (range, 3.1-54.3 kg). Benz incisions were applied for various procedures, including reduced port surgery with hepaticojejunostomy for congenital biliary dilatation, portojejunostomy for biliary atresia, Meckel diverticulectomy, tumor resection, varicocelectomy, cholecystectomy, splenectomy, ileus surgery, ileocecal resection, and total colectomy. All patients were successfully treated, without a significant increase in operating time or severe complications. The cosmetic profile of the umbilicus was maintained after surgery. CONCLUSION The Benz incision is a feasible, effective, and scarless approach for reduced port surgery in pediatric patients whose umbilical rings are too small for the conventional approach.","output":"The umbilical Benz incision for reduced port surgery in pediatric patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Medical students in China face severe depression and anxiety because of their difficult circumstances, such as the long length of schooling, academic pressure, and the stress of clinical practice. Although there have been many empirical studies about depression or anxiety in medical students in China, no previous studies have conducted a related systematic review about this topic in English. This analysis can convey the general findings from China to other areas of the world. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of depression or anxiety in medical students and related determinants were conducted. Three Chinese and three English databases were searched for the review, with no restrictions on language. Articles published between January 1, 2000 and April 1, 2018 were included. RESULTS Twenty-one articles investigating a total of 35,160 individual Chinese medical students were included in this review. The prevalence of depression ranged from 13.10 to 76.21% with a mean of 32.74%, and the prevalence of anxiety ranged from 8.54 to 88.30% with a mean of 27.22%. Based on the meta-analysis, gender, grade level, residence, satisfaction with current major and monthly household income per capita were significantly associated with depression. Grade level and satisfaction with current major were significantly associated with anxiety. Other risk factors were identified and described using a narrative approach. CONCLUSION The mean prevalence of depression was 32.74% amongst medical students in China, whereas the mean prevalence of anxiety was 27.22%. The determinants of depression and anxiety included individual factors, social and economic factors, and environmental factors. More measures should be taken towards at-risk medical students based on the identified risk factors.","output":"A systematic review of depression and anxiety in medical students in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic initially started in China then spread to Europe. It is not known whether COVID-19 affects patients differently across the two continents. We aimed to describe our cohort of patients admitted to a single British centre with COVID-19 in comparison to a Chinese cohort of similar size and admitted over a similar time period to Chinese centres. We present a comparison of 62 Chinese and 71 British cases hospitalised for COVID-19. Cases in both sites were confirmed by a positive RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Comparison analysis highlighted some differences between both populations. The most striking difference is the significantly older age of the British population (72% of the British  66 years compared to only 3% of the Chinese patients, difference of 69%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 68.3% to 69.7%, respectively) and the associated significant premorbid conditions (85% of patients vs 32%, difference of 53%, 95% CI 52 to 54%, respectively). Gastrointestinal and general symptoms were more common clinical presentation in the British while respiratory symptoms were more prominent in the Chinese cohort. Mortality was significantly higher in the British cohort 14% compared to none in the Chinese cohort (difference of 14%, 95% CI 13.7 to 14.3%).

RECENT FINDINGS According to several randomized controlled trials, NIV has gained acceptance as the preferred ventilatory modality to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients, and to decrease the intubation length and to improve weaning results in patients recovering from a hypercapnic respiratory failure. Observational studies suggest that NIV may also be used to treat other conditions like severe pneumonia (including H1N1 virus), severe asthma attack, cystic fibrosis, obesity hypoventilation, and to improve the respiratory outcome in postsurgical patients. SUMMARY NIV has radically changed the management of ARF. Recently the possible applications of NIV have increased, both in the hospital and extrahospital setting. NIV is no longer confined to the ICU, but has crossed over into the regular ward, Emergency Department and 'out-of-hospital' environment. Current research is focusing on improving the quality and safety of the devices and establishing new ventilatory modes in order to extend even further the indications to NIV as well as its rate of success.","output":"Noninvasive mechanical ventilation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Few studies in the literature deal with the acceptance of being vaccinated while pregnant. This study aimed to investigate the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant women and those who are planning for pregnancy in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used an online self-administered questionnaire in Saudi Arabia between 12 June and 1 August 2021. The first section described the demographic characteristics of the study participants (five items), participants perceptions about COVID-19 (three items), participants hesitancy about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (nine items), perceived benefits of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (four items), and motivations and causes of action for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (three items). RESULTS: A total of 431 women who met the inclusion criteria were involved in this study. The study participants showed moderate scores in terms of their COVID-19 vaccination perception, hesitancy, perceived benefits and causes of action that ranged between 53.3% and 65.0%. The mean perception score for all participants was 8.0 (standard deviation (SD): 2.8) out of 15. The mean hesitancy score for was 27.6 (SD: 7.3) out of 45. The mean perceived benefits score was 13.0 (SD: 4.5) out of 20. The mean causes of action score was 9.0 (SD: 3.7) out of 15.

The pace at which the disease spread in the last 4 months, since it was first recognized from China, is unprecedented. This review of the epidemiology of COVID-19 summarizes the burden of infection, transmission dynamics, and other related epidemiological features. While countries such as China, Italy, and the United States have particularly high-rates of infection, the disease is gradually spreading in India as well, threatening the health and economy of the country. Transmission in asymptomatic cases, early symptomatic phase, as well as limited access to testing in different settings are factors that have led to the rapid spread of infection. A large case series from China revealed that 81% of cases had mild symptoms, 14% had severe disease, and 5% were afflicted with critical illness. While the mortality in China was reported as 2.3%, Italy, with a high-proportion of elderly, reported a case fatality report of 7.2% due to higher infection and mortality rates among the elderly. Being a highly infectious disease, with a basic reproduction number between 2 to 3, COVID-19 is affecting a large number of healthcare workers, as evidenced by the fact that a sizeable portion of reported infections in the US included healthcare workers. Delivering health care for both COVID-19 affected individuals, as well those with other acute and chronic conditions, with limited access to healthcare facilities and services, are challenges for the health systems in low- and middle-income countries, which require immediate measures for health system strengthening across sectors.","output":"Epidemiology of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different technological, socio-economic, geopolitical, and demographic factors have a significant influence on labor markets.

In terms of clinical manifestations, although it starts as an acute respiratory disorder, it could eventually lead to death by causing damage to many organs such as: lung, liver, kidney and heart. It has been shown that COVID-19 pathology is mediated by an excessive inflammation, oxidation and an aggravated immune response. Vitamin D is a an immunomodulator hormone and has receptors in many tissues and organs. In many studies, vitamin D was shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, since COVID-19 infection causes a cytokine storm, vitamin D can have a protective effect on many tissues and organs by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D has a high safety profile, and thus could be beneficial against multiple organ damage in COVID-19 patients.

The virus was determined to be highly cell-associated with Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells and was routinely maintained as a persistent infection (CrFK 83C4497). The cheetah coronavirus was compared with other members of the feline coronavirus group including the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) 79C1683 and the feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV), 79C1146, and UCD-1. The cheetah coronavirus was demonstrated to have a restricted host-cell range with limited cytopathic effect. Indirect immunofluorescence with antisera to FIPV UCD-1 revealed the concentration of viral antigens in the perinuclear region of cells infected with the cheetah coronavirus. Ultrastructural studies of the cheetah coronavirus indicated a limited number of immature viral particles within cytoplasmic vesicles and at the cell surface. This was in contrast to electron microscopy results of FECV 79C1683 and FIPV 79C1146, which had numerous mature virus particles within the cytoplasmic vesicles, as well as at the cell surface.

These include standardization of trial protocols; alternative outcome choices and use of core outcome sets; increased acceptance of uncertainty, probabilistic interpretations and use of Bayesian statistics; novel approaches to assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects; adaptation and platform trials; and increased integration between clinical trials and clinical practice. We outline the advantages and discuss the potential methodological and practical disadvantages with these approaches. With this review, we aim to inform clinicians and researchers about conventional and novel RCTs, including the rationale for choosing one or the other methodological approach based on a thorough discussion of pros and cons.

Citation counts and PlumX Field-Weighted Citation Impact scores were collected from the Scopus database. Additionally, AASs, PlumX scores, and citation counts were log-transformed and adjusted by +1 for linear regression, and Spearman correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations. RESULTS: The median AAS, PlumX score, and citation count were 4922.50, 37.92, and 24.00, respectively. The New England Journal of Medicine published the most articles (18/100, 18%).

Considering families' increased reliance on technology to survive, this research documents parents' lived experiences adapting to technology's outsized role alongside other shifts in family life associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we describe a 10-week study with 30 enrolled families with children aged 3 to 13 in the United States using the asynchronous remote communities (ARC) methodology to 1) understand the benefits and challenges faced by families as they adapted technology at home to navigate the pandemic, and 2) to ideate improvements to those experiences through co-design.

For wildlife populations, disease-induced mortality is likely even greater, but remains notoriously difficult to estimate - especially for endemic infections. Approaches for quantifying wildlife mortality due to endemic infections have historically been limited by an inability to directly observe wildlife mortality in nature. Here, we address a question that can rarely be answered for endemic pathogens of wildlife: what are the population- and landscape-level effects of infection on host mortality? We combined laboratory experiments, extensive field data, and novel mathematical models to indirectly estimate the magnitude of mortality induced by an endemic, virulent trematode parasite (Ribeiroia ondatrae) on hundreds of amphibian populations spanning four native species. We developed a exible statistical model that uses patterns of aggregation in parasite abundance to infer host mortality. Our model improves on previous approaches for inferring host mortality from parasite abundance data by i.) relaxing restrictive assumptions on the timing of host mortality and sampling, ii.) placing all mortality inference within a Bayesian framework to better quantify uncertainty, and iii.) accommodating data from laboratory experiments and field sampling to allow for estimates and comparisons of mortality within and among host populations. Applying our approach to 301 amphibian populations, we found that trematode infection was associated with an average of between 13 and 40% population-level mortality. For three of the four amphibian species, our models predicted that some populations experienced >90% mortality due to infection, leading to mortality of thousands of amphibian larvae within a pond. At the landscape scale, the total number of amphibians predicted to succumb to infection was driven by a few high mortality sites, with fewer than 20% of sites contributing to greater than 80% of amphibian mortality on the landscape. The mortality estimates in this study provide a rare glimpse into the magnitude of effects that endemic parasites can have on wildlife populations and our theoretical framework for indirectly inferring parasite-induced mortality can be applied to other host-parasite systems to help reveal the hidden death toll of pathogens on wildlife hosts.","output":"Disease's hidden death toll: Using parasite aggregation patterns to quantify landscape-level host mortality in a wildlife system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Poor sleep quality among college students is a global problem. Chinese college students were required to home quarantine, social distance and participate in online learning during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study aimed to investigate the sleep quality of college students during the epidemic and identify the factors related to poor sleep quality. METHODS: Study participants completed an online survey that included questionnaires about sleep symptoms and lifestyle during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study participants included 3416 college students (mean age 20.4  1.8 years). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure sleep quality, and a PSQI score >7 was defined as poor sleep quality. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors related to sleep quality. RESULTS: The percentage of college students with poor sleep quality was 15.97 % in southern Anhui province during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of the students were female (67.4%) and most were from urban areas (53.9%). Single-parent (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.39;95% CI, 1.02-1.89) domestic violence incidents 5/yr (aOR, 3.68;95% CI, 1.70 to 7.96), nap time >4 hr/d (aOR, 1.90;95% CI, 25-2.90) were significantly associated with poor sleep quality. While knowledge of COVID-19 was prevalent (aOR, 0.71;95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96) light exercise >1 hour/day (aOR, 0.47;95% CI, 0.28 to 0.78), parent-accompanied exercise >3/wk (aOR, 0.59;95% CI, 0.38 to 0.90) were protective factors against poor sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found that college students in single-parent families and students who had experienced domestic violence had a high risk of poor sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. College students who were familiar with COVID-19 and had light exercise habits or parent-accompanied exercise habits had better sleep quality.

METHODS: This retrospective analysis was conducted at an urban hospital in the Bronx, NY and evaluated adult monoclonal antibody recipients from any of our infusion sites. Patients initially received BAM but given the high prevalence of variants, treatment was transitioned to first B/E and then C/I exclusively. We compared BAM versus combination therapy as well as B/E versus C/I individually. The primary outcome was all-cause hospital admission within 30 days post infusion. RESULTS: From February 1 to March 7, 2021, 358 patients received BAM and from March 17 to May 9, 2021, 86 and 179 patients received B/E and C/I, respectively. Compared to any combination infusion, patients who received BAM were significantly older, more likely to possess  2 qualifying EUA criteria, and less likely to be vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to infusion (Table 1). Following B/E and C/I, 4.5% of patients were admitted versus 10.1% for BAM, p=0.011. There were no significant differences in admission between B/E and C/I recipients, p=0.485. After excluding fully vaccinated patients (n=14) and adjusting for age and  2 EUA criteria, combination therapy remained associated with decreased odds of hospitalization compared to BAM (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.94). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Combination therapy may be associated with fewer hospital admissions following infusion, although there were no statistically significant differences between the individual combination infusions. We suggest similar studies be conducted by other sites to understand the clinical impact of local SARS-CoV-2 variants on antibody efficacy.

The dimensions of resilience were used as lens to highlight the role played by tourism small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and extract strategies for tourism destination resilience amid various disasters. The systematic integrative literature review of 107 documents covered six books and 101 papers. Seven sources are chapters from 6 books and 94 articles from 47 journals. The literature review uses thematic analysis to extract dimensional concepts from extant literature on resilience, tourism resilience, and tourism MSMEs. Key insights on limitations and strategies on resilience emerged from the review. These addressed aspects of governance, economics, environment, and social resilience. This analysis led to the formulation of a framework that underscored the dimensions of tourism. It provides insights for tourism policymakers in drafting strategies to address limitations, which anchored on a more comprehensive perspective. As a contribution to theory, this study expanded the scope of resilience dimensions to address limitations. The strategies intend to fortify MSME resilience as a dominant part of tourism resilience.

Scholars have stated that it is characteristic for political populism to describe society as a fundamental struggle between an allegedly virtuous people and political elites which are portrayed negatively. This anti-elitist sentiment not only targets politicians, however, but also other representatives of the alleged establishmentincluding scientists and scholarly institutions. But the specifics of such science-related populism have not yet been conceptualized. We aim to do so, integrating scholarship on political populism, the participatory turn, and alternative epistemologies. We propose to conceptualize science-related populism as a set of ideas which suggests that there is a morally charged antagonism between an (allegedly) virtuous ordinary people and an (allegedly) unvirtuous academic elite, and that this antagonism is due to the elite illegitimately claiming and the people legitimately demanding both science-related decision-making sovereignty and truth-speaking sovereignty.","output":"Science-related populism: Conceptualizing populist demands toward science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent and specific post-transcriptional gene silencing process. Since its discovery, tremendous efforts have been made to translate RNAi technology into therapeutic applications for the treatment of different human diseases including respiratory diseases, by manipulating the expression of disease-associated gene(s). Similar to other nucleic acid-based therapeutics, the major hurdle of RNAi therapy is delivery. Pulmonary delivery is a promising approach of delivering RNAi therapeutics directly to the airways for treating local conditions and minimizing systemic side effects. It is a non-invasive route of administration that is generally well accepted by patients. However, pulmonary drug delivery is a challenge as the lungs pose a series of anatomical, physiological and immunological barriers to drug delivery. Understanding these barriers is essential for the development an effective RNA delivery system. In this review, the different barriers to pulmonary drug delivery are introduced. The potential of RNAi molecules as new class of therapeutics, and the latest preclinical and clinical studies of using RNAi therapeutics in different respiratory conditions are discussed in details.

Due to its easy transmission, developing techniques to accurately and easily identify the presence of COVID19 and distinguish it from other forms of flu and pneumonia is crucial. Recent research has shown that the chest Xrays of patients suffering from COVID19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography. However, those approaches are closed source and not made available to the research community for re-producibility and gaining deeper insight. The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID19 cases from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training techniques including progressive resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and discriminative learning rates to training fast and accurate residual neural networks. Using these techniques, we showed the state of the art results on the open-access COVID-19 dataset. This work presents a 3-step technique to fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture to improve model performance and reduce training time. We call it COVIDResNet. This is achieved through progressively re-sizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and 229x229x3 pixels and fine-tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the automatic learning rate selection enabled us to achieve the state of the art accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes) on the COVIDx dataset with only 41 epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly accurate model for multi-class classification of three different infection types from along with Normal individuals.

Previous studies projected delays in cancer diagnoses and excess mortality for cancer patients as a result of the pandemic. Little is known, however, on the impact of the pandemic on the functioning of cancer services. We aimed to fill this gap by using a region-wide, population-based administrative health care data repository. Methods: We obtained data for patients initiating a targeted molecular therapy during 2017-2020 (January-September, by quarter) in Veneto. Eligible treatments were those with lapatinib, pertuzumab, TDM-1 and trastuzumab for breast cancer;with afatinib, alectinib, crizotinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and osimertinib for lung cancer;with cobimetinib, dabrafenib, trametinib and vemurafenib for melanoma;and with niraparib, olaparib and rucaparib for ovarian cancer. Patients starting more than one targeted molecular therapy in a given calendar year were included only once. We estimated the normalised difference between the number of patients for a given quarter in 2020 and the mean number of patients for the corresponding quarter during 2017-2019. Statistical significance was calculated assuming a type I error probability of 5%. Results: The study included 3,180 patients. In 2020, patients starting a targeted molecular therapy were 361 in the first quarter, 260 in the second quarter and 268 in the third quarter. The normalised difference between the number of treatments in 2020 and the mean number of treatments during 2017-2019 for all cancer types combined was statistically significant only for the first quarter, with more therapies in 2020 than in 2017-2019. In a breakdown by cancer type, differences were unremarkable for breast, lung or ovarian cancer, while there were significantly more treatments for melanoma for all the three quarters in 2020 compared to 2017- 2019. Conclusions: We chose to use the rate of initiation of targeted molecular therapies as a proxy for the effectiveness of oncology services in managing cancer patients, because these therapies require that at least pathology and diagnostic facilities are fully operational. The study covered a population of nearly five million people, in a region where universal health coverage is available and where cancer care has been prioritised, by law, over non-cancer related health care services during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings suggest that provision of oncology care has not been substantially impacted by the pandemic in Veneto. Of note, label indications were unchanged for these drugs in 2020. The findings are also in line with the priority-based, adapted European Society for Medical Oncology recommendations. Further research is needed to assess whether delays at earlier stages of the route to cancer diagnosis (e.g. GP referrals for specialist care) may have occurred.","output":"Trends in new cancer treatments with targeted molecular therapies before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in Veneto, Italy: A real-world, population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Respiratory tract infections are one of the most important infections among military personals, worldwide. The present study aimed to survey the prevalence of bacterial and viral main etiological agents causing respiratory tract infections among military personnel in Iran.

Detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was performed with one step qRT-PCR method. TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR assay was used for the detection of influenza A and B viruses. The prevalence of adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were determined using nested PCR. Moreover, Bordetella pertussis and Streptococcus pyogenes were identified by conventional PCR assay. The detection of Haemophilus influenzae was performed by the multiplex PCR method. Results Overall, 145 patients were included. Among viral pathogens, COVID-19, influenza A virus, and adenovirus were identified in 85.5%, 4.1%, and 1.4% of patients, respectively. Influenza B virus was not detected among military personnel. The frequency of bacteria etiological agents was as follows: S. pyogenes (2%), M. pneumoniae (0.7%), H. influenzae (0%), and B. pertussis (0%).

There is, however, no effective antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we extended a recently developed approach, EvoDesign, to design multiple peptide sequences that can competitively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to inhibit the virus from entering human cells. The protocol starts with the construction of a hybrid peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from the interface of the hACE2 protein (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, which is followed by the redesign and refinement simulations of the peptide sequence to optimize its binding affinity to the interface of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The binding experiment analyses showed that the designed peptides exhibited a significantly stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type hACE2 receptor (with -53.35 vs. -46.46 EvoEF2 energy unit scores for the top designed and wild-type peptides, respectively).

As a result, many plastic surgeons faced challenges sustaining their practice. We aimed to investigate the effect of these national directive instructions on the surgeons and to review their strategies for adapting their practices during this new pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using an online questionnaire. It was constructed to assess the attitudes and practices of plastic surgeons in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries during the COVID-19 lockdown. It also explored their strategies on reopening their practice, as well as their plans on modifications of practice during and after the lockdown. RESULTS: In total, 197 surgeons responded to the survey. The majority were from Saudi Arabia (42.1%), followed by the United Arab Emirates (37.6%), with relatively smaller participation from the remaining countries. Over two-thirds (69.5%) indicated that the pandemic had affected their practice. Surgeons in private practices were significantly affected (P < 0.001) compared with those in the public sector. Only 39% of respondents mentioned COVID-19 testing as part of their post-pandemic surgical protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons responses to the pandemic varied. Fear and future uncertainty significantly led to a surge in the utilization of different technical means to maintain the patient pool.

Recent cost reductions and growth of whole genome sequencing has produced a wealth of data in which viral presence and integration detection is possible. While key research and clinically relevant insights can be uncovered, existing software has not achieved widespread adoption, limited in part due to high computational costs, the inability to detect a wide range of viruses, as well as precision and sensitivity. RESULTS: Here, we describe VIRUSBreakend, a high-speed tool that identifies viral DNA presence and genomic integration. It utilizes single breakends, breakpoints in which only one side can be unambiguously placed, in a novel virus-centric variant calling and assembly approach to identify viral integrations with high sensitivity and a near-zero false discovery rate. VIRUSBreakend detects viral integrations anywhere in the host genome including regions such as centromeres and telomeres unable to be called by existing tools. Applying VIRUSBreakend to a large metastatic cancer cohort, we demonstrate that it can reliably detect clinically relevant viral presence and integration including HPV, HBV, MCPyV, EBV and HHV-8.

Additionally, the information regarding the impact of chronic liver disease (CLD) on COVID-19 outcomes is evolving. Our study aims to investigate hospitalization outcomes of patients with COVID-19 on long term corticosteroids for coexisting conditions while also seeking to compare outcomes between such patients with a history of CLD to analyze the impact on mortality. We conducted a retrospective chart review across our 10-hospital network identifying patients on chronic corticosteroids (Prednisone  5 mg daily dose or equivalent dose of another steroid, for a duration of 30 days or more) who were hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Of these patients who met inclusion criteria, patients were then divided into groups based upon their history of CLD. Primary outcomes of the study looked to investigate the hospitalization outcomes of patients with a history of CLD and comorbid conditions requiring chronic corticosteroid use. Secondary outcomes sought to further investigate risk factors for mortality in our study sample. 837 charts were reviewed. 139 patients met inclusion criteria of which 34 patients had a history of CLD. Statistical analysis demonstrated no difference in length of hospital stay but increased ICU admission rate in the CLD group (41.2% vs 23.8%). No statistically significant difference was seen in between the CLD and non-CLD groups in term of complication rates and 28-day mortality. However, chronic corticosteroids patients were found to have higher rates of ICU admission and overall 28-day and ICU mortality in comparison to patients who were not on chronic corticosteroids prior to COVID-19 hospitalization. The larger contributor to COVID-19 severity was likely chronic corticosteroid use rather than CLD and thus chronic corticosteroid use should be limited throughout the COVID-19 pandemic especially in patients with additional speculated risk factors for COVID-19 such as CLD.","output":"Comparison of the impact of chronic corticosteroid therapy on critical care outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without history of chronic liver disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 public health measures have significantly impacted persons living with dementia (PLWD) and family caregivers (FCGs).

METHODS Between April 2013 and July 2019, 41 patients presenting with acute complicated (n = 29) or chronic (n = 12) descending thoracic aortic dissection were treated by the FET technique, which was the treatment of choice when supra-aortic vessel transposition would not suffice to create a satisfactory proximal landing zone for endovascular aortic repair, when a concomitant ascending or arch aneurysm was present, or in patients with connective tissue diseases. RESULTS One patient (2%) died intra-operatively secondary to an aortic rupture in dwnstream aortic segments. No post-operative deaths occurred. Four patients (10%) suffered a non-disabling posto-operative stroke and were discharged with no clinical symptoms (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0, n = 1), no significant disability (mRS 1, n = 2), or with slight disability (mRS 2, n = 1). No spinal cord ischaemia was observed. The primary entry tear was either surgically resected or excluded from circulation in all patients. During follow up, one patient (2%) died after two years (not aorta related) and 16 patients (39%) underwent an aortic re-intervention after 7.7 [interquartile range 0.7, 15.8] months (endovascular aortic repair: n = 14; open thoraco-abdominal aortic replacement: n = 1, hybrid approach: n = 1). CONCLUSION The FET technique is an effective treatment option for acute complicated and chronic Type B or non-A non-B aortic dissection in patients in whom primary endovascular aortic repair is non-feasible. While the post-operative outcome is acceptable with a relatively low incidence of non-disabling strokes, this study also underlines the considerable need for aortic re-interventions.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the anthropometrics of Israeli children benchmarked by CDC and WHO tables. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of the 1987-2003 birth cohort (age 4-18 years) from Clalit Health Services databases. Anthropometrics were retrieved twice: at study entry and one year later. We evaluated them as separate cohorts. Gender-specific age-matched median height and BMI were compared with CDC and WHO height and BMI tables. RESULTS he study consisted of 15,650, mean age at study entry 9.5 years (range 4-18). Gender-specific median heights of the Israeli children were similar to CDC and WHO values at younger ages, but were slightly shorter than the age-matched CDC and WHO toward the age of final height in both cohorts. However, gender-specific median BMI was considerably and statistically significant higher compared to CDC and WHO values consistently along the entire age range in both cohorts.

Staple mesh fixation is the surgical technique preferentially used but may also cause residual pain. Although a substantial number of specialists advocate no mesh fixations, concerns are that this could lead to an increase in recurrence rates. This study aimed to assess the safety and the effectiveness of fibrin sealant, as an alternative technique to staple mesh fixation after totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A total of 472 patients underwent elective TEP inguinal hernia repair between February 2005 and July 2011. Mesh fixation was achieved using fibrin sealant. Patients were reviewed postoperatively at Week 2, Week 6, and Month 6. Patient satisfaction was assessed in a subgroup of 116 patients using a comprehensive scoring system designed for hernia repairs, and pain was assessed using a standard Visual Analog pain Scale. RESULTS No conversion to open surgery was observed. There were two cases of major morbidities and no mortality. Three months after surgery, only three patients (0.6 %) experienced chronic groin or testicular discomfort.

Plasma endostatin, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction is upregulated during hypoxia, inflammation and progress of pulmonary disease. Aim: To investigate if plasma endostatin is associated to hypoxia, inflammation and 30-day mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Method: Samples for blood analysis and plasma endostatin quantification were collected from adult patients with ongoing COVID-19 (n = 109) on admission to intensive care unit (day 1). Demographic characteristics and 30-day mortality data were extracted from medical records. The ability of endostatin to predict mortality was analyzed using receiving operating characteristics and KaplanCMeier analysis with a cutoff at 46.2 ng/ml was used to analyze the association to survival. Results: Plasma endostatin levels correlated with; PaO(2)/FiO2 (r = -0.3, p < 0.001), arterial oxygen tension (r = -0.2, p = 0.01), lactate (r = 0.2, p = 0.04), C-reactive protein (r = 0.2, p = 0.04), ferritin (r = 0.2, p = 0.09), D-dimer (r = 0.2, p = 0.08) and IL-6 (r = 0.4, p < 0.001). Nonsurvivors at 30 days had higher plasma endostatin levels than survivors (72  26 vs 56  16 ng/ml, p = 0.01). Receiving operating characteristic curve (area under the curve 0.7) showed that plasma endostatin >46.2 ng/ml predicts mortality with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 71%. In patients with plasma endostatin >46.2 ng/ml probability of survival was lower (p = 0.02) in comparison to those with endostatin <46.2 ng/ml.

For this study, we collected 100 samples of surface soil from tree pits, parks, and other sites in all directions within 1 km of the cathedral. Concentrations of Pb measured by X-ray fluorescence range from 30 to 9,000 mg/kg across the area, with a higher proportion of elevated concentrations to the northwest of the cathedral, in the direction of the wind prevailing during the fire. By integrating these observations with a Gaussian process regression model, we estimate that the average concentration of Pb in surface soil downwind of the cathedral is 430 (95% interval, 300-590) mg/kg, nearly double the average Pb concentration in the other directions of 240 (95% interval, 170-320) mg/kg. The difference corresponds to an integrated excess Pb inventory within a 1 km radius of 1.0 (95% interval, 0.5-1.5) t, about 0.2% of all the Pb covering the roof and spire.

Mixed-effects linear regression estimated yearly BMI z-score change before the COVID-19 pandemic year (i.e., 2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic year (i.e., 2019-2020). Subgroup analyses by sex, race (i.e., Black, White, other race), weight status (overweight or obese and normal weight), and grade (i.e., lower=kindergarten-2nd grade and upper=3rd-6th grade) were conducted. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, children's yearly BMI z-score change was +0.03 (95% CI= -0.10, 0.15).

For each region, an epidemic timeline is established, obtaining a precise knowledge of the chronology of the main epidemiological events during the full course of the first wave. It includes, in particular, the time that the virus has been in free circulation before the impact of the social distancing measures were observable. The results of the study suggest that among the analyzed regions, only South Korea and Germany possessed, at the beginning of the epidemic, a testing capacity that allowed to correctly follow the evolution of the epidemic. Anticipation in taking measures in these two countries caused the virus to spend less time in free circulation than in the rest of the regions. The analysis of the growth rates in the different regions suggests that the exponential growth rate of the cumulative number of infected, when the virus is in free circulation, is around 0.250737. In addition, we also study the ability of the model to properly forecast the epidemic spread at the beginning of the epidemic outbreak when very little data and information about the coronavirus were available.

DESIGN: The current study investigated whether purposefulness predicted daily positive affect, negative affect, and physical symptoms. Participants (n = 831) reported on these variables during the first weeks of the COVID-19 response in North America. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed daily surveys asking them for daily positive events, stressors, positive affect, negative affect, physical symptoms, and purposefulness. RESULTS: Purposefulness at between- and within-person levels predicted less negative affect and physical symptoms, but more positive affect at the daily level. Between-person purposefulness interacted with positive events when predicting negative and positive affect, suggesting that purposeful people may be less reactive to positive events. However, between-person purposefulness also interacted with daily stressors, insofar that stressors predicted greater declines in positive affect for purposeful people. CONCLUSION: Being a purposeful person holds positive implications for daily health and well-being, even during the pandemic context.

Our medical school has developed and implemented tailored LMS for medical students and examine the acceptance and effects of this LMS on the medical students learning outcomes and identify factors influencing their adoption of online learning. METHODS: This was a mixed-methods study using an online questionnaire and online semi-structured interviews with first-year medical students at one medical school in Thailand. The platform's monitoring system and questionnaire data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The response rate was 55.5% (157/283). Most of the respondents agreed on the advantages and were very satisfied with their learning experience. The logistic regression showed that content quality (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.11C5.31) and perceived usefulness (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.02C7.39) were significantly associated with the acceptance of online learning among medical students. There was no association between the test scores and time spent in the course. CONCLUSION: Despite limited evidence of LMS effectiveness in medical schools in LMIC, learning on a customised LMS appeared to be accepted, useful, user-friendly, and effective among medical students. The perceived usefulness and the content quality are associated with the acceptance of online learning.

However, risk factors associated with asynchrony are not completely understood. The main objectives of this study are to estimate the incidence of asynchrony during invasive MV and its association with respiratory mechanics and other baseline patient characteristics. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We designed a prospective cohort study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Inclusion criteria are adult patients under invasive MV initiated for less than 72 hours, and with expectation of remaining under MV for more than 24 hours. Exclusion criteria are high flow bronchopleural fistula, inability to measure respiratory mechanics and previous tracheostomy. Baseline assessment includes clinical characteristics of patients at ICU admission, including severity of illness, reason for initiation of MV, and measurement of static mechanics of the respiratory system. We will capture ventilator waveforms during the entire MV period that will be analysed with dedicated software (Better Care, Barcelona, Spain), which automatically identifies several types of asynchrony and calculates the asynchrony index (AI). We will use a linear regression model to identify risk factors associated with AI.

This study investigated the effects of auxins and four explants on pokeweed callus induction. The effects of cytokinins and combinations between cytokinins and NAA on shoot and root induction were also studied. TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity of calli were screened and compared with other pokeweed plant parts. Methods: Four explants were used to induce callus using 2,4-D and IBA at 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg/l for each auxin. Direct shoot organogenesis from nodal explants was investigated using BAP, kinetin and TDZ (1, 2 and 4 mg/l for each cytokinin). Combined effects between cytokinins and NAA at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/l were further simultaneously estimated with root induction. Calli derived from the leaves were compared with other plant parts for TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity using the Folin-Ciocalteu, AlCl3 colorimetric assay and DPPH assays, respectively. Results: Results showed that MS medium containing 2 mg/l 2,4-D induced callus formation on leaf explants that provided highest fresh and dry weights. Three types of synthetic cytokinins as kinetin, TDZ and BAP were used for direct shoot organogenesis from pokeweed nodes. MS medium containing 2 mg/l kinetin was effective in stimulating normal shoots, with the largest number of shoots and leaves and the longest shoots. The combination between cytokinins and NAA showed no positive effect on shoot and root induction from pokeweed nodal explants. For TPC and TFC determination, pokeweed seeds and leaves possessed the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents, respectively. Highest phenolic content of pokeweed seeds led to lowest IC50 by DPPH assay. Phenolic content was higher than flavonoid content. Conclusion: Results suggested promising conditions for callus induction. Leaf explants cultured on MS medium with 2 mg/l 2,4-D and nodal explants cultured on MS medium with 2 mg/l kinetin provided the largest number of normal shoots and leaves. NAA did not show positive effects on shoot and root induction when combined with cytokinins. Chemical constituent screening indicated that seeds and leaves provided highest TPC and TFC, respectively, while pokeweed calli contained higher phenolic than flavonoid content.

The social science literature has already established a clear link between mental health and sociodemographic as well as economic factors; at the same time, a growing number of studies investigate the role of biased risk perceptions. To assess this role in the context of COVID-19, this study first implements survey-based measures of health perception biases among Chinese adults during the pandemic. Then, it analyzes their relation to three mental health outcomes: life satisfaction, happiness, and depression (as measured by the CES ? D). We show that the health overconfidence displayed by approximately 30% of the survey respondents is a clear risk factor for mental health problems; it is a statistically significant predictor of depression and low levels of happiness and life satisfaction. We also document that these effects are stronger in regions that experienced higher numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results also offer clear guidelines for the implementation of effective interventions to temper health overconfidence, particularly in uncontrollable situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The better you feel, the harder you fall: Health perception biases and mental health among Chinese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mechanisms underlying liver disease in patients with COVID-19 are not entirely known. The aim is to investigate, by means of novel statistical techniques, the changes over time in the relationship between inflammation markers and liver damage markers in relation to survival in COVID-19. The study included 221 consecutive patients admitted to the hospital during the first COVID-19 wave in Spain. Generalized additive mixed models were used to investigate the influence of time and inflammation markers on liver damage markers in relation to survival. Joint modeling regression was used to evaluate the temporal correlations between inflammation markers (serum C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6, plasma D-dimer, and blood lymphocyte count) and liver damage markers, after adjusting for age, sex, and therapy. The patients who died showed a significant elevation in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase levels over time. Conversely, a decrease in serum AST levels was observed in the survivors, who showed a negative correlation between inflammation markers and liver damage markers (CRP with serum AST, alanine transaminase [ALT], and gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT]; and D-dimer with AST and ALT) after a week of hospitalization. Conversely, most correlations were positive in the patients who died, except lymphocyte count, which was negatively correlated with AST, GGT, and alkaline phosphatase. These correlations were attenuated with age. The patients who died during COVID-19 infection displayed a significant elevation of liver damage markers, which is correlated with inflammation markers over time. These results are consistent with the role of systemic inflammation in liver damage during COVID-19.","output":"Longitudinal relationship of liver injury with inflammation biomarkers in COVID-19 hospitalized patients using a joint modeling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 'Therapeutics discovery: From bench to first in-human trials' conference, held at the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from October 10-12, 2017, provided a unique opportunity for experts worldwide to discuss advances in drug discovery and development, focusing on phase I clinical trials. It was the first event of its kind to be hosted at the new research center, which was constructed to boost drug discovery and development in the KSA in collaboration with institutions, such as the Academic Drug Discovery Consortium in the United States of America (USA), Structural Genomics Consortium of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom (UK), and Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in China. The program was divided into two parts. A pre-symposium day took place on October 10, during which courses were conducted on clinical trials, preclinical drug discovery, molecular biology and nanofiber research. The attendees had the opportunity for one-to-one meetings with international experts to exchange information and foster collaborations. In the second part of the conference, which took place on October 11 and 12, the clinical trials pipeline, design and recruitment of volunteers, and economic impact of clinical trials were discussed. The Saudi Food and Drug Administration presented the regulations governing clinical trials in the KSA. The process of preclinical drug discovery from small molecules, cellular and immunologic therapies, and approaches to identifying new targets were also presented.

Activating mutations in YY1 lead to tumorigenesis of pancreatic ?-cells, however, the physiological functions of YY1 in ?-cells are still unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of YY1 ablation on insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. METHODS: We established two models of ?-cell-specific YY1 knockout mice. The glucose metabolic phenotypes, ?-cell mass and ?-cell functions were analyzed in the mouse models. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect the ultrastructure of ?-cells. The flow cytometry analysis, measurement of OCR and ROS were performed to investigate the mitochondrial function. Histological analysis, quantitative PCR and ChIP were performed to analyze the target genes of YY1 in ?-cells. RESULTS: Our results showed that loss of YY1 resulted in reduction of insulin production, ?-cell mass and glucose tolerance in mice. Ablation of YY1 led to defective ATP production and mitochondrial ROS accumulation in pancreatic ?-cells. The inactivation of YY1 impaired the activity of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, induced mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetes in mouse models. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of YY1 is essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions and insulin secretion in ?-cells.","output":"YY1 deficiency in ?-cells leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetes in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early thymic progenitors (ETPs) are bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells that remain multipotent and give rise to a variety of lineage-specific cells. Recently, we discovered a subset of murine ETPs that expresses the IL-4R/IL-13R1 heteroreceptor (HR) and commits only to the myeloid lineage. This is because IL-4/IL-13 signaling through the HR inhibits their T cell potential and enacts commitment of HR+ETPs to thymic resident CD11c+CD8+ dendritic cells (DCs). In this study, we discovered that HR+-ETP-derived DCs function as APCs in the thymus and promote deletion of myelin-reactive T cells. Furthermore, this negative T cell selection function of HR+-ETP-derived DCs sustains protection against experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, a mouse model for human multiple sclerosis. These findings, while shedding light on the intricacies underlying ETP lineage commitment, reveal a novel, to our knowledge, function by which IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines condition thymic microenvironment to rheostat T cell selection and fine-tune central tolerance.","output":"Type II Cytokines Fine-Tune Thymic T Cell Selection to Offset Murine Central Nervous System Autoimmunity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundTo reduce the coronavirus disease burden in England, along with many other countries, the Government implemented a package of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that have also impacted other transmissible infectious diseases such as norovirus. It is unclear what future norovirus disease incidence is likely to look like upon lifting these restrictions. MethodsHere we use a mathematical model of norovirus fitted to community incidence data in England to project forward expected incidence based on contact surveys that have been collected throughout 2020-2021. ResultsWe report that susceptibility to norovirus infection has likely increased between March 2020 to mid-2021. Depending upon assumptions of future contact patterns incidence of norovirus that is similar to pre-pandemic levels or an increase beyond what has been previously reported is likely to occur once restrictions are lifted. Should adult contact patterns return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels the incidence of norovirus will be similar to previous years. If contact patterns return to pre-pandemic levels there is a potential for the expected annual incidence to be up to 2-fold larger than in a typical year. The age-specific incidence is similar across all ages. ConclusionsContinued national surveillance for endemic diseases such as norovirus will be essential after NPIs are lifted to allow healthcare services to adequately prepare for a potential increase in cases and hospital pressures beyond what is typically experienced.","output":"Predicted Norovirus Resurgence in 2021-2022 Due to the Relaxation of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Associated with COVID-19 Restrictions in England: A Mathematical Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most betacoronaviruses possess an hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, which appears to play a role in binding to or release from the target cell. Since this HE protein possesses an acetyl-esterase activity that removes acetyl groups from O-acetylated sialic acid, a role as a receptor-destroying enzyme has been postulated. However, the precise function of HE and of its enzymatic activity remains poorly understood. Making use of neutralizing antibody and of molecular clones of recombinant human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), our results suggest that the HE protein of this HCoV could be associated with infection of target cells and, most notably, is important in the production of infectious viral particles. Indeed, after transfecting BHK-21 cells with various cDNA infectious clones of HCoV-OC43, either lacking the HE protein or bearing an HE protein with a nonfunctional acetyl-esterase enzymatic activity, we were reproducibly unable to detect recombinant infectious viruses compared to the reference infectious HCoV-OC43 clone pBAC-OC43(FL). Complementation experiments, using BHK-21 cells expressing wild-type HE, either transiently or in a stable ectopic expression, demonstrate that this protein plays a very significant role in the production of infectious recombinant coronaviral particles that can subsequently more efficiently infect susceptible epithelial and neuronal cells. Even though the S protein is the main viral factor influencing coronavirus infection of susceptible cells, our results taken together indicate that a functionally active HE protein enhances the infectious properties of HCoV-OC43 and contributes to efficient virus dissemination in cell culture.","output":"The acetyl-esterase activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase protein of human coronavirus OC43 strongly enhances the production of infectious virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: World Health Organization declared Coronavirus (COVID-19) as a newly emerging disease on 31 December 2019.

In this study we characterize the disease course and severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with gastrointestinal manifestations in a large, diverse cohort from the Unites States. Methods This retrospective study evaluated hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 between March 11 and April 28, 2020 at two affiliated hospitals in New York City. We evaluated the association between GI symptoms and death, and also explored disease duration, from symptom onset to death or discharge. Results Of 2,804 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the 1,084 (38.7%) patients with GI symptoms were younger (aOR for age75 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.77) and had more co-morbidities (aOR for modified Charlson comorbidity score 2 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48) compared to those without GI symptoms. Individuals with GI symptoms had better outcomes, with a lower likelihood of intubation (aHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.55-0.79) and death (aHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.87), after adjusting for clinical factors. These patients had a longer median disease course from symptom onset to discharge (13.8 vs. 10.8 days, log-rank p=0.048; among 769 survivors with available symptom onset time), which was driven by longer time from symptom onset to hospitalization (7.4 vs. 5.4 days, log-rank p<0.01).

The aim of this review was to study how often and to what extent COVID-19 causes myocardial injury and whether this is an important contributor to outcome with implications for management. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline and Embase. Myocardial injury was defined as elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels with at least one value >a?99th percentile of the upper reference limit. The primary outcome measure was mortality, whereas secondary outcome measures were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Four studies and one review were included. The presence of myocardial injury varied between 9.6 and 46.3%. Myocardial injury was associated with a higher mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 5.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.48-8.80) and more ICU admissions (RR 3.78, 95% CI 2.07-6.89). The results regarding length of hospital stay were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Patients with myocardial injury might be classified as high-risk patients, with probably a higher mortality rate and a larger need for ICU admission. cTn levels can be used in risk stratification models and can indicate which patients potentially benefit from early medication administration.

Data were extracted from hospital electronic records and anonymised. Any patients admitted to adult intensive care unit had their case notes reviewed in detail and comparison made to a local risk-assessment guideline identifying patients at-risk of thromboembolic events or cytokine storms. Local hospital guidelines were followed. Patients admitted to adult intensive care unit gave written consent. Results A total of 24 pregnant or immediately post-partum patients with COVID-19 were admitted. Three patients required long adult intensive care unit admissions for severe single-organ respiratory failure after emergency C-sections. Two of these patients required proning (three times and eight times, respectively). All were considered medium risk for thromboembolic events but had rising D-dimers following adult intensive care unit admission, resulting in increased dosing of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis throughout their admission.

In general, the heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria as well as the variety of formulations to describe the symptomatology and different coding options make it difficult to clearly assign symptoms to a clinical picture. Exertion intolerance has been identified as a severe symptom of post-COVID-19 disorder. For this reason, recommendations in international guidelines are currently being revised, especially with regard to pacing. The implications for recommendations in tumor-related fatigue or due to multiple sclerosis are unclear. CONCLUSION: Against the background of a decreasing burden of disease due to increasing vaccination rates, research on fatigue should not only include viral diseases.","output":"Post-Corona-Fatigue C das bekannte Bild in neuem Gewand?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Nurse practitioner (NP) preceptors encounter stress when balancing clinical responsibilities with mentoring. Support can decrease role stress and promote preceptor resilience. PURPOSE Characterize NP preceptor resource needs and their perception of support for the clinical preceptor role. METHODS A cross-sectional, mixed-methods study used a web-based survey to identify preceptor resource needs. A convenience sample from a large, academic Midwestern university was recruited by email, with reminder emails 1 and 2 weeks after initial invitation. Survey tools included researcher-designed questions about preceptor-desired resources, an adapted Preceptor's Perception of Support Scale, and qualitative questions of preceptor needs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS Two hundred thirty-nine of 784 surveys (30.48%) were returned. Preceptors valued free mentoring resources, desired access by \\"smartphone app,\\" and identified mentoring topics of interest. They perceived adequate role preparation, clearly defined roles, supportive and knowledgeable colleagues, committed supervisors, and appropriate workload. Respondents noted the following insufficiencies: time for normal duties while precepting, preceptor resources, opportunities to share with colleagues, faculty-student time, and faculty assistance to identify student's performance problems. Qualitative data highlighted faculty-preceptor communication and compensation as preceptor concerns. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Preceptors feel a need for specific supports identified in this study. Preceptor insights inform strategies to build clinical preceptor resilience and well-being, strengthen the academic-practice partnership, and facilitate positive education outcomes. Faculty should increase communication-based support individualized to specific student needs. Resources should be developed that more fully support specific competencies and skills within NP student clinical education.","output":"Nurse practitioner preceptor resource needs and perceptions of institutional support."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan China.

However, application of gig economy in health care is underresearched, especially in areas of eHealth that can facilitate various online activities and be outsourced. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the gig economy and eHealth in terms of prospects for future health care in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Analysis of data collected using online semistructured interviews with 19 experts, including executives from ministries of health and information and communications, physicians, and health-care administrative managers was conducted and new empirical insights are offered. RESULTS: A lack of legal and regulatory frameworks and integrating gig culture into the eHealth system were identified to be the major challenges. Improved operational efficiency of health care, reduced costs, and positive societal impact were identified to be the opportunities and benefits of using the gig economy and eHealth in Saudi Arabia. A strategic framework and an effective regulatory framework are essential for integrating the gig economy into the eHealth system in Saudi Arabia and improving future health care by adopting innovative artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies. CONCLUSION: eHealth has major scope for future health-care operations in Saudi Arabia and use of the gig economy in eHealth may lead to effective management of eHealth operations.

METHODS: A retrospective survey was distributed to all operative patients (N = 767) from a single nerve surgeons practice between 2014 and 2020. Data collected included demographics, specifics of the injury and symptoms, medication and opioid use before surgery, and medication/opioid use following surgery. RESULTS: Out of the 767 patients, 209 (27.2%) completed the survey. Average age was 48.8 (SD = 19.1) years; 68.9% female and 31.1% male. More than 50% of the patients took at least three medications. More than 50% of the patients after surgery did not need medication or had significant reduction; 54.1% of the patients took opioid medication daily, and 97.3% of patients reported that narcotic medications did not resolve their problem. Patients rated the effectiveness (Likert scale 0C10) of opioid medications in general at an average 3.25  2.03. Of patients who took opioids regularly, 61.6% reported a negative effect of these medications on daily or professional activities. After surgery, more than 50% of the patients did not need opioids or had a significant reduction in opioid usage.

Some members of the TTSP family are implicated in viral infection. TMPRSS11A is a TTSP expressed on the surface of airway epithelial cells, which has been shown to cleave and activate spike proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (CoVs). In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the activation cleavage of TMPRSS11A that converts the one-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme. By expression in human embryonic kidney 293, esophageal EC9706, and lung epithelial A549 and 16HBE cells, Western blotting, and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that the activation cleavage of human TMPRSS11A was mediated by autocatalysis. Moreover, we found that TMPRSS11A activation cleavage occurred before the protein reached the cell surface, as indicated by studies with trypsin digestion to remove cell surface proteins, treatment with cell organelle-disturbing agents to block intracellular protein trafficking, and analysis of a soluble form of TMPRSS11A without the transmembrane domain. We also showed that TMPRSS11A was able to cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results reveal an intracellular autocleavage mechanism in TMPRSS11A zymogen activation, which differs from the extracellular zymogen activation reported in other TTSPs. These findings provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms in regulating TTSP activation.","output":"Intracellular autoactivation of TMPRSS11A, an airway epithelial transmembrane serine protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The presence of mediastinal lymph node enlargement (MLNE) in computed tomography (CT) of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can be associated with disease severity. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between MLNE with intensive care unit admission (ICU), mortality rates, and CT findings, especially in early-stage COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This single-center retrospective case-control study, included aged 18 years, 250 COVID-19 patients with positive RT-PCR tests. We included two patient groups, 125/250 with and without MLNE. Demographic information of the patients, laboratory findings, length of stay in hospital or ICU, mortality rates, initial CT imaging findings and CT severity scores (CT-SS) were recorded and their relationship with MLNE was investigated. RESULTS: Patients with MLNE were older (69.6111.16; p<0.001) and had a higher CT-SS (14.677.55; p<0.001). There was a significant difference between the presence of MLNE with mortality (58/77, 75.3%; p<0.001) and ICU admission (49/61, 80.3%; p<0.001). Also, a statistical association was found between MLNE with ICU admission (p=0.001) and (p<0.001) mortality rates in patients with CORADS2 CT findings. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, MLNE was 8.8-fold (95% CI: 1.62-47.86, p= 0.01) more correlated with linear opacity and 0.25-fold with bronchial wall thickening (95% CI: 0.07-0.92, p= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Mediastinal lymph node enlargement is an important CT finding that can predict the severe prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Since many outbreaks of infectious diseases last only six to eight weeks, there is a need for trial designs that can be implemented rapidly in the face of uncertainty. Outbreaks are sudden and unpredictable and so it is essential that as much planning as possible takes place in advance. Statistical aspects of such trial designs should be evaluated and discussed in readiness for implementation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper proposes a generic ordinal sequential trial design (GOST) for a randomised clinical trial comparing an experimental treatment for an emerging infectious disease with standard care. The design is intended as an off-the-shelf, ready-to-use robust and flexible option. The primary endpoint is a categorisation of patient outcome according to an ordinal scale. A sequential approach is adopted, stopping as soon as it is clear that the experimental treatment has an advantage or that sufficient advantage is unlikely to be detected. The properties of the design are evaluated using large-sample theory and verified for moderate sized samples using simulation. The trial is powered to detect a generic clinically relevant difference: namely an odds ratio of 2 for better rather than worse outcomes. Total sample sizes (across both treatments) of between 150 and 300 patients prove to be adequate in many cases, but the precise value depends on both the magnitude of the treatment advantage and the nature of the ordinal scale. An advantage of the approach is that any erroneous assumptions made at the design stage about the proportion of patients falling into each outcome category have little effect on the error probabilities of the study, although they can lead to inaccurate forecasts of sample size. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It is important and feasible to pre-determine many of the statistical aspects of an efficient trial design in advance of a disease outbreak. The design can then be tailored to the specific disease under study once its nature is better understood.","output":"GOST: A generic ordinal sequential trial design for a treatment trial in an emerging pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 strain, was first identified in late 2019 in China. The outcomes of patients affected by the virus can worsen, developing acute respiratory failure and other serious complications, especially in older individuals and people with obesity and comorbidities. Thus, obese patients tend to have a more severe course of COVID-19. Thus, this review aims to synthesize the evidence in the literature that associates COVID-19 and the severity of clinical outcomes in infected obese patients. METHODS: This protocol was designed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols Statement. Scientific and gray literature will be systematically selected from PubMed/MEDLINE, Latin American Literature in Health Sciences, Online Scientific Electronic Library, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane. The selection of articles will be limited to studies published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish from December 2019 onwards. The main clinical outcomes will be clinical severity in obese patients with COVID-19 as tachypnea (respiratory rate, &#8805; 30 breaths per minute), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation, &#8804; 93%), the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (< 300), lung infiltrate (> 50% of the lung field involved within 24-48 h), diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, need of invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and abstract data. Selection bias will be minimized by excluding studies published before December 2019. Conflicts will be resolved through a third reviewer and consensus-building. Moreover, findings will be reported using narrative synthesis and tabulation of the summaries. DISCUSSION: Given the need for early detection of the possible implications and treatment for patients with obesity diagnosed with COVID-19, the scoping review will be useful to capture the state of the current literature, identify the gaps, and make recommendations for future research for directing the conduct and optimization of therapies in these patients by the multiprofessional teams.

It is a typical zoonotic pathogen that has caused substantial social and economic losses worldwide. The relation between JEV-induced immunosuppression and inflammatory responses has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, cells infiltrating the brain tissue of JEV-infected mice were mainly identified as monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs), which subsequently differentiated into CD3(+) macrophages. Co-culture with T cells showed that both splenic M-MDSCs and brain infiltrated M-MDSCs isolated from JEV-infected mice inhibited T cell proliferation through ARG1 and iNOS. The splenectomy model revealed that JEV-induced M-MDSCs were mainly derived from bone marrow and migrated to the spleen and central nervous system (CNS). The results of the transcriptome analysis and IRF7-deficient mice indicated that the ZBP1-IRF7 signaling pathway stimulated by JEV RNA played a central role in the induction of M-MDSCs. M-MDSCs migrated into the CNS through the chemokine CCL2/N-CCL2 derived from astrocytes and brain infiltrated M-MDSCs differentiated into CD3(+) macrophages through a mechanism mediated by M-CSF, IL-6 and IFN- in the brain microenvironment. These findings provide evidence for the mechanism that JEV regulates the differentiation of M-MDSCs and thereby exacerbates pathogenicity, which represents a potential therapeutic target for Japanese encephalitis (JE).","output":"JEV Infection Induces M-MDSC Differentiation Into CD3(+) Macrophages in the Brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methaemoglobinaemia is a rare disease that is typically caused by a medication or other exogenous agent, with dapsone being the most common.

In Tanzania, the procedure is a treatment of persistent cough, and in some areas of the country, one in three children have been cut. Previous research from Sub-Saharan Africa suggest that uvulectomy by lay providers can increase morbidity and mortality in children, but few studies have examined the cultural ideas and practices that are linked to this form of lay surgery. METHODS: This ethnomedical study took place in Dar es Salaam. Ten focus group discussions with a total of 43 caregivers in three different administrative districts were carried out, focusing on their perceptions of uvulectomy, the folk illness kimeo, and their experiences with taking a child for cutting. Four folk practitioners who carry out uvulectomies were interviewed individually, with a special focus on their background, and their perceptions of kimeo and uvulectomy. RESULTS: Caregivers in Dar es Salaam typically take children who suffer from cough, vomiting and weakness to a professional health provider as a first recourse. If the child does not get well relatively quickly, some start fearing that their child may suffer from the folk illness kimeo. Kimeo is perceived by some to be an acute, life-threatening illness that professional health providers are incapable of treating. Folk practitioners treat kimeo by amputating the uvula using forceps. The four interviewed practitioners had learned their skill in apprenticeship, and two of them were third generation uvula cutters. Caregivers regard the folk practitioners as experts who offer a service that is perceived as both efficient and safe. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be made to improve the quality of professional health services for children presenting with cough, including more open communication with caregivers about the folk illness kimeo. More research is needed to establish the clinical conditions that children who are taken for uvulectomy suffer from, to what degree the practice delays professional health care for underlying illnesses like pneumonia, and the negative effects of the cutting itself.","output":"The folk illness kimeo and traditional uvulectomy: an ethnomedical study of care seeking for children with cough and weakness in Dar es Salaam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently detected virus, which can cause mild to severe respiratory tract infections.

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are amongst the most abundant, densely populated, and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the United States. Human interaction with white-tailed deer has resulted in the occurrence of disease in human populations in the past. Recently, white-tailed deer fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult white-tailed deer. In addition, we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA1/2020) and the alpha variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020), through co-infection of white-tailed deer. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult white-tailed deer are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally, we determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A isolate in white-tailed deer, as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals, and from virus present in tissues of principal infected deer, fetuses and contact animals.","output":"Infection and transmission of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha variant in pregnant white-tailed deer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Little is known about the impact of restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on self-image and engagement in exercise and other coping strategies alongside the use of image and performance-enhancing drugs (IPEDs) to boost performance and appearance Objectives: To assess the role of anxiety about appearance and self-compassion on the practice of physical exercise and use of IPEDs during lockdown Methods: An international online questionnaire was carried out using the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) in addition to questions on the use of IPEDs Results: The sample consisted of 3,161 (65% female) adults from Italy (41 1%), Spain (15 7%), the United Kingdom (UK) (12 0%), Lithuania (11 6%), Portugal (10 5%), Japan (5 5%), and Hungary (3 5%) The mean age was 35 05 years (SD = 12 10) Overall, 4 3% of the participants were found to engage in excessive or problematic exercise with peaks registered in the UK (11 0%) and Spain (5 4%) The sample reported the use of a wide range of drugs and medicines to boost image and performance (28%) and maintained use during the lockdown, mostly in Hungary (56 6%), Japan (46 8%), and the UK (33 8%), with 6 4% who started to use a new drug Significant appearance anxiety levels were found across the sample, with 18 1% in Italy, 16 9% in Japan, and 16 7% in Portugal Logistic regression models revealed a strong association between physical exercise and IPED use Anxiety about appearance also significantly increased the probability of using IPEDs However, self-compassion did not significantly predict such behavior Anxiety about appearance and self-compassion were non-significant predictors associated with engaging in physical exercise Discussion and Conclusion: This study identified risks of problematic exercising and appearance anxiety among the general population during the COVID-19 lockdown period across all the participating countries with significant gender differences Such behaviors were positively associated with the unsupervised use of IPEDs, although no interaction between physical exercise and appearance anxiety was observed Further considerations are needed to explore the impact of socially restrictive measures among vulnerable groups, and the implementation of more targeted responses","output":"Exercise and Use of Enhancement Drugs at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicultural Study on Coping Strategies During Self-Isolation and Related Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Until July 29th, the number of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases worldwide has risen to over 16 million, within which 655 k deaths.

So far, there is limited clinical evidence on the effect of corticosteroid therapy for this disease. This study aims to investigate the association between corticosteroid therapy and the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clearance among patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with mild COVID-19 were enrolled from two medical centers in China between January 13, 2020 and February 29, 2020. Baseline characteristics and durations of RNA clearance were compared between the corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid therapy groups. The independent effects of corticosteroid therapy on the duration of RNA clearance were estimated by generalized linear models. RESULTS: Of 82 patients with a mild infection, 40 patients were male (48.8%), with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, IQR 36-61). Among those patients, 36 patients (43.9%) received corticosteroid therapy. The adjusted multivariate models showed that the effects of corticosteroids were non-significant on the durations of onset to first RNA clearance [? 2.48, 95% CI (95% confidence interval) - 0.42 to 5.38, P = 0.0926] and to persistent RNA clearance (? 1.54, 95% CI - 1.41 to 4.48, P = 0.3016), and durations of therapy to first RNA clearance (? 2.16, 95% CI - 0.56 to 4.89, P = 0.1184) and to persistent RNA clearance (? 1.22, 95% CI - 1.52 to 3.95, P = 0.3787). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroid therapy in patients with mild COVID-19 was not associated with the duration of SARS-CoV-2 clearance, suggesting that the use of corticosteroids may not be beneficial for patients with mild COVID-19 and should be prudently recommended in clinical practice. However, further studies are needed to verify the findings.","output":"Effect of Corticosteroid Therapy on the Duration of SARS-CoV-2 Clearance in Patients with Mild COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Experts in the life sciences glean critical information from biomolecular visualizations. When teaching, we assume our students grasp the concepts in these depictions of biomolecules in the same way that experts do. However, biomolecular visualization (BMV) skills must be intentionally taught and assessed to gauge student understanding. To identify misperceptions and assess comprehension, BioMolViz developed a framework outlining the required skills for biomolecular visualization literacy. Over the past four years, BioMolViz conducted numerous workshops to engage the broader community in creating assessments aligned with the BMV framework, with the goal of developing a repository of validated assessments that can be used by the broader community. Workshops were shifted to an online format during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a new working group emerged, the BioMolViz Fellows. This subset of workshop participants continued writing and revising assessments remotely, augmenting the group's peer review and validation process. Our workshops and the ongoing work of the Fellows generated over 200 assessments at various stages in our validation process, with 80 that underwent at least two rounds of revision, and 27 assessments are pending review by an external expert panel. Here, the Fellows present guidelines for generating excellent images using popular visualization software, such as PyMOL, Chimera, and iCn3d. We also provide tips and tricks for designing or reframing questions and rubrics to help instructors maximize student understanding of important biomolecular concepts. Fellows crafted these guidelines using the BMV framework coupled with the lessons learned through workshops.

We investigated the cause of this ARI outbreak. METHODS: In partnership with the local center for disease control, we collected a total of twelve pharyngeal swab specimens as well as demographic information for the affected patients. We used multiplex real-time PCR to screen for sixteen common respiratory viruses in these samples. To isolate HAdV, we inoculated Hep-2 cells with the human adenovirus (HAdV)-positive samples and then carried out sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hexon, fiber, and penton genes of the isolated adenoviruses. In addition, we analyzed the entire genome of one strain isolated from the index case to identify single-nucleotide substitutions. RESULTS: We identified ten HAdV-positive students using multiplex real-time PCR. None of the students were co-infected with other viruses. We successfully isolated seven HAdV strains from the pharyngeal swab specimens. The coding sequences of the hexon, fiber, and penton genes of these seven HAdV strains were identical, suggesting that they represented seven strains from a single virus clone. One HAdV isolate obtained from the index case, BJDX-01-2015, was selected for whole genome analysis. From this isolate, we obtained a 34,774-nucleotide sequence. The genome of BJDX-01-2015 clustered with HAdV-B55 in phylogenetic analyses and had 99.97% identity with human adenovirus 55 isolate HAdV-B/CHN/BJ01/2011/55 (GenBank accession no. JX491639). CONCLUSIONS: We identified HAdV-B55 as the strain associated with the August 2015 ARI outbreak at a training base in Beijing. This was the first reported outbreak in Beijing due to HAdV-B55. Continuous surveillance of respiratory adenoviruses is urgently needed to understand the epidemiological and evolutionary features of HAdV-B55, and an epidemiological modeling approach may provide further insights into this emerging public health threat. Furthermore, the clinical laboratory data from this outbreak provides important reference for the clinical diagnosis and may ultimately aid in informing the development of strategies to control and prevent respiratory tract infections caused by HAdV-B55.","output":"An outbreak of acute respiratory infection at a training base in Beijing, China due to human adenovirus type B55"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Forecasting fields of oceanic phenomena has long been dependent on physical equation-based numerical models.

However, policy responses remained restricted to relief, for what was conceived of as a temporary problem precipitated by the lockdown. The migrant workers crisis has been treated solely as an interstate mobility issue, while the lack of wage and employment security or hazardous work conditions, which are commonplace in urban labour markets, does not feature as part of the problem description. This is evident in the attack on workers' rights by state and central governments, through a labour reforms agenda under the garb of economic revival, even at the peak of the migrants' crisis. The article uses pre- and post-Covid evidence on labour rights violations facing migrant workers in three modern, urban work sectors-construction, hotels and manufacturing-spanning the high in-migration cities of Ahmedabad and Surat in Gujarat. It juxtaposes the exploitation of migrant workers with gaps in the country's labour governance architecture, to highlight that suspension of migrant workers' rights is the central feature of urban economic growth, maintained through extra-legal and informal processes in its labour markets. It addresses core tensions and deadlocks in the labour reforms process, to move towards a labour governance architecture that is able to respond to an intersection of challenges presented by informality, mobility and social marginalisation experienced by rural-urban migrants, for enabling inclusive and equitable urban growth.","output":"Examining the 'Labour' in Labour Migration: Migrant Workers' Informal Work Arrangements and Access to Labour Rights in Urban Sectors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under the current COVID\\\\19 global pandemic, most of the world is operating online, which has increased the importance of better understanding the perceived color quality of video conference calls We performed two experiments to evaluate the white balance appearance preference for images simulating a scene from a video conference call where a person is using a virtual background Due to the dissimilarities of the light sources used for the subject and the background scene, the overall picture may look aesthetically unappealing The first experiment was designed to assess the preference of white balance for images containing a foreground subject, with three different skin tones: light, medium, and dark, and a background scene, with five different color temperature appearances, cool to warm The background scenes include famous attractions in the United States, water bodies, foliage, and a few less common scenes like a sculpture at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and a ColorChecker Observers were presented with a pair of images of the same subject with same background scene, but with different white balance appearance These comparisons were performed for each foreground subject with all background scenes Both experiments were performed by na?ve observers, who were from around the globe with no knowledge of color science and observers from the Munsell Color Science Lab (MCSL) at the RIT The results show that observers' preference increases as we go from cooler to warmer appearance for the Canyon, RIT, Snow, Flower, and Autumn backgrounds, and vice versa for the Lake background The Golden Gate background results are the most scattered among all scenes with very small differences in their scale values MCSL observers show a strong agreement in preference to warmer appearance for light and dark skin tones for the RIT scene, and neutral and warmer appearance for medium skin tone for the RIT and Golden Gate scenes, respectively To understand the relation between the background scene and foreground subject's white balance appearance, a second experiment was performed The subjects had three different appearances: cool, neutral, and warm Based on the results of the first experiment, five scenes with two white balance appearances, the most preferred rendition and the neutral rendition (original appearance at the time of the scene was captured), were used for the second paired comparison study The results indicated that preference varied based on the foreground subject skin tone and background scene However, the background preferences follow similar trends to the first experiment There were variations in the degree of agreement, some showed very strong agreement, like dark skin tone with the RIT background, whereas for others, like autumn background with light skin tone, preferences were more scattered Overall, the differences in the scale values were smaller as compared to the first experiment, which indicates that, as we present the observers with more options, the decision became harder [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Color Research & Application is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Preferred white balance for applications using virtual backgrounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medicine can be broadly divided into two fields: clinical medicine that aims to save existing patients and basic medical research that aims to save the lives of future patients.

Medical students are susceptible to these emotional injuries, but their psychological wellbeing and learning may further be assaulted by future uncertainties and altered teaching and training programs. Our objective was to find the extent of the psychological impact of the pandemic and the learning difficulties they are experiencing; Methodology: This cross-sectional study included 418 undergraduate and postgraduate medical students from all over the world. A questionnaire was uploaded in Google survey form. It included background characteristics, questions for psychiatric impact like PHQ-9, GAD-7, ZF-OCS, and questions for learning difficulties perceived in comparison to the pre-pandemic time. Results: Among participants, 34.9% of students were male and 65.1% female. Around 46.4% belonged to the WHO, Eastern Mediterranean region, 26.8% from South East Asia region, 17.5% from the region of America, 5.5% from the European region,2.2%from the Western Pacific region, and 1.7% from the African region. Symptoms due to psychiatric illness were noticed in 393 (93.1%); depression in 386 (92.3%), anxiety in 158 (37.8%), obsessive compulsion disorder in 225 (53.8%), and post-traumatic stress syndrome in 129 (39.9%).

Based on the decisions of all the players, each player receives a reward as per his/her utility function. However, classical models of BNPG game do not consider altruism, which players often exhibit and can significantly affect equilibrium behavior. Yu et al.

We, in this paper, first study the problem of deciding the existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (PSNE) in a BNPG game with altruism. This problem is already known to be NP-complete. We complement this hardness result by showing that the problem admits efficient algorithms when the input network is either a tree or a complete graph. We further study the Altruistic Network Modification problem, where the task is to compute if a target strategy profile can be made a PSNE by adding or deleting a few edges. This problem is also known to be NP-complete. We strengthen this hardness result by exhibiting intractability results even for trees. A perhaps surprising finding of our work is that the above problem remains NP-hard even for bounded degree graphs when the altruism network is undirected, but becomes polynomial-time solvable when the altruism network is directed. We also show some results on computing an MSNE and some parameterized complexity results.

This study was conducted in three local municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to determine the patterns of smallholder choice of alternative climate-smart agricultural practices and the factors affecting such choices. It was particularly crucial to investigate why adaptation of CSA practices continues to be lower than expectation despite awareness of their benefits, thus highlighting the social and cultural limits to adaptation to climate change. A total of 210 households were enumerated on the basis of their involvement in crop and livestock farming. The data were analyzed by means of multinomial logistic model, which was applied separately to individual local municipality data sets and a combined provincial data set, and it was revealed that most farmers were not being sufficiently motivated to move from established practices to adopt new CSA practices. The most influential factors in the decision process as to what CSA practice to adopt were primary occupation, farming system type, household size, age and membership of farmer groups. It seemed that asset fixity constrained farmers to continue with existing practices rather than shift to new, more profitable practices, a situation that can be resolved by external intervention by government agencies and/or other entities. Awareness creation targeting remote rural areas as well as institutions to ease farmers access to credit and information will contribute to higher adoption rates, which are likely to lead to enhanced food security and standard of living for rural dwellers as their agricultural production and productivity improve.","output":"Innovative Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) Practices in the Smallholder Farming System of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is associated with far-reaching psychological consequences, such as anxiety.

The mechanism by which the pathogen moves from the reservoir into the patient is known as transmission such as by drinking contaminated water. The portals of entry are mucosal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cutaneous. A pathogen may replicate at the portal of entry and cause disease by secreting a toxin or enter the body and spread via the lymphatic or blood vessels, nerves, urinary tract, respiratory tract, cerebrospinal fluid, over mesothelial surfaces, or to the fetus transplacentally. Many infectious agents target a particular organ where they replicate and cause damage, for example, hepatitis, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis.","output":"Interactions of Pathogens with the Host"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented global health crisis that may cause mental health problems and heighten suicide risk. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trends in suicide attempts and suicide deaths in New Taipei City, Taiwan. METHODS: The current study used the official daily data on suicide attempts and deaths in New Taipei City, Taiwan (4 million inhabitants) between 2015 and 2020 from the Taiwan National Suicide Prevention Reporting System. Interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses with parameters corrected by the estimated autocorrelations were applied on weekly aggregated data to examine whether the suicide trends during the early COVID-19 pandemic (late January to July 2020) deviated from previous trends (January 2015 to late January 2020). The impact due to the suicide prevention policy change was also examined (since August 2020). RESULTS: ITS analyses revealed no significant increases in both mean and trend on weekly suicide deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the policy change. In contrast, there was a significant increasing trend in weekly suicide attempts since the COVID-19 outbreak at the rate of 1.54 attempts per week (95% confidence interval 0.49-2.60; p = 0.004). Sex difference analysis revealed that, however, this increasing trend was observed only in females not in males.

Locating science education within the traditions of critical pedagogy allows us to interrogate some of the historical, theoretical, and practical contradictions that have challenged the field, and to consider science learning as part of a wider struggle for social justice in education. My analysis draws specifically on the intellectual ideas of Paulo Freire, whose work continues to influence issues of theoretical, political, and pedagogical importance. A leading social thinker in educational practice, Freire rejected the dominant hegemonic view that classroom discourse is a neutral and value-free process removed from the juncture of cultural, historical, social, and political contexts. Freires ideas offer several themes of relevance to this discussion, including his banking conception of education, dialog and conscientization, and teaching as a political activity.

Due to its high inter-person contagiousness, COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the world. Positive patients are often suffering from different symptoms that can vary from mild to severe including cough, fever, sore throat, and body aches. In more dire cases, infected patients can experience severe symptoms that can cause breathing difficulties which lead to stern organ failure and die. The medical corps all over the world are overloaded because of the exponentially myriad number of contagions. Therefore, screening for the disease becomes overwrought with the limited tools of test. Additionally, test results may take a long time to acquire, leaving behind a higher potential for the prevalence of the virus among other individuals by the patients. To reduce the chances of infection, we suggest a prediction model that distinguishes the infected COVID-19 cases based on clinical symptoms and features. This model can be helpful for citizens to catch their infection without the need for visiting the hospital. Also, it helps the medical staff in triaging patients in case of a deficiency of medical amenities. In this paper, we use the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to select the interesting features by finding the best trade-offs between two conflicting objectives: minimizing the number of features and maximizing the weights of selected features. Then, a classification phase is conducted using an AdaBoost classifier. The proposed model is evaluated using two different datasets. To maximize results, we performed a natural selection of hyper-parameters of the classifier using the genetic algorithm. The obtained results prove the efficiency of NSGA-II as a feature selection algorithm combined with AdaBoost classifier.

METHODS: This was a study of a pilot pathway performed at Barts Heart Centre for the admission of patients requiring elective coronary and structural procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020). All patients on coronary and structural waiting lists were screened for procedural indications, urgency and adverse features for COVID-19 prognosis and discussed at dedicated multidisciplinary teams. Dedicated admission pathways involving preadmission isolation, additional consent, COVID-19 PCR testing and dedicated clean areas were used. RESULTS: 143 patients (101 coronary and 42 structural) underwent procedures (coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, transcatheter aortic valve intervention and MitralClip) during the study period. The average age was 68.2; 74% were male; and over 93% had one or more moderate COVID-19 risk factors. All patients were COVID-19 PCR negative on admission with (8.1%) COVID-19 antibody positive (swab negative). All procedures were performed successfully with low rates of procedural complications (9.8%). At 2-week follow-up, no patients had symptoms or confirmed COVID-19 infection with significant improvements in quality if life and symptoms. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that patients undergoing coronary and structural procedures can be safely admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no patients contracting COVID-19 during their admission. Reassuringly, patients reflective of typical practice, that is, those at moderate or higher risk, were treated successfully.

The purpose of this study was to compare print versus media-based EMs given to caregivers of pediatric and young adult patients undergoing surgery. We aimed to see whether print or media-based EMs lead to greater caregiver satisfaction, comfort, and preparedness for outpatient peripheral nerve catheter and pain pump management. We also assessed caregiver preference for EM modality. HYPOTHESIS We hypothesized that media-based EMs would demonstrate greater overall efficacy and thus generate higher caregiver preference. STUDY DESIGN Randomized control trial. METHODS After IRB approval, clinicaltrials.gov registration (17-0638), and informed consent, caregivers were randomized to either media or print-based EM groups. Caregivers reviewed their assigned EM and completed a standardized assessment of their comprehension. We assessed caregiver satisfaction, preparedness, and comfort level with the content on a 5-point Likert scale. On postoperative days 1 to 2, caregivers reported satisfaction, comfort, and preference for EM modality. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare the 2 groups. RESULTS From our final cohort of 135 caregivers, we found no difference [P>0.05] in satisfaction, comfort level, level of preparedness, or discharge readiness scores between groups. After the caregivers were given both EMs, they were evenly split in their preference for print (49.6%) versus video (50.4%) based methods. CONCLUSIONS We did not detect a significant difference in caregiver preference or feelings of preparedness between groups. Interestingly, a significant proportion of caregivers (25%) did not feel comfortable managing the peripheral nerve catheter and its pain pump at home. Future studies should work to improve caregiver comfort with educational content before patient discharge.

Bacteriophages were discovered over a century ago and have proven to be a successful replacement during antibiotic treatment failure. This review discusses on the scientific investigation of phage therapy for Gram-positive pathogens and general outlook of phage therapy clinical trials and commercialization. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: This review aimed to highlight the phage therapy in Gram-positive bacteria and the need for phage therapy in the future. Phage therapy to treat Gram-positive bacterial infections is in use for a very long time. However, limited review on the phage efficacy in Gram-positive bacteria exists. The natural efficiency and potency of bacteriophages against bacterial strains have been advantageous amidst the other non-antibiotic agents. The use of phages to treat oral biofilm, skin infection, and recurrent infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria has emerged as a predominant research area in recent years. In addition, the upsurge in research in the area of phage therapy for spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria has added a wealth of information to phage therapy. SHORT CONCLUSION: We conclude that the need of phage as an alternative treatment is obvious in future. However, phage therapy can be used as reserve treatment. This review focuses on the potential use of phage therapy in treating Gram-positive bacterial infections, as well as their therapeutic aspects. Furthermore, we discussed the difficulties in commercializing phage drugs and their problems as a breakthrough medicine.","output":"Phage therapy as a revolutionary medicine against Gram-positive bacterial infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Depatux-M is a tumor-specific antibody-drug-conjugate consisting of an antibody (ABT-806) directed against the activated Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and the toxin monomethylauristatin-F. We investigated Depatux-M in combination with temozolomide or as single agent in a randomized controlled phase II trial in recurrent EGFR amplified glioblastoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible were patients with centrally confirmed EGFR amplified glioblastoma at first recurrence after chemo-irradiation with temozolomide. Patients were randomized to either Depatux-M 1.25 mg/kg every 2 weeks intravenously, or this treatment combined with temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 day 1-5 every 4 weeks, or either lomustine or temozolomide. The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. RESULTS 260 patients were randomized. In the primary efficacy analysis with 199 events (median follow-up 15.0 months) the hazard ratio (HR) for the combination arm compared to the control arm was 0.71, 95% CI [0.50, 1.02]; p = 0.062. The efficacy of Depatux-M monotherapy was comparable to that of the control arm (HR =1.04, 95%CI [0.73, 1.48]; p = 0.83). The most frequent toxicity in Depatux-M treated patients was a reversible corneal epitheliopathy, occurring as grade 3-4 in 25-30% of patients. In the long-term follow-up analysis with median follow-up of 28,7 months the HR for the comparison of the combination arm versus the control arm was 0.66 (95%CI [0.48, 0.93].

This modification occurs when the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) attaches one or more nucleotides to a target protein through a nucleotidyl-transferase reaction. The most characterized nucleotidylylation target is VPg (viral protein genome-linked), a protein linked to the 5 end of the genome in Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and Potyviridae. The nucleotidylylation of VPg by RdRp is a critical step for the VPg protein to act as a primer for genome replication and, in Caliciviridae and Potyviridae, for the initiation of translation. In contrast, Coronaviridae do not express a VPg protein, but the nucleotidylylation of proteins involved in replication initiation is critical for genome replication. Furthermore, the RdRp proteins of the viruses that perform nucleotidylylation are themselves nucleotidylylated, and in the case of coronavirus, this has been shown to be essential for viral replication.

Approximately 40% of those infected will remain asymptomatic;with a similar percentage developing a mild to moderate illness, essentially localized to the respiratory system. A markedly more severe and extensive illness involving multiple organs occurs in the remaining approximately 20% of those infected. A further intriguing consequence of Covid-19 disease is the continuing illness in about 10% of those with either the mild to moderate or the more severe acute Covid-19 disease. This Long Covid-19 syndrome has many features in common with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The concept of coinfecting virus pathogens is central to understanding several human diseases. Another useful concept is that of stealth adapted viruses. These viruses differ from the viruses from which they are derived in not typically evoking inflammation. This is because of deletion or mutation of the genes coding for the relatively few virus components that are normally targeted by the cellular immune system. It is a generic process that can potentially apply to all viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Stealth adaptation has occurred with the cytomegaloviruses of rhesus and African green monkeys. Kidney cells from African green monkeys are still being used to produce poliovirus vaccines. DNA sequencing studies on these monkey-derived stealth adapted viruses show that in addition to deletions or mutations of some of the originating virus genes, stealth adaptation can involve the incorporation of additional genetic sequences from cells, other viruses, and bacteria. These ?renegade? sequences become components within the reformed, replicating and infectious stealth adapted viruses. The variable and diverse genetic compositions of different stealth adapted viruses are likely to at least occasionally include some elements that are interactive with genes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This could lead to the potentiation of either or both viruses with added pathogenicity for the infected individual. Moreover, although the residual virus components may not be ordinarily immunogenic, some may become so if the virus levels are greatly increased and/or the immune system is sufficiently stimulated. A strong case can be made for a role of stealth adapted viruses in patients with the Long Covid-19 syndrome. These patients can be divided into those who had similar but milder symptoms prior to Covid-19 and those who had previously been asymptomatic. The former patients were probably infected earlier with a stealth adapted virus, which has now become potentiated through its interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The later patients are likely to be newly infected with a stealth adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus. The next step in exploring this hypothesis is to culture the blood of patients for evidence of infection with stealth adapted viruses, followed by genetic sequencing of the positive cultures. The testing should include patients who have experienced severe acute Covid-19 illness and patients with the Long Covid-19 syndrome. Identifying severe acute Covid-19 illness as a co-infection and the realization that the Long Covid-19 syndrome is also an infectious and transmissible disease will have important Public Health implications with regards to an expanding spectrum of human illnesses.","output":"Do Stealth Adapted Viruses Predispose to More Severe and Prolonged Covid-19 Illness?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 we now refer to as COVID-19.

Aims: To offer alternatives tending to promote the current research activities of the research groups of the electrical engineering area of the Universidad Distrital (Colombia) to increase the performance of the formative research processes, in particular with motivational aspects, development of critical awareness, and strengthening of resilience. Methods: A strategic plan was developed to increase the activity related to research processes within the academic program. It was based on the dynamics shown in the last seven years, and a set of strategies aimed at strengthening and encouraging this trend was projected for the next seven years. Results and Discussion: This strategic plan is expected to increase academic activity, particularly related to scientific production indicators. Projections for the next seven years indicate an increase in student participation related to scientific publications, the population in research groups, and project development.

Directives from the World Health Organization (WHO) against social gatherings to control COVID-19 transmission have negatively impacted religious-political partnerships. Compliance of rural communities to national lockdowns requires support from community faith leaders. Across the African sub-continent faith plays an important role within communities that display diverse religious practice. Specific guidelines to prevent community transmission and spread of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are however, scarce, complicating adherence to best practice as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). During the Ebola epidemic in Africa, faith groups played a crucial role in spreading information from the WHO to control community disease transmissions. Methods: Here we examined knowledge, attitudes and practices for COVID-19 among market vendors, of faith, in South-Western Uganda. A cross sectional study was undertaken among rural market vendors (n=248) in southwestern Uganda was undertaken using an online questionnaire. Results: Most moslems (72%) and protestants (70%) were aware that COVID-19 could present symptomatically and the challenges for control of COVID-19 in Uganda. Definitive knowledge of COVID-19 transmission dynamics was most prevalent among individuals of Protestant faith (70%). Most moslems (66%) interviewed found it difficult to comply with public health measures (lockdowns and self-isolation) while most pentecostals (64%) considered wearing as face mask to be impractical. Such discrepancies within a tight knit community and religious groupings in relation to practice shows a need to strengthen and revise policy for the national implementation of COVID-19 guidelines. Conclusion: Engagement from religious leaders to encourage their followers to abide to COVID-19 guidelines would facilitate Africas COVID-19 response to become more effective addressing key areas of non-compliance that undermine control e.g. a majority of Pentecostal Christians are hesitant to be associated with alcohol-based hand sanitizers.","output":"Religion Influences Community Adherence to COVID-19 Guidelines in Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To interview representatives from Indigenous doulas across Canada in order to document how they manage the logistics of providing community-based doula care and understand their challenges. These objectives inform the development of an Indigenous doula pilot programme as part of the project, She Walks With Me: Supporting Urban Indigenous Expectant Mothers Through Culturally Based Doulas. METHODS: In 2020, semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of five Indigenous doula collectives across Canada. Interview transcripts were approved by participants and subsequently coded by the entire research team to identify key themes. RESULTS: Our article explores one of the main themes that emerged from these interviews: sustainable funding for Indigenous doula services. Within this theme we identified two sub-themes: (1) limitations on and regulations for available funding and (2) negative impacts of limited funding on doula service. CONCLUSION: A major challenge to providing Indigenous community-based doula services is sustainable funding. Current models of funding for this work often do not provide livable wages and are bound by limited durations and regulations that are unsustainable and can be culturally inappropriate. Due to this lack of sustainable funding, Indigenous doula service in Canada faces challenges that include high staff turnover and burnout and lack of time and resources to provide culturally safe care, pursue professional development and additional training, and keep their services affordable for the families who need them. Future research is needed to ascertain potential programmes and funding streams for sustainable Indigenous doula support in Canada, including possible integration of doula care into the universal public health care system despite the jurisdictional challenges in providing health care for Indigenous peoples.","output":"The need for sustainable funding for Indigenous doula services in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background and aims: Obesity and high body max index (BMI) have been linked to elevated levels of inflammation serum markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), adiponectin, and resistin. It has been described that adipose tissue presents a high production and secretion of these diverse pro-inflammatory molecules, which may have local effects on the physiology of the fat cell and also systemic effects on other organs. Our aim was to evaluate the impact that lifestyle modifications, following a Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) program and physical activity (PA) training, would have on inflammatory biomarkers in a metabolically healthy prepubertal population with obesity (MHOPp) from Malaga (Andalusia, Spain). (2) Methods: 144 MHOPp subjects (aged 5C9 years) were included in this study as they met 1 of the following criteria: waist circumference and blood pressure  90 percentile, triglycerides > 90 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) < 40 mg/dL, or impaired fasting glucose (100 md/dL). Selected subjects followed a personalized intensive lifestyle modification. Anthropometric measurements, inflammation biomarkers, and adipokine profile were analyzed after 12 and 24 months of intervention. (3) Results: 144 MHOPp participants (75 boys52% and 69 girls48%; p = 0.62), who were 7.8  1.4 years old and had a BMI 24.6  3.3 kg/m(2), were included in the study. After 24 months of MedDiet and daily PA, a significant decrease in body weight (?0.5  0.2 SD units; p < 0.0001) and BMI (?0.7  0.2 SD units; p < 0.0001) was observed in the total population with respect to baseline. Serum inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP) after 24 months of intervention were significantly reduced. Adipokine profile (adiponectin and resistin) did not improve with the intervention, as adiponectin levels significantly decreased and resistin levels increased in all the population. Inflammatory biomarkers and adipokine profile had a significant correlation with anthropometric parameters, body composition, and physical activity. (4) Conclusions: After 24 months of lifestyle modification, our MHOPp reduced their Z-score of BMI, leading to an improvement of inflammatory biomarkers but inducing deterioration in the adipokine profile, which does not improve with MedDiet and physical activity intervention. An adequate education within the family about healthier habits is necessary to prevent and reduce an excessive increase in obesity in childhood.","output":"Adipokines Profile and Inflammation Biomarkers in Prepubertal Population with Obesity and Healthy Metabolic State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Bovine rotavirus (BRV) is a non-enveloped dsRNA virus that cause neonatal calf diarrhea. Lipid rafts are cholesterol-enrich membrane mircodomains that play a vital role in many cellular processes. In this study, the effect of cellular cholesterol depletion on infection of MA-104 cells with bovine rotavirus was investigated. RESULTS: We demonstrated that cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane by MCD had no effect on BRV binding to cells but significantly impaired BRV entry in a dose-dependent manner and the effect was partially reversed by addition of exogenous cholesterol, suggesting the reduction of BRV infection by MCD was specifically due to cholesterol depletion. Cholesterol depletion after virus entry did not reduce BRV replication, whereas affected virus assembly.

The hostCpathogen relationship in COPD is a complex, dynamic process characterised by frequent changes in pathogens, their strains and loads, and subsequent host immune responses. Exacerbations are detrimental events in the course of COPD and evidence suggests that 70% may be caused by microorganisms. When considering bacterial exacerbations, recent findings based on molecular typing have demonstrated that the acquisition of new strains of bacteria or antigenic changes in pre-existing strains are the most important triggers for exacerbation onset. Even in clinically stable COPD patients the presence of microorganisms in their lower airways may cause harmful effects and induce chronic low-grade airway inflammation leading to increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function and impaired health-related quality of life. Besides intraluminal localisation in the distal airways, bacteria can be found in the bronchial walls and parenchymal lung tissue of COPD patients. Therefore, the isolation of pathogenic bacteria in stable COPD should be considered as a form of chronic infection rather than colonisation.

In this study we explore the relationship between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional descriptive study. We enrolled 100 COVID-19 positive patients admitted to a tertiary level hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. Fifty had symptomatic disease (COVID-19 pneumonia) and 50 who were asymptomatic (incidental diagnosis). Following written informed consent, patients were interviewed regarding age, gender and sunlight exposure during the past week, disease severity, BMI, calcium, albumin, magnesium and alkaline phosphatase levels. Finally, blood was collected for vitamin D measurement. RESULTS: We found an 82% prevalence rate of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency among COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D levels were lower in the symptomatic group (18.1 ng/mL  8.1 ng/mL) than the asymptomatic group (25.9 ng/mL  7.1 ng/mL) with a p-value of 0.000. The relative risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher among vitamin D deficient patients than vitamin D non-deficient patients (confidence interval [CI]: 1.14C3.26). Additional predictors of symptomatic disease were older age, hypocalcaemia and hypoalbuminaemia. Using multiple regression, the only independent predictors of COVID-19 severity were age and vitamin D levels. The patients exposed to less sunlight had a 2.39-fold increased risk for symptomatic disease compared to those with more sunlight exposure (CI: 1.32C4.33).

METHODS After ethical approval, 60 patients, aged between 18-65 years, ASA I-III, underwent unilateral MRM, and AD was assigned into 2 groups. The SPB group received ultrasound-guided SPB with 30 mL 0.25% bupivacaine, and the control group received 2 mL saline injection subcutaneously. Postoperative analgesia was performed with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and dexketoprofen trometamol. Pain scores, opioid consumption, and rescue analgesic requirements were recorded. Chronic pain and quality of life were evaluated with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), short form-36 (SF-36), and painDETECT. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the visual analogue scale scores were statistically lower in the SPB group during 4 postoperative hours in post-anaesthetic care unit PACU at 1st, 2nd (P < 0.001), and 4th hour (P = 0.014).

METHODS: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study with cluster sampling among children 0C60 months of age living in the state of Cear, Brazil. Child screen time was assessed by maternal report and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations were used to define excessive screen time exposure. Child development was assessed with the Brazilian Ages and Stages Questionnaire. Generalized linear regression was used to determine the association of screen exposure with developmental outcomes. We also examined the potential non-linear relationship of screen time with development scores using spline analyses. RESULTS: A total of 3155 children 0C60 months of age had screen time exposure evaluated and 69% percent were identified as exposed to excessive screen time. This percentage of excess screen time increased with child age from 41.7% for children 0C12 months to 85.2% for children 49C60 months.

Besides biological differences, women have also faced social inequities and economic hardships due to this pandemic. Several recent studies have shown that independent of age males are at higher risk for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was found to be similar across both genders in several disease cohorts, a disproportionate death ratio in men can be partly explained by the higher burden of pre-existing diseases and occupational exposures among men. At immunological point of view, females can engage a more active immune response, which may protect them and counter infectious diseases as compared to men. This attribute of better immune responses towards pathogens is thought to be due to high estrogen levels in females.

HAP poses additional challenges for respiratory sampling, and the utility of sputum or distal sampling in HAP has not been comprehensively evaluated, particularly in HAP admitted to the ICU. METHODS: We analyzed 200 patients with HAP from six ICUs in a teaching hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The respiratory sampling methods used were divided into non-invasive [sputum and endotracheal aspirate (EAT)] and invasive [fiberoptic-bronchoscopy aspirate (FBAS), and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)]. RESULTS: A median of three diagnostic methods were applied [range 2C4]. At least one respiratory sampling method was applied in 93% of patients, and two or more were applied in 40%. Microbiological diagnosis was achieved in 99 (50%) patients, 69 (70%) by only one method (42% FBAS, 23% EAT, 15% sputum, 9% BAL, 7% blood culture, and 4% urinary antigen). Seventy-eight (39%) patients underwent a fiberoptic-bronchoscopy when not receiving mechanical ventilation. Higher rates of microbiological diagnosis were observed in the invasive group (56 vs. 39%, p = 0.018). Patients with microbiological diagnosis more frequently presented changes in their empirical antibiotic scheme, mainly de-escalation. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive approach might be undertaken for microbiological diagnosis in critically ill nonventilated HAP. Sputum sampling determined one third of microbiological diagnosis in HAP patients who were not subsequently intubated. Invasive methods were associated with higher rates of microbiological diagnosis.

The objective was to investigate how members of the general public value attributes beyond health gains and healthcare system expenditures; and better understand their perspectives regarding the importance of attributes typically characterizing rare genetic diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: Qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit feedback on the importance of disease and treatment attributes from general public participants from three US cities. Participants ranked attributes (scale, 1C10) in terms of importance for future research, reported their rationale for ranking, and provided feedback specific to rare diseases. Interview transcripts were coded using NVivo for thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 33 participants (median age, 51 years; 48.5% male) ranked disease severity (mean [median] ranking, 8.7 [9.0]), treatment availability (8.7 [9.0]), and impact on life expectancy (8.4 [9.0]), as most important. The impact on the family, need for equity, and intrinsic value of life were frequently provided rationales. While rare disease as an attribute received a relatively low ranking (6.1 [7.0]), 88% of participants prioritized disease profiles including attributes of severity, health related quality of life (HRQoL) impact, limited lifespan and young age at onset. CONCLUSION: Attributes including disease severity, impact on life expectancy and HRQoL, and treatment availability were all highly important to members of the general public.

In the current study, we aimed to test the combination of DMXAA treatment with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 DNA vaccination to enhance the antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. We determined that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice. We then found that combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor bearing mice. Furthermore, the DMXAA-mediated enhancement or suppression of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination was found to be dependent on the time of administration of DMXAA and was also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines. In addition, we determined that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration before DNA vaccination.

Adolescence is an important period to promote preconception health, but education resources need to be age- and culturally-appropriate. Few studies have addressed preconception awareness and knowledge among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth, and few culturally appropriate resources exist. METHODS: A mixed methods, co-design process engaging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth and an Indigenous Reference Group (IRG). Additionally, a survey was carried out to identify preconception health awareness and interest among a broader youth audience. RESULTS: Several main themes emerged from consultation meetings with youth reflecting an awareness of preconception health, but limited understanding. Youth revealed an interest in fertility, and a need for more information on lifestyle factors associated with infertility. Preconception information related to the opposite sex was seen as important as well as information incorporating current local knowledge and world views. Among the survey respondents, 46% (11/24) had a pre-existing understanding of pre-conception health. Optimising lifestyle behaviours prior to pregnancy was perceived as important for women (21/24; 88%), but less so for men (16/24; 67%), highlighting a gap in knowledge regarding the importance of preconception health for men.

In this paper, the first aim is to describe our efforts to test a simple, low-cost intervention to large numbers of women following a major natural disaster. The second aim is to outline the challenges faced and lessons learned during the execution of this natural disaster study. Methods: The setting was the May 2016 Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo wildfire in northern Alberta, Canada. Women who were pregnant or preconception at the time of the disaster were invited to participate via social media. This prospective cohort study included a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of an expressive writing intervention on the levels of prenatal maternal stress and maternal, birth, and early childhood outcomes. At recruitment and at multiple timepoints postpartum, a battery of questionnaires was administered to evaluate objective and subjective stress exposure to the fire as well as maternal mental health, resilience and its contributing factors as well as infant developmental milestones. Qualitative content analysis of the expressive writing was conducted. Discussion: There is an increasing need to develop effective, wide-spread, rapid, and low-cost interventions to reduce prenatal maternal stress, increase resilience, and improve pregnancy outcomes following a natural disaster. Though analysis of data is ongoing, we highlight the strengths of this study which include strong community participation, rapid recruitment of eligible participants, low-cost intervention and data acquisition, and successful testing of the intervention. We acknowledge the challenges we encountered including the high rate of participant disqualifications or losses due to incomplete collection of online data; evacuation, dispersal, and inconsistent return to homes; and the high levels of stress accumulated post-disaster which led to inability to complete the study.

Their role in the pathogenesis of both diseases is not entirely understood and previous studies several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the NPPA-NPPB locus associated with natriuretic peptides have been identified. We investigated the causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and AF as well as HF using a Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND RESULTS N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (N = 6669), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (N = 6674), and mid-regional pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (N = 6813) were measured in the FINRISK 1997 cohort. N = 30 common SNPs related to NT-proBNP, BNP, and MR-proANP were selected from studies. We performed six Mendelian randomizations for all three natriuretic peptide biomarkers and for both outcomes, AF and HF, separately. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on multiple SNPs were used as genetic instrumental variable in Mendelian randomizations. Polygenic risk scores were significantly associated with the three natriuretic peptides. Polygenic risk scores were not significantly associated with incident AF nor HF. Most cardiovascular risk factors showed significant confounding percentages, but no association with PRS. A causal relation except for small causal betas is unlikely. CONCLUSION In our Mendelian randomization approach, we confirmed an association between common genetic variation at the NPPA-NPPB locus and natriuretic peptides. A strong causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and incidence of AF as well as HF at the community-level was ruled out.

However, medical societies mostly adopted a precautionary approach with a focus on protective measures. Austrian surgeons considered MIS safe during the pandemic and Austria managed to keep the initial outbreak in control. Yet, MIS programs were still affected due to the postponements of elective procedures and switches to other methods by some surgeons. SUMMARY: The postponement and cancellation of MIS caused complexities in health-care delivery in Austria, whilst the evidence to substantiate this precautionary approach is missing.

Serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair, and the incubation period are key parameters in determining the control strategies for COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate surveillance of HCWs and estimate the serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 149 HCWs and 36 certain infector-infectee pairs between 19th March 2020 and 1st November 2020 in a university hospital were included in the study. Epidemiological characteristics were recorded. Serial interval and incubation period were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models. RESULTS: Forty HCWs (26.8%) were detected via contact-based surveillance. Of 100 HCWs epidemiologically linked with a confirmed COVID-19 case, 36 (36%) had contact with a colleague. The median serial interval was 3.93 days (95% CI: 3.17-4.83). Of symptomatic HCWs, 97.5% had developed symptoms 13.71 (95% CI: 9.39-18.73) days after symptom onset of the primary case.

Interventional radiology in many instances continues to provide frontline care during this pandemic and can overcome the unique challenges of safety while providing adequate and efficient highquality patient care. Objective: The aim of our study was to focus upon the detection of typical imaging features of COVID-19 infection for asymptomatic patients, performing the different interventional radiological procedures of the chest to avoid the spread of infection and thus influence better detection and further management. Patients and methods: In this cross-sectional study, we have 382 patients, coming for different interventional radiological procedures of the chest from May 2020 till 30 October 2021. Results: 35 (9.1%) patients had computed tomography (CT) features of COVID-19 pneumonia using CORADS classification. RT-PCR testing was performed in 28 cases while 7 patients showed negative results;four cases repeated the RT-PCR test and three of them became positive. The other 3 cases refused to repeat RT-PCR and were only isolated and carefully monitored. Conclusion: The radiology staff including interventional radiologists should be aware of the accidental discovery of imaging features of COVD-19 infection, before proceeding with the interventional procedure.

Work in humans and mice also points to inflammation from obesity impacting taste, altering taste bud abundance and composition. There is accumulating evidence that taste cells, and particularly their receptors, play a role in airway and gut immunity, responsive to invading organisms. Inflammation itself may further act on taste buds and other taste receptor expressing cells throughout the body as a form of homeostatic control.","output":"To Detect and Reject, Parallel Roles for Taste and Immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telomeres are localized at the end of chromosomes to provide genome stability; however, the telomere length tends to be shortened with each cell division inducing a progressive telomere shortening (TS). In addition to age, other factors, such as exposure to pollutants, diet, stress, and disruptions in the shelterin protein complex or genes associated with telomerase induce TS. This phenomenon favors cellular senescence and genotoxic stress, which increases the risk of the development and progression of lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and lung cancer. In an infectious environment, immune cells that exhibit TS are associated with severe lymphopenia and death, whereas in a noninfectious context, na?ve T cells that exhibit TS are related to cancer progression and enhanced inflammatory processes. In this review, we discuss how TS modifies the function of the immune system cells, making them inefficient in maintaining homeostasis in the lung. Finally, we discuss the advances in drug and gene therapy for lung diseases where TS could be used as a target for future treatments.","output":"Telomere Shortening and Its Association with Cell Dysfunction in Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) utilize proteases to enter host cells. Upon receptor binding, the spike (S) proteins of both viruses are activated for membrane fusion by proteases, such as trypsin, present in the environment, facilitating virus entry from the cell surface. In contrast, in the absence of extracellular proteases, these viruses can enter cells via an endosomal pathway and utilize endosomal cathepsins for S protein activation. We demonstrate that the MHV-2 S protein uses multistep conformational changes for membrane fusion. After interaction with a soluble form of the MHV receptor (CEACAM1a), the metastable form of S protein is converted to a stable trimer, as revealed by mildly denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Liposome-binding assays indicate that the receptor-bound virions are associated with the target membrane through hydrophobic interactions. The exposure of receptor-bound S protein to trypsin or cathepsin L (CPL) induces the formation of six-helix bundles (6HB), the final conformation. This trypsin- or CPL-mediated conversion to 6HB can be blocked by a heptad repeat peptide known to block the formation of 6HB. Although trypsin treatment enabled receptor-bound MHV-2 to enter from the cell surface, CPL failed to do so. Interestingly, consecutive treatment with CPL and then chlorpromazine enabled a portion of the virus to enter from cell surface. These results suggest that trypsin suffices for the induction of membrane fusion of receptor-primed S protein, but an additional unidentified cellular factor is required to trigger membrane fusion by CPL.","output":"Two-step conformational changes in a coronavirus envelope glycoprotein mediated by receptor binding and proteolysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to obtain the birth prevalence of cleft lips and/or cleft palates (CLP) and to identify potential associated risk factors in the population of the Northeast (NE) region of Thailand. METHODS: The data were collected from October 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013, for infant deliveries with nonsyndromic CLP in all hospitals of 4 provinces in the region. Workshops were conducted to establish diagnostic criteria, treatment guidelines, referral systems, data collection, and data reporting. All patients included in this study, including a case (the child born with cleft lip and palate [CLP]) and 2 control cases (2 following children born without CLP in the same hospital), completed a questionnaire regarding demographics, cleft characteristics, and factors of interest such as alcohol intake, smoking, vitamin use, and medication. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio were presented for the magnitude of associations between proposed risk factors and CLP along with 95% CIs. RESULTS: The overall birth prevalence of CLP was 1.93 per 1000 live births. There was a significant difference in percentages of infants with low birth weights (P = .03), family history of CLP (P = .01) in cases than controls. Mothers who took self-medication or a menstrual regulation supplement were more likely to have the child with CLP (P = .01 adjusted). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CLP in the NE Thailand was high.

In this study, we investigated the correlation between a SARS-CoV-2 signal derived from wastewater sampling and COVID-19 incidence values monitored by means of individual testing programs. The dataset used in the study is composed of timelines (duration approx. five months) of both signals at four wastewater treatment plants across Austria, two of which drain large communities and the other two drain smaller communities. Eight regression models were investigated to predict the viral incidence under varying data inputs and pre-processing methods. It was found that population-based normalisation and smoothing as a pre-processing of the viral load data significantly influence the fitness of the regression models. Moreover, the time latency lag between the wastewater data and the incidence derived from the testing program was found to vary between 2 and 7 days depending on the time period and site. It was found to be necessary to take such a time lag into account by means of multivariate modelling to boost the performance of the regression. Comparing the models, no outstanding one could be identified as all investigated models are revealing a sufficient correlation for the task.

Considering party manifestos between 1991 and 2018, we ask: how have Quebec major political parties treated immigration policy issues over time? We argue that Quebecs immigration partisan space is organised by a liberal-restrictive immigration policy continuum and a jurisdictional axis. Mapping provincial political parties positions, we document a stable clustering towards liberal policy positions but a clear cleavage on the jurisdictional axis. We show that the emergence in 2012 of a highly moderate centre right partythe Coalition Avenir Qubecbroke with these established positions and drove a politicisation of the issue.

Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized with CAP to a teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Etiology was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate multiplex PCR. Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4C41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17C5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40C5.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48C6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03C9.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72C7.50]).

Zeaxanthin, a crucial carotenoid, positively regulates plant abiotic stress responses. Therefore, this study investigated the regulatory mechanisms of zeaxanthin-induced chilling tolerance in peppers. The results indicated that the pretreatment with zeaxanthin effectively alleviated chilling damage in pepper leaves and increased the plant fresh weight and photosynthetic pigment content under chilling stress. Additionally, alterations in photosynthetic chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves after zeaxanthin treatment highlighted the participation of zeaxanthin in improving the photosystem response to chilling stress by heightening the quenching of excess excitation energy and protection of the photosynthetic electron transport system. In chill-stressed plants, zeaxanthin treatment also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity and transcript expression, and reduced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2?-) content, resulting in a decrease in biological membrane damage. Additionally, exogenous zeaxanthin upregulated the expression levels of key genes encoding -carotene hydroxylase (CaCA1, CaCA2), zeaxanthin epoxidase (CaZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (CaVDE), and promoted the synthesis of endogenous zeaxanthin during chilling stress. Collectively, exogenous zeaxanthin pretreatment enhances plant tolerance to chilling by improving the photosystem process, increasing oxidation resistance, and inducing alterations in endogenous zeaxanthin metabolism.","output":"Alleviating damage of photosystem and oxidative stress from chilling stress with exogenous zeaxanthin in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seedlings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a pandemic affecting billions of people worldwide. Apart from the extreme global economic impact, the pandemic will likely have a lasting impact through long-term sequelae not yet fully understood. Fully understanding the mechanisms driving the various symptoms and sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection will allow for the eventual development of therapeutics to prevent or treat such life-altering symptoms. In this study, we developed a behavioral test of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. We find a moderately strong correlation between the level of anosmia and the score of histological damage within the olfactory epithelium. We also find a moderately strong correlation between the level of anosmia and the thickness of the olfactory epithelium, previously demonstrated to be severely damaged upon infection. Thus, this food-searching behavioral test can act as a simple and effective screening method in a hamster model for various therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2-related anosmia.","output":"Recovery of anosmia in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with repair of the olfactory epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current in vitro models have significant limitations for new respiratory disease research and rapid drug repurposing. Lung on a chip (LOAC) technology offers a potential solution to these problems. However, these devices typically are fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has small hydrophobic molecule absorption, which hinders the application of this technology in drug repurposing for respiratory diseases. Off-stoichiometry thiolCene (OSTE) is a promising alternative material class to PDMS. Therefore, this study aimed to test OSTE as an alternative material for LOAC prototype development and compare it to PDMS. We tested OSTE material for light transmission, small molecule absorption, inhibition of enzymatic reactions, membrane particle, and fluorescent dye absorption. Next, we microfabricated LOAC devices from PDMS and OSTE, functionalized with human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and A549 cell lines, and analyzed them with immunofluorescence. We demonstrated that compared to PDMS, OSTE has similar absorption of membrane particles and effect on enzymatic reactions, significantly lower small molecule absorption, and lower light transmission. Consequently, the immunofluorescence of OSTE LOAC was significantly impaired by OSTE optical properties. In conclusion, OSTE is a promising material for LOAC, but optical issues should be addressed in future LOAC prototypes to benefit from the material properties.","output":"Lung on a Chip Development from Off-Stoichiometry ThiolCEne Polymer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: RNA viruses and especially coronaviruses could act inside host cells not only by building their own proteins, but also by perturbing the cell metabolism.

Compared to the rise in cases, there are few Covid-19 testing kits available. Due to the lack of testing kits for the public, it is useful to implement an automated AI-based E-health decision support system as a potential alternative method for Covid-19 detection. As per medical examinations, the symptoms of Covid-19 could be somewhat analogous to those of pneumonia, though certainly not identical. Considering the enormous number of cases of Covid-19 and pneumonia, and the complexity of the related images stored, the data pertaining to this problem of automated detection constitutes big data. With rapid advancements in medical imaging, the development of intelligent predictive and diagnostic tools have also increased at a rapid rate. Data mining and machine learning techniques are widely accepted to aid medical diagnosis. In this paper, a huge data set of X-ray images from patients with common bacterial pneumonia, confirmed Covid-19 disease, and normal healthy cases are utilized for AI-based decision support in detecting the Coronavirus disease. The transfer learning approach, which enables us to learn from a smaller set of samples in a problem and transfer the discovered knowledge to a larger data set, is employed in this study. We consider transfer learning using three different models that are pre-trained on several images from the ImageNet source. The models deployed here are VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet101.

People of these two countries perceive threats of COVID-19 differently, influenced by their knowledge of the disease, healthcare infrastructure and facilities, and social security. We conducted a survey study with the primary objective of comparing COVID-19 related stress and their predictors between India and USA. Our secondary objectives were to compare knowledge on COVID-19, perception about healthcare facilities, and adherence to preventive COVID-19 recommendations between US and Indian participants. Methodology: A public survey was designed via Redcap, and the survey link was sent out using social media platforms, Research-match and Studyfinder. The data was collected between June to October 2020, with a focus on comparative analyses. Stress-related questions were based on confinement, job-loss, healthcare facility, contracting COVID-19, and risk of death. Knowledge related questionnaire tested the understanding of spreading, prevention, treatment of COVID-19. We also asked about preventive practices like handwashing, facemask, and social distancing, to understand whether disease perception could influence adherence to preventive guidelines. 'Factor analysis' function in 'SPSS' was used to summarize the questionnaire (Likert scale) on stress, knowledge, and guideline adherence into combined normalized scales (0-10), for each of those three categories. T-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to compare between US and Indian participants, as applicable. Results: Redcap captured 531 and 242 responses from the USA and India, respectively. The stress score (meanSD) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001?) in Indian participants (Ind-P) (6.681.78), compared to US participants (US-P) (5.302.01). Among the sociodemographic factors, sex (p=0.035), age (p=0.016), race (p=0.002) and education level (p=0.025) were significant predictors of stress in US-P, while age(p=0.008) was the only stress predictor in Ind-P. US-P demonstrated better knowledge on COVID-19 compared to Ind-P (7.801.30 vs. 5.261.98, p&lt;0.001?). Ind-P were more adherent to preventive guidelines than US-P (9.061.23 vs. 8.661.82, p&lt;0.002?). Ind-P, compared to US-P, consistently reported inadequate healthcare facilities, including hospital, ventilator availability, and administrative initiative (p&lt;0.001?, p&lt;0.001?, and p=0.008? based on Mann-Whitney test). Participants attitude towards future participation in clinical trials were also varied, as US-P were more willing to participate in the ongoing vaccine(p=0.028) and drug trials(p=0.03) compared to Ind-P. Conclusion: Ind-P compared to US-P demonstrated higher stress level, lower knowledge score. Higher stress scores in Indians could be related to dissatisfaction over available healthcare facilities and might have encouraged them to adhere to the preventive measure better than US-based participants.","output":"A comparative analysis of COVID-19 related perception and predictors of stress in india versus usa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study concerns the clinicopathologic correlation of 50 decedents of 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid\\\\19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome\\\\coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) from among 250 reported patients succumbing to Covid\\\\19 illness (1\\\\7) who underwent detailed postmortem neuropathological studies.

Since 2005, TSWV emerged as an economically important virus of processing tomatoes in the Central Valley of California, in part due to increased populations of the primary thrips vector, western flower thrips (WFT; Frankliniella occidentalis). To develop an understanding of the epidemiology of TSWV in this region, population densities of WFT and incidence of TSWV were monitored in California's processing tomato transplant-producing greenhouses and associated open fields from 2007 to 2013. Thrips were monitored with yellow sticky cards and in tomato flowers, whereas TSWV incidence was assessed with indicator plants and field surveys for virus symptoms. All thrips identified from processing tomato fields were WFT, and females were three-fold more abundant on sticky cards than males. Symptoms of TSWV infection were observed in all monitored processing tomato fields. Incidences of TSWV ranged from 1 to 20%, with highest incidence found in late-planted fields. There was no single primary inoculum source, and inoculum sources for thrips/TSWV varied depending on the production region. These results allowed us to develop a model for TSWV infection of processing tomatoes in the Central Valley of California. The model predicts that low levels of primary TSWV inoculum are amplified in early-planted tomatoes and other susceptible crops leading to highest levels of infection in later-planted fields, especially those with high thrips populations. Based upon these findings, an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for TSWV in processing tomatoes in California was devised. This IPM strategy focuses on strategic field placement (identification of high-risk situations), planting TSWV- and thrips-free transplants, planting resistant varieties, monitoring for TSWV symptoms and thrips, roguing infected plants, thrips management targeting early generations, extensive sanitation after harvest, and strategic cropping to avoid overlap with winter bridge crops.","output":"Development of an IPM Strategy for Thrips and Tomato spotted wilt virus in Processing Tomatoes in the Central Valley of California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amid COVID-19, there have been rampant increase in the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits by frontline health and sanitation communities, to reduce the likelihoods of infections. The used PPE kits, potentially being infectious, pose a threat to human health, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems, if not scientifically handled and disposed. However, with stressed resources on treatment facilities and lack of training to the health and sanitation workers, it becomes vital to vet different options for PPE kits disposal, to promote environmentally sound management of waste. Given the various technology options available for treatment and disposal of COVID-19 patients waste, Life Cycle Assessment, i.e., cradle to grave analysis of PPE provides essential guidance in identifying the environmentally sound alternatives. In the present work, Life Cycle Assessment of PPE kits has been performed using GaBi version 8.7 under two disposal scenarios, namely landfill and incineration (both centralized and decentralized) for six environmental impact categories covering overall impacts on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which includes Global Warming Potential (GWP), Human Toxicity Potential (HTP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Acidification Potential (AP), Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (FAETP) and Photochemical Ozone Depletion Potential (POCP). Considering the inventories of PPE kits, disposal of PPE bodysuit has the maximum impact, followed by gloves and goggles, in terms of GWP. The use of metal strips in face-mask has shown the most significant HTP impact. The incineration process (centralized?3816 kg CO2 eq. and decentralized?3813 kg CO2 eq.) showed high GWP but significantly reduced impact w.r.t. AP, EP, FAETP, POCP and HTP, when compared to disposal in a landfill, resulting in the high overall impact of landfill disposal compared to incineration. The decentralized incineration has emerged as environmentally sound management option compared to centralized incinerator among all the impact categories, also the environmental impact by transportation is significant (2.76 kg CO2 eq.) and cannot be neglected for long-distance transportation.

Subsequently, the diagnostic value of serum miR-592 was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Both the assessment of clinical samples and bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that miR-592 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the tissues and serum of patients with CRC, suggesting that elevated serum miR-592 may be tumor-derived. ROC analysis indicated that serum miR-592 levels may differentiate patients with early stage CRC and advanced adenoma from healthy individuals, with area under the curve values of 0.801 and 0.747, respectively.

Robust expansions of central memory (T(CM)) and effector memory (T(EM)) CD4 and CD8 T cells were also measured. An enhanced recruitment of NP-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells was observed in the lungs of SAM(NP)-immunized mice after influenza infection that paralleled with reduced lung viral titers and pathology, and increased survival after homologous and heterosubtypic influenza challenge. Finally, we demonstrated for the first time that the co-administration of RNA (SAM(M1-NP)) and protein (monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (MIIV)) was feasible, induced simultaneously NP-, M1- and HA-specific T cells and HA-specific neutralizing antibodies, and enhanced MIIV efficacy against a heterologous challenge.

To determine if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (as determined by at least one positive commercial antibody test performed in a laboratory) in healthcare workers confers future immunity to reinfection, we are undertaking a large-scale prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare staff across the United Kingdom. METHODS Population and Setting: staff members of healthcare organisations working in hospitals in the UK At recruitment, participants will have their serum tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and using these results will be initially allocated to either antibody positive or antibody negative cohorts. Participants will undergo antibody and viral RNA testing at 1-4 weekly intervals throughout the study period, and based on these results may move between cohorts. Any results from testing undertaken for other reasons (e.g. symptoms, contact tracing etc.) or prior to study entry will also be included. Individuals will complete enrolment and fortnightly questionnaires on exposures and symptoms. Follow-up will be for at least 12 months from study entry. Outcome: The primary outcome of interest is a reinfection with SARS -CoV-2 during the study period. Secondary outcomes will include incidence and prevalence (both RNA and antibody) of SARS-CoV-2, viral genomics, viral culture, symptom history and antibody/neutralising antibody titres.

Here, we show that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone activates the EC inflammatory phenotype in a manner dependent on integrin 5{beta}1 signaling. Incubation of human umbilical vein EC with whole spike, its receptor-binding domain, or the integrin-binding tripeptide RGD induced the nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B and enhanced the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules VCAM1 and ICAM1, the adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes, and the permeability of the monolayer.

Viral cell tropism is a key determinant of viral pathogenesis, but the tropism of RV is currently poorly understood. We analyzed various human cell lines and determined that RV only establishes an infection efficiently in particular non-immune cell lines. To establish an infection the host cells must be susceptible and permissible. To assess the susceptibility of individual cell lines, we generated a pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus bearing RV envelope proteins (VSV-RV/CE2E1). VSV-RV/CE2E1 entered cells in an RV envelope protein-dependent manner, and thus the infection was neutralized completely by an RV-specific antibody. The infection was Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibited by endosomal acidification inhibitors, further confirming the dependency on RV envelope proteins for the VSV-RV/CE2E1 infection. Human non-immune cell lines were mostly susceptible to VSV-RV/CE2E1, while immune cell lines were much less susceptible than non-immune cell lines. However, susceptibility of immune cells to VSV-RV/CE2E1 was increased upon stimulation of these cells.

It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters into the host cell through interaction between conserved residues of viral spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is highly expressed in host's cardiac and pulmonary cells and finally transmembrane protease, serine-2 (TMPRSS2), helps in priming of the surface protein. Subsequently, symptom related to multi organ involvement is primarily contributed by cytokine storm. Although various clinical trials are being conducted on renin- angiotensin- system inhibitor, till to date there is no standard treatment protocol approved for critically ill COVID-19 positive cases with pre-existing hypertension. Recently, several studies are carried out to document the safety and efficacy outcome of mesenchymal stem cell transplantation based on its immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. Therefore, identification of future novel therapeutics in the form of mesenchymal stem cell either alone or in combination with pharmacological approach could be recommended for combating SARS-CoV-2 which might be dreadful to debilitating elderly people.

The coronavirus soon spread across the globe in the next few weeks. To curb the spread of coronavirus, stringent measures such as lockdown and social distancing were enforced resulted in a declining of cases in various countries. However, unlocking, relaxation of preventive measures, and changing human behaviors led to a drastic increase in the number of COVID-19 cases resulting in the second wave of transmission. This resulted in reimposing of lockdown measures in countries such as Nepal, Italy, France, Netherland, and Germany. At present, the virus has affected over 110.7 million peoples and over 2.4 million deaths across the world, with India having the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases, following the United States of America. Furthermore, a cross-sectional view of the disease states several new strains being reported across the globe at one end and at another end there is rolling out of vaccine against COVID-19. There is still uncertainty related to curbing of the pandemic as effect of vaccine on new strains is undetermined.

Design and Method: MTurk participants (n=192;50% women) recruited from a pre-pandemic study were followed across five timepoints between April and August 2020. IU, mental health symptoms (i.e., worry, COVID-19 fears, and trauma-related symptoms), and perceived and objective measures of COVID-19 threat were assessed. Results: On average, worry and trauma-related symptoms were not elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, and scores remained stable across time. Higher baseline IU and mental health symptoms did in fact act as vulnerabilities, predicting more worry, trauma-related symptoms, COVID-19 fears, and perceptions of threat. Perceived threat did not seem well-calibrated with objective threat, with measures of the two constructs showing no associations or even inverse associations.

The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including universal masking, hand hygiene, and social distancing not only resulted in a decline in reported SARS-CoV-2 cases but also contributed to the decline in the non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection-related hospital utilization. Moreover, it also led to the decreased incidence of previous commonly encountered respiratory pathogens, such as influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although antimicrobial agents are essential for treating patients with COVID-19 co-infection, the prescribing of antibiotics was significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection, which indicated the overuse of antibiotics or unnecessary antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, inappropriate antimicrobial exposure may drive the selection of drug-resistant microorganisms, and the disruption of infection control in COVID-19 setting measures may result in the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). In conclusion, NPIs could be effective in preventing respiratory tract infection and changing the microbiologic distribution of respiratory pathogens; however, we should continue with epidemiological surveillance to establish updated information, antimicrobial stewardship programs for appropriate use of antibiotic, and infection control prevention interventions to prevent the spread of MDROs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Changing Epidemiology of Respiratory Tract Infection during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last months, as oncology specialists, we have frequently been contacted for estimating prognosis for cancer patients affected by COVID-19 infection.

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% corresponding confidence intervals (95% CIs) were analyzed to evaluate the strength of the relationship. Results A total of 8 studies involving 6694 patients (2559 cases and 4135 controls) were included. Pooled analysis showed a trend of increased risk between the TNF- rs1800629 variant and AKI (A vs. G: OR [95%CI] = 1.33 [0.98-1.81]) among the overall population. Ethnicity-stratified analysis indicated that the TNF- rs1800629 variant was a risk factor for Asians (OR [95%CI] = 1.93 [1.59-2.35]) while it is not for Caucasians (OR [95%CI] = 1.04 [0.91-1.20]).

The existing methods for crop disease recognition mainly focus on accuracy while ignoring the algorithms robustness. In practice, the acquired images are often accompanied by various noises. These noises lead to a huge challenge for improving the robustness and accuracy of the recognition algorithm. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a residual self-calibration and self-attention aggregation network (RCAA-Net) for crop disease recognition in actual scenarios. The proposed RCAA-Net is composed of three main modules: (1) multi-scale residual module, (2) feedback self-calibration module, and (3) self-attention aggregation module. Specifically, the multi-scale residual module is designed to learn multi-scale features and provide both global and local information for the appearance of the disease to improve the performance of the model. The feedback self-calibration is proposed to improve the robustness of the model by suppressing the background noise in the original deep features. The self-attention aggregation module is introduced to further improve the robustness and accuracy of the model by capturing multi-scale information in different semantic spaces. The experimental results on the challenging 2018ai_challenger crop disease recognition dataset show that the proposed RCAA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on robustness and accuracy for crop disease recognition in actual scenarios.","output":"Residual Self-Calibration and Self-Attention Aggregation Network for Crop Disease Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on childrens behavior and their parents mental health in China.

The performance of the proposed prediction framework is determined by using three machine learning regression algorithms, namely Polynomial Regression (PR), Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest (RF) Regression. The results show a comparative analysis of the states and union territories having more than 1000 cases, and the trained model is validated by testing it on further dates. The performance is evaluated using the RMSE metrics. The results show that the Polynomial Regression with an RMSE value of 0.08, shows the best performance in the prediction of the discharged patients.

We examined the independent association between d-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Multicenter cohort study. SETTING: ICUs at 68 hospitals across the United States. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICUs between March 4, 2020, and May 25, 2020, with a measured d-dimer concentration on ICU day 1 or 2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary exposure was the highest normalized d-dimer level (assessed in four categories: < 2, 2-3.9, 4-7.9, and &#8805; 8 the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1 or 2. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among 3,418 patients (63.1% male; median age 62 yr [interquartile range, 52-71 yr]), 3,352 (93.6%) had a d-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal.

The primary outcome was the change in pulse oximetry associated with prone positioning, measured on room air, with supplemental oxygen, and approximately 30 minutes after initiating prone positioning. Median and mean differences were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t-test. RESULTS: Of the 440 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, 31 met inclusion criteria. Median pulse oximetry increased as 83% (interquartile range, 75%-86%) on room air, 90% (interquartile range, 89%-93%) with supplemental oxygen, and 96% (interquartile range, 94%-98%) with prone positioning (z = -4.48, P < .001). A total of 45% (n = 14) were intubated during their hospital stay, and 26% (n = 8) of the included patients died. DISCUSSION: In patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who are awake, alert, and spontaneously breathing, an initially low pulse oximetry reading improved with prone positioning. Future studies are needed to determine the association of prone positioning with subsequent endotracheal intubation and mortality.","output":"Prone Positioning of Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 Who Are Nonintubated in Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Single-Site Retrospective Health Records Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) is a novel virus. There has been an increasing number of case reports on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) but the global and population-specific incidence of MIS-C particularly in Asian countries, its causal relationship with SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathogenesis remain unknown. Emerging questions on how the pathophysiology of MIS-C differs from that of Kawasaki disease (KD) and non-KD inflammatory syndromes need to be answered. Genetic factors influencing the incidence of MIS-C in the different ethnic populations are to be explored. What happens to the children with MIS-C, in the long run, remains unknown to date.

Among its most important aspects that require special study, are pathogenesis and morphological changes in severe forms of the disease. Material and methods. The analysis of 18 autopsy observations was carried out. Along with routine assessment of macro - and microscopic changes, immunohistochemical studies of lungs and other organs were performed using sera against antigens CD2,3,4,5,7, 20,31,34, 56,57,69; the presence of Fe2+and Fe3+was detected in the lungs and liver. Results. Structural changes in the lungs may be associated with cytopathic and cytoproliferative effects of the virus with damage to both the ciliary and alveolar epithelium, as well as the formation of hyaline membranes. Cellular infiltration is mainly represented by suppressor populations of T-lymphocytes and macrophages. Endothelial damage, vascular thrombosis of vessels of different calibers, and hemorrhages were detected. Many organs (lymph nodes, spleen, intestines, brain, adrenal glands) show changes that may indicate generalization of viral infection, and infiltration of CD8+ lymphocytes in the kidneys, liver, adrenal glands, pericardium, and intestines indicates a probable autoimmune component of pathogenesis. In the liver and lungs deceased from COVID-19 only small clusters of Fe3+and Fe2+granules were detected, which can be associated (including in our control observation) with liver damage in malaria.","output":"Issues of pathology of a new coronavirus infection CoVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The current Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) uses the PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio to classify severity. However, for the same P/F ratio, a patient on a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may have more severe lung injury than one on a lower PEEP. OBJECTIVES: We designed a new formula, the P/FP ratio, incorporating PEEP into the P/F ratio and multiplying with a correction factor of 10 [(PaO(2)*10)/(FiO(2)*PEEP)], to evaluate if it better predicts hospital mortality compared to the P/F ratio post-intubation and to assess the resultant changes in severity classification of ARDS. METHODS: We categorized patients from a dataset of seven ARDS network trials using the thresholds of  100 (severe), 101C200 (moderate), and 201C300 (mild) for both P/F (mmHg) and P/FP (mmHg/cmH(2)O) ratios and evaluated hospital mortality using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). RESULTS: Out of 3,442 patients, 1,057 (30.7%) died. The AUC for mortality was higher for the P/FP ratio than the P/F ratio for PEEP levels > 5 cmH(2)O: 0.710 (95% CI 0.691C0.730) versus 0.659 (95% CI 0.637C0.681), P < 0.001. Improved AUC was seen with increasing PEEP levels; for PEEP  18 cmH(2)O: 0.963 (95% CI 0.947C0.978) versus 0.828 (95% CI 0.765C0.891), P < 0.001. When the P/FP ratio was used instead of the P/F ratio, 12.5% and 15% of patients with moderate and mild ARDS, respectively, were moved to more severe categories, while 13.9% and 33.6% of patients with severe and moderate ARDS, respectively, were moved to milder categories. The median PEEP and FiO(2) were 14 cmH(2)O and 0.70 for patients reclassified to severe ARDS, and 5 cmH(2)O and 0.40 for patients reclassified to mild ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The multifactorial P/FP ratio has a greater predictive validity for hospital mortality in ARDS than the P/F ratio. Changes in severity classification with the P/FP ratio reflect both true illness severity and the applied PEEP strategy. Trial registration: ClinialTrials.govCNCT03946150.

Methods: : We studied all Mexican adults infected with COVID-19 from February 1st to July 31st, 2020. The data set is available for free on the Ministry of Healths webpage. We analyzed previous diagnosis of NCDs, other preexisting diseases, indicators of severity, and the institution treating the patient. We estimated CFR and analyzed it by the number of NCDs, specific diseases, and combinations of NCDs. Relative risk was estimated using Poisson models and probability of death estimates with Logistic models. Results: : We analyzed 406,966 COVID-19 positive adults. The general CFR was 11.2%, while for men it was 13.7% and for women 8.4%. CFR is positively associated with age and number of NCDs (trend test p<0.001). The combination of type 2 diabetes+chronic kidney failure has the highest CFR (44.0%). The number of comorbidities increase the CFR in younger adults, in which the relative risk from 0 to 3 or more NCDs was 30.2 in women and 11.8 in men. We observed great heterogeneity in the CFR by institution, from 4.6% in private institutions to 18.9% in public institutions.

Survivors were younger than 60 years old (80%), had less comorbidities (10% no comorbidities, 70% with 1 or 2 comorbidities), lower serum ferritin levels (30% under 1000 ng/mL), and 50% had no serum glucose elevation. Our patients with CRS had no response to corticosteroid therapy. Five out of the 25 patients had an unfavorable evolution to death. The off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe or critically ill form of SARS-CoV-2 infection had good results in our study. Off-label use of TCZ in severe and critical cases of COVID-19 pneumonia is effective in managing the cytokine storm. Better outcomes were noted in younger patients.

Understanding patients' attitudes toward participation in a long trial and their acceptability of strategies aimed at promoting retention/compliance is important for assessing feasibility and resource needs and optimizing trial design. METHODS A crowdsourcing survey to adult RP patients was administered on social media in 2020 July-November. Patient enthusiasm level of study participation, acceptability of attending clinic visits every 4-5 months for 45-months, tele-visits with doctors, and of receiving text messages for medication reminders and for reporting missed dosages were surveyed. RESULTS Among the 1473 respondents, over 95% use email or a mobile phone and receive text messages; 1157 (79%) respondents were very/somewhat enthusiastic about participation, among them, 80.6% were \\"very willing\\" to attend clinic visits every 4-5 months for 45 months; 90.3% were \\"very willing\\" to have tele-visits; 64.7% and 77.1% were willing to receive text reminders to take medication and messages surveying missed doses, respectively.

Methods In this prospective randomized study, 60 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia lasting less than 120 min were divided into two groups: the 10-min pre-warming group (n = 30) and the control group (n = 30). Patients in the 10-min pre-warming group were pre-warmed for 10 min in the pre-anesthetic area using a forced-air warmer set at 47oC. Intraoperatively, we warmed all patients with a forced-air warmer. Body temperature was measured using a tympanic membrane thermometer pre- or postoperatively and a nasopharyngeal temperature probe intraoperatively. Patients were evaluated on the shivering and thermal comfort scale in the pre-anesthetic area and post-anesthesia care unit. Results The incidences of intraoperative hypothermia and postoperative hypothermia were similar in both groups (10.7% vs. 28.6%, P = 0.177; 10.7% vs. 10.7%, P = 1.000 respectively). Body temperature was higher in the 10-min pre-warming group (P = 0.003). Thermal comfort during the pre-warming period was higher in the 10-min pre-warming group (P < 0.001). However, postoperative thermal comfort and shivering grades of both groups were similar.

In current study, we sought to evaluate the incidence, clinical outcomes, and characteristics of barotrauma among COVID-19 patients receiving invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and requiring oxygen support or positive airway pressure for ARDS who presented to our tertiary-care center from March through November, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 232 patients who required heated high-flow nasal cannula, continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure were assigned to non-invasive group. The remaining 121 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and were assigned to invasive group. Of the total 353 patients, 32 patients (65.6% males) with a mean age of 63  11 years developed barotrauma in the form of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. The incidence of barotrauma was 4.74% (11/232) and 17.35% (21/121) in the non-invasive group and invasive group, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 22 (15.7 -33.0) days with an overall mortality of 62.5% (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 ARDS have a high incidence of barotrauma. Pulmonary barotrauma should be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who exhibit worsening of their respiratory disease as it is likely associated with a high mortality risk.

A maximum G. columna growth rate was observed at 25 C and 30-35 psu salinity. The G. columna could survive in a wide salinity range of 25-40 psu. However, the maximum number and weight of G. columna polyps was determined at 30-35 psu. Furthermore, 30-35 psu salinity at 25 C led to the best G. columna growth and survival, mainly because of their enhanced nutrient absorption rate, polyp expansion rate, metabolic rate and adaptability. Comparing various salinity-temperature treatment groups, all obtained values for growth, behavior and metabolism were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for 30 psu at 25 C than other treatment groups resulting in maximum G. columna yield. In addition, the optimal timing of G. columna feeding was assessed by studying changes in body composition and digestive enzymes within 24 h of feeding.

HIFU treatment of tumours and metastases in the liver dome is limited due to the adjacent ultrasound blocking lung. One-lung flooding (OLF) enables complete sonography of lung and adjoining organs including liver. HIFU liver ablation passing through the flooded lung could enable a direct intercostal beam path and thus improve dose deposition in liver. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of an ultrasound guided transthoracic, transpulmonary HIFU ablation of liver using OLF. Methods: After right-side lung flooding, ultrasound guided HIFU was applied transthoracic- transpulmonary into liver to create thermal lesions in three pigs. The HIFU beam was targeted five times into liver, two times at the liver surface and three times deeper into the tissue. During autopsy examinations of lung, diaphragm and liver located in the HIFU path were performed. The focal liver lesions and lung tissue out of the beam path were examined histologically. Results: Fifteen thermal liver lesions were generated by transpulmonary HIFU sonication in all targeted regions. The lesions appeared well-demarcated in grey color with a cigar-shaped configuration. The mean length and width of the superficial and deeper lesions were 15.8 mm (range: 13-18 mm) and 5.8 mm (range: 5-7 mm), and 10.9 mm (range: 9-13 mm) and 3.3 mm (range: 2-5 mm), respectively. Histopathological, all liver lesions revealed a homogeneous thermal necrosis lacking vitality. There were no signs of damage of the overlying diaphragm and lung tissue.

The risks of disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been alerted to cause serious secondary pollution;however, there is still lack of evidence. This study collected 110 water samples from nine lakes and two rivers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic and comprehensively analyzed the occurrence of eighteen DBPs. Trihalomethanes, halonitromethanes, halogen acetonitriles and nitrosamines had a high detection frequency and were 0.99-14.26, ND-4.62, ND-1.09 and 0.0414-0.0861 g/L, respectively, all lower than the maximum contamination level (MCL) suggested by China and USA. Haloacetic acids were detected in all lakes and Yangtze River and ranged from 33.8 to 856.1 g/L, much higher than the MCL. Haloacetic acids and halogen acetonitriles accounted for 74.2-95.1% of the total cytotoxicity (0.38-3.62105);halonitromethanes (94.0-98.7%) contributed to the majority of genotoxicity (0.52-5.17104). Dichloroacetic acid exhibited significant ecological risks to green algae in two lakes and Yangtze River (risk quotient >10), and all the other DBPs showed negligible risks (risk quotient <0.01) to fish, daphnid or green algae. Correlation and redundancy analysis identified strong correlations between total organic carbon, conductivity, NH3-N, turbidity and DBPs. DBP composition and the fluorescence indices of dissolved organic matters together categorized all lakes into two types. Type-I lakes contained all DBP categories, driven by total organic carbon and secondarily formed by residual active chlorine with natural organic matters;Type-II lakes and Yangtze River only had high levels of haloacetic acids and small amounts of trihalomethanes, explained by the primary formation of DBPs in sewage. Our findings for the first time uncovered the significant accumulation and risks of DBPs in lakes and rivers of Wuhan during the COVID-19, provided the evidence of secondary pollution from intensive disinfection activities with chlorine-based disinfectants, evaluated the potential the ecological risks of DBPs in Wuhan and along Yangtze River, and raised our re-consideration of disinfection strategy in the pandemics and post-COVID-19 era.","output":"Disinfection tackling the COVID-19 pandemic causes disinfection by-products (DBPs) accumulation and threatens aquatic ecosystems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent past, major pandemics and epidemics have occurred due to the emergence and resurgence of the novel strains of viruses like Influenza [HINI-A \\"Spanish Flu\\", H1N1-Novel A \\"Swine flu\\"], Corona [Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2)] and Ebola virus [Ebola virus disease].

However, almost all the leading methods for video anomaly detection rely on large-scale training datasets with long training times. As a result, many real-world video analysis tasks are still not applicable for fast deployment. On the other hand, the leading methods cannot provide interpretability due to the uninterpretable feature representations hiding the decision-making process when anomaly detection models are considered as a black box. However, the interpretability for anomaly detection is crucial since the corresponding response to the anomalies in the video is determined by their severity and nature. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes an efficient deep learning framework for video anomaly detection and provides explanations. The proposed framework uses pre-trained deep models to extract high-level concept and context features for training denoising autoencoder (DAE), requiring little training time (i.e., within 10 s on UCSD Pedestrian datasets) while achieving comparable detection performance to the leading methods. Furthermore, this framework presents the first video anomaly detection use of combing autoencoder and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for model interpretability. The framework can explain each anomaly detection result in surveillance videos. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed framework's effectiveness and efficiency while also explaining anomalies behind the autoencoders prediction.

Aerosol measurement during clinical procedures using particle counting may be confounded by variable natural background aerosol levels or limited by partial volume sampling. The study objective was to quantify any significant aerosol generated from simulated suction clearance procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation during clinical suction simulation. SETTING: Clean chamber. METHODS: We created a clean environment for particle counting in a transparent neutralized polypropylene chamber. Air was passed through a HEPA 14 class filter to maintain a constant chamber inlet pressure. An optical particle counter was connected in line to the chamber exhaust vent to measure all of the vented particles. The chamber background count was 1 particle 0.3 m per 15 minutes at a flow rate of 1 chamber air change per minute. We used this system to quantify very low aerosol counts generated from suction clearance of a silicone ear canal and at an open air-fluid interface. RESULTS: No clinically significant aerosol generation was found by particle counting of the whole chamber air volume during simulated suction procedures. CONCLUSION: Simulated ear suction clearance and air-fluid interface suction does not generate any significant aerosol. It appears likely that any aerosol potentially generated at the suction tube tip is entrained by incoming air flow. This is the first study to quantify aerosols generated by suction in a controlled environment; further research is required to determine its clinical implications.","output":"Aerosol Generation in Ear Canal and Air-Fluid Interface Suction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The study has the primary objective of assessing the efficacy/safety of rac-methadone, levomethadone, and buprenorphine in maintenance patients and na?ve, in pharmacological polytherapy.

Social capital has also been associated with behaviors that promote better health and reduce the impacts of diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, face masking, and vaccination have all been essential in controlling contagion. These behaviors have not been uniformly adopted by communities in the United States. Using different facets of social capital to explain the differences in public behaviors among communities during pandemics is lacking. ObjectiveThis study examines the relationship among public health behavior--vaccination, face masking, and physical distancing--during COVID-19 pandemic and social capital indices in counties in the United States. MethodsWe used publicly available vaccination data as of June 2021, face masking data in July 2020, and mobility data from mobile phones movements from the end of March 2020. Then, correlation analysis was conducted with county-level social capital index and its subindices (family unity, community health, institutional health, and collective efficacy) that were obtained from the Social Capital Project by the United States Senate. ResultsWe found the social capital index and its subindices differentially correlate with different public health behaviors. Vaccination is associated with institutional health: positively with fully vaccinated population and negatively with vaccination hesitancy. Also, wearing masks negatively associates with community health, whereases reduced mobility associates with better community health. Further, residential mobility positively associates with family unity. By comparing correlation coefficients, we find that social capital and its subindices have largest effect sizes on vaccination and residential mobility. ConclusionOur results show that different facets of social capital are significantly associated with adoption of protective behaviors, e.g., social distancing, face masking, and vaccination. As such, our results suggest that differential facets of social capital imply a Swiss cheese model of pandemic control planning where, e.g., institutional health and community health, provide partially overlapping behavioral benefits.","output":"Social Capital Dimensions are Differentially Associated with COVID-19 Vaccinations, Masks, and Physical Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are increasing environmental issues and require novel removal technology since the required doses of algaecides may cause further environmental pollution or treatment facility damage.

The COVID-19 pandemic generated an unprecedented health crisis. In the subsequent response, geriatric day hospitals paid a heavy price in the organizational restructuring of the hospital environment, with almost instantaneous closures imposed by the authorities. A survey was conducted under the aegis of the APHJPA among day hospitals to learn the lessons from the management of this crisis and to reflect on the role of these structures in contexts of this nature. 50 day hospitals throughout the country answered. Most of the professionals were immediately redeployed to classic hospitalization services, whether or not the population area was heavily impacted by COVID-19. Some of them provided assistance to nursing homes or patients confined to their homes and their families. Although they accepted the closures during the acute period of the crisis, the lack of clarity about the reopening of their units despite the precautionary measures envisaged was not well received, often with the feeling that the authorities and sometimes the management of their establishments were not well acquainted with their role in the care of the elderly. The lockdown and discontinuation of care led to de-compensations, especially among patients with neurodegenerative pathologies.

This study investigates vaccine confidence amongst Chinese caregivers and vaccination-service providers (VSPs) six months after the CCVI. METHODS: Quantitative surveys were conducted in January 2019 with 2124 caregivers of children and 555 VSPs in three areas in China. The proportions of respondents who agreed to the four statements from the Vaccine Confidence Index? were used to measure vaccine confidence. Descriptive and univariate analyses were performed to study the level of vaccine confidence. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 48 caregivers, 43 VSPs and 9 immunization program managers. Interviews were analyzed thematically using a combination of deductive and inductive coding. Media surveillance was conducted to monitor public responses to the CCVI. RESULTS: Media surveillance indicated that public attention to vaccine-related issues increased sharply immediately post-CCVI but declined rapidly thereafter. Six months post-CCVI, 96.0% of caregivers and the same proportion of VSPs reported that vaccination was important and compatible with their religious beliefs. 82.7% and 88.2% of caregivers agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. 92.8% and 94.6% of VSPs agreed that vaccines were safe and effective. Both caregivers and VSPs reported an immediate decline in vaccine confidence post-CCVI. In most cases this trust was regained over time following government and public health responses, however some people remained hesitant about vaccinating their children. Many VSPs were overwhelmed by consultations, workload and psychological pressure after the CCVI. CONCLUSION: After an initial decline, vaccine confidence recovered to pre-incident levels six months after the CCVI. However, some caregivers moved from the higher to the lower end of the vaccine confidence spectrum, pointing to the need to promote the acceptance of vaccination especially given the need for new vaccines to control the coronavirus epidemic.","output":"Caregiver and service provider vaccine confidence following the Changchun Changsheng vaccine incident in China: A cross-sectional mixed methods study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus is getting to be cerebral pain for world day by day.

METHODS Of 656 patients enrolled in Interventional Management of Stroke III trial, 306 had baseline computed tomographic angiography. Of these, 185 patients had M1 middle cerebral artery  intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion, where baseline collateral status could be measured. Collateral status was assessed by consensus using 3 different ordinal scales and categorized as good, intermediate, and poor. Multivariable modeling was used to assess the effect of collateral status and treatment type on clinical outcome by modified Rankin Scale (mRS 0-2, mRS 0-1, and the ordinal mRS). RESULTS Of 185 patients, 126 randomized to endovascular therapy (87.6% recanalized, 41.3% 90-day mRS 0-2) and 59 to intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator only (60.5% recanalized, 30.5% 90-day mRS 0-2). In multivariable modeling, collateral status was a significant predictor of all clinical outcomes (P<0.05). Maximal benefit with endovascular treatment across all clinical outcomes was seen in patients with intermediate collaterals, some benefit in patients with good collaterals, and none in patients with poor collaterals, although small sample size limited the power of the analysis to show a statistically significant interaction between collateral status and treatment type (P>0.05).

SUMMARY ANSWER: E3G testing provides an alternative to serum E2 assessment and a new patient friendly approach for COH monitoring. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In many IVF clinics basic monitoring tools for controlled ovarian stimulation during IVF procedure are ultrasound measurements of follicle growth and hormone assessment of serum E2 levels. The monitoring can occur 4C6 times during stimulation, but repeated blood sampling causes patient stress. In contrast, E3G sampling, one of principal metabolites of estradiol in urine, is non-invasive and can be performed by the patients themselves and measured by fluorescent immunoassay. A correlation has been shown between concentrations of E2 present in plasma and concentrations of E3G in different phases of menstruation cycle. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a pilot, prospective study, in a single IVF clinic. Twenty female participants were recruited November 2020 -January 2021, aged 25C43 years and BMI: 18C28kg/m2. Dynamic change of serum E2 and urine E3G at ovarian stimulation monitoring are being analyzed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Concurrent urine E3G and serum E2 values were collected from patients who provided between 2 and 4 samples on different days of their COH IVF cycle. Serum E2 values were assessed routinely, while E3G values were measured and validated using a fluorescent immunoassay Mira Fertility Plus? analyzer.Main results and the role of chance: The urine E3G of assay was validated for intra- and inter-assay variability with a coefficient of variation of < 20%. It was also validated for analytical and functional sensitivity and sample stability. Linear regression of serum E2 and E3G values of 56 early morning urine samples who had evaluated between Days 4 and 13 of menstruation cycle provided an R = 0,81. Urine E3G values also correlated to follicle growth. Patient survey results showed that urine sampling was the preferred method of analysis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We have provided proof of principle that urine E3G measurement can be accurately carried out using fluorescent immunoassay technology during routine COH for IVF cycles. The patients study group has to be expanded in order to enable us to find the appropriate place of urine E3G assay in COH protocol. Wider implications of the findings: Urine E3G testing correlates well to serum E2 assessment in COH. Urine E3G assay provides an alternative to serum-based assessment. The ease of urine sampling allows a reduction in patient discomfort during venopuncture, costs, time, and infection risks in epidemics/pandemics, like COViDC19, and offers a patient-friendly approach to ovarian stimulation.

Through an electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, myricetin could inhibit the ssDNA binding activity of PaSSB with an IC(50) of 2.8  0.4 M. The effect of quercetin, kaempferol, and galangin was insignificant. To elucidate the flavonol inhibition specificity, the crystal structure of PaSSB complexed with the non-inhibitor quercetin was solved using the molecular replacement method at a resolution of 2.3 ? (PDB entry 7VUM) and compared with a structure with the inhibitor myricetin (PDB entry 5YUN). Although myricetin and quercetin bound PaSSB at a similar site, their binding poses were different. Compared with myricetin, the aromatic ring of quercetin shifted by a distance of 4.9 ? and an angle of 31 for hydrogen bonding to the side chain of Asn108 in PaSSB. In addition, myricetin occupied and interacted with the ssDNA binding sites Lys7 and Glu80 in PaSSB whereas quercetin did not. This result might explain why myricetin could, but quercetin could not, strongly inhibit PaSSB. This molecular evidence reveals the flavonol inhibition specificity and also extends the interactomes of the natural anticancer products myricetin and quercetin to include the OB-fold protein SSB.","output":"A Complexed Crystal Structure of a Single-Stranded DNA-Binding Protein with Quercetin and the Structural Basis of Flavonol Inhibition Specificity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, sales of nonperishable food drastically increased in Germany.

Such strategies include the increased use of digital health tools. However, patient preferences, privacy concerns, a lack of regulations, overregulation, and insufficient evidence on the efficacy of digital health tools may have hampered the potential positive benefits of using such tools to manage NCDs. OBJECTIVE: This viewpoint aims to discuss the views of an advisory board of patient and caregiver association members. Specifically, we aim to present this advisory board's view on the role of digital health tools in managing patients with NCDs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify future directions based on patients' perspectives. METHODS: As an initiative under the NCD Partnership (PARTners in Ncds Engage foR building Strategies to improve Healthy ageing In Patients) model of Upjohn, a web-based advisory board of patient and caregiver advocates was held on July 28, 2020, to bring together key stakeholders from public and private sectors. RESULTS: The following key themes emerged: (1) technology developers should understand that the goals of patients may differ from those of health care professionals and other stakeholders; (2) patients, health care professionals, caregivers, and other end users need to be involved in the development of digital health tools at the earliest phase possible, to guarantee usability, efficacy, and adoption; (3) digital health tools must be better tailored to people with complex conditions, such as multimorbidity, older age, and cognitive or sensory impairment; and (4) some patients do not want or are unable to use digital health care tools, so adequate alternatives should always be available. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus that public-private partnership models, such as the Upjohn NCD Partnership, can be effective models that foster innovation by integrating multiple perspectives (eg, patients' perspectives) into the design, development, and implementation of digital and nondigital health tools, with the main overall objective of improving the life of patients with NCDs.","output":"Digital Health Tools for Managing Noncommunicable Diseases During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives of Patients and Caregivers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This paper identifies and discusses the strategies adopted by a manufacturing company to manage its national and international employees' anxiety, health and safety with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, to fill a current research gap. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses the qualitative method to identify the strategies employed by a manufacturing company to manage its employees' anxiety, health and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis of data from fourteen semi-structured interviews is presented. Findings: Results from the data analysed show that five strategies that help manage employees' health, safety and anxiety are - enhanced communication, formulation and enforcement of policies, rules and regulation, education and training, and management commitment. The findings indicate that the implementation of these strategies does not lead to a negative effect and therefore can conclude that there was no cobra effect. Research limitations/implications: Although exploratory and based on one organisation;the findings lay the foundation for future theoretically grounded research on management of employees' health, safety and anxiety. Practical implications: Findings could be the basis for training for managers and also be used to modify the strategies applied in managing employees' anxiety, health and safety.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the trauma registry data of all hospitalised trauma patients, who were treated at the two main trauma centres in Al-Ain City (Al-Ain Hospital and Tawam Hospital); those who were treated over 1 year before the pandemic (n = 2002) and those who were treated at the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 1468). RESULTS: There was a 26.7% reduction in the overall incidence of trauma admissions in the COVID-19 pandemic period. The mechanism of injury significantly differed between the two periods (p < 0.0001, Fishers exact test). There was an absolute increase in the number of injuries, due to machinery and falling objects during the pandemic (39.7% and 54.1% respectively, p < 0.001). In contrast, road traffic collisions and falls were reduced by 33.5% and 31.3%, respectively. Location significantly differed between the two periods (p < 0.0001, Fishers exact test). There was an absolute increase of 18.4% in workplace injuries and a reduction of 39.3% in home injuries over the study period. In addition, we observed relatively more workplace injuries and fewer home injuries during the pandemic (11.3% and 42.8% compared with 7.1% and 52.4%, respectively). Mortality was similar between the two periods (1.8% compared with 1.2%, p = 0.16, Fishers exact test). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the trauma risk exposure in our population. It reduced trauma hospital admissions by around 27%. Work-related injuries, including falling objects and machinery injuries, were relatively higher during the pandemic.

We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the general public's grasp of the accuracy and significance of the results of the swab test. DESIGN: Web-based behavioural experiment. SETTING: Italy during the April 2020 lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: 566 Italian residents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence; the predictive and diagnostic accuracy of the test; the behavioural impact of (positive vs negative) test results; the perceived usefulness of a short-term repetition of the test following positive or negative results; and rankings of causes for false positives and false negatives. RESULTS: Most participants considered the swab test useful (89.6%) and provided predictive values consistent with their estimates of test diagnostic accuracy and infection prevalence (67.0%). Participants acknowledged the effects of symptomatic status and geographical location on prevalence (all p<0.001) but failed to take this information into account when estimating the positive or negative predictive value. Overall, test specificity was underestimated (91.5%, 95% CI 90.2% to 92.8%); test sensitivity was overestimated (89.7%, 95% CI 88.3% to 91.0%). Positive results were evaluated as more informative than negative ones (91.6, 95% CI 90.2 to 93.1 and 41.0, 95% CI 37.9 to 44.0, respectively, p<0.001); a short-term repetition of the test was considered more useful after a positive than a negative result (62.7, 95% CI 59.6 to 65.7 and 47.2, 95% CI 44.4 to 50.0, respectively, p=0.013). Human error and technical characteristics were assessed as more likely to be the causes of false positives (p<0.001); the level of the viral load as the cause of false negatives (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While some aspects of the swab for SARS-CoV-2 are well grasped, others are not and may have a strong bearing on the general public's health and well-being. The obtained findings provide policymakers with a detailed picture that can guide the design and implementation of interventions for improving efficient communication with the general public as well as adherence to precautionary behaviour.","output":"Public's understanding of swab test results for SARS-CoV-2: an online behavioural experiment during the April 2020 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surgical masks are widely used for the prevention of respiratory infections.

This publication describes experimental testing of the Protection and Isolation System for Patients with COVID-19 (PISP/COVID-19). Method PISP/COVID-19 is a disposable transparent polyethylene plastic that covers the patient's entire hospital bed, with its internal air aspirated by the hospital's vacuum system attached to a microparticle filter. Experiments validated PISP/COVID-19's ability to block aerosolized microparticles dissemination. Caffeine was used as a molecular marker, with leakage evaluation through sensors analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The biological marker was synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) as the detection method. Results PISP/COVID-19 was effective against molecular and biological markers environmental dispersion in simulations of non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and mechanical ventilation isolation.

The aim of the present investigation was to determine the impact of policies and several sociodemographic factors on the COVID-19 doubling time in Mexico. Methods. A retrospective longitudinal study was carried out across March-August, 2020. Policies issued by each of the 32 Mexican states during each week of this period were classified according to the University of Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), and the doubling time of COVID-19 cases was calculated. Additionally, variables such as population size and density, poverty and mobility were included. A panel data model was applied to measure the effect of these variables on doubling time. Results. States with larger population sizes issued a larger number of policies. Delay in the issuance of policies was associated with accelerated propagation. The policy index (coefficient 0.60, p < 0.01) and the income per capita (coefficient 3.36, p < 0.01) had a positive effect on doubling time; by contrast, the population density (coefficient -0.012, p < 0.05), the mobility in parks (coefficient -1.10, p < 0.01) and the residential mobility (coefficient -4.14, p < 0.01) had a negative effect.

Although their role in infection diseases is not completely known, they can exert double functions in the infected cell, by mediating the virus infection and/or regulating the immunity-related gene targets through complex networks of virus-host cell interactions. In this systematic review, the Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus, Lilacs, Scielo, and EBSCO databases were searched for research articles published until October 22nd, 2020 that focused on describing the role, function, and/or association of miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 human infection and COVID-19. Following the PRISMA 2009 protocol, 29 original research articles were selected. Most of the studies reported miRNA data based on the genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates and computational prediction analysis. The latter predicted, by at least one independent study, 1266 host miRNAs to target the viral genome. Thirteen miRNAs were identified by four independent studies to target SARS-CoV-2 specific genes, suggested to act by interfering with their cleavage and/or translation process. The studies selected also reported on viral and host miRNAs that targeted host genes, on the expression levels of miRNAs in biological specimens of COVID-19 patients, and on the impact of viral genome mutations on miRNA function. Also, miRNAs that regulate the expression levels of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins, which are critical for the virus entrance in the host cells, were reported. In conclusion, despite the limited number of studies identified, based on the search terms and eligibility criteria applied, this systematic review provides evidence on the impact of miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Although most of the reported viral/host miRNAs interactions were based on in silico prediction analysis, they demonstrate the relevance of the viral/host miRNA interaction for viral activity and host responses. In addition, the identified studies highlight the potential use of miRNAs as therapeutic targets against COVID-19, and other viral human diseases (This review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (#CRD42020199290).","output":"The role of microRNAs in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cells: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Organizations do not make decisions;people do.

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells, notably type II alveolar epithelial cells. Importantly, ACE2 gene is highly polymorphic. Here we have used in silico tools to analyze the possible impact of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. We found that S19P (common in African people) and K26R (common in European people) were, among the most diffused SNPs worldwide, the only two SNPs that were able to potentially affect the interaction of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 spike. FireDock simulations demonstrated that while S19P may decrease, K26R might increase the ACE2 affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

Considering the shortage of medical resources and the need to prevent nosocomic infection, the respiratory-treatment strategy in these nonstandard ICUs is different from those in general wards and standard ICUs. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) plays an important role in nonstandard ICUs and is beneficial to the patients therein. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we analyzed four cases of HFNC-treated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a makeshift ICU and summarized our experience. DIAGNOSES: Four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were admitted to the makeshift ICU. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had oxygen treatment with HFNC, as well as regular treatment of antivirals and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: Two patients survived after treatment, while the other two died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 often have poor prognoses after mechanical ventilation, exhibiting corresponding complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis, which significantly prolongs length of stay in the ICU. HFNC could prevent intubation in some patients, thereby avoiding the above complications; however, this needs confirmation in further clinical studies. This treatment reduced difficulty and workloads for healthcare professionals, had good tolerability for patients, might not significantly increase the risk of infection for healthcare professionals, and do not require additional preventive measures against nosocomic infection. HFNC treatment has its advantages in providing oxygen therapy in COVID-19, but healthcare professionals should still pay close attention to changes in patients' oxygenation rates and respiratory frequency.","output":"Therapeutic effect of high-flow nasal cannula on severe COVID-19 patients in a makeshift intensive-care unit: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths among women of reproductive age in Peru. Screening and early identification of pre-cancerous lesions are a cornerstone of the cervical cancer prevention strategy. Yet, there is limited literature on barriers to screening among Peruvian women. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to examine Peruvian women's knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding cervical cancer screening and identify possible reasons for the gap between knowledge and screening. METHODS The study was conducted in metropolitan Lima from June-August 2019. We purposefully recruited 12 women who had previously been screened, and 12 who had never been screened for cervical cancer. The women completed a 40-question knowledge and attitude survey and an in-depth interview about barriers to screening. Descriptive analysis was used to calculate a knowledge and attitude score and qualitative analysis was guided by the Health Belief Model constructs. RESULTS Previously screened participants had greater knowledge of cervical cancer symptoms, risk factors, and prevention (mean score = 28.08, S.D. = 4.18) compared to participants who had never been screened (mean score = 21.25, S.D. = 6.35). Both groups described lack of priority and embarrassment as barriers to cervical cancer screening. For participants who had never been screened before, major barriers included the fear of a cancer diagnosis and lack of information about screening services. Pregnancy, unusual gynecological symptoms and encouragement from friends and family were cues to action for participants seeking screening. Most participants in both groups recognized the benefits of getting screened for cervical cancer. Being previously screened increased participants' self-efficacy for engaging in screening behaviors again. Misconceptions regarding screening procedures and cervical cancer were also noted as barriers for participants accessing screening services. CONCLUSIONS Improving knowledge and awareness about cervical cancer and screening programs may improve screening behaviors among women. Targeting women who have never been screened before and addressing their fears and concerns around embarrassment may be other areas for intervention. Misconceptions that deter women from screening services are an important issue that should be addressed in order to increase the number of women who get timely screenings.","output":"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding cervical cancer screening among women in metropolitan Lima, Peru: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) outbreak on global stock markets is investigated by analyzing the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the stock markets of 15 countries selected from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and North America.

A multi-country matched case-control study was conducted in 2011 to identify calf-level risk factors for BNP. 405 BNP cases were recruited from 330 farms in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands by laboratory confirmation of farmer-reported cases. Up to four calves of similar age from the same farm were selected as controls (1154 calves). Risk factor data were collected by questionnaire. Multivariable modelling using conditional logistic regression indicated that PregSure?BVD (PregSure, Pfizer Animal Health) vaccination of the dam was strongly associated with BNP cases (adjusted matched Odds Ratio - amOR 17.8 first lactation dams; 95% confidence interval C ci 2.4, 134.4; p = 0.005), and second or more lactation PregSure-vaccinated dams were more likely to have a case than first lactation vaccinated dams (amOR 2.2 second lactation; ci 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.024; amOR 5.3 third or more lactation; ci 2.9, 9.8; p = <0.001). Feeding colostrum from other cows was strongly associated with BNP if the dam was not PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 30.5; ci 2.1, 440.5; p = 0.012), but the effect was less if the dam was PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 2.1; ci 1.1, 4.0; p = 0.024).

No other calf-level factors were identified, suggesting that there are other important factors that are outside the scope of this study, such as genetics, which explain why BNP develops in some PregSure-colostrum-exposed calves but not in others.","output":"Calf-Level Factors Associated with Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia C A Multi-Country Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We present a rare case of status epilepticus in a 56-year-old man which arose as a complication after vaccination with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mRNA-1273 vaccine. The patient's history included well-compensated secondary epilepsy. The root cause of the situation was a fever which had developed as a side effect of the vaccination. CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old man received the first dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2. The vaccine was administered intramuscularly (100 mg, 0.5 mL). The next morning the man was found to be suffering from fever and headaches while at the same time experiencing general weakness. He lost consciousness suddenly and experienced generalized clonic seizures which turned into status epilepticus. When the Emergency Medical Service arrived the patient was unconscious with spontaneous breathing and generalized clonic seizures. It was necessary to administer diazepam repeatedly. It was also necessary to administer high doses of levetiracetam and temporary propofol. The status epilepticus was brought under control approximately 90 min after the patients transport to the Emergency Department. A follow-up electroencephalogram no longer revealed abnormal indications of epileptic fit. The patient was temporarily hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit and after seven days care was discharged without any further apparent effects. CONCLUSION: There is currently no specific treatment against COVID-19. Therefore, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine protection outweigh the risks.","output":"Status epilepticus as a complication after COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To date, the microbiome, as well as the virome of the Croatian populations of bats, was unknown.

The constantly growing number of hip replacement procedures is, however, associated with a proportional rise in the number of subsequent surgery-related complications. The most important complication is septic loosening of the implant. The treatment of septic complications is often ineffective and recovery becomes impossible. In that setting, an awareness of the risk factors of septic complications and an ability to prevent periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) are becoming necessary. AIM The aim of the study was to analyse the risk factors of PJI as an essential element of the prophylaxis of septic complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analysed the data of 142 patients treated for PJI at the Ward of Bone and Joint Infections, Department of Orthopaedics, Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education in Otwock, between 2008 and 2010. Their medical records were analysed retrospectively. The diagnosis was evidence-based, relying on case histories, physical examination and accessory investigations, including imaging studies and biochemical and microbiological testing. RESULTS The analysis of clinical data served to identify factors that appeared repetitively in the patients with PJI treated at the Ward. Those elements constitute the combination of risk factors for PIJ. CONCLUSIONS 1. An awareness of risk factors for septic complications and their early elimination are necessary in daily orthopaedic care. 2.

A predictive phenotype model built from nucleotide-level information alone has previously been considered un-tenable with respect to RNA viruses due to the ultra-high intra-sequence variance of their genomes, even within closely related clades. Building from our prior work developing a degenerate k-mer method to accommodate this high intra-sequence variation of RNA virus genomes for modeling frameworks, and leveraging a taxonomic group-shuffle-split paradigm on complete coronavirus assemblies from prior to October 2018, we trained multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers at the nucleotide k-mer level capable of accurately predicting withheld SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences as human pathogens and accurately predicting withheld Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) genome sequences as non-human pathogens. LASSO feature selection identified several degenerate nucleotide predictor motifs with high model coefficients for the human pathogen class that were present across widely disparate classes of coronaviruses. However, these motifs differed in which genes they were present in, what specific codons were used to encode them, and what the translated amino acid motif was. This emphasizes the importance of a phenetic view of emerging pathogenic RNA viruses, as opposed to the canonical phylogenetic interpretations most-commonly used to track and manage viral zoonoses. Applying our model to more recent Orthocoronavirinae genomes deposited since October 2018 yields a novel contextual view of pathogen-potential across bat-related, canine-related, porcine-related, and rodent-related coronaviruses and critical adaptations which may have contributed to the emergence of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, we discuss the utility of these predictive models (and their associated predictor motifs) to novel biosurveillance protocols that substantially increase the pound-for-pound information content of field-collected sequencing data and make a strong argument for the necessity of routine collection and sequencing of zoonotic viruses.","output":"A Genotype-to-Phenotype Modeling Framework to Predict Human Pathogenicity of Novel Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most abundant internal RNA modification of cellular mRNAs. m(6)A is recognised by YTH domain-containing proteins, which selectively bind to m(6)A-decorated RNAs regulating their turnover and translation.

The primary objective of this study was to determine if the implementation of a designated COVID-19 cohort area (hot zone) within a busy ED mitigated the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the rest of the department. METHODS: In an ED of a tertiary academic medical center, with 64,000 annual visits, an eight room pod was designated for known COVID-19 or individuals with high suspicion for infection. There was a single entry and exit for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers (HCW) changed gowns and gloves between patients, but maintained their N-95 mask and face shield, cleaning the shield with a germicidal wipe between patients. Staffing assignments designated nurses and technicians to remain in this area for 4 h, where physicians regularly moved between the hot zone and rest of the ED. Fifteen surface samples and four air samples were taken to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 contamination levels and the effectiveness of infection control practices. Samples were collected outside of patient rooms in 3 primary ED patient care areas, the reception area, the primary nurses station, inside the cohort area, and the PPE donning and doffing areas immediately adjacent. Samples were recovered and analyzed for the presence of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on any surface samples, including in and around the cohort area. All air samples outside the COVID-19 hot zone were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but air samples within the cohort area had a low level of viral contamination. CONCLUSION: A designated COVID-19 cohort area resulted in no air or surface contamination outside of the hot zone, and only minimal air, but no surface contamination, within the hot zone.","output":"Implementation of a COVID-19 cohort area resulted in no surface or air contamination in surrounding areas in one academic emergency department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent complication in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with mortality.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 127 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to the intensive care unit of two teaching hospitals were included. VTE was diagnosed with either ultrasound or computed tomography scan. Univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for Positive End Expiratory Pressure, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, platelet count, international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time as well as levels of fibrinogen, antithrombin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate analysis was done using binary linear regression. RESULTS: Variables associated with VTE in both univariate and multivariate analysis were D-dimer and CRP with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.64, P = 0.023 and 0.75, P = 0.045, respectively. Variables indicating hypoxemia were not predictive. The ROC curve of D-dimer and CRP combined had an AUC of 0.83, P < 0.05. Categorized values of D-dimer and CRP were used to compute a mean absolute risk for the combination of these variables with a high positive predictive value. The predicted probability of VTE with a D-dimer > 15 in combination with a CRP > 280 was 98%. The negative predictive value of D-dimer was low.

In particular, pediatric kidney and non-kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease have significant cardiovascular risk that worsens with declining kidney function. Biomarkers associated with future cardiovascular risk such as casual and ambulatory hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular stiffness and calcification, and left ventricular hypertrophy can be detected throughout the post-transplant period and in patients with stable kidney function. Among these, hypertension and dyslipidemia are two potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors that are highly prevalent in kidney and non-kidney pediatric transplant recipients. Standardized approaches to appropriate BP measurement and lipid monitoring are needed to detect and address these risk factors in a timely fashion. To achieve sustained improvement in cardiovascular health, clinicians should partner with patients and their caregivers to address these and other risk factors with a combined approach that integrates pharmacologic with non-pharmacologic approaches.

We used the former for the derivation dataset and the latter for the validation dataset. We asked students questions in three areas: 1) opportunities to learn from each educational approach (lectures, medical quizzes, assignments, oral presentations, observation of physicians practice, clinical skills practice, participation in interprofessional meetings, and interactive discussions with physicians) in online clinical clerkships compared to face-to-face, 2) frequency of technical problems on online platforms, and 3) satisfaction and motivation as outcome measurements. We developed a scoring system based on a multivariate prediction model for satisfaction and motivation in a cross-sectional study of 1,671 medical students during the period MayCJune 2020. We externally validated this scoring with a cross-sectional study of 106 medical students during FebruaryCMarch 2021 and assessed its predictive performance.

Methods: In this parallel, double-blind study, patients with ADHD were randomly assigned to receive active (A-tDCS) or sham tDCS (S-tDCS) using a home-based device. Treatment consisted of one daily stimulation session (30-min, 2-mA, prefrontal cortex) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was a clinician-applied Adult ADHD Report Scale (AARS), inattention section (range 0-36, higher values indicating increased inattention). Analysis of the primary outcome was performed using an ANCOVA controlled for prespecified covariates (baseline AARS, sex, age, ADHD subtype). Results: From July 2019 to July 2021, a total of 147 subjects were assessed for eligibility, and 64 were randomized (mean age=38 years, 30 females). A total of 9 subjects dropped out of the study (4 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The remaining 59 performed an average of 25 tDCS sessions. Baseline (meanSD) AARS was 273.6 in S-tDCS and 27.64 in A-tDCS. In the intention-to-treat analysis (missing data imputed using last observation carried forward), there was a significant decrease of 3.9 (1.50 - 6.44 95% CI) points in the AARS after A-tDCS when compared to S-tDCS (p = 0.002, partial 2 = 0.15).

As such, an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work, we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections. We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that it exacerbates complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism has no impact on viral loads but rather on the host resilience to infection and may have direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions. Author summary Exacerbated complement activation and immune deregulation are at the basis of several pathologies induced by respiratory viruses. Here, we report that complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which inhibits complement activation in healthy cells, increases disease severity upon Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Remarkably, DAF interaction with IAV proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), resulted in excessive complement activation and recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, without affecting viral loads. Furthermore, we observed that viral NA directly cleaves DAF and promotes complement activation, providing a possible link between IAV-DAF interaction and pathology. Therefore, our results unveil a novel pathway that could modulate disease severity, which may help to understand the increased pathogenicity of zoonotic and pandemic IAV infections.","output":"Complement Decay-Accelerating Factor is a modulator of influenza A virus lung immunopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After first being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization [WHO], (2020) in March 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly and in the process altered our very way of life.

These studies investigate three broad topics: Risk perception, decision-making under risk, and risk communication in the context of COVID-19. Collectively, they advance our knowledge of risk calibration, health communication interventions, and decisions about behaviors that address risk in the context of a global health threat. Perhaps most importantly they also make a practical contribution to how we approach these issues going forward.

They have contributed to the emergence of new public health topics (e.g. gynaecological and obstetric violence, long-Covid), the unearthing of testimonials of medical injustice, and in some cases, the creation of new evidence and changes in medical practice. MAIN TEXT: From a theoretical and methodological perspective, we observe two powerful mechanisms at play on social media, which can facilitate the implementation of feminist epidemiological research and address so-called anti-feminist bias: social media as a third space and the power of groups. Social media posts can be seen as inhabiting a third space, akin to what is said off the record or in-between doors, at the end of a therapy session. Researchers somehow miss the opportunity to use the third spaces that people occupy. Similarly, another existing space that researchers are seldom interested in are peer-groups. Peer-groups are the ideal terrain to generate bottom-up research priorities. To some extent, their on-line versions provide a safe and emancipatory space, accessible, transnational, and inclusive. We would argue that this could bring feminist epidemiology to scale. CONCLUSION: Given the emancipatory power of social media, we propose recommendations and practical implications for leveraging the potential of online-sourced feminist epidemiology at different stages of the research process (from design to dissemination), and for increasing synergies between researchers and the community. We emphasise that attention should be paid to patriarchal sociocultural contexts and power dynamics, the mitigation of risks for political recuperation and stigmatisation, and the co-production of respectful discourse on studied populations.","output":"Womens voices on social media: the advent of feminist epidemiology?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Super-spreading events have been observed in the transmission dynamics of many infectious diseases. The 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea has also shown super-spreading events with a significantly high level of heterogeneity in generating secondary cases. It becomes critical to understand the mechanism for this high level of heterogeneity to develop effective intervention strategies and preventive plans for future emerging infectious diseases. In this regard, agent-based modeling is a useful tool for incorporating individual heterogeneity into the epidemic model. In the present work, a stochastic agent-based framework is developed in order to understand the underlying mechanism of heterogeneity. Clinical (i.e., an infectivity level) and social or environmental (i.e., a contact level) heterogeneity are modeled. These factors are incorporated in the transmission rate functions under assumptions that super-spreaders have stronger transmission and/or higher links. Our agent-based model has employed real MERS-CoV epidemic features based on the 2015 MERS-CoV epidemiological data. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under various epidemic scenarios. Our findings highlight the roles of super-spreaders in a high level of heterogeneity, underscoring that the number of contacts combined with a higher level of infectivity are the most critical factors for substantial heterogeneity in generating secondary cases of the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission.","output":"Agent-Based Modeling for Super-Spreading Events: A Case Study of MERS-CoV Transmission Dynamics in the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To regulate a social system comprised of self-interested agents, economic incentives (e.g., taxes, tolls, and subsidies) are often required to induce a desirable outcome. This incentive design problem naturally possesses a bi-level structure, in which an upper-level\\"designer\\"modifies the payoffs of the agents with incentives while anticipating the response of the agents at the lower level, who play a non-cooperative game that converges to an equilibrium. The existing bi-level optimization algorithms developed in machine learning raise a dilemma when applied to this problem: anticipating how incentives affect the agents at equilibrium requires solving the equilibrium problem repeatedly, which is computationally inefficient; bypassing the time-consuming step of equilibrium-finding can reduce the computational cost, but may lead the designer to a sub-optimal solution. To address such a dilemma, we propose a method that tackles the designer's and agents' problems simultaneously in a single loop. In particular, at each iteration, both the designer and the agents only move one step based on the first-order information. In the proposed scheme, although the designer does not solve the equilibrium problem repeatedly, it can anticipate the overall influence of the incentives on the agents, which guarantees optimality. We prove that the algorithm converges to the global optima at a sublinear rate for a broad class of games.","output":"Inducing Equilibria via Incentives: Simultaneous Design-and-Play Finds Global Optima"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the COVID pandemic, the Norwegian government implemented the strictest border controls in modern Norwegian history, barring entry to most foreign nationals. The Prime Minister, Erna Solberg, justified these policies with reference to the rise of new COVID variants and the need to limit visitors to Norway as much as possible. As this approach has severe adverse effects on many people, there is a need to critically examine the justification given for closing the border. In this paper, we argue that while many border restrictions are legitimate, (1) the arguments given for the recent banning of entry for groups of people are not convincing, and (2) that the ban unduly limits personal freedoms and places an unjust burden on transnational citizens and Norwegians with close relations abroad. ? 2021 Akademika Forlag.

METHOD: Data come from a national sample (n = 10,368) of U.S. adults. Using an online platform, information was gathered during the third week of March 2020, and post\\\\stratification weighted to proportionally represent the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and geography. RESULTS: Nearly 15 percent of sampled respondents were categorized as high risk, scoring 7+ on the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire\\\\Revised (SBQ\\\\R). This level of risk varied across social vulnerability groupings: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, families with children, unmarried, and younger respondents reported higher SBQ\\\\R scores than their counterparts (p < .000). Regression results confirm these bivariate differences and also reveal that risk factors (food insecurity, physical symptoms, and CES\\\\D symptomatology) are positive and significantly related to suicidality (p < .000). Additionally, resource measures are significant and negatively related to suicidality (p < .000).

Although children get infected by coronavirus, they are less commonly affected. Only 2% of cases are being reported among patients aged less than 20 years of age and childhood cases constitute around 1C5% of them. Moreover, they are less likely to be seriously affected when compared to adults, with more than 90% of them being either asymptomatic or having mild to moderate disease. This could be attributed to less exposure or sensitivity to COVID-19, varying immune response mechanisms, differences in the expression/function of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptors or higher antibody levels to viruses owing to exposures to multiple respiratory infections, protective role of measles and BCG vaccine, and few associated comorbidities. However, children with certain underlying medical conditions like cardiac or respiratory disease, diabetes, immunodeficiency disorders, cancer or on immunosuppressants may be at a higher risk for developing severe disease.","output":"Recommendations for Pediatric Dermatology Practice during COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brazil has one of the largest biodiversities in the world. The search for new natural products extracted from the Brazilian flora may lead to the discovery of novel drugs with potential to treat infectious and other diseases. Here, we have investigated 9 lectins extracted and purified from the Northeastern Brazilian flora, from both leguminous species: Canavalia brasiliensis (ConBr), C. maritima (ConM), Dioclea lasiocarpa (DLasiL) and D. sclerocarpa (DSclerL), and algae Amansia multifida (AML), Bryothamniom seaforthii (BSL), Hypnea musciformis (HML), Meristiella echinocarpa (MEL) and Solieria filiformis (SfL). They were exposed to a panel of 18 different viruses, including HIV and influenza viruses. Several lectins showed highly potent antiviral activity, often within the low nanomolar range. DSclerL and DLasiL exhibited EC(50) values (effective concentration of lectin required to inhibit virus-induced cytopathicity by 50%) of 9 nM to 46 nM for HIV-1 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively, DLasiL also inhibited feline corona virus at an EC(50) of 5 nM, and DSclerL, ConBr and ConM showed remarkably low EC(50) values ranging from 0.4 to 6 nM against influenza A virus strain H3N2 and influenza B virus. For HIV, evidence pointed to the blockage of entry of the virus into its target cells as the underlying mechanism of antiviral action of these lectins. Overall, the most promising lectins based on their EC(50) values were DLasiL, DSclerL, ConBr, ConM, SfL and HML.

But in suspected cases, where these samples are false-negative, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may prove diagnostic. OBJECTIVES: Hence, the diagnostic yield of BAL for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in cases of non-diagnostic upper respiratory tract samples is reviewed. METHODS: Databases such as MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched using a systematic search strategy. The current study has been in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and has been registered with the International Prospective Registry of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020224088). RESULTS: 911 records were identified at initial database extraction, of which 317 duplicates were removed and, 596 records were screened for inclusion eligibility. We included total 19 studies in the systematic review, and 17 were included in metanalysis. The pooled estimate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in BAL was 11% (95%CI: 0.01C0.24). A sensitivity analysis also showed that the results appear to be robust and minimal risk of bias amongst the studies.

The main objective was to assess clinical and laboratory differences in hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to occurrence of PE. METHODS: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who underwent a computed tomography (CT) angiography for PE clinical suspicion. Clinical data and median blood test results distributed into weekly periods from COVID-19 symptoms onset, were compared between PE and non-PE patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included, 29 (32%) had PE. PE patients were younger (63.9 (SD 13.7) vs 69.9 (SD 12.5) years). Clinical symptoms and COVID-19 CT features were similar in both groups. PE was diagnosed after a mean of 20.0 (SD 8.6) days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Corticosteroid boluses were more frequently used in PE patients (62% vs. 43%). No patients met ISTH DIC criteria. Any parameter was statistically significant or clinically relevant except for D-Dimer when comparing both groups. Median values [IQR] of D-dimer in PE vs non-PE patients were: week 2 (2010.7 [770.1C11208.9] vs 626.0 [374.0C2382.2]; p = 0.004); week 3 (3893.1 [1388.2C6694.0] vs 1184.4 [461.8C2447.8]; p = 0.003); and week 4 (2736.3 [1202.1C8514.1] vs 1129.1 [542.5C2834.6]; p = 0.01). Median fold-increase of D-dimer between week 1 and 2 differed between groups (6.64 [3.02C23.05] vs 1.57 [0.64C2.71], p = 0.003); ROC curve AUC was 0.879 (p = 0.003) with a sensitivity and specificity for PE of 86% and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, D-dimer levels are higher at weeks 2, 3 and 4 after COVID-19 symptom onset in patients who develop PE.

METHODS: In June 2020, PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), Scopus, LitCovid, CINAHL, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were queried for articles using controlled vocabulary and keywords pertaining to COVID-19 and total joint arthroplasty. Studies were characterized by their region of origin, design, and CEBM level of evidence. The identified relevant studies were grouped into six categories: changes to future clinical workflow, education, impact on patients, impact on surgeons, technology, and surgical volume. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on arthroplasty practice, including the disruption of the clinical teaching environment, personal and financial consequences for patients and physicians, and the drastic reduction in surgical volume. New pathways for clinical workflow have emerged, along with novel technologies with applications for both patients and trainees. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the recent trend in arthroplasty toward risk stratification and outpatient surgery, which may result in improved clinical outcomes and significant cost-savings.

COVID-19 is only the latest case of betacoronavirus (-CoV) epidemics/pandemics. In the last 20 years, two deadly CoV epidemics, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; fatality rate 9.6%) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; fatality rate 34.7%), plus the emergence of HCoV-HKU1 which causes the winter common cold (fatality rate 0.5%), were already a source of public health concern. Betacoronaviruses can also be a threat for livestock, as evidenced by the Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS) epizootic in pigs. These repeated outbreaks of -CoV-induced diseases raise the question of the dynamic of propagation of this group of viruses in wildlife and human ecosystems. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-HKU1 emerged in Asia, strongly suggesting the existence of a regional hot spot for emergence. However, there might be other regional hot spots, as seen with MERS-CoV, which emerged in the Arabian Peninsula. -CoVs responsible for human respiratory infections are closely related to bat-borne viruses. Bats are present worldwide and their level of infection with CoVs is very high on all continents. However, there is as yet no evidence of direct bat-to-human coronavirus infection. Transmission of -CoV to humans is considered to occur accidentally through contact with susceptible intermediate animal species. This zoonotic emergence is a complex process involving not only bats, wildlife and natural ecosystems, but also many anthropogenic and societal aspects. Here, we try to understand why only few hot spots of -CoV emergence have been identified despite worldwide bats and bat-borne -CoV distribution. In this work, we analyze and compare the natural and anthropogenic environments associated with the emergence of -CoV and outline conserved features likely to create favorable conditions for a new epidemic. We suggest monitoring South and East Africa as well as South America as these regions bring together many of the conditions that could make them future hot spots.","output":"Emergence of Bat-Related Betacoronaviruses: Hazard and Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first case of coronavirus disease19 (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, as of March 2, 2020, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 89,069 cases in 67 countries and regions.

Part of the reason for this gap in the literature is that the instruments that are used to assess reward responsiveness and optimism in adolescents and adults are usually not suitable for young children. OBJECTIVE: Two behavioral tasks to assess reward learning, a questionnaire on reward responsiveness, and a questionnaire on optimism/pessimism will be tested on their feasibility and reliability in children aged 6-7. Depending on their feasibility and reliability, these instruments will also be used to investigate if reward responsiveness and optimism are associated with mental and social functioning in young children. METHODS: For this cross-sectional pilot study, we adapted a number of tasks and questionnaires to the needs of 6-7-year-old children, by simplification of items, oral rather than written assessment, and reducing the number of conditions and items. We will approach teachers and, with their help, aim to include 70 children aged 6-7 to assess the feasibility and reliability of the tasks and questionnaires. Feasibility measures that will be reported are the proportion of children completing the task/questionnaire, the proportion of children that were able to explain the instructions in their own words to the researcher, and the proportion of children that correctly answered the control questions. The reliability of the scales will be assessed by computing Cronbach  and item-total score correlations and the reliability of the tasks by correlations between different consecutive blocks of trials. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Department of Pedagogy and Educational Sciences. RESULTS: Data collection was originally planned in March and April 2020, but has been postponed due to Corona virus regulations. We expect to collect the data in the first half of 2021. The findings will be disseminated in preprints and peer-reviewed publications. CONCLUSIONS: The development of feasible and reliable instruments for assessing reward responsiveness and optimism in young children is expected to benefit future research on underlying mechanisms of mental and social functioning in young children. If the instruments assessed in this study are usable with young children, it would be particularly interesting to include them in cohort studies because this would enable investigating not only concurrent associations, but also prospective associations between reward responsiveness and optimism early in life and mental and social functioning later in life. If, as we hypothesize, reward responsiveness and optimism are not only associated with (prospective) mental and social functioning in adults and adolescents but also in young children, this could provide a way of identifying vulnerable children already at an early stage.

Therefore, models were developed to predict high and low dengue incidence in order to provide timely forewarnings in the Philippines. METHODS: Model inputs were chosen based on studies indicating variables that may impact dengue incidence. The method first uses Fuzzy Association Rule Mining techniques to extract association rules from these historical epidemiological, environmental, and socio-economic data, as well as climate data indicating future weather patterns. Selection criteria were used to choose a subset of these rules for a classifier, thereby generating a Prediction Model. The models predicted high or low incidence of dengue in a Philippines province four weeks in advance. The threshold between high and low was determined relative to historical incidence data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Model accuracy is described by Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Sensitivity, and Specificity computed on test data not previously used to develop the model. Selecting a model using the F(0.5) measure, which gives PPV more importance than Sensitivity, gave these results: PPV = 0.780, NPV = 0.938, Sensitivity = 0.547, Specificity = 0.978. Using the F(3) measure, which gives Sensitivity more importance than PPV, the selected model had PPV = 0.778, NPV = 0.948, Sensitivity = 0.627, Specificity = 0.974. The decision as to which model has greater utility depends on how the predictions will be used in a particular situation. CONCLUSIONS: This method builds prediction models for future dengue incidence in the Philippines and is capable of being modified for use in different situations; for diseases other than dengue; and for regions beyond the Philippines.

The aim of this paper is to develop a set of metrics for airline catering organisations and explore the choices of SCOR based performance metrics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Case study approach involving an airline catering supply chain organisation is adopted in this research. The SCOR framework is applied in the context of the case study supply chain to develop a performance metrics model for the chain. The performance metrics model is analysed and validated by a set of experts in the case study organisation. The experts are formed into a focus group. The performance metrics were prioritised using MoSCoW method based on the experience of the focus group participants on COVID-19 challenges. Findings: A hierarchical performance measure framework is proposed, and a set of 55 metrics from the SCOR framework is identified and validated for airline catering supply chains. MoSCoW based prioritisation of the metrics by the focus group participants results in 7 Level-1 SCOR metrics and 13 Levels 2 & 3 SCOR metrics been considered as necessary to better mitigate COVID-19 pandemic challenges. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on a single case study and a small number of participants, which limits the generalisability of the results. Practical implications: With the development of performance metrics and the prioritisation presented in this paper, airline catering organisations can monitor their catering logistics performance and use techniques such as MoSCoW to decide performance measures priorities in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to explore convenient and cost-free BFP evaluation indicators to routinely monitor BFP status in Chinese patients with normal-weight obesity. Participants (N = 164) were divided into three groups according to body mass index (BMI) and BFP: normal-weight lean, normal-weight obese, and overweight and obese. Differences in body composition and circumference were compared to examine the relationship between BFP and circumference, determine a simple evaluation indicator reflecting BFP, and identify cutoff values for normal-weight obesity circumference. Significant differences in body composition and circumference were observed among the three groups. The correlation between thigh/height, hip/height, (hip + waist)/height, and BFP was stronger than that with BMI. The (hip + waist)/height ratio was the indicator most reflective of BFP (95% confidence interval: 3.004C9.018, p = 0.013), and a ratio above 1.115 (95% confidence interval: 0.936C0.992, p < 0.001) was predictive of normal-weight obesity.

This openness to trade and investment has transformed the region's economic fortunes, with front-runners such as Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand at the vanguard of global manufacturing in fields as diverse as electronics, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. ASEAN's success as a manufacturing hub would not have been possible without both an openness to trade and the presence of regional supply chains that favorably position Southeast Asia as an essential supplier of raw materials and key components for final assembly in China. But this defining economic model is confronting headwinds that could upend its continued success. The region's policymakers face a difficult set of challenges as they navigate an increasingly disruptive external and internal landscape. policy implications * ASEAN is at the epicenter of growing trade and geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, which raises the threat of decoupling and supply chain reconfiguration and potentially places the region in a difficult position of having to take sides. * Deglobalization and reshoring also pose a risk to manufacturing and investment, which ASEAN states depend on. Protectionist policies are resurging in Europe and the U.S., and the Covid-19 pandemic highlights the fragility of just-in-time supply chain management, encouraging instead a just-in-case approach. This will test the region's ability to sustain its high pace of economic growth to meet rising public aspirations and concerns about stalling social mobility. * Southeast Asia is already facing climate-related devastation due to rising ground temperatures and sea levels.

Our samples consisted of 506 older adults (332 people in 2019 and 174 people in 2020), whose physical, cognitive, depression, and independence in daily and social activities were measured annually. Furthermore, a questionnaire survey (COVID-19 questionnaire) on the impact of the spread of COVID-19 infection on respondents' daily lives (reduction in social interaction, going out, exercise, and sleep time) was conducted among participants in 2020.

If $R_0>1$, then the infectious class uniformly persists for all time; conditions for a globally stable, endemic equilibrium are given. In contrast, the infection goes extinct in finite time with probability one in the stochastic models for all $R_0$ values. To understand the length of the transient prior to extinction as well as the behavior of the transients, the quasi-stationary distributions and the associated mean time to extinction are analyzed using large deviation methods.

Therefore, we aim to estimate the difference of risk for people with rare diseases comparing to the unaffected. METHOD: To estimate the correlation between rare diseases and COVID-19 related death, we performed a retrospective cohort study in Genomics England 100k Genomes participants, who tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 during the first wave (16-03-2020 until 31-July-2020) of COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (n = 283). COVID-19 related mortality rates were calculated in two groups: rare disease patients (n = 158) and unaffected relatives (n = 125). Fishers exact test and logistic regression was used for univariable and multivariable analysis, respectively. RESULTS: People with rare diseases had increased risk of COVID19-related deaths compared to the unaffected relatives (OR [95% CI] = 3.47 [1.21C 12.2]). Although, the effect was insignificant after adjusting for age and number of comorbidities (OR [95% CI] = 1.94 [0.65C5.80]). Neurology and neurodevelopmental diseases was significantly associated with COVID19-related death in both univariable (OR [95% CI] = 4.07 [1.61C10.38]) and multivariable analysis (OR [95% CI] = 4.22 [1.60C11.08]).

The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples suggests the involvement of further mechanisms including autoimmunity. We therefore determined whether anti-neuronal or anti-glial autoantibodies are present in eleven consecutive severely ill COVID-19 patients presenting with unexplained neurological symptoms. These included myoclonus, cranial nerve involvement, oculomotor disturbance, delirium, dystonia and epileptic seizures. Most patients showed signs of CSF inflammation and increased levels of neurofilament light chain. All patients had anti-neuronal autoantibodies in serum or CSF when assessing a large panel of autoantibodies against intracellular and surface antigens relevant for central nervous system diseases using cell-based assays and indirect immunofluorescence on murine brain sections. Antigens included proteins well-established in clinical routine, such as Yo or NMDA receptor, but also a variety of specific undetermined epitopes on brain sections. These included vessel endothelium, astrocytic proteins and neuropil of basal ganglia, hippocampus or olfactory bulb. The high frequency of autoantibodies targeting the brain in the absence of other explanations suggests a causal relationship to clinical symptoms, in particular to hyperexcitability (myoclonus, seizures).

However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present. METHODS: We discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components. RESULTS: When only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.","output":"Accounting for external factors and early intervention adoption in the design and analysis of stepped-wedge designs: Application to a proposed study design to reduce opioid-related mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microneedle (MNs) technology is a recent advancement in biomedical science across the globe.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that KL-6 could diagnose the severity of COVID-19 (AUC=0.862) and predict the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (AUC = 0.741) and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (AUC=0.872). Importantly, the cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that KL-6 rises earlier than the development of lung radiology fibrosis, thus also illuminating the predictive function of KL-6. We set specific values (505U/mL and 674U/mL) for KL-6 in order to assess the risk of pulmonary fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The survival curves for days in hospital show that the higher the KL-6 levels, the longer the hospital stay (P<0.0001). In conclusion, KL-6 could be used as an important predictor to evaluate the secondary pulmonary fibrosis degree for COVID-19.","output":"Krebs Von den Lungen-6 as a predictive indicator for the risk of secondary pulmonary fibrosis and its reversibility in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immense uncertainty and the need for drastic interventions cause politicians to rely heavily on scientific advice for underpinning or legitimating their COVID-19 decision-making.

The emergence of divergent variants in the context of a heterogeneous and evolving neutralizing antibody response in host populations might compromise protection afforded by vaccines or prior infection. METHODSWe measured neutralizing antibody titers in 169 longitudinally collected plasma samples using pseudotypes bearing the Wuhan-hu-1 or the Omicron variant or a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant SARS-CoV-2 spike (PMS20). Plasmas were obtained from convalescents who did or did not subsequently receive an mRNA vaccine, or naive individuals who received 3-doses of mRNA or 1-dose Ad26 vaccines. Samples were collected approximately 1, 5-6 and 12 months after initial vaccination or infection. RESULTSLike PMS20, the Omicron spike protein was substantially resistant to neutralization compared to Wuhan-hu-1. In convalescent plasma the median deficit in neutralizing activity against PMS20 or Omicron was 30- to 60-fold. Plasmas from recipients of 2 mRNA vaccine doses were 30- to 180- fold less potent against PMS20 and Omicron than Wuhan-hu-1. Notably, previously infected or two-mRNA dose vaccinated individuals who received additional mRNA vaccine dose(s) had 38 to 154-fold and 35 to 214-fold increases in neutralizing activity against Omicron and PMS20 respectively. CONCLUSIONSOmicron exhibits similar distribution of sequence changes and neutralization resistance as does a laboratory-designed neutralization-resistant spike protein, suggesting natural evolutionary pressure to evade the human antibody response. Currently available mRNA vaccine boosters, that may promote antibody affinity maturation, significantly ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers.","output":"Plasma neutralization properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 lockdown presented a novel opportunity to study the experiences of people attempting to maintain friendships in the context of worldwide, government-enforced physical distancing and lockdown.

In robotic procedures, we employed a \\"top down technique\\" to allow early identification of the gastrocolic trunk and middle colic vessels. The aim of our study was to illustrate the details of this technique in a series of 12 patients. METHODS The top down technique consists of two steps. First, the omental bursa was entered to identify the right gastroepiploic vein. Tracing down this vein as a landmark, the gastrocolic trunk was exposed, branches of this trunk and the middle colic vessels were divided. Second, dissection was directed to the ileocolic region and proceeded in an inferior-to-superior direction along the superior mesenteric vein to divide the ileocolic and right colic vessels consecutively. The ileotranverse anastomosis was created intracorporeally. RESULTS There were 8 males and 4 females with a mean age of 64.8  16.9 years and a mean body mass index of 25.6  3.7 kg/m2. All the procedures were completed successfully. No conversions occurred. The mean operative time and blood loss were 312.1  93.9 min and 110.0  89.9 ml, respectively.

It is important to understand if current clinical guidance for supporting carers are effective and being utilised for these groups, to help meet their needs. AIMS: To identify the experiential perspectives of siblings and partners of a loved one with an eating disorder compared with guidance for improving the adequacy of support provided to carers published by Beat and Academy for Eating Disorders. METHOD: Three online focus groups were held for ten siblings and five partners from across the UK (12 females and three males). Carers had experience of caring for a loved one with anorexia nervosa (13 carers) or bulimia nervosa (two carers), across a range of therapeutic settings. Focus group transcriptions were analysed with thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified: (a) role-specific needs, (b) challenges encountered by siblings and partners, (c) generic needs and helpful strategies or approaches, and (d) accounts of service provision and family support. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the majority of experiences reported by siblings and partners did not meet the published guidance. Consequently, clinical practice recommendations were identified for services, alongside the charity sector, to take a proactive approach in detecting difficulties, providing skills training and emotional/practical support, adapting/tailoring peer support groups and supporting online facilitation.

A vaccine provides the best hope for a permanent solution to controlling the pandemic. However, to be effective, a vaccine must be accepted and used by a large majority of the population. The aim of this study was to understand the attitudes towards and obstacles facing vaccination with a potential COVID-19 vaccine. To measure these attitudes a survey was administered to 316 respondents across the United States by a survey corporation. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships of several factors with attitudes toward potential COVID-19 vaccination. Prior vaccine usage and attitudes predicted attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Assessment of the severity of COVID-19 for the United States was also predictive. Approximately 68% of all respondents were supportive of being vaccinated for COVID-19, but side effects, efficacy and length of testing remained concerns. Longer testing, increased efficacy and development in the United States were significantly associated with increased vaccine acceptance. Messages promoting COVID-19 vaccination should seek to alleviate the concerns of those who are already vaccine-hesitant.

However, the flexibility of computational experiments leads to arbitrary modeling processes and unconvincing results, which greatly hinder the large-scale application of this method. In this context, the verification of computational models has become an urgent problem in this field. Currently, model evaluation is still in its infancy and the existing evaluation methods are not mature enough. Thus, we took epidemic models as the research object and proposed a capability maturity evaluation framework for computational models of artificial society. The framework differs from previous assessment methods that focus on the validity of results, but instead provides a comprehensive evaluation from two perspectives: 1) evaluation of the model itself--by comparing the expectation with the final implementation, we can obtain whether the model meets the expectation and 2) comparison between different models--by evaluating the implementation process of each model and comparing the results, we can identify more mature models. The implementation of the model is evaluated from input, process, and output. Further, specific analyses and evaluations are conducted for several representative COVID-19 models to verify the validity of this evaluation framework. The results of the case study show that the proposed evaluation framework can help decision-makers identify more mature and referential models, and point out the directions where modelers can improve their models.

In an age where social media is prevalent and long hours are spent browsing through the internet, it is crucial to understand audience engagement. Two of the most common platforms used worldwide are Twitter and Facebook. Both have provided a unique opportunity for the science world;it broadened the horizons for spreading information on current endeavors in the research world. Clinical Neurophysiology and Clinical Neurophysiology Practice, the Official Journals of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology, opened the Twitter and Facebook pages on April 1, 2020. We determined what factors would alter users' engagement. Methods. We employed a multivariate regression analysis. The tested predictor variables included 'days elapsed since the opening (range: 1C100)', 'posting during weekend', 'introduction of a 2020 article', 'author interview', 'inclusion of guidelines or review article', 'COVID19-related information', 'number of hashtags', 'number of attachments', 'presence of colored attachment', and 'attachment of movie'. The dependent variable was the proportion of engaged users, defined as the number of link clicks divided by users who saw the post. Results. Posts including author interviews (p < 0.001) and those introducing guidelines/review articles (p = 0.005) independently increased the proportion of engaged Facebook users. Conversely, posts including a larger number of colored attachments (p < 0.001) and those introducing COVID19-related articles (p = 0.007) independently increased the proportion of engaged Twitter users.

For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics. OBJECTIVES: We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States. DISCUSSION: Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","output":"Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many countries, flexibilizing the retirement transition is seen as an innovative policy which may help to solve some of the problems ageing societies face.

It spells out four dimensions based on which measures of flexibilization can be differentiated, compared and examined more closely: aggregate vs. individual flexibilization (the latter resulting in gradual retirement), the temporal form and reference of flexibilizing measures, accessibility and eligibility, and financial risks and costs resulting from flexible transitions to retirement. These dimensions of comparison are exemplified by referring to existing measures of retirement flexibilization, in particular wage subsidies and partial pensions. Based on the conceptual argument, some of the potential consequences of flexibilized retirement transitions are discussed critically and in particular with regard to questions of social inequality.

Healthcare-associated influenza is prevented through healthcare worker (HCW) vaccination and effective use of U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended infection control practices, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Although effective PPE use may significantly reduce healthcare-associated influenza transmission, PPE adherence among ICU HCWs for preventing nosocomial influenza infection has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE To characterize ICU HCW behavior, knowledge, and attitudes about recommended precautions for the prevention of healthcare-associated influenza infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey of 292 internal medicine housestaff, pulmonary/critical care fellows and faculty, nurses, and respiratory care professionals working in four ICUs in two hospitals in Baltimore, MD. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of those surveyed, 88% (n = 256) completed the survey. Only 63% of respondents were able to correctly identify adequate influenza PPE, and 62% reported high adherence (>80%) with PPE use for prevention of nosocomial influenza. In multivariable modeling, odds of high adherence varied by clinician type. Respondents who believed adherence was inconvenient had lower odds of high adherence (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.82), and those reporting likelihood of being reprimanded for nonadherence were more likely to adhere (odds ratio 2.40, 95% confidence interval 1.25-4.62). CONCLUSIONS ICU HCWs report suboptimal levels of influenza PPE adherence. This finding in a high-risk setting is particularly concerning, given that it likely overestimates actual behavior. Both suboptimal adherence levels and significant PPE knowledge gaps indicate that ICU HCWs may be at a substantial risk of developing and/or transmitting nosocomial respiratory viral infection. Improving respiratory virus infection control will likely require closing knowledge gaps and changing organizational factors that influence behavior.","output":"The use of personal protective equipment for control of influenza among critical care clinicians: A survey study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In recent days, Covid-19 coronavirus has been an immense impact on social, economic fields in the world. The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors. The proposed method has a high prediction rate and works fast for probable accurate identification of the disease. The performance analysis shows that a high rate of accuracy is obtained by the proposed method.","output":"Machine Learning Approach for Confirmation of COVID-19 Cases: Positive, Negative, Death and Release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Communication with remote persons over a video link is common today, e g to connect with family members abroad, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic However, social activities such as board games are rarely shared in this way, as common video chat software does not support this scenario well However, interactive tabletops provide inherent support for natural tangible interaction with items on the tabletop surface We present the Tabletop Teleporter, a setup designed to merge two remote locations into a single shared interaction space We evaluate the system using a board game, focusing on the perceived immersion and connectedness of participants Our evaluation shows that most measures for the social quality of a remotely shared game are not significantly different from one played with co-located participants, and that players prefer our setup over a pure videochat scenario ? 2020 ACM","output":"Tabletop teleporter: Evaluating the immersiveness of remote board gaming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused an urgent necessity for higher education institutions and their teaching staff to move the educational process online in the shortest possible time. It should be admitted that higher education worldwide is changing, and institutions face challenges when adapting to the new COVID-19 reality - blended digital teaching and learning. They are tackling several issues connected with the essence of virtual education, its technical aspect, and students' learning environment. During COVID-19 lockdown, teachers have to prepare and deliver their classes from home, simultaneously coping with numerous professional and technical challenges, often without any appropriate support. In addition to that, they were lack of technology literacy, professional knowledge, and experience needed for successful E-teaching. Besides, a new mode of blended digital teaching and learning also made them consider technical and administrative aspects of the current educational process, namely to use new educational platforms and tools, organize active workflows, and work out critical educational principles to design and facilitate practical online experiences. Along with the challenges that the teachers face in such conditions, they should be able to cope with the stress and psychological disorders of pupils and students. The article emphasizes the abnormal psychology of youngsters (pupils and students) as the result of stress and anxiety that appeared during Covid lockdown - the application of psychological science to understanding and treating mental disorders - and the use of video as a productive means of avoiding psychological disabilities. The research objective is to prove that video is an effective educational tool for avoiding psychological difficulties in blended digital learning during COVID-19 lockdown while teaching foreign languages, literature, and culture. Special attention is paid to psychological strategies of overcoming stress during COVID-19 lockdown, as well as to effective ways to students' adapt to a virtual learning environment, development and implementation of anti-stress methods, which heighten their motivation. The article also heads on and explores potential solutions to educational problems that one can encounter in the new educational process at the post-COVID-19 epidemic period, such as the quality of education offered, its cost and availability, internationalization, and employability.","output":"Psychological Difficulties during the Covid Lockdown: Video in Blended Digital Teaching Language, Literature, and Culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has created an extraordinary global health crisis. However, with limited understanding of the effects of COVID-19 during pregnancy, clinicians and patients are forced to make uninformed decisions. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the literature and report the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched from November 1(st), 2019 and March 28(th), 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Primary studies, reported in English, investigating COVID-19-positive pregnant women and reporting their pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data in relation to clinical presentation, investigation were maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted and analysed using summary statistics. Hypothesis testing was performed to examine differences in time-to-delivery. Study quality was assessed using the ICROMS tool. MAIN RESULTS: Of 73 identified articles, nine were eligible for inclusion (n = 92). 67.4% (62/92) of women were symptomatic at presentation. RT-PCR was inferior to CT-based diagnosis in 31.7% (26/79) of cases. Maternal mortality rate was 0% and only one patient required intensive care and ventilation. 63.8% (30/47) had preterm births, 61.1% (11/18) fetal distress and 80% (40/50) a Caesarean section. 76.92% (11/13) of neonates required NICU admission and 42.8% (40/50) had a low birth weight. There was one indeterminate case of potential vertical transmission. Mean time-to-delivery was 4.33.08 days (n = 12) with no difference in outcomes (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-positive pregnant women present with fewer symptoms than the general population and may be RT-PCR negative despite having signs of viral pneumonia.

Results showed that both COVID-19-related worries and IU were found to be positively associated with PTSSs. An interaction with formal media consumption was found, so that when one's formal media consumption was high, he or she were most vulnerable to the aforementioned effects on the development of PTSSs. Our findings point to the interactive effects of both COVID-19 worries and IU with media consumption on the development of PTSSs.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for consideration of alternative anaesthetic techniques to a general anaesthetic (GA). This audit looks at the anaesthetic practice for i&d of abscess on the emergency list pre and post COVID-19, to help determine if there is an impact on post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pain, and duration of hospital stay.MethodsPatients undergoing an i&d of lower body abscess were identified between 1/1/20 C 29/2/20 (pre COVID-19) and 1/3/20 C 9/5/20 (post COVID-19). The patients electronic records were reviewed and the following data collected: age, ASA, gender, weight, BMI, co-morbidities, inflammatory markers, NEWS score, anaesthetic administered, post op anti-emetics and analgesics, problems encountered and duration of stay.ResultsThere were 49 cases from 1/1/20 C 29/2/20 (pre COVID-19) and 36 from 1/3/20 C 9/5/20 (post COVID-19). Of the pre COVID-19 cases 42/49 (85.7%) cases were done under GA and 1/49 (2%) under spinal. Of the post COVID-19 cases 50% were done under spinal and 50% were done under GA. Of the patients receiving a GA, 1/60 (2%) required an antiemetic in recovery and 30/60 (50%) required analgesia in recovery. Of the patients receiving a spinal, 2/19 (11%) required an antiemetic in recovery and 3/19 (16%) required analgesia in recovery. Of the patients receiving a spinal 13/19 (68%) were discharged on the same day of surgery compared to 42/60 (70%) patients receiving GA.ConclusionThe results of this audit (although small) provide evidence that having a spinal does not lengthen a patients stay in hospital and may offer superior pain relief post-operatively. Although more patients were receiving spinals post COVID-19, there were still 50% of cases done under GA, which is possibly due to hesitancy of inserting spinal in the presence of systemic infection.","output":"Audit of anaesthetic practice for incision and drainage of lower body abscesses before and after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for an ongoing human pandemic (COVID-19).

Within the model, teachers activity is viewed as diagnosing students mathematical activity, managing uncertainties due to the characteristics of the situation and decision-making about didactic interventions. The study extends our earlier work and focuses on teachers interventions in DT-based lessons, as they manage disturbances caused by unexpected difficulties. Our first observation is that there is a substantial change in how teachers diagnose these difficulties compared to paper-and-pencil environments. Notably, they need to make more inferences about the pedagogical support that is provided. Second, we show that in such conditions, rather than facing the single dynamicity of the class as a whole, the teacher has to deal with multiple, open dynamic situations (small groups named mini-classes), which are themselves intertwined in the dynamics of students interactions with technology. Moreover, even if teachers are able to make reliable inferences concerning an individual students current difficulties, they must also be able to make inferences about the scope of such difficulties within the class as a whole. We present four case studies that illustrate the diverse approaches that teachers take when managing such open dynamic situations and use them to illustrate the concepts and analytical tools that are introduced.","output":"Open Dynamic Situations of Classroom Use of Digital Technologies: Investigating Teachers Interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Chemical-biological-radiological-nuclear-explosive (CBRNe) are complex events. Decontamination is mandatory to avoid harm and contain hazardous materials, but can delay care. Therefore, the stabilization of patients in the warm zone seems reasonable, but research is limited. Moreover, subjects involved in biological events are considered infectious even after decontamination and need to be managed while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), as seen with Ebola and COVID-19 pandemic. With this simulation mannequin trial, we assessed the impact of CBRNe PPE on cardiopulmonary resuscitation and combat casualty care procedures. METHODS: We compared procedures performed by emergency medicine and anesthesiology senior residents, randomized in 2 groups (CBRNe PPE vs. no PPE). Chest compression (CC) depth was defined as the primary outcome. Time to completion was calculated for the following: tourniquet application; tension pneumothorax needle decompression; peripheral venous access (PVA) and intraosseous access positioning; and drug preparation and administration. A questionnaire was delivered to evaluate participants' perception. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents participated. No significant difference between the groups in CC depth (mean difference = 0.26 cm [95% confidence interval = -0.26 to 0.77 cm, P = 0.318]), as well as for CC rate, CC complete release, and time for drugs preparation and administration was detected. The PPE contributed to significantly higher times for tourniquet application, tension pneumothorax decompression, peripheral venous access, and intraosseous access positioning. The residents found simulation relevant to the residencies' core curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be performed while wearing PPE without impacting quality, whereas other tasks requiring higher dexterity can be significantly impaired by PPE.Trial Registration Number: NCT04367454, April 29, 2020 (retrospectively registered).","output":"Life-Saving Procedures Performed While Wearing CBRNe Personal Protective Equipment: A Mannequin Randomized Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To determine the performance of radiologists with different levels of expertise regarding the differentiation of COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias. Chest CT to identify patients suffering from COVID-19 has been reported to be limited by its low specificity for distinguishing COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias (\\"COVID-19 mimics\\"). Meanwhile, the understanding of the morphologic patterns of COVID-19 has improved and they appear to be fairly specific. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 02/2020 and 04/2020, 60 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia underwent chest CT in our department. Cases were matched with a comparable control group of 60 patients of similar age, sex, and comorbidities, who underwent chest CT prior to 01/2020 for atypical pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Included were other viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens. All 120 cases were blinded to patient history and were reviewed independently by two radiologists and two radiology residents. Readers rated the probability of COVID-19 pneumonia according to the COV-RADS classification system. Results were analyzed using Clopper-Pearson 95 % confidence intervals, Youden's Index for test quality criteria, and Fleiss' kappa statistics. RESULTS Overall, readers were able to correctly identify the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia in 219/240 (sensitivity: 91 %; 95 %-CI; 86.9 %-94.5 %), and to correctly attribute CT findings to COVID-19 mimics in 159/240 ratings (specificity: 66.3 %; 59.9 %-72.2 %), yielding an overall diagnostic accuracy of 78.8 % (378/480; 74.8 %-82.3 %). Individual reader accuracy ranged from 74.2 % (89/120) to 84.2 % (101/120) and did not correlate significantly with reader expertise. Youden's Index was 0.57. Between-reader agreement was moderate ( = 0.53). CONCLUSION In this enriched cohort, radiologists were able to distinguish COVID-19 from \\"COVID-19 mimics\\" with moderate diagnostic accuracy. Accuracy did not correlate with reader expertise. KEY POINTS  In a scenario of direct comparison (no negative findings), CT allows the differentiation of COVID-19 from other atypical pneumonias (\\"COVID mimics\\") with moderate accuracy..  Reader expertise did not significantly influence these results..

Concerted efforts are made to admit infected children together with their caregivers as a family unit.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the psychological experiences of children and their caregivers isolated in hospital due to COVID-19.MethodsA prospective mixed-methods design was used to evaluate the psychological status of hospitalised family units where at least one child < 18 years had SARS-CoV-2 infection.Patient medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical information. Parents and children >7 years old underwent a telephone-based interview performed by a trained psychologist to explore their understanding of the infection, hospital isolation, and pandemic.Two self-reported questionnaire instruments were used to assess anxiety and depression C the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) in adults;SMFQ for children with the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) Questionnaire in children 7 years old.Parents were asked to score their opinion and emotions relating to their experience in isolation on a Likert scale of 1 to 5 on a series of qualitative questionnaires.ResultsFifteen family units were admitted in our institution between March-May 2020 and were invited to participate. 11 (73%) family units were recruited- 9 child-adult dyads, a triad of 2 children and 1 adult, and 1 child who was admitted alone. The mean length of hospitalization was 25.5 days (range 20C31 days). The mean age of children admitted was 5.1 years (8 months C 12.3 years). Five children were 7 years old and all completed interviews and questionnaires. All caregivers interviewed were positive for COVID-19. Nine parental questionnaires and 10 adult interviews were completed.Parents were overall more anxious for their children than themselves. Most common sources of anxiety were the frequency of swab tests, and uncertainty regarding swab results and duration of isolation. 44.4% of adults vs 60% of children had symptoms indicative of generalized anxiety disorder, and 66.7% of adults vs 80% of children had symptoms indicative of separation anxiety disorder. 80% of parents reported being sad about separation from other family members who were not admitted. None of the participants met criteria suggestive of depression on the SMFQ.ConclusionsFamilies were anxious about their admission despite being admitted as a family unit. Main sources of anxiety were procedural discomfort and prolonged isolation of the child. Children appeared more susceptible to separation anxiety, possibly due to limited understanding of the situation.Clear timely parental communications to provide information on clinical management and anticipated discharge should be encouraged. We recommend routine psychological assessment for all children and family units, with focus on reassurance and early recognition of evolving anxiety disorders.

We aim to compare the nature and volume of the paediatric trauma during the first 2020 UK lockdown period with the same period in 2019. METHODS: Prospective data was collected from 23 March 2020 to 14 June 2020 and compared with retrospective data collected from 23 March 2019 to 14 June 2019. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, nature of the injury, and details of any surgery were tabulated and statistically analyzed using the independent-samples t-test for normally distributed data and the Mann-Whitney-U test for non-parametric data. Additionally, patients were contacted by telephone to further explore the mechanism of injury where required, to gain some qualitative insight into the risk factors for injury. RESULTS: The 2020 lockdown resulted in 30% fewer paediatric trauma presentations (441 vs 306), but no significant change in the number of patients requiring surgery (47 vs 51; p = 0.686). Trampolining injuries increased in absolute numbers by 168% (p < 0.001), almost four times more common when considered as percentage of all injuries observed in 2020 vs 2019. There was a decrease in high energy trauma from road traffic accidents and falls from height (21.5% decrease, p < 0.001). Despite a shift towards more conservative treatment options, trampolining injuries continued to require surgery in similar proportions (19.4 vs 20%; p = 0.708). Qualitative investigation revealed that the most common risk factor for trampolining injury was concurrent usage, especially with an older child. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in a decrease in paediatric orthopaedic presentations and high energy trauma. However, due to a marked increase in home trampolining injuries, and their unchanged requirement for surgery, there has been no change in the requirement for surgery during the lockdown period. As home exercise becomes more prevalent, a duty of public health falls upon clinicians to advise parents against trampoline usage.

The majority of cleft surgery is elective, and as a result, almost all cleft surgery was suspended across the UK in March 2020 during the first national lockdown. The UK has centralised regional Cleft Services which all use the same agreed target-age standards for primary surgery including lip and palate repairs. The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) response has caused a delay in carrying out procedures. The severity of this delay depends on the impact of COVID-19 on local trusts and R-value within that region. As the country goes through the second and third wave, the impact could be long lasting, and we aimed to quantify it so that the data could be used to guide service prioritisation in the NHS and help future workforce planning. METHODS An online survey was designed based on the cleft quality dashboard indicators and circulated nationally to all nine cleft regions in the UK. The survey was divided into three main headings: ? Duration of suspended cleft services ? Quantification of the impact on delayed in surgery/services ? Changes needed to restart surgery/services RESULTS: We obtained a 60% response rate with five completed surveys from five out of nine regions. All regions reported that they suspended their cleft services in March 2020 around the time of the first wave and the first national lockdown. There has been an impact on delayed surgical and clinical interventions for cleft patients. Regions were affected differently with some on an exponential waiting list growth projection, whereas other teams are on track to recover from the backlog within 7-22 weeks. There has been an impact on the allied health professionals' services within the cleft multidisciplinary team. The cleft nurses' 24-h reviews, Speech And Language Therapy (SALT), and psychology maintained service delivery in some format. Patient-facing services such as audiology and dentistry were significantly disrupted and continue to experience delays due to reduced capacity. CONCLUSIONS Various regions have seen a varied impact from COVID-19 on their services, from all cleft regions there seems to be an impact on achieving surgery within the national target age. The adverse effect of the COVID-19 impact is unlikely to be known for a few years to come; however, the data are a useful guide when supporting the allocation of resources within the healthcare setting. A prospective long-term study is required to assess the impact of COVID-19 on cleft surgery, follow-up, assess access to allied health professional MDT clinics, and long-term complications.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on cleft services in Great Britain & Northern Ireland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Eleven, 11 and 2 of 11 precolostral sera from normal calves and 13, 14 and 9 of 14 sera from normal fetuses, 7 to 10 months of gestation, neutralized bovine parvovirus, coronavirus and rotavirus, respectively.

For instance, it has been demonstrated that ACE2 is the primary receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry to many human cells through binding to the viral spike S protein. Consequently, genetic variability in ACE2 gene has been suggested to contribute to the variable clinical manifestations in COVID-19. Many of those genetic variations result in missense variants within the amino acid sequence of ACE2. The potential effects of those variations on binding to the spike protein has been speculated and, in some case, demonstrated experimentally. However, their effects on ACE2 protein folding, trafficking and subcellular targeting have not been established. Results: : In this study we aimed to examine the potential effects of 28 missense variants (V801G, D785N, R768W, I753T, L731F, L731I, I727V, N720D, R710H, R708W, S692P, E668K, V658I, N638S, A627V, F592L, G575V, A501T, I468V, M383I, G173S, N159S, N149S, D38E, N33D, K26R, I21T, S19P) distributed across the ACE2 receptor domains on its subcellular trafficking and targeting through combinatorial approach involving in silico analysis and experimental subcellular localization analysis. Our data show that none of the studied missense variants (including 3 variants predicted to be deleterious R768W, G575V and G173S) has a significant effect on ACE2 intracellular trafficking and subcellular targeting to the plasma membrane. Conclusion: Loss of proper trafficking and targeting of ACE2 is expected to lead to loss of the protein function and therefore our results support the notion that loss of this protein function is not tolerated in humans due to its many essential physiological functions.","output":"Characterization of ACE2 naturally occurring missense variants: impact on subcellular localization and trafficking (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the Coronavirus Infection Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the number of patients released from quarantine is exceeding the number of newly diagnosed cases.

A total of 1604 subjects were selected for the final analysis. Of these, 1145 (71.4%) had one consultation and 459 (28.6%) had two or more. The group that had two or more consultations reported significantly more physical symptoms, more psychological symptoms (including depression), and more psychological stress. Multivariate forward selection logistic regression analysis showed that re-confirmed cases of COVID-19, physical symptoms after quarantine, feelings of depression, and psychological stress had a significant effect on the number of consultations received. In conclusion, COVID-19 has various physical and mental sequelae after discharge from quarantine. Therefore, a well-structured follow-up program is needed after recovery.","output":"A Well-Structured Follow-Up Program is Required after Recovery from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19);Release from Quarantine is Not the End of Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic's effects on nephrology fellows' educational experiences, preparedness for practice, and emotional wellbeing are unknown. METHODS: We recruited current adult and pediatric fellows and 2020 graduates of nephrology training programs in the United States to participate in a survey measuring COVID-19's effects on their training experiences and wellbeing. RESULTS: Of 1005 nephrology fellows-in-training and recent graduates, 425 participated (response rate 42%). Telehealth was widely adopted (90% for some or all outpatient nephrology consults), as was remote learning (76% of conferences were exclusively online). Most respondents (64%) did not have in-person consults on COVID-19 inpatients; these patients were managed by telehealth visits (27%), by in-person visits with the attending faculty without fellows (29%), or by another approach (9%). A majority of fellows (84%) and graduates (82%) said their training programs successfully sustained their education during the pandemic, and most fellows (86%) and graduates (90%) perceived themselves as prepared for unsupervised practice. Although 42% indicated the pandemic had negatively affected their overall quality of life and 33% reported a poorer work-life balance, only 15% of 412 respondents who completed the Resident Well-Being Index met its distress threshold. Risk for distress was increased among respondents who perceived the pandemic had impaired their knowledge base (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00 to 4.77) or negatively affected their quality of life (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.29 to 5.46) or work-life balance (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.18 to 4.71).

Governments have responded by shuttering economies, limiting social interactions and refocusing healthcare. There are implications for antibiotic resistance both during and after these events. During spring 2020, COVID-19-stressed ICUs relaxed stewardship, perhaps promoting resistance. Counterpoised to this, more citizens died at home and total hospital antibiotic use declined, reducing selection pressure. Restricted travel and social distancing potentially reduced community import and transmission of resistant bacteria, though hard data are lacking. The future depends on the vaccines now being deployed. Unequivocal vaccine success should allow a swift return to normality. Vaccine failure followed by extended and successful non-pharmaceutical suppression may lead to the same point, but only after some delay, and with indefinite travel restrictions; sustainability is doubtful. Alternatively, failure of vaccines and control measures may prompt acceptance that we must live with the virus, as in the prolonged 1889C94 influenza (or coronavirus OC43) pandemic.

There are many suggested ways to improve pain after rotator cuff surgery, but the effects of adopting a pathway that includes formal patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and extensive multimodal analgesia are unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does adoption of a clinical pathway incorporating patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and preemptive multimodal analgesia reduce the worst pain during the first 48 hours after surgery compared with current standard institutional practices? (2) Does adoption of the pathway reduce opioid use? (3) Does adoption of the pathway reduce side effects and improve patient-oriented outcomes? METHODS: From September 2018 to January 2020, 281 patients scheduled for arthroscopic ambulatory rotator cuff surgery were identified for this paired sequential prospective cohort study. Among patients in the control group, 177 were identified, 33% (58) were not eligible, for 11% (20) staff was not available, 56% (99) were approached, 16% (29) declined, 40% (70) enrolled, and 40% (70) were analyzed (2% [4] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). For patients in the pathway cohort, 104 were identified, 17% (18) were not eligible, for 11% (11) staff was not available, 72% (75) were approached, 5% (5) declined, 67% (70) enrolled, and 67% (70) were analyzed (3% [3] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). No patients were lost to follow-up for primary outcome; for secondary outcomes, four were lost in the control group and three in the pathway group after postoperative day 2 (p = 0.70). The initial 70 patients enrolled received routine care (control group), and in a subsequent cohort, 70 patients received care guided by a pathway (pathway group). Of the 205 eligible patients, 68% (140) were included in the analysis. This was not a study comparing two tightly defined protocols but rather a study to determine whether adoption of a pathway would alter patient outcomes. For this reason, we used a pragmatic (real-world) study design that did not specify how control patients would be treated, and it did not require that all pathway patients receive all components of the pathway. We developed the pathway in coordination with a group of surgeons and anesthesiologists who agreed to apply the pathway as much as was viewed practical for each individual patient. Patients in both groups received a brachial plexus nerve block with sedation. Major differences between the pathway and control groups were: detailed patient education regarding reasonable pain expectations with a goal of reducing opioid use (no formal educational presentation was given to the control), a long-acting nerve block using bupivacaine with dexamethasone (control patients often received shorter-acting local anesthetic without perineural dexamethasone), and preemptive multimodal analgesia including intraoperative ketamine, postoperative acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentin at bedtime, with opioids as needed (control patients received postoperative opioids but most did not get postoperative NSAIDS and no controls received gabapentin or separate prescriptions for acetaminophen). The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) worst pain with movement 0 to 48 hours after block placement. The NRS pain score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) [12] for NRS that was used for calculation of the study sample size was 1.3 [18], although some authors suggest 1 [13] or 2 [5] are appropriate; if we had used an MCID of 2, the sample size would have been smaller. Secondary outcomes included NRS pain scores at rest, daily opioid use (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), block duration, patient-oriented pain questions (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), and patient and physician adherence to pathway. RESULTS: On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had lower worst pain with movement (3.3  3.1) compared with control patients (5.6  3.0, mean difference -2.7 [95% CI -3.7 to -1.7]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for pain at rest (1.9  2.3 versus 4.0  2.9, mean difference -2.0 [95% CI -2.8 to -1.3]; p < 0.001). Cumulative postoperative opioid use (0-48 hours) was reduced (pathway oral morphine equivalent use was 23  28 mg versus 44  35 mg, mean difference 21 [95% CI 10 to 32]; p < 0.01). The greatest difference in opioid use was in the first 24 hours after surgery (pathway 7  12 mg versus control 21  21 mg, mean difference -14 [95% CI -19 to -10]; p < 0.01). On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had less interference with staying asleep compared with control patients (0.5  1.6 versus 2.6  3.3, mean difference -2.2 [95% CI -3.3 to -1.1]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for interference with activities (0.9  2.3 versus 1.9  2.9, mean difference -1.1 [95% CI -2 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). Satisfaction with pain treatment on postoperative day 1 was higher among pathway patients compared with control patients (9.2  1.7 versus 8.2  2.5, mean difference 1.0 [95% CI 0.3 to 1.8]; p < 0.001). On postoperative day 2, pathway patients had lower nausea scores compared with control patients (0.3  1.1 versus 1  2.1, mean difference -0.7 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.1]; p = 0.02); lower scores were also seen for drowsiness on postoperative day 1 (1.7  2.7 versus 2.6  2.6, mean difference -0.9 [95% CI - 1.7 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Adoption of the pathway was associated with improvement in the primary outcome (pain with movement) that exceeded the MCID. Patients in the pathway group had improved patient-oriented outcomes and fewer side effects. This pathway uses multiple analgesic drugs, which may pose risks to elderly patients, in particular. Therefore, in evaluating whether to use this pathway, clinicians should weigh the effect sizes against the potential risks that may emerge with large scale use, consider the difficulties involved in adapting a pathway to local practice so that pathway will persist, and recognize that this study only enrolled patients among surgeons and the anesthesiologists that advocated for the pathway; results may have been different with less enthusiastic clinicians. This pathway, based on a long-lasting nerve block, multimodal analgesia, and patient education can be considered for adoption.

Since group exercise fosters cohesion, we sought to determine if paired exercise would have similar, positive effects. An experiential study design was used to compare the effect of exercise (12 weeks) on psychosocial health in paired versus individually trained cancer patients. METHODS: Female cancer patients (n = 28) who completed cancer treatment were placed into either the singly trained or paired group. Groups were matched for cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption, single: 24.1  7.4, pair: 24.8  6.3 ml/kg/min) and age (single: 58  12, pair: 58  9 years). Patients participated in 36, 90-min exercise sessions in accordance with exercise recommendations. QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, FACT-G), depressive, fatigue, and insomnia symptoms were measured before, midway, and after the intervention. Fitness was measured pre- and post-intervention. Participants did not meet prior to the intervention. Two-way ANOVAs and multiple comparisons tests were used to detect differences (p < 0.05). RESULTS: Emotional well-being and total FACT-G scores were significantly improved in the paired but not individually trained patients. Depressive symptoms were significantly improved at mid- and final time points in the paired group. Paired patients reported significant improvements in insomnia symptoms from pre- to mid-intervention. Depressive and insomnia symptoms in the individually trained group were unchanged.

SETTING: A single tertiary-care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Our study cohort included patients &#8805;18 years of age who had semiurgent or urgent hospital procedures or surgeries. METHODS: Overall, 625 patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using a combination of phone questionnaire (7 days prior to the anticipated procedure), RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) between March 1, 2020, and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 625 patients, 520 scans (83.2%) were interpreted as normal; 1 (0.16%) had typical features of COVID-19; 18 scans (2.88%) had indeterminate features of COVID-19; and 86 (13.76%) had atypical features of COVID-19. In total, 640 RT-PCRs were performed, with 1 positive result (0.15%) in a patient with a CT scan that yielded an atypical finding. Of the 18 patients with chest CTs categorized as indeterminate, 5 underwent repeat negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab 1 week after their initial swab. Also, 1 patient with a chest CT categorized as typical had a follow-up repeat negative RT-PCR, indicating that the chest CT was likely a false positive. After surgery, none of the patients developed signs or symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 that would indicate the need for a repeated RT-PCR or CT scan.

Aims: To give the information on clinical characteristics and different durations of COVID-19 and to identify the potential risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 77 patients (mean age: 52 years; 44.2% males) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing YouAn Hospital during 21st Jan and 8th February 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and radiological data on admission were collected; complications and outcomes were followed up until 29th February 2020. The study endpoint was the discharge within two weeks. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to identify risk factors for longer hospitalization duration. Results: Of 77 patients, there are 34 (44.2%) males, 24 (31.2%) with comorbidities, 22 (28.6%) lymphopenia, 20 (26.0%) categorized as severe patients, and 28 (36.4%) occurred complications. By the end of follow-up, 64 (83.1%) patients were discharged home after being tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infections, 8 remained in hospital and 5 died. 36 (46.8%) patients were discharged within 14 days and thus reached the study endpoint, including 34 (59.6%) of 57 non-severe patients and 2 (10%) of 20 severe patients. The overall cumulative probability of the endpoint was 48.3%. Hospital length of stay and duration of exposure to discharge for 64 discharged patients were 13 (10-16.5) and 23 (18-24.5) days, respectively. Multivariable stepwise Cox regression model showed bilateral pneumonia on CT scan, shorter time from the illness onset to admission, the severity of disease and lymphopenia were independently associated with longer hospitalized duration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Using clinicaltrials.gov, we found information related to ongoing clinical studies on potential drugs for COVID-19 which are also used in MS therapy. The outcomes of several trials were published on pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. RESULTS There were 18 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness and safety of interferon-, fingolimod, or leflunomide in COVID-19. Some trial outcomes available at pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov suggested an association of these drug treatments with improvements in signs and symptoms, and the disease course.

Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of 20 M, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2-3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3) were treated. Time of addition and plaque reduction assays showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.","output":"Suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture by interfering with early steps of the replication cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic in the spring of 2020.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic and led a huge impact on the health of human and daily life. It has been demonstrated that physical and psychological conditions of hospitalised COVID-19 patients are impaired, but the studies focus on physical and psychological conditions of COVID-19 patients after discharge from hospital are rare. DESIGN: A multicentre follow-up study. METHODS: This was a multicentre follow-up study of COVID-19 patients who had discharged from six designated hospitals. Physical symptoms and HRQoL were surveyed at first follow-up (the third month after discharge). The latest multiple laboratory findings were collected through medical examination records. This study was performed and reported in accordance with STROBE checklist. RESULTS: Three hundred eleven patients (57.6%) were reported with one or more physical symptoms. The scores of HRQoL of COVID-19 patients at third month after discharge, except for the dimension of general health, were significantly lower than Chinese population norm (p < .001). Results of logistic regression showed that female (odds ratio (OR): 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-3.06), older age (&#8805;60 years) (OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.33-4.47) and the physical symptom after discharge (OR: 40.15, 95% CI: 9.68-166.49) were risk factors for poor physical component summary; the physical symptom after discharge (OR: 6.68, 95% CI: 4.21-10.59) was a risk factor for poor mental component summary. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality of life of discharged COVID-19 patients did not come back to normal at third month after discharge and affected by age, sex and the physical symptom after discharge.

The development and validation of new testing supplies and equipment, including collection swab, help expand the availability and capability for various diagnostic, therapeutic, and protective medical devices in high demand during the COVID-19 emergency. Here, we report the validation of a new injection-molded anterior nasal swab, ClearTip, that was experimentally validated in a laboratory setting as well as in independent clinical studies in comparison to gold standard flocked swabs. We have also developed an in vitro anterior nasal tissue model, that offers an efficient and clinically relevant validation tool to replicate with high fidelity the clinical swabbing workflow, while being accessible, safe, reproducible, time and cost effective. ClearTip displayed a greater efficiency of release of inactivated virus in the benchtop model, confirmed by greater ability to report positive samples in a clinical study in comparison to flocked swabs. We also quantified in multi-center pre-clinical and clinical studies the detection of biological materials, as proxy for viral material, that showed a statistically significant difference in one study and a slight reduction in performance in comparison to flocked swabs. Taken together these results underscore the compelling benefits of non-absorbent injected molded anterior nasal swab for COVID-19 detection, comparable to standard flocked swabs.

To fill this gap, we collected various B-cell fractions from bone marrow and tonsil donors, performed RNA-seq, and examined transcript variants. We identified 150 genes that harbor local splicing variations in all pairwise comparisons. One of them encodes FBXW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated as a cancer driver in several blood cancers. Surprisingly, we discovered that in normal human pro-B cells, the predominant transcript utilized an alternative first exon to produce the poorly characterized FBXW7 isoform, previously thought to be restricted to neural tissues. The FBXW7 transcript was also abundant in cell lines and primary samples of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which originates in the bone marrow. When overexpressed in a heterologous cell system, this transcript yielded the expected protein product, as judged by anti-FLAG immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, in REH B-ALL cells, FBXW7 mRNA was the only FBXW7 isoform enriched in the polyribosome fraction. To shed light on possible functions of FBXW7, we utilized gain- and loss-of-function approaches and identified an FBXW7-dependent inflammatory gene signature, apparent in a subset of B-ALL with high FBXW7 expression. This signature contained several members of the TNF superfamily, including those comprising the HLA Class III cluster (LTB, LST1, NCR3, LTA, and NFKBIL1). Our findings suggest that FBXW7 expression drives proinflammatory responses, which could contribute to normal B-cell development, leukemogenesis and responses to anti-cancer therapies.

However, utilization of SoMe in the European neurosurgical community has not been assessed systematically. METHODS: An online search was undertaken to discover SoMe accounts of (1) national and related neurosurgical societies listed on the EANS website, (2) neurosurgical journals present on EANS website, (3) neurosurgery centers within EANS member countries, as listed on their website. SoMe accounts of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram were searched for journals and societies, and Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for neurosurgery departments. The number of likes/followers/subscribers was recorded. RESULTS: Five (31%) neurosurgery journals had a SoMe presence. The highest number of followers, likes, and tweets was found for JNNP, and Journal of Neurological Surgery Part B had the most subscribers and video views. SoMe usage was identified for 11 national (28.2%) and 2 multi-national neurosurgical societies. From these, the French Society of Neurosurgery had the largest number of Facebook followers (> 2800) and Likes (> 2700), the Society of British Neurological Surgeons had the largest number of Twitter followers (> 2850), whereas EANS overall had the most followers on Twitter > 5100 and Facebook > 5450.

Nasal sodium transport may reflect alveolar transport. The primary objective of this prospective, observational study was to determine if reduced nasal sodium transport, as measured by nasal potential difference (NPD), was predictive of the development of and outcome from ARDS. METHODS NPD was measured in 15 healthy controls and in 88 patients: 40 mechanically ventilated patients defined as 'at-risk' for ARDS, 61 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (13 who were previously included in the 'at-risk' group) and 8 ARDS survivors on the ward. RESULTS In at-risk subjects, maximum NPD (mNPD) was greater in those who developed ARDS (difference -8.4 mV; 95% CI -13.8 to -3.7; p=0.005) and increased mNPD predicted the development of ARDS before its onset (area under the curve (AUC) 0.75; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89). In the ARDS group, mNPD was not significantly different for survivors and non-survivors (p=0.076), and mNPD was a modest predictor of death (AUC 0.60; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75). mNPD was greater in subjects with ARDS (-30.8 mV) than in at-risk subjects (-24.2 mV) and controls (-19.9 mV) (p<0.001). NPD values were not significantly different for survivors and controls (p=0.18). CONCLUSIONS Increased NPD predicts the development of ARDS in at-risk subjects but does not predict mortality. NPD increases before ARDS develops, is greater during ARDS, but is not significantly different for controls and survivors. These results may reflect the upregulated sodium transport necessary for alveolar fluid clearance in ARDS. NPD may be useful as a biomarker of endogenous mechanisms to stimulate sodium transport.

Although these vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 for a short period, safety and efficiency evaluations should be continuously monitored over a long time period. As the time of writing, more than 10 projects are now in phase 3 to evaluate the prevention of infection in double-blind studies. Hopefully, several projects may be approved to ensure high-efficiency and safe vaccines.","output":"Development of COVID-19 vaccines utilizing gene therapy technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Acrochordons are benign hypertrophic lesions of the skin of which the pathophysiology is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association of acrochordons with autoimmune disorders in patients with a poor obstetric history. METHODS: This retrospective cohort involved 350 female patients with poor obstetric history who were included in a preconceptional care program to investigate risk factors for obstetric complications. These patients were further investigated for the co-existence of autoimmune disorders (defined by either a diagnosis of autoimmune diseases or autoimmune antibody positivity) and acrochordons. RESULTS: An autoimmune disorder was present in 55.7% (195/350) of the patients. The rate of acrochordons was significantly higher in patients with autoimmune disorders (n= 195) compared to the control group (n= 155) (8.21% versus 2.58%, respectively) (p= 0.043). When the autoimmune disease positive (n= 58) and autoimmune antibody-positive (n= 137) groups were separately analyzed, acrochordons were found more frequently in the autoimmune disease group (p= 0.004). However, there was no statistically significant co-occurrence of autoimmune antibody positivity and the presence of skin tags (p= 0.135). CONCLUSION: There may be immune system-related biological mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of acrochordons.

Evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that local inflammation of the olfactory epithelium is linked to olfactory dysfunction. However, whether systemic inflammation causes olfactory dysfunction is yet to be determined. In the present behavioral study, we set out to test whether acute systemic inflammation impairs olfactory identification performance by inducing a transient and controlled state of systemic inflammation using an experimental endotoxemia model. We treated young healthy participants (N = 20) with a relatively high dose (2.0 ng/kg) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a placebo treatment in a double-blind within-subject design, and assessed participants ability to identify odors using the MONEX-40, a reliable method for experimental assessment of odor identification ability in healthy and young individuals. Our results show that olfactory identification performance was not affected by the acute systemic inflammation triggered by the injection of LPS. Moreover, odor identification performance following the LPS injection was not associated with levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-). Because experimental LPS-induced systemic inflammation does not affect olfactory identification performance, our findings suggest that chronic, rather than transient, systemic inflammation is a more likely mechanism to explore in order to explain the olfactory deficits observed in inflammatory diseases.","output":"Acute Systemic Experimental Inflammation Does Not Reduce Human Odor Identification Performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In this COVID-19 pandemic, onco-hematological patients are at higher risk of severe infection not only because of their immunosuppressive state cau","output":"An Innovative Organization Model to Face Risks Reduction Challenges in an Italian Cancer Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Risk Reduction Estimation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak has shut down universities and prompted the teaching faculty to move to online resources.

Associations between mayoral officials' opinions about health disparities in their city and the magnitude of life expectancy disparity in their city are not moderated by the social or fiscal ideology of mayoral officials or the ideology of their constituents. Highly visible and publicized information about mortality disparities, such as that related to COVID-19 disparities, has potential to elevate elected officials' perceptions of the severity of health disparities and influence their opinions about the issue. CONTEXT: A substantive body of research has explored what factors influence elected officials' opinions about health issues. However, no studies have assessed the potential influence of the health of an elected official's constituents. We assessed whether the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity within a city was associated with the opinions of that city's mayoral official (i.e., mayor or deputy mayor) about health disparities in their city. METHODS: The independent variable was the magnitude of income-based life expectancy disparity in US cities. The magnitude was determined by linking 2010-2015 estimates of life expectancy and median household income for 8,434 census tracts in 224 cities. The dependent variables were mayoral officials' opinions from a 2016 survey about the existence and fairness of health disparities in their city (n = 224, response rate 30.3%). Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for characteristics of mayoral officials (e.g., ideology) and city characteristics. FINDINGS: In cities in the highest income-based life expectancy disparity quartile, 50.0% of mayoral officials \\"strongly agreed\\" that health disparities existed and 52.7% believed health disparities were \\"very unfair.\\" In comparison, among mayoral officials in cities in the lowest disparity quartile 33.9% \\"strongly agreed\\" that health disparities existed and 22.2% believed the disparities were \\"very unfair.\\" A 1-year-larger income-based life expectancy disparity in a city was associated with 25% higher odds that the city's mayoral official would \\"strongly agree\\" that health disparities existed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25; P = .04) and twice the odds that the city's mayoral official would believe that such disparities were \\"very unfair\\" (OR = 2.24; P <.001).

Here we present a protocol for the National Institute of Health (NIH) Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) VR trial that evaluates the effectiveness of three forms of VR for patients with chronic lower back pain (cLBP), a highly prevalent form of chronic pain. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The NIH BACPAC VR trial will randomise 360 patients with cLBP into one of three arms, each administered through a head-mounted display: 1) skills-based VR, a program incorporating principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, mindful meditation and physiological biofeedback therapy using embedded biometric sensors; 2) distraction-based VR, a program using 360-degree immersive videos designed to distract users from pain; and 3) sham VR, a non-immersive program using two-dimensional videos within a VR headset. Research participants will be monitored for 12 weeks using a combination of patient-reported outcomes administered via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), wearable sensor data collected via Fitbit Charge 4 and electronic health record data.

To develop and evaluate strategies to potentially improve care coordination, it is necessary to develop a method for organising different ways of coordinating care for rare conditions. Developing a taxonomy would help to describe different ways of coordinating care and in turn facilitate development and evaluation of pre-existing and new models of care coordination for rare conditions. To the authors knowledge, no studies have previously developed taxonomies of care coordination for rare conditions. This research aimed to develop and refine a care coordination taxonomy for people with rare conditions. METHODS: This study had a qualitative design and was conducted in the United Kingdom. To develop a taxonomy, six stages of taxonomy development were followed. We conducted interviews (n = 30 health care professionals/charity representatives/commissioners) and focus groups (n = 4 focus groups, 22 patients/carers with rare/ultra-rare/undiagnosed conditions). Interviews and focus groups were audio-recorded with consent, and professionally transcribed. Findings were analysed using thematic analysis. Themes were used to develop a taxonomy, and to identify which types of coordination may work best in which situations. To refine the taxonomy, we conducted two workshops (n = 12 patients and carers group; n = 15 professional stakeholder group). RESULTS: Our taxonomy has six domains, each with different options. The six domains are: (1) Ways of organising care (local, hybrid, national), (2) Ways of organising those involved in care (collaboration between many or all individuals, collaboration between some individuals, a lack of collaborative approach), (3) Responsibility for coordination (administrative support, formal roles and responsibilities, supportive roles and no responsibility), (4) How often appointments and coordination take place (regular, on demand, hybrid), (5) Access to records (full or filtered access), and (6) Mode of care coordination (face-to-face, digital, telephone). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that there are different ways of coordinating care across the six domains outlined in our taxonomy. This may help to facilitate the development and evaluation of existing and new models of care coordination for people living with rare conditions.

Individual trials have assessed the clinical profile of tirzepatide vs different comparators. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and ClinicalTrials.gov up until 27 October 2021 for randomised controlled trials with a duration of at least 12 weeks that compared once-weekly tirzepatide 5, 10 or 15 mg with placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes irrespective of their background glucose-lowering treatment. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c) from baseline. Secondary efficacy outcomes included change in body weight, proportion of individuals reaching the HbA(1c) target of <53 mmol/mol (<7.0%), 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or <39 mmol/mol (<5.7%), and proportion of individuals with body weight loss of at least 5%, 10% or 15%. Safety outcomes included hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal adverse events, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, serious adverse events, and mortality. We used version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials to assess risk of bias for the primary outcome. RESULTS: Seven trials (6609 participants) were included. A dose-dependent superiority in lowering HbA(1c) was evident with all three tirzepatide doses vs all comparators, with mean differences ranging from ?17.71 mmol/mol (?1.62%) to ?22.35 mmol/mol (?2.06%) vs placebo, ?3.22 mmol/mol (?0.29%) to ?10.06 mmol/mol (?0.92%) vs GLP-1 RAs, and ?7.66 mmol/mol (?0.70%) to ?12.02 mmol/mol (?1.09%) vs basal insulin regimens. Tirzepatide was more efficacious in reducing body weight; reductions vs GLP-1 RAs ranged from 1.68 kg with tirzepatide 5 mg to 7.16 kg with tirzepatide 15 mg. Incidence of hypoglycaemia with tirzepatide was similar vs placebo and lower vs basal insulin. Nausea was more frequent with tirzepatide vs placebo, especially with tirzepatide 15 mg (OR 5.60 [95% CI 3.12, 10.06]), associated with higher incidence of vomiting (OR 5.50 [95% CI 2.40, 12.59]) and diarrhoea (OR 3.31 [95% CI 1.40, 7.85]). Odds of gastrointestinal events were similar between tirzepatide and GLP-1 RAs, except for diarrhoea with tirzepatide 10 mg (OR 1.51 [95% CI 1.07, 2.15]). Tirzepatide 15 mg led to higher discontinuation rate of study medication due to adverse events regardless of comparator, while all tirzepatide doses were safe in terms of serious adverse events and mortality. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A dose-dependent superiority on glycaemic efficacy and body weight reduction was evident with tirzepatide vs placebo, GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin. Tirzepatide did not increase the odds of hypoglycaemia but was associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. Study limitations include presence of statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analyses for change in HbA(1c) and body weight, assessment of risk of bias solely for the primary outcome, and generalisation of findings mainly to individuals who are overweight or obese and already on metformin-based background therapy.

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the use of preventive health care services. Although there was an increase in the number of cancer screening tests beginning in late 2020, screenings remained 29% to 36% lower than in the prepandemic era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to assist health care providers in identifying approaches for prioritizing patients and increasing breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening during the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used the scoping review framework to identify articles on PubMed and EBSCO databases. A total of 403 articles were identified, and 23 articles were selected for this review. The literature review ranged from January 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. RESULTS: The articles included two primary categories of recommendations: (1) risk stratification and triage to prioritize screenings and (2) alternative methods to conduct cancer screenings. Risk stratification and triage recommendations focused on prioritizing high-risk patients with an abnormal or suspicious result on the previous screening test, patients in certain age groups and sex, patients with a personal medical or family cancer history, patients that are currently symptomatic, and patients that are predisposed to hereditary cancers and cancer-causing mutations. Other recommended strategies included identifying areas facing the most disparities, creating algorithms and using artificial intelligence to create cancer risk scores, leveraging in-person visits to assess cancer risk, and providing the option of open access screenings where patients can schedule screenings and can be assigned a priority category by health care staff. Some recommended using telemedicine to categorize patients and determine screening eligibility for patients with new complaints. Several articles noted the importance of implementing preventive measures such as COVID-19 screening prior to the procedures, maintaining hygiene measures, and social distancing in waiting rooms. Alternative screening methods that do not require an in-person clinic visit and can effectively screen patients for cancers included mailing self-collection sampling kits for cervical and colorectal cancers, and implementing or expanding mobile screening units. CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 pandemic had devastating effects on population health globally, it could be an opportunity to adapt and evolve cancer screening methods.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. We recently described a novel method to pharmacologically down-regulate the expression of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulation of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data reveal the existence of a folding intermediate showing druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation.

Importantly, among the different virtual hits, we identified mefloquine, a quinoline-derivative belonging to a class of antimalaria agents (e.g. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) recently described for their effects on ACE2 maturation.

(Covidien, Mansfield, MA) has been used in cases undergoing laparoscopic colon and rectal resections. This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of the 5-mm and 10-mm devices. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Patients who received a laparoscopic or hand-assisted laparoscopic operation for a tumor located in the sigmoid colon or rectum since 2006 were abstracted from a prospectively designed database, and findings were analyzed in two groups based on size of the device used during the procedure. The videotapes of the procedures were watched, and operation reports were read to obtain further information on specific intra- and postoperative complications. Demographics, tumor and operation-related information, and postoperative data were compared. RESULTS Among 215 (128 [59.5%] males; median age, 59.513.8 years) patients, data obtained from the 5-mm (n=32) and 10-mm (n=183) groups were identical regarding demographics and data related to tumor (localization and stage) and operation (number of harvested lymph nodes, conversion rates, operation time, intraoperative bleeding, transfusion requirement, reoperation rates, complications, 30-day mortality, and length of hospital stay). However, more patients underwent an anterior resection in the 10-mm group than in the 5-mm group (31.7% versus 15.6%, P<.05). Further analyses found device-related bleeding in 8 (3.7%) cases (2 [6.3%] versus 6 [3.3%] in the 5-mm versus 10-mm group, respectively, P>.05), requiring further attempts for hemorrhage control (n=6), conversion to open surgery (n=1), or relaparotomy (n=1).

However, studies on the psychological status of older adults during this public health emergency remained scant. This study aims to investigate the mental health status among the elderly Chinese population during COVID-19 pandemic and determine the influencing factors of psychological symptoms. Methods: From February 19 to March 19, 2020, an online survey was administered to Chinese older adults using a convenience sampling method. Information on demographic data, health status and other epidemic related factors were collected. Specifically, the study defined the psychological status as five primary disorder-depression, neurasthenia, fear, anxiety, and hypochondria-which were assessed by the Psychological Questionnaire for Emergent Event of Public Health (PQEEPH). Standard descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. Results: Of 1,501 participants recruited from 31 provinces in China, 1,278 were valid for further analysis. Participants' scores on each sub-scale were described in median and interquartile [M(Q)]: depression [0.00 (0.33)], neurasthenia [0.00 (0.40)], fear [1.00 (0.83)], anxiety [0.00 (0.17)], hypochondria [0.00 (0.50)]. Chronic diseases (depression p = 0.001;neurasthenia p &lt; 0.001;fear p = 0.023;anxiety p &lt; 0.001;hypochondria p = 0.001) and the BMI index (depression p = 0.015;neurasthenia p = 0.046;fear p = 0.016;anxiety p = 0.015;hypochondria p = 0.013) had significant impacts on all of the five sub-scales. Specifically, the rural dwellers had a higher level of neurasthenia, fear, and hypochondria. Besides, education level (p = 0.035) and outbreak risk level (p = 0.004) had significant impacts on the depression. Higher household monthly income per capita (p = 0.031), and the community-level entry/exit control (p = 0.011) are factors against anxiety. Conclusions: Most elderly residents reported mild negative emotions during COVID-19 and more attention should be paid to the recognition and alleviation of fear.

In this study, we describe PCT levels overtime and their relationship with bacterial infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) critically ill patients with pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in an ICU of a University Hospital. All consecutive COPD patients admitted for pneumonia between September 2005 and September 2006 were included. Respiratory samples were tested for the presence of bacteria and viruses. Procalcitonin was sequentially assessed and patients classified according to the probability of the presence of a bacterial infection. RESULTS: Thirty four patients were included. The PCT levels were assessed in 32/34 patients, median values were: 0.493 g/L [IQR, 0.131 to 1.471] at the time of admission, 0.724 g/L [IQR, 0.167 to 2.646] at six hours, and 0.557 g/L [IQR, 0.123 to 3.4] at 24 hours. The highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 g/L in 3/32 (9%) patients and greater than 0.25 g/L in 22/32 (69%) patients, suggesting low and high probability of bacterial infection, respectively. Fifteen bacteria and five viruses were detected in 15/34 (44%) patients. Bacteria were not detected in patients with PCTmax levels < 0.1 g/L. In contrast, bacteria were detected in 4/7 (57%) patients estimated unlikely to have a bacterial infection by PCT levels (PCTmax > 0.1 and < 0.25 g/L). CONCLUSION: Based on these results we suggest that a PCT level cut off > 0.1 g/L may be more appropriate than 0.25 g/L (previously proposed for non severe lower respiratory tract infection) to predict the probability of a bacterial infection in severe COPD patients with pneumonia. Further studies testing procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategies are needed in COPD patients with severe pneumonia.","output":"Procalcitonin levels and bacterial aetiology among COPD patients admitted to the ICU with severe pneumonia: a prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been linked to a higher risk of mortality compared to influenza, which is mainly due to severe secondary diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

This approach, however, produces a lot of false-negative and erroneous outcomes. According to recent studies, COVID-19 can also be diagnosed using X-rays, CT scans, blood tests and cough sounds.

METHODS: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and UV (ultraviolet)-Vis (visible) spectrophotometer examination were performed for acrylamide characterization. In this study, after the femur fracture model was created, the groups were formed to include eight rats in each group (G) as follows: G1: 15th-day control, G2: 15th-day AA, G3: 30th-day control, G4: 30th-day AA. In G2 and G4, 5mg/kg acrylamide was administered 3 times a week by gastric gavage. The fracture was evaluated radiologically according to Lane-Sandhu scoring and histologically according to Huo scoring. The weight changes of the rats were recorded. Albumin, total protein, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride, ALP, LDH, vit. D, PTH, Ca, P, WBC, Hb, Plt values were examined in the blood samples. The data were analyzed using the SPSS program. RESULTS: The characterization properties of acrylamide were confirmed. No significant weight change was observed in the rats during the study. When blood values were compared, a statistically significant difference was determined between albumin, total protein, phosphorus, white blood cell (WBC), and hemoglobin groups (p=0.41, p=0.00, p=0.003, p=0.019, and p=0,017, respectively).

Several AI systems have been developed for diagnosing COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest CT and X-ray images. These AI systems mainly differ in their choices of the algorithms for image segmentation, classification and disease diagnosis. Other AI-based systems have focused on predicting mortality rate, long-term patient hospitalization and patient outcomes for COVID-19. AI has huge potential in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic but successful practical deployments of these AI-based tools have so far been limited due to challenges such as limited data accessibility, the need for external evaluation of AI models, the lack of awareness of AI experts of the regulatory landscape governing the deployment of AI tools in healthcare, the need for clinicians and other experts to work with AI experts in a multidisciplinary context and the need to address public concerns over data collection, privacy, and protection. Having a dedicated team with expertise in medical data collection, privacy, access and sharing, using federated learning whereby AI scientists hand over training algorithms to the healthcare institutions to train models locally, and taking full advantage of biomedical data stored in biobanks can alleviate some of problems posed by these challenges.

Thirty-six domestic violence victims (mean age: 33.4  3.5 yrs-old) were enrolled in this study. Participants were randomly and equally assigned to two intervention (physical exercise, counseling/support group therapy) and one control (no intervention) groups. The French version of the Physical Self-Perception Profile (ISP-25) was administered to all participants pre- and post-study. Mixed-design ANOVAs revealed significant Group by Time interactions for Global Self-Esteem, Physical Condition, and Body Attractiveness. Global Self-Esteem significantly improved in the two intervention groups, with a trend for better improvement in women who exercised compared to those who took part in support group meetings, Cohens d = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [?0.18, 1.54]. On the other hand, only women from the Physical Exercise group reported significant gains in Physical Condition and Body Attractiveness.

When burn injuries occur at work, there is an additional unfamiliar stress of income loss and dependence on a third-party payer. Patients with claims through the Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC) report frustration and overall dissatisfaction in working with the BWC to achieve claim coverage. Of workers who are off of work more than 5 days due to a work-related injury, 10% are diagnosed with depression in the 12 months following the injury (Carnide, 2016). In our clinic, screening for depression and anxiety is done through the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a valid four-item assessment tool that utilizes a Likert style measurement to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety (Kroenke et al., 2009). This is a health questionnaire that determines a patients risk for depression and anxiety as mild, moderate, or severe. OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a correlation between insurance type and PHQ-4 scores in burn patients. We hypothesized that risk of depression and anxiety could differ based on payer, which can affect a patients access to care, referral approval, and financial burden of treatment. Additional focus was placed on BWC patients due to their reported frustrations and dissatisfaction in working with BWC and the established correlation between depression and missed work. METHODS: A quality improvement project was initiated based on increased rates of referrals for psychological evaluation and treatment in BWC patients. A retrospective review was conducted of outpatient burn clinic visits where a PHQ-4 questionnaire was completed in the past 3 fiscal years: 7/1/2019-6/30/2021. RESULTS: Total of 1932 visits with PHQ-4 collection were reviewed within the above specified time frame. The rates of moderate and high-risk scores for anxiety and depression were highest with BWC and Medicaid patients. Patients with private insurance showed a lower risk of moderate and severe depression. However, there was no significant difference when comparing BWC verses all other insurance. Table 1 CONCLUSIONS: Overall there was no significant difference in risk of anxiety and depression with BWC versus other insurance coverage based on PHQ-4 scores. Limitations of the study include no distinction of extent of burn injury/burn depth, burn care/treatments, length of hospital stay if any; no distinction was made amongst BWC patients and their length of time off of work. A portion of the timeframe reviewed was during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"773 Insurance Coverage Does Not Increase Risk of Depression and Anxiety in Burn Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Stent thrombosis (ST) is a dreaded complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), however incidence has been declining with improvement in stent design and pharmacological treatments. While ST can occur at any time after placement of a stent, the rate of ST declines as time from implantation progresses. Case: A 54 year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type two diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease status PCI to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) six years prior presented with substernal chest discomfort for three hours. Vital signs were within normal limits, and his electrocardiogram showed two-to-three-millimeter ST elevation across the precordial leads with reciprocal ST depressions. He was brought emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where coronary angiography revealed a large thrombus within the previously placed LAD stent. The patient underwent aspiration thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty and stenting of the LAD. The patient was discharged in good condition on dual-antiplatelet therapy three days after his presentation. Decision-making: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians on the front lines have been learning more and more about the virus including prevention and treatment. In a stunning collaboration of science and enterprise, several vaccines were created including the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen (J&J) single dose COVID-19 immunization. However, although effective at preventing serious COVID-19 infections, anecdotal evidence of thrombotic events has been reported. Given this patient's thrombotic event, a hypercoagulable workup was undertaken but unrevealing. Conclusion: We describe a case of very late ST of a six year-old drug eluting stent occurring three weeks after the patient received a J&J COVID-19 vaccine. While temporally the timing of the stent thrombosis is surprising and possibly related, this is yet another case to add to the body of evidence as we learn more about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the COVID-19 vaccines as we navigate this pandemic together.","output":"Very Late Stent Thrombosis after Johnson & Johnson/janssen Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aim: In December 2019, a kind of viral pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) appeared in Wuhan, China and then a pandemic of COVID-19 created.

This condition not only raises public health concerns but also causes a number of psychosocial problems. Therefore, this study intends to examine the psychosocial experiences of patients with COVID-19 after passing the crisis stage. A qualitative study with a conventional content analysis method was used. Thirty participants were selected using purposeful sampling from Khoy Educational and Medical Centers from 20 March to 20 June 2020. In-depth semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Data were analysed by continuous comparative analysis using MAXQDA 10 software. The concepts extracted from data analysis identified eight subthemes and three main themes. Social rejection theme includes three subthemes: 'Insularity of the patient', 'Concealment' and 'patient as the life-threatening center'. Lack of support theme consists of three subthemes including: 'financial concerns', 'non-response of the treatment team after discharge' and 'concerns about the persistent condition of the disease'. Efforts to gain mental peace theme has two subthemes: 'recourse to spirituality' and 'strengthening hope'. According to the results of the present study, it is necessary to examine the psychological and social needs of patients. Also, by identifying high-risk groups, supportive psychological networks such as telephone, internet and on-site medical services to help patients, medical worker and others affected in overcoming psychological problems should be increased. Providing free service packages such as the Internet, free financial aid to damaged jobs and creating the necessary platforms for online shopping and payment services, as well as training on how to plan and practice rehabilitation at home for patients and family caregivers can be helpful.","output":"Psychosocial care experiences of patients with COVID-19 at home in Iran: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Excluding pregnant people from Covid\\\\19 clinical trials may lead to unintended harmful consequences.

To date, no studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of persistent COVID-19-associated vascular dysfunction. Our purpose was to quantify nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation in healthy adults who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesized that COVID-19-recovered adults would have impaired NO-mediated vasodilation compared with adults who have not had COVID-19. In methods, we performed a cross-sectional study including 10 (5 men/5 women, 24  4 yr) healthy control (HC) adults who were unvaccinated for COVID-19, 11 (4 men/7 women, 25  6 yr) healthy vaccinated (HV) adults, and 12 (5 men/7 women, 22  3 yr) post-COVID-19 (PC, 19  14 wk) adults. COVID-19 symptoms severity (survey) was assessed. A standardized 39C local heating protocol was used to assess NO-dependent vasodilation via perfusion (intradermal microdialysis) of 15 mM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester during the plateau of the heating response. Red blood cell flux was measured (laser-Doppler flowmetry) and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC = flux/mmHg) was expressed as a percentage of maximum (28 mM sodium nitroprusside + 43C). In results, the local heating plateau (HC: 61  20%, HV: 60  19%, PC: 67  19%, P = 0.80) and NO-dependent vasodilation (HC: 77  9%, HV: 71  7%, PC: 70  10%, P = 0.36) were not different among groups.

At the same time, it is also a test of concepts and practices of what good care is and requires, and how quality of care can be accounted for. In this paper, we present our Care-Ethical Model of Quality Enquiry (CEMQUE) and apply it to the case of residential care for older people in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of thinking about care in healthcare and social welfare as a set of separate care acts, we think about care as a complex practice of relational caring, crossed by other practices. Instead of thinking about professional caregivers as functionaries obeying external rules, we think about them as practically wise professionals. Instead of thinking about developing external quality criteria and systems, we think about cultivating (self-)reflective quality awareness. Instead of abstracting from societal forces that make care possible but also limit it, we acknowledge them and find ways to deal with them. Based on these critical insights, the CEMQUE model can be helpful to describe, interrogate, evaluate, and improve existing care practices. It has four entries: (i) the care receiver considered from their humanness, (ii) the caregiver considered from their solicitude, (iii) the care facility considered from its habitability and (iv) the societal, institutional and scholarly context considered from the perspective of the good life, justice and decency.

We here introduce a notion of scalar product and distance between reduced representations, which allows the study of the metric and topological properties of their space in a quantitative manner. Making use of a WangCLandau enhanced sampling algorithm, we exhaustively explore such space, and examine the qualitative features of mappings in terms of their squared norm. A one-to-one correspondence with an interacting lattice gas on a finite volume leads to the emergence of discontinuous phase transitions in mapping space, which mark the boundaries between qualitatively different reduced representations of the same molecule.

Psychological stress, anxiety and depression are affecting not only COVID-19 patients but also health professionals, and general population. Fear of contracting COVID-19, forced restrictive social measures, and economic hardship are causing mental trauma. Nepal is a developing country from South Asia where the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving. This online survey has been carried out to understand impact of COVID- 19 on mental health of Nepalese community dwellers. METHODS: The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) questionnaire adapted from the Shanghai Mental Health Centre was used for online data collection from 11 April-17 May 2020. Collected data were extracted to Microsoft excel-13 and imported and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version-22. An initial univariate analysis was conducted for all variables to assess the distribution. Logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the odds ratios of relevant predicting variables. RESULTS: A total of 410 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Mean age of study participants was 34.8  11.7 years with male preponderance. 88.5% of the respondents were not in distress (score less than 28) while, 11% had mild to moderate distress and 0.5% had severe distress. The prevalence of distress is higher among age group > 45 years, female gender, and post-secondary education group. Health professional were more likely to get distressed. Respondents with post-secondary education had higher odds (OR = 3.32; p = 0.020) of developing distress as compared to respondents with secondary education or lower.

After psychiatric medication washout, participants (n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo (P < 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score (P = 0.0116, d = 0.43).

We recorded caregivers' perceptions of care before, during, and moving forward from COVID-19, emphasizing positive experiences, coping strategies, creative care adaptation, strengths demonstrated, and benefits of providing care.Methods: Allied health professionals conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 informal caregivers of people living with dementia. We categorized and thematically analyzed responses as before, during or moving forward from COVID-19.Results: A range of themes were derived from the data. Pre-pandemic care: (1) focusing on the person living with dementia and (2) working together. During-pandemic care: (1) respecting personhood; (2) connecting with virtues and values; (3) improving relationships; (4) seeking and receiving support; (5) prioritizing self-care; (6) being protective and proactive; (7) making practical changes. Moving forward from COVID-19: (1) strengthening commitment to the person living with dementia, (2) looking after my own needs, and (3) considering practical requirements.Conclusions: Participants reported positive caregiving experiences in all timeframes, focusing more on their own needs and experiences during and moving forward from COVID-19. This research may highlight informal caregivers' challenges and needs.Clinical implications: Enforced isolation produced deeper connections for some caregivers. Caregivers benefit from resources facilitating adaptive care.","output":"Positive Aspects of Dementia Caregiving During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On March 9 2020 the WHO Global Influenza Program (GIP) asked participant sites on the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network (GIHSN) to contribute to data collection concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency, the gold standard for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosis is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Additional diagnostic methods enabling the detection of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection would be highly beneficial to ensure the timely diagnosis of all infected and recovered patients. Here, we investigated several serological tools, i.e., two immunochromatographic lateral flow assays (LFA-1 (Biosynex COVID-19 BSS) and LFA-2 (COVID-19 Sign IgM/IgG)) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) detecting IgA (ELISA-1 Euroimmun), IgM (ELISA-2 EDI) and/or IgG (ELISA-1 and ELISA-2) based on well-characterized panels of serum samples from patients and healthcare workers with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and from SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. A total of 272 serum samples were used, including 62 serum samples from hospitalized patients (panel 1 and panel 3), 143 serum samples from healthcare workers (panel 2) diagnosed with COVID-19 and 67 serum samples from negative controls.

In the case of Colombia, a series of measures focused on isolation and remote services provision were introduced in a context marked by health inequities. This article reviews the theoretical and normative references on primary care interventions in the Colombian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, LILACS, MEDLINE, and official documents and regulations issued in Colombia, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization. A narrative synthesis was done of 33 documents based on their contribution to the implementation of primary care in Colombia and their role in the pandemic. Results: The information was organized into two categories: Actions taken in Colombia in response to COVID-19 and Opportunities in primary care in response to COVID-19. Colombias actions were contrasted with world experience. Better pandemic control was found in countries that adopted primary care as a response. Primary care has strengthened the handling of the pandemic through community action, the provision of coordinated services, mental health inclusion, and the adoption of telemedicine processes. Conclusions: In Colombia, primary care is presented as an opportunity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the problems and needs derived from this situation. However, despite the above, there is resistance in the country to adopt this type of approach and complement the hospital-centric model to face the pandemic.","output":"Description and analysis of primary care-based COVID-19 interventions in Colombia./ Descripcin y anlisis de las intervenciones fundamentadas en la atencin primaria para responder al COVID-19 en Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Precision medicine relies upon artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technologies that raise ethical and practical concerns. In this study, we developed and validated a measure of parental openness and concerns with AI-driven technologies in their childs healthcare. In this cross-sectional survey, we enrolled parents of children <18 years in 2 rounds for exploratory (n = 418) and confirmatory (n = 386) factor analysis. We developed a 12-item measure of parental openness to AI-driven technologies, and a 33-item measure identifying concerns that parents found important when considering these technologies. We also evaluated associations between openness and attitudes, beliefs, personality traits, and demographics. Parents (N = 804) reported mean openness to AI-driven technologies of M = 3.4/5, SD = 0.9. We identified seven concerns that parents considered important when evaluating these technologies: quality/accuracy, privacy, shared decision making, convenience, cost, human element of care, and social justice. In multivariable linear regression, parental openness was positively associated with quality (beta = 0.23), convenience (beta = 0.16), and cost (beta = 0.11), as well as faith in technology (beta = 0.23) and trust in health information systems (beta = 0.12). Parental openness was negatively associated with the perceived importance of shared decision making (beta = ?0.16) and being female (beta = ?0.12).

This requires the use of management systems that should be fed with large amounts of data captured by acoustic sensors, mostly remote nodes that belong to a wireless acoustic sensor network. These systems help city managers to conduct data-driven analysis and propose action plans in different areas of the city, for instance, to reduce citizens exposure to noise. In this paper, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to discover different behavior patterns, both time and space, of sound pressure levels captured by acoustic sensors and to cluster them allowing the identification of various urban acoustic environments. In this approach, the categorization of urban acoustic environments is based on a clustering algorithm using yearly acoustic indexes, such as [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and standard deviation of [Formula: see text]. Data collected over three years by a network of acoustic sensors deployed in the city of Barcelona, Spain, are used to train several clustering methods. Comparison between methods concludes that the k-means algorithm has the best performance for these data. After an analysis of several solutions, an optimal clustering of four groups of nodes is chosen. Geographical analysis of the clusters shows insights about the relation between nodes and areas of the city, detecting clusters that are close to urban roads, residential areas and leisure areas mostly. Moreover, temporal analysis of the clusters gives information about their stability. Using one-year size of the sliding window, changes in the membership of nodes in the clusters regarding tendency of the acoustic environments are discovered. In contrast, using one-month windowing, changes due to seasonality and special events, such as COVID-19 lockdown, are recognized. Finally, the sensor clusters obtained by the algorithm are compared with the areas defined in the strategic noise map, previously created by the Barcelona city council. The developed k-means model identified most of the locations found on the overcoming map and also discovered a new area.","output":"Cluster Analysis of Urban Acoustic Environments on Barcelona Sensor Network Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization has placed a lot of attention on vulnerable communities of Africa due to their chronically weak health care systems. Recent findings from Uganda show that medical staff members have sufficient knowledge but poor attitudes toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and preparedness/practices of lecturers and students in the fight against COVID-19. METHOD: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of 103 lecturers and students both men and women of age group 18 to 69 years in western Uganda. Data were obtained through a pretested questionnaire availed online. RESULTS: Knowledge on COVID-19 symptoms was highest in this order: fever > dry cough > difficulty breathing > fatigue > headache with no significant differences between lecturers and students. Knowledge of participants on transmission of COVID-19 was highest in the order of cough drops > contaminated surfaces > person-to-person contact > asymptomatic persons > airborne > zoonotic with no significant differences among lecturers and students. Lecturers and students were all willing to continue using personal protective equipment like masks, and personal practices such as covering the mouth while sneezing and coughing, no handshaking, and washing of hands with no significant differences in the responses. The positive attitudes that COVID-19 could kill, anyone can get COVID-19, and willing to abide by the set regulations against the pandemic showed personal concerns and desired efforts against COVID-19.

Structured reporting systems simplify the interpretation and reporting of imaging examinations, serve as a framework for consistent generation of recommendations, and improve the quality of patient care. PURPOSE: To compose a comprehensive lexicon for description of the imaging findings and propose a grading system and structured reporting format for CT findings in COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We updated our published systematic review on imaging findings in COVID-19 to include 37 published studies pertaining to diagnostic features of COVID-19 in chest CT. Using the reported imaging findings of 3647 patients, we summarized the typical chest CT findings, atypical features, and temporal changes of COVID-19 in chest CT. Subsequently, we extracted a list of descriptive terms and mapped it to the terminology that is commonly used in imaging literature. RESULTS: We composed a comprehensive lexicon that can be used for documentation and reporting of typical and atypical CT imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. Using the same data, we propose a grading system with five COVID-RADS categories. Each COVID-RADS grade corresponds to a low, moderate, or high level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The proposed COVID-RADS and common lexicon would improve the communication of findings to other healthcare providers, thus facilitating the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

Additionally, we also explored factors that may affect the difference in terms of vWF antigen between the two groups. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases from inception up until 7 April 2021. The main outcome was poor outcome, which is a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. Results: There are 10 studies comprising of 996 patients included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. vWF antigen was higher in patients with poor outcome (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.84 [0.45, 1.23], p<0.001; I(2): 87.3, p<0.001).

The e-cigarette/vaping epidemic is one example with a rise in the associated lung injury. This case report aims to highlight two cases of EVALI and highlight their clinic course. CASE PRESENTATION: Case Report #1: A 55 y/o male with a medical history of squamous cell carcinoma with right pneumonectomy, COPD & CAD presented with complaints of shortness of breath. He had been hospitalized 4 times with 2 intubations in a 3-month period, each time when steroids were tapered;further history revealed he had vaped since he quit smoking 5 years ago. He was noted to have a leukocytosis and diffuse interstitial infiltrates on radiography. CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolus. Antibiotics were started, but infectious workup was unrevealing. High dose steroids were started. He eventually required intubation. Pneumonitis was therefore considered. He was evaluated for lung biopsy and transplant, but was not deemed a suitable candidate. His clinical status continued to decline, and family opted for a compassionate extubation and inpatient hospice.Case Report #2: A 43 y/o male with PMH of polysubstance abuse and schizoaffective disorder was admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He reported vaping for the last 3 years, former smoker prior to this. CT angiogram at the time showed findings consistent with ARDS. He eventually was intubated. Initial concern for pneumonia and blood culture did grow klebsiella, however bilateral infiltrates persisted despite adequate antibiotics. Rheumatological workup was unrevealing. Eventual open lung biopsy was performed and samples showed diffuse alveolar damage. He was started on high dose steroids and eventually extubated and discharged. He did continue to vape and had similar admission presentation several days later. DISCUSSION: EVALI serves as a diagnosis of exclusion, linked to vitamin E in vaping. There is a spectrum of acute lung injury in this pathology, which both of these cases highlight. The first shows this disease in a single lung patient, a unique presentation, while the second showcases a more classic form. Thorough explanation of all etiologies of interstitial lung disorders is necessary. Both of these cases help to provide further information and data on the growing body of knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Originally vaping was thought as an option in smoking cessation. However, these cases indicate the complications associated with the practice of vaping (i.e. development of pneumonitis and respiratory failure). It is imperative to determine the drivers of vaping practices and focus on awareness campaigns to reduce its use. Furthermore, research should be directed towards specific clinical and radiological manifestations for early detection and attempt to reverse pulmonary damage. REFERENCE #1: Jonas AM, Raj R.

This study examines the experiences and effects of these changes from the teachers perspective. Methods: We conducted ten guideline-based anonymized e-mail interviews with lecturers of the Medical Faculty of the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. Questions were asked on the subject areas of advantages and disadvantages, teaching experience and the future of digital teaching. The qualitative evaluation was based on Mayring. Results: The assessment of the digitization of face-to-face courses could be described by the inductively formed categories social aspects, methodological aspects, institutional aspects, technical aspects and temporal-spatial aspects. These revealed in particular concerns about the lack of personal exchange, temporal-spatial advantages, technical barriers and disagreement about the future role of digital teaching. Conclusion: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-face courses were replaced by online teaching, which is currently an accepted part of the curriculum. The results show, that teachers were able to implement the comprehensive ad-hoc digitization of theoretical courses well, although previously known problem areas were aggravated.

This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways \\"atypical\\". The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life? administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life? is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life?). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life? was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life? has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life? for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","output":"Combating hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients with a natural oxygen carrier, HEMO2Life?

This paper considers these findings in the light of the literature on Jewish mortality and undertakes a re-analysis of the results alongside the additional data on Jewish deaths provided by the British Jewish communal statistics. It asks two questions: (1) To what extent is elevated British Jewish mortality from COVID-19 a result of the presence of long-standing vulnerability and ill health among Jews? (2) What role do strictly Orthodox Jews play in elevating coronavirus mortality levels among British Jews? The primary contribution of the paper is to explore, via analyses of alternative data sources, the ONS finding of elevated Jewish mortality from coronavirus, to explain why it is surprising, to test whether it is real and to eliminate certain explanations. Such process of elimination in itself will highlight other alternative explanations, but the paper falls short of decisively explaining the phenomenon of the elevated British Jewish mortality from coronavirus.

In particular, little is known about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the joints either post mortem 3 or in vivo 4. To the best of our knowledge, only Lopz-Gonzalez et al.5 have published a description of acute arthritides occurring during hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and they did not find any SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in the patients' synovial fluid samples. Objectives: The aim of this post mortem study was to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the knee synovial fluid, synovial tissue, and bone tissue of COVID-19 patients in order to discover whether the joint is a possible route of transmission during orthopaedic surgical procedures, and clarify the possible role of SARS-CoV-2 as a directly arthritogenic virus. Methods: Post mortem synovial fluid, synovial tissue and bone tissue samples were collected from the knees of five patients who died of COVID-19 in our hospital between September and October 2020, and analysed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using a commercial real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) panel. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to test post mortem nasopharyngeal swabs of all of the patients. Results: No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in any of the knee samples, despite the positivity of the throat swab. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in knee synovial fluid, synovial membrane or bone. Therefore, our results suggest that all healthcare professionals performing surgical procedures on the joints of COVID-19 patients are exposed to a risk of contagion due to exposure to respiratory droplets, blood and body fluids, but not to direct exposure to joint-or bone-related tissues. Furthermore, given that some case reports of arthritis in COVID-19 patients 5-8 show that it is possible that COVID-19 patients display viral-mediated arthralgias and arthritis, the absence of the virus in the knee highlighted by our study suggests that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 has a direct inflammatory action on the joint, but it could induce an inflammation-related reaction, manifesting as a reactive arthritis 9.","output":"No evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the knee joint: A cadaver study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We reported two fatal cases of acute liver failure secondary to Herpes Simplex Virus 1 infection in COVID-19 patients, following tocilizumab and corticosteroid therapy.Screening for and prompt recognition of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 reactivation in these patients, undergoing immunomodulatory treatment, may have potentiallyrelevant clinical consequences.","output":"Two fatal cases of acute liver failure due to HSV-1 infection in COVID-19 patients following immunomodulatory therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether higher positive end- expiratory pressure (PEEP) could provide a survival advantage for patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) compared with lower PEEP. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified through searches of Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Medline, and Wanfang database from inception up to 1 June 2021. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used in this meta-analysis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified for further evaluation. Higher and lower PEEP arms included 1330 patients and 1650 patients, respectively. A mean level of 9.63.4 cmH(2)O was applied in the higher PEEP groups and 1.92.6 cmH(2)O was used in the lower PEEP groups. Higher PEEP, compared with lower PEEP, was not associated with reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.91C1.18; P =0.627), and 28-day mortality (RR 1.07 ; 95% CI 0.92C1.24; P =0.365). In terms of risk of ARDS (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.24C0.78; P =0.005), duration of intensive care unit (MD -1.04; 95%CI-1.36 to ?0.73; P < 0.00001), and oxygenation (MD 40.30; 95%CI 0.94 to 79.65; P = 0.045), higher PEEP was superior to lower PEEP. Besides, the pooled analysis showed no significant differences between groups both in the duration of mechanical ventilation (MD 0.00; 95%CI-0.13 to 0.13; P = 0.996) and hospital stay (MD -0.66; 95%CI-1.94 to 0.61; P = 0.309). More importantly, lower PEEP did not increase the risk of pneumonia, atelectasis, barotrauma, hypoxemia, or hypotension among patients compared with higher PEEP. The TSA analysis showed that the results of all-cause mortality and 28-day mortality might be false-negative results. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a lower PEEP ventilation strategy was non-inferior to a higher PEEP ventilation strategy in ICU patients without ARDS, with no increased risk of all-cause mortality and 28-day mortality. Further high-quality RCTs should be performed to confirm these findings.","output":"Effect of different levels of PEEP on mortality in ICU patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cessation of amateur and recreational sport has had significant implications globally, impacting economic, social and health facets of population well-being.

Early reports identify protective roles for both humoral and cell-mediated immunity for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We leveraged our bioinformatics binding prediction tools for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I and HLA-II alleles that were developed using mass spectrometry-based profiling of individual HLA-I and HLA-II alleles to predict peptide binding to diverse allele sets. We applied these binding predictors to viral genomes from the Coronaviridae family and specifically focused on T cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We assayed a subset of these epitopes in a T cell induction assay for their ability to elicit CD8+ T cell responses. RESULTS: We first validated HLA-I and HLA-II predictions on Coronaviridae family epitopes deposited in the Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) database. We then utilized our HLA-I and HLA-II predictors to identify 11,897 HLA-I and 8046 HLA-II candidate peptides which were highly ranked for binding across 13 open reading frames (ORFs) of SARS-CoV-2. These peptides are predicted to provide over 99% allele coverage for the US, European, and Asian populations. From our SARS-CoV-2-predicted peptide-HLA-I allele pairs, 374 pairs identically matched what was previously reported in the ViPR database, originating from other coronaviruses with identical sequences. Of these pairs, 333 (89%) had a positive HLA binding assay result, reinforcing the validity of our predictions. We then demonstrated that a subset of these highly predicted epitopes were immunogenic based on their recognition by specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, we characterized the expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in virally infected cells to prioritize those which could be potential targets for T cell immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Using our bioinformatics platform, we identify multiple putative epitopes that are potential targets for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, whose HLA binding properties cover nearly the entire population. We also confirm that our binding predictors can predict epitopes eliciting CD8+ T cell responses from multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Protein expression and population HLA allele coverage, combined with the ability to identify T cell epitopes, should be considered in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design strategies and immune monitoring.","output":"Sequence-based prediction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine targets using a mass spectrometry-based bioinformatics predictor identifies immunogenic T cell epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the worlds leading causes of cancer-related deaths; thus, it is important to detect it as early as possible. Obesity is thought to be linked to a large rise in the CRC incidence as a result of bad dietary choices, such as a high intake of animal fats. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a set of molecules that coordinate intracellular lipid responses and are highly associated with metabolism and inflammatory pathways. There are nine types of FABP genes that have been found in mammals, which are FABP1C7, FABP9, and FABP12. Each FABP gene has its own roles in different organs of the body; hence, each one has different expression levels in different cancers. The roles of FABP family genes in the development of CRC are still poorly understood. We used a bioinformatics approach to examine FABP family gene expression profiles using the Oncomine, GEPIA, PrognoScan, STRING, cBioPortal, MetaCore, and TIMER platforms. Results showed that the FABP6 messenger (m)RNA level is overexpressed in CRC cells compared to normal cells. The overexpression of FABP6 was found to be related to poor prognosis in CRC patients overall survival. The immunohistochemical results in the Human Protein Atlas showed that FABP1 and FABP6 exhibited strong staining in CRC tissues. An enrichment analysis showed that high expression of FABP6 was significantly correlated with the role of microRNAs in cell proliferation in the development of CRC through the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. FABP6 functions as an intracellular bile-acid transporter in the ileal epithelium. We looked at FABP6 expression in CRC since bile acids are important in the carcinogenesis of CRC.

As an important component protein of the intestinal mucosal barrier, Mucin 2 (MUC2) plays a critical role in preventing the invasion of pathogens, toxins, and foreign bodies. In the present study, we preliminary verified the function of the porcine MUC2 gene in resisting porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection and investigated the effect of DNA methylation in the promoter region on MUC2 gene expression. The results showed that after PEDV infection, the intestinal mucosal barrier was damaged. Moreover, MUC2 expression was significantly higher in PEDV-infected piglets than in healthy piglets (P < 0.01). The mRNA expression of MUC2 was significantly higher in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells than in non-infected IPEC-J2 cells (P < 0.05). Methylation of the mC-5 site in the MUC2 promoter inhibited the binding of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) to the promoter, down regulated the expression of MUC2 and increased the susceptibility of piglets to PEDV. In conclusion, this study suggests that MUC2 plays an essential regulatory role in PEDV infection. High MUC2 expression improves the resistance of pigs to PEDV infection. The binding of YY1 to the MUC2 promoter is hindered by the methylation of the mC-5 site, which downregulates MUC2 expression and ultimately affects the resistance of pigs to PEDV infection.","output":"Effect of Promoter Methylation on the Expression of Porcine MUC2 Gene and Resistance to PEDV Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is no comprehensive meta-analysis on the value of physiological scoring systems in predicting the mortality of critically ill patients. Therefore, the present study intended to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to collect the available clinical evidence on the value of physiological scoring systems in predicting the in-hospital mortality of acute patients. METHOD: An extensive search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until the end of year 2020. Physiological models included Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS), Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS), modified REMS (mREMS), and Worthing Physiological Score (WPS). Finally, the data were summarized and the findings were presented as summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC), sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). RESULTS: Data from 25 articles were included. The overall analysis showed that the area under the SROC curve of REMS, RAPS, mREMS, and WPS criteria were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.86), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92), 0.64 (95% CI: 0.60-0.68) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.83-0.89), respectively.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Systematic dydrogesterone supplementation in AC for FET is associated with similar outcomes compared to prior individualized supplementation in patients with low P levels. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In AC for FET using vaginal P for endometrial preparation, low serum P levels following P administration have been associated with decreased pregnancy and live birth rates. This deleterious effect can be overcome by addition of other routes of P administration. We obtained effective results by adding dydrogesterone to vaginal P and postponing FET by one day in patients with low P levels. However, in order to limit patient monitoring visits and to schedule better FET activity during CovidC19 pandemic, we implemented a systematic dydrogesterone supplementation without luteal P measurement in artificial FET cycles. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective study aimed to analyse outcomes of 394 FET after 2 different protocols of artificial endometrial preparation. From September 2019 to CovidC19 lockdown on 15th March 2020, patients had serum P level measured on D1 of vaginal P administration. When P levels were < 11 ng/ml, dydrogesterone supplementation was administered and FET was postponed by one day. From May to December 2020, no P measurement was performed and dydrogesterone supplementation was systematically used. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In our university hospital, endometrial preparation was performed using sequential administration of vaginal estradiol until endometrial thickness reached >7 mm, followed by transdermal estradiol combined with 800 mg/day vaginal micronized P started in the evening (D0). Oral dydrogesterone supplementation (30 mg/day) was started concomitantly to vaginal P in all patients during CovidC19 pandemic and only after D1 P measurement followed by one day FET postponement in patients with P levels <11 ng/ml before the lockdown. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: During the CovidC19 pandemic, 198 FET were performed on D2, D3 or D5 of P administration with dydrogesterone supplementation depending on embryo stage at cryopreservation. Concerning the 196 FET before lockdown, 124 (63%) were performed after dydrogesterone addition from D1 onwards and postponement by one day in patients with serum P levels <11 ng/ml at D1 while 72 were performed in phase following introduction of vaginal P without dydrogesterone supplementation in patients with P > 11 ng/ml. Characteristics of patients in the 2 time periods were similar for age (34.5 + 5 vs 34.1 + 4.8 years), endometrial thickness prior to P introduction (9.9 + 2.1 vs 9.9 + 2.2 mm), number of transferred embryos (1.3 + 0.5 vs 1.4 + 0.5) , embryo transfer stage (D2/D3/blastocyst: 8/16/76% vs 3/18/79%). No significant difference was observed between both time periods [nor between dydrogesterone addition and postponement by 1 day and in phase FET before lockdown] in terms of positive pregnancy test (39.4% vs 39.3% [44% vs 30.5%]), heartbeat activity at 8 weeks (29.3% vs 28% [29% vs 26.4%]) and ongoing pregnancy rates at 12 weeks (30.7% but truncated at end of October 2020 vs 25.5% [26.6% vs 23.6%]). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Full results of the CovidC19 period will be further provided concerning ongoing pregnancy rates as well as comparison of live birth rates and obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Wider implications of the findings: These results suggest that systematic dydrogesterone supplementation is as effective as individualized supplementation according to serum P levels following administration of vaginal P. This strategy enabled us to schedule easier FET and limit patient visits for monitoring while maintaining optimal results for FET in AC during the CovidC19 pandemic.

Morbilliviruses are enveloped viruses with two envelope proteins, one of which is hemagglutinin (H) protein, which plays a role in binding to cellular receptors. During morbillivirus infection, the virus initially targets lymphoid cells and replicates efficiently in the lymph nodes. The principal cellular receptor for morbillivirus is signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, also called CD150), which is exclusively expressed on immune cells. This feature reflects the strong lymphoid cell tropism and viral spread in the infected body. Morbillivirus infection, however, affects various tissues in the body, including the lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium, and brain. Thus, other receptors for morbilliviruses in addition to SLAM might exist. Recently, nectin-4 has been identified as a novel epithelial cell receptor for MeV. The expression of nectin-4 is localized to polarized epithelial cells, and this localization supports the notion of cell tropism since MeV also grows well in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Although two major receptors for lymphoid and epithelial cells in natural infection have been identified, morbillivirus can still infect many other types of cells with low infectivity, suggesting the existence of inefficient but ubiquitously expressed receptors. We have identified other molecules that are implicated in morbillivirus infection of SLAM-negative cells by alternative mechanisms. These findings indicate that morbillivirus utilizes multiple pathways for establishment of infection.

An extensive set of experiments were performed using state-of-the-art deep Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Networks (ED-CNNs), UNet, and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), with different backbone (encoder) structures using the variants of DenseNet and ResNet. The conducted experiments showed the best performance for lung region segmentation with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.19% and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 95.10% using U-Net model with the DenseNet 161 encoder. Furthermore, the proposed system achieved an elegant performance for COVID-19 infection segmentation with a DSC of 94.13% and IoU of 91.85% using the FPN model with the DenseNet201 encoder. The achieved performance is significantly superior to previous methods for COVID-19 lesion localization. Besides, the proposed system can reliably localize infection of various shapes and sizes, especially small infection regions, which are rarely considered in recent studies. Moreover, the proposed system achieved high COVID-19 detection performance with 99.64% sensitivity and 98.72% specificity. Finally, the system was able to discriminate between different severity levels of COVID-19 infection over a dataset of 1,110 subjects with sensitivity values of 98.3%, 71.2%, 77.8%, and 100% for mild, moderate, severe, and critical infections, respectively.","output":"Detection and severity classification of COVID-19 in CT images using deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Based on its forensic capacity and experience gained worldwide from the management of the dead in emergencies, including epidemics, the International Committee of the Red Cross has been asked by the authorities and other relevant stakeholders in some of its operational contexts to advise on the management of the dead from COVID-19 infection, for which it has prepared the following guidance.

The S protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a spatial structure similar to the S proteins of other mammalian coronaviruses, except for a unique receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a significant inducer of host immune response. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD is widely used as a highly specific minimal antigen for serological tests. Correct exposure of antigenic determinants has a significant impact on the accuracy of such tests-the antigen has to be correctly folded, contain no potentially antigenic non-vertebrate glycans, and, preferably, should have a glycosylation pattern similar to the native S protein. Based on the previously developed p1.1 vector, containing the regulatory sequences of the Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EEF1A1) from Chinese hamster, we created two expression constructs encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD with C-terminal c-myc and polyhistidine tags. RBDv1 contained a native viral signal peptide, RBDv2 -human tPA signal peptide. We transfected a CHO DG44 cell line, selected stably transfected cells, and performed a few rounds of methotrexate-driven amplification of the genetic cassette in the genome. For the RBDv2 variant, a high-yield clonal producer cell line was obtained. We developed a simple purification scheme that consistently yielded up to 30 mg of RBD protein per liter of the simple shake flask cell culture. Purified proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in reducing and non-reducing conditions and gel filtration; for RBDv2 protein, the monomeric form content exceeded 90% for several series.

The majority of infected individuals have experienced no or only mild symptoms, ranging from fully asymptomatic cases to mild pneumonic disease. However, a minority of infected individuals develop severe respiratory symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible HLA alleles and clinical markers that can be used in risk prediction model for the early identification of severe COVID-19 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 137 patients with mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) and 53 patients with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) were recruited from the Center Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Tokyo, Japan for the period of February-August 2020.

In response, major governmental agencies have emphasized the need to frequently disinfect high-touch surfaces. While this recommendation may seem straightfor-ward and achievable, it is far more nuanced and complex. In the retail food and foodservice industry, sanitization is a routine, common practice defined and recommended in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Code. Hence, sanitizers, rather than disinfectants, are the main antimicrobial products used in these settings. It is important to emphasize that sanitizers and disinfectants are not inter-changeable products, so they may be inadvertently misused. Therefore, end users need to understand the differences of when, why, and how both can be used in retail food and foodservice settings. The aim of this paper is to increase end users knowledge and awareness about the proper use of sanitizers and disinfectants in retail food and foodservice establishments. This paper is organized into six sections Antimicrobial Products: Sanitizers and Disinfectants, FDA Food Code, Regulation of Sanitizers and Disinfectants, Understanding EPA-Registered Labels, Emerging Issues, and Current and Future Trends in Sanitizing and Disinfecting.

Given that inflammatory immune cells may induce severe lung injury, the involvement of immune factors in the pathogenesis of the disease cannot be overestimated. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses (CoVs) have developed mechanisms of immune evasion, making them invisible to the immune system at an early stage of infection. The mechanism relies on inhibition of the anti-viral response of type I interferons (IFNs), which supports uncontrolled viral replication in epithelial cells. There is growing body of evidence that the fatal hyperinflammation ('cytokine storm') responsible for the severe course of COVID-19 is a consequence of massive SARS-CoV-2 replication rather than inappropriate hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Therefore, a dampened innate anti-viral immune response seems to be the primary cause of the delayed critical cascade of uncontrolled immune events leading to fulminating systemic inflammation. The occurrence of virus transmission even in asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 clearly strengthens the evidence for a key role of sufficient immune control of viral replication in a subset of cases (e.g. in children, a population with highly effective innate immune responses). Although administration of immunomodulatory therapeutics is recommended under certain conditions in the guidelines of COVID-19 management, controversies regarding treatment protocols in immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 still exist.

This study aimed to examine COVID-19-related risk perceptions, knowledge, and information sources among prenatal and postnatal Chinese women during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted, and a four-section online questionnaire was used to collect data. Using a social media platform, the online survey was administered to 161 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, China, in February 2020. RESULTS: The participants perceived their risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 to be lower than their risk of contracting influenza, however many of them were worried that they might contract COVID-19. The participants demonstrated adequate knowledge about COVID-19. The three major sources from which they obtained information about COVID-19 were doctors, nurses/midwives, and the television, and they placed a high level of confidence in these sources. There was no significant relationship between the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and knowledge about this disease.

We advocate that professional education obligates us to embrace the role of trusteeship that demands working to meet society's needs by producing graduates who accept their social, and moral responsibilities as agents and advocates who act to improve health and health care. To achieve this, we must adopt a curriculum philosophy of social reconstruction and think more deeply about the why and how of learning. Currently, health professions education places strong emphasis on habits of head (cognitive knowledge) and hand (clinical skills), and less focus on habits of heart (professional formation). We believe that habits of heart are the essential foundations of the humanistic practice needed to address health inequities, find the moral courage to change the status quo, and address imbalances of power, privilege, and access. A social reconstruction orientation in physical therapist education not only places habits of heart at the center of curricula, it also requires intentional planning to create pathways into the profession for individuals from underrepresented groups. Adopting social reconstructionism begins with a faculty paradigm shift emphasizing the learning sciences, facilitating learning, metacognition, and development of a lifelong master adaptive learner. Achieving this vision depends not only on our ability to meet the physical therapy needs of persons with COVID-19 and its sequalae, but also on our collective courage to address injustice and systemic racism. It is imperative that the physical therapy community find the moral courage to act quickly and boldly to transform DPT education in ways that enable graduates to address the social determinants of health and their systemic and structural causes that result in health disparities.

METHODS: Total 160 subjects (80 COVID-19 patients and 80 symptom-free controls) were recruited from Shanxi and Shandong provinces, two regions heavily polluted by PFASs in China. Twelve common PFASs were quantified in both urine and serum. Urine metabolome profiling was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). RESULTS: In unadjusted models, the risk of COVID-19 infection was positively associated with urinary levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (Odds ratio: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.52-3.22]), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (2.91, [1.95-4.83], and total PFASs (&#8721; (12) PFASs) (3.31, [2.05-4.65]). After controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), the associations remained statistically significant (Adjusted odds ratio of 1.94 [95% CI: 1.39-2.96] for PFOS, 2.73 [1.71-4.55] for PFOA, and 2.82 [1.97-3.51] for &#8721; (12) PFASs). Urine metabolome-PFASs association analysis revealed that 59% of PFASs-associated urinary endogenous metabolites in COVID-19 patients were identified to be produced or largely regulated by mitochondrial function. In addition, the increase of PFASs exposure was associated with the accumulation of key metabolites in kynurenine metabolism, which are involved in immune responses (Combined ? coefficient of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.25-0.95, P = 0.001]). Moreover, alternations in PFASs-associated metabolites in mitochondrial and kynurenine metabolism were also correlated with clinical lab biomarkers for mitochondrial function (serum growth/differentiation factor-15) and immune activity (lymphocyte percentage), respectively. CONCLUSION: Elevated exposure to PFASs was independently associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. PFASs-associated metabolites were implicated in mitochondrial function and immune activity.

Here we show that EPO promotes mitochondrial respiration in developing postnatal hippocampus by increasing mitochondrial content and enhancing cellular respiratory potential. Ultrastructurally, mitochondria profiles and total vesicle content were greater in presynaptic axon terminals, suggesting that EPO enhances oxidative metabolism and synaptic transmission capabilities. Behavioural tests of hippocampus-dependent memory at early adulthood, showed that EPO improves spatial and short-term memory.

We conducted an unbiased CRISPRi screen to uncover druggable pathways controlling Spike protein binding to human cells. We found that the protein BRD2 is an essential node in the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. BRD2 is required for ACE2 transcription in human lung epithelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and BRD2 inhibitors currently evaluated in clinical trials potently block endogenous ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells. BRD2 also controls transcription of several other genes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, including the interferon response, which in turn regulates ACE2 levels. It is possible that the previously reported interaction between the viral E protein and BRD2 evolved to manipulate the transcriptional host response during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The information is transmitted from such sensory modules to other protein domains that act as output effectors. Sensor and effector can be part of the same polypeptide or instead be separate diffusible proteins that interact specifically. The output effector modules regulate physiologic responses, allowing the cells to adapt to the varying conditions. These biological machineries are known as signal transduction systems (STSs). Despite the captivating architectural diversity exhibited by STS proteins, a universal feature is their allosteric regulation: signal binding at one site modifies the activity at a physically distant site. Allostery requires protein plasticity, precisely encoded within their 3D structures, and implicating programmed molecular motions. This review summarizes how STS proteins connect stimuli to specific responses by exploiting allostery and protein plasticity. Illustrative examples spanning a wide variety of protein folds will focus on one- and two-component systems (TCSs). The former encompass the entire transmission route within a single polypeptide, whereas TCSs have evolved as separate diffusible proteins that interact specifically, sometimes including additional intermediary proteins in the pathway. Irrespective of their structural diversity, STS proteins are able to modulate their own molecular motions, which can be relatively slow, rigid-body movements, all the way to fast fluctuations in the form of macromolecular flexibility, thus spanning a continuous protein dynamics spectrum. In sum, STSs rely on allostery to steer information transmission, going from simple two-state switching to rich multi-state conformational order/disorder transitions.","output":"Allostery and protein plasticity: the keystones for bacterial signaling and regulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Expanding addiction treatment services in Rhode Island has never been more urgent.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the scientific evidence on the possible influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on MH, critically evaluating the methods and scientific validity of the studies found, in addition to summarizing the recommendations on strategic measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on MH. METHODOLOGY: The current scoping review was conducted from a screening of 465 articles on COVID-19 and MH outcomes, based on the main database of scientific references on health, assessed throughout PubMed. RESULT : Of the 43 papers selected for summary and critical analysis 77% (n=33) indicated a relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and anxiety symptoms, 56% (n=26) with depression or depressive symptoms, seven with changes in sleep pattern and seven with obsessive behaviours or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. In addition to studies that showed an influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, stress and fear.

The diagnosis was based on the total lung severity score ranging from 0 to 25. The data were randomly split into a 40% training set and a 60% test set. Optimal cut-off value was determined using Youden-index method on the training cohort. RESULTS: A total of 1259 patients were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of RT-PCR positivity in the overall investigated period was 51.5%. As compared to RT-PCR, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy on the test cohort were 39.0%, 80.2%, 68.0%, 55.0% and 58.9%, respectively. Regarding the whole data set, when adding those with positive RT-PCR test at any time during hospital stay or COVID-19 without virus detection, as final diagnosis to the true positive cases, specificity increased from 80.3% to 88.1% and the positive predictive value increased from 68.4% to 81.7%. CONCLUSION: DL-based CT severity score was found to have a good specificity and positive predictive value, as compared to RT-PCR. This standardized scoring system can aid rapid diagnosis and clinical decision making. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: DL-based CT severity score can detect COVID-19-related lung alterations even at early stages, when RT-PCR is not yet positive.","output":"The diagnostic performance of deep-learning-based CT severity score to identify COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular diarrhoea, are common in non-treated HIV-1 infected individuals. Although various enteric pathogens have been implicated, the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of HIV-1 infected patients. Our aim is to identify the cause of diarrhoea for patients that remain negative in routine diagnostics. METHODS: In this study stool samples of 196 HIV-1 infected persons, including 29 persons with diarrhoea, were examined for enteropathogens and HIV-1. A search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cDNA-AFLP combined with Roche-454 sequencing (VIDISCA-454). RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA was detected in stool of 19 patients with diarrhoea (66%) compared to 75 patients (45%) without diarrhoea. In 19 of the 29 diarrhoea cases a known enteropathogen could be identified (66%). Next to these known causative agents, a range of recently identified viruses was identified via VIDISCA-454: cosavirus, Aichi virus, human gyrovirus, and non-A non-B hepatitis virus. Moreover, a novel virus was detected which was named immunodeficiency-associated stool virus (IASvirus). However, PCR based screening for these viruses showed that none of these novel viruses was associated with diarrhoea. Notably, among the 34% enteropathogen-negative cases, HIV-1 RNA shedding in stool was more frequently observed (80%) compared to enteropathogen-positive cases (47%), indicating that HIV-1 itself is the most likely candidate to be involved in diarrhoea. CONCLUSION: Unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1 infected patients is probably not caused by recently described or previously unknown pathogens, but it is more likely that HIV-1 itself plays a role in intestinal mucosal abnormalities which leads to diarrhoea.","output":"Unexplained diarrhoea in HIV-1 infected individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widely spreading COVID-19 has caused thousands of hundreds of mortalities over the world in the past few months. Early diagnosis of the virus is of great significance for both of infected patients and doctors providing treatments. Chest Computerized tomography (CT) screening is one of the most straightforward techniques to detect pneumonia which was caused by the virus and thus to make the diagnosis. To facilitate the process of diagnosing COVID-19, we therefore developed a graph convolutional neural network ResGNet-C under ResGNet framework to automatically classify lung CT images into normal and confirmed pneumonia caused by COVID-19. In ResGNet-C, two by-products named NNet-C, ResNet101-C that showed high performance on detection of COVID-19 are simultaneously generated as well. Our best model ResGNet-C achieved an averaged accuracy at 0.9662 with an averaged sensitivity at 0.9733 and an averaged specificity at 0.9591 using five cross-validations on the dataset, which is comprised of 296 CT images. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating graph knowledge into the COVID-19 classification task. Graphs are constructed according to the Euclidean distance between features extracted by our proposed ResNet101-C and then are encoded with the features to give the prediction results of CT images. Besides the high-performance system, which surpassed all state-of-the-art methods, our proposed graph construction method is simple, transferrable yet quite helpful for improving the performance of classifiers, as can be justified by the experimental results.","output":"ResGNet-C: A graph convolutional neural network for detection of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A herd of pigs infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was used in a double-blind randomised trial to assess the effectiveness of three control strategies against chronic respiratory disease in growing-finishing pigs.

We describe COVID-19 infection control measures implemented and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the Emory Dialysis facilities. METHODS: Implementation of COVID-19 infection procedures commenced in February 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 preparedness assessments were conducted at each facility. Patients with COVID-19 from March 1-May 31, 2020 were included; with a follow-up period spanning March-June 30, 2020. Percentages of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were calculated, and characteristics of COVID-19 patients were summarized as medians or percentage. Baseline characteristics of all patients receiving care at Emory Dialysis (i.e. Emory general dialysis population) were presented as medians and percentages. RESULTS: Of 751 dialysis patients, 23 (3.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median age was 67.0 years and 13 patients (56.6%) were female. Eleven patients (47.8%) were residents of nursing homes. Nineteen patients (82.6%) required hospitalization and 6 patients (26.1%) died; the average number of days from a positive SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) test to death was 16.8 days (range 1-34). Two patients dialyzing at adjacent dialysis stations and a dialysis staff who cared for them, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in a time frame that may suggest transmission in the dialysis facility. In response, universal masking in the facility was implemented (prior to national guidelines recommending universal masking), infection control audits and re-trainings of PPE were also done to bolster infection control practices. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented recommended COVID-19 infection control measures aimed at mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the patients with COVID-19 required hospitalizations.

This study investigates how public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, affect peoples impulsive consumption behavior. Data from 1548 individuals in China during the COVID-19 outbreak was collected. The sample covered 297 prefecture-level cities in 31 provincial administrative regions. The research method included the use of a structural equation model to test multiple research hypotheses. The study finds that the severity of a pandemic positively affects peoples impulsive consumption. Specifically, the more severe the pandemic, the more likely people are to make impulsive consumption choices. The results indicate that both perceived control and materialism play mediating roles between the severity of a pandemic and impulsive consumption. As conclusions, peoples impulsive consumption during public health emergencies can be weakened either by enhancing their perceived control or by reducing their materialistic tendency.

There are currently no effective treatment strategies and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of this fatal disease. The current study aims to determine promising treatment options for the COVID-19 through a computational drug repurposing approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we focus on differentially expressed genes (DEGs), detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines including \\"the primary human lung epithelial cell line NHBE\\" and \\"the transformed lung alveolar cell line A549\\". Next, the identified DEGs are used in the connectivity map (CMap) analysis to identify similarly acting therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, to interpret lists of DEGs, pathway enrichment and protein network analysis are performed. Genes are categorized into easily interpretable pathways based on their biological functions, and overrepresentation of each pathway is tested in comparison to what is expected randomly. KEY FINDINGS: The results suggest the effectiveness of lansoprazole, folic acid, sulfamonomethoxine, tolnaftate, diclofenamide, halcinonide, saquinavir, metronidazole, ebselen, lidocaine and benzocaine, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors, and many other clinically approved drugs as potent drugs against COVID-19 outbreak. SIGNIFICANCE: Making new drugs remain a lengthy process, so the drug repurposing approach provides an insight into the therapeutics that might be helpful in this pandemic.

We have noted a paucity of lymph nodes in rectal cancer specimens after neoadjuvant therapy, positing that the number of lymph nodes depends on the response to radiation and may not be an appropriate benchmark. Our purpose was to determine whether the number of lymph nodes harvested after neoadjuvant therapy is a useful quality indicator. METHODS A database of rectal cancer patients was queried to identify patients undergoing total mesorectal excision after neoadjuvant chemoradiation between January 1997 and August 2007. We compared patients with <12 lymph nodes to those with >or=12 lymph nodes relative to multiple patient and treatment factors. RESULTS One hundred seventy-six patients were identified (119 men; mean age, 60.4 y (range, 22-87)). Mean lymph node harvest was 10.1 (range, 1-38). Only 28% had >or=12 lymph nodes and 32% had <6 lymph nodes. There was no statistically significant difference in lymph node harvest relative to radiation dosage, age, tumor response, or type of surgery.

OBJECTIVE: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods approach was used to examine the rates of visit completion as well as the opinions and experiences of participants enrolled in an ongoing clinical trial of smoking cessation who were required to change from in-person clinic visits to remote visits using video or telephone conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For quantitative comparisons, we used a quasi-experimental design, comparing a cohort of participants followed during the pandemic (n=23, COVID-19 cohort) to a comparable cohort of participants followed over a similar time period in the calendar years 2018 and 2019 (n=51, pre-COVID-19 cohort) to examine the rates of completion of scheduled visits and biospecimen collection. For the qualitative component, interviews were conducted with participants who experienced the transition from in-person to remote visits. RESULTS: Participants in the COVID-19 cohort completed an average of 83.6% of remote clinic visits (95% CI 73.1%-91.2%), which was not significantly different than the in-person completion rate of 89.8% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Participants in the COVID-19 cohort returned an average of 93.2% (95% CI 83.5%-98.1%) of saliva specimens for remote clinic visits completed, which was not significantly different than the in-person saliva specimen completion rate of 100% in the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Two broad themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) the benefits of remote visits and (2) the challenges of remote counseling compared to in-person counseling. Despite limited experience with telehealth prior to this transition, most participants expressed a willingness to engage in remote visits in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the context of a rapid transition from in-person to remote visits necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, rates of visit completion and return of biospecimens remained high. Participants were generally accepting of the transition. Further research is needed to identify the optimal mix of in-person and remote visits beyond the pandemic context and to better understand how these changes may impact study outcomes.

All scenarios assumed a 6- or 12-month disruption followed by a rapid catch-up of missed screens. Cervical screening disruptions could increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5-6%. In all settings, more than 60% of the excess cancer burden due to disruptions are likely to have occurred in women aged less than 50 years in 2020, including settings where women in their 30s have previously been offered HPV vaccination. Approximately 15-30% of cancers predicted to result from disruptions could be prevented by maintaining colposcopy and precancer treatment services during any disruption period. Disruptions to primary screening had greater adverse effects in situations where women due to attend for screening in 2020 had cytology (vs. HPV) as their previous primary test. Rapid catch-up would dramatically increase demand for HPV tests in 2021, which it may not be feasible to meet because of competing demands on the testing machines and reagents due to COVID tests.

METHODS: Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, enrolled in the LEOSS cohort study between March 16, 2020, and May 14, 2020, were analyzed. Associations between baseline characteristics and clinical stages at diagnosis (uncomplicated vs. complicated) were assessed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: We included 2155 patients, 59.7% (1,287/2,155) were male; the most common age category was 66-85 years (39.6%; 500/2,155). The primary COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 35.0% (755/2,155) during complicated clinical stages. A significant univariate association between age; sex; body mass index; smoking; diabetes; cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and kidney diseases; ACE inhibitor therapy; statin intake and an increased risk for complicated clinical stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis was found.

Even though causality has not yet been established, intestinal dysbiosis has emerged as a hallmark of several diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). The fact that the microbiota and central nervous system are co-developing during the first years of life has provided a paradigm suggesting a potential role of psychobiotics for earlier interventions. Studies in animal models of early-life stress (ELS) have shown that they can counteract the pervasive effects of stress during this crucial developmental period, and rescue behavioral symptoms related to anxiety and depression later in life. In humans, evidence from clinical studies on the efficacy of psychobiotics at improving mental outcomes in most NPDs remain limited, except for major depressive disorder for which more studies are available. Consequently, the beneficial effect of psychobiotics on depression-related outcomes in adults are becoming clearer. While the specific mechanisms at play remain elusive, the effect of psychobiotics are generally considered to involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, intestinal permeability, and inflammation. It is anticipated that future clinical studies will explore the potential role of psychobiotics at mitigating the risk developing NPDs in vulnerable individuals or in the context of childhood adversity. However, such studies remain challenging at present in terms of design and target populations; the profound impact of stress on the proper development of the MGBA during the first year of life is becoming increasingly recognized, but the trajectories post-ELS in humans and the mechanisms by which stress affects the susceptibility to various NPDs are still ill-defined. As psychobiotics are likely to exert both shared and specific mechanisms, a better definition of target subpopulations would allow to tailor psychobiotics selection by aligning mechanistic properties with known pathophysiological mechanisms or risk factors. Here we review the available evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting a role for psychobiotics at ameliorating depression-related outcomes, highlighting the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with conducting longitudinal studies to address outstanding key questions in the field.","output":"The effects of psychobiotics on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in early-life stress and neuropsychiatric disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A ship in the harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for, observed that sage 19th century philosopher William Shedd.

The Pearson's rank correlation coefficients, between total scores of SNSI-CHI and CPSS and SINS-CN and CPSS, were assessed to 0.38 (P < 0.01) and 0.39 (P < 0.01), respectively. Regarding the CPSS, as the criterion, the cut-points of SNSI-CHI and SINS-CN for the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.77and 0.66, respectively. Conclusion Both scales are valid and reliable for evaluating the source of stress of student nurses in China. Each has its own characteristics, but the SNSI-CHI demonstrated marginal advantage over the SINS-CN. The SNSI-CHI is short, is easily understood, and with clear dimension for the nursing students, and the SNSI-CHI is more acceptable for the users in China.","output":"Testing Two Student Nurse Stress Instruments in Chinese Nursing Students: A Comparative Study Using Exploratory Factor Analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although recent trends in politics and media make it appear that conspiracy theories are on the rise, in fact they have always been present, probably because they are sustained by natural dispositions of the human brain.

Nurse practitioner, medical, and pharmacy students participated in virtual patient contact, geriatric case-based learning, and team-based interprofessional development. We conducted pre-and post-outreach assessments with students and geriatric providers to determine the effects of this initiative. After participating in the 3-month outreach initiative, interprofessional students reported increased confidence in conducting outreach calls, participating in interdisciplinary team discussions, and reviewing geriatric cases.

Here, we achieved a substantial reduction in time required to read a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study to estimate left atrial volume without compromising accuracy or reliability. Rather than deploying a fully automatic black-box, we propose to incorporate the automated LA volumetry into a human-centric interactive image-analysis process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atri-U, an automated data analysis pipeline for long-axis cardiac cine images, computes the atrial volume by: (i) detecting the end-systolic frame, (ii) outlining the endocardial borders of the LA, (iii) localizing the mitral annular hinge points and constructing the longitudinal atrial diameters, equivalent to the usual workup done by clinicians. In every step human interaction is possible, such that the results provided by the algorithm can be accepted, corrected, or re-done from scratch. Atri-U was trained and evaluated retrospectively on a sample of 300 patients and then applied to a consecutive clinical sample of 150 patients with various heart conditions. The agreement of the indexed LA volume between Atri-U and two experts was similar to the inter-rater agreement between clinicians (average overestimation of 0.8 mL/m(2) with upper and lower limits of agreement of ? 7.5 and 5.8 mL/m(2), respectively). An expert cardiologist blinded to the origin of the annotations rated the outputs produced by Atri-U as acceptable in 97% of cases for step (i), 94% for step (ii) and 95% for step (iii), which was slightly lower than the acceptance rate of the outputs produced by a human expert radiologist in the same cases (92%, 100% and 100%, respectively). The assistance of Atri-U lead to an expected reduction in reading time of 66%from 105 to 34 s, in our in-house clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposal enables automated calculation of the maximum LA volume approaching human accuracy and precision. The optional user interaction is possible at each processing step. As such, the assisted process sped up the routine CMR workflow by providing accurate, precise, and validated measurement results.

METHODS Medical attention injuries, time-loss injuries and dance exposure hours of 123 professional ballet dancers (women: n=66, age: 28.08.3 years; men: n=57, age: 27.98.5 years) were prospectively recorded between the 2015/2016 and 2019/2020 seasons. RESULTS The incidence rate (per 1000 hours) of medical attention injury was 3.9 (95% CI 3.3 to 4.4) for women and 3.1 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.5) for men. The incidence rate (per 1000 hours) of time-loss injury was 1.2 (95% CI 1.0 to 1.5) for women and 1.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.3) for men. First Soloists and Principals experienced between 2.0-2.2 additional medical attention injuries per 1000 hours and 0.9-1.1 additional time-loss injuries per 1000 hours compared with Apprentices (p0.025). Further, intraseason differences were observed in medical attention, but not time-loss, injury incidence rates with the highest incidence rates in early (August and September) and late (June) season months. Thirty-five per cent of time-loss injuries resulted in over 28 days of modified dance training. A greater percentage of time-loss injuries were classified as overuse (women: 50%; men: 51%) compared with traumatic (women: 40%; men: 41%). CONCLUSION This is the first study to report the incidence rate of medical attention and time-loss injuries in professional ballet dancers.

METHODS: In this observational research, we studied 104 intubated adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection (based on clinical symptoms, and radiographic or CT scan parameters) who were admitted to the ICU of a multispecialty hospital during March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. All cases received standard treatment regimens as local protocol (Oseltamivir + hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or sofosbuvir or atazanavir  ribavirin). The cases were grouped as controls (n = 43), infliximab (n = 27), IVIg (n = 23) and combination (n = 11). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between controls and treatment groups in terms of underlying diseases or the number of underlying diseases.

The review summarizes the benefits of using HCQ against COVID-19 through exploiting the ability of this antimalarial agent in ameliorating the body immunity, inhibiting and/or delaying the viral glycosylation by increasing the pH inside the host cell and also via suppressing the viral transcription and replication through the formation of a complex structure after binding with zinc. We concluded that these interfering properties of HCQ support human immunity to fight against the progression of COVID-19.

Nintedanib, an antifibrotic drug, has been shown to delay the worsening of pulmonary function in IPF. Therefore, the concomitant use of nintedanib with pulmonary rehabilitation is anticipated to contribute to the long-term maintenance of the pulmonary rehabilitation effects. The long-term effect of pulmonary rehabilitation under nintedanib treatment in IPF (FITNESS) study is a multicenter, randomised, prospective, parallel-group, open-label trial. METHODS: The study will enrol 84 patients with IPF who have been treated with nintedanib. Patients in the pulmonary rehabilitation group will receive a programmed short-term induction pulmonary rehabilitation programme, followed by a maintenance home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programme, while patients in the control group will receive usual outpatient care. Patients in both groups will continue to receive nintedanib treatment throughout the study period. The primary end-point of the study is to compare the change in the 6-min walk distance from the baseline to 12 months between the pulmonary rehabilitation and control groups. The main secondary end-point is endurance exercise time, measured using a bicycle ergometer. DISCUSSION: FITNESS is the first randomised controlled study to evaluate the long-term effects of pulmonary rehabilitation in IPF treated with nintedanib. This study will address the hypothesis that concomitant use of nintedanib contributes to the maintenance of long-term effects of pulmonary rehabilitation, thus leading to a comprehensive therapeutic approach of nintedanib and pulmonary rehabilitation in the antifibrotic era.","output":"Protocol for long-term effect of pulmonary rehabilitation under nintedanib in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper will investigate the literature surrounding cyber security threats in the 2020 US Elections.

To this end, the contribution of our work is twofold. First, it introduces a new method for obfuscating malicious code to bypass all static checks of multi-engine scanners, such as VirusTotal. Interestingly, our approach to generating the malicious executables is not based on introducing a new packer but on the augmentation of the capabilities of an existing and widely used tool for packaging Python, PyInstaller but can be used for all similar packaging tools. As we prove, the problem is deeper and inherent in almost all antivirus engines and not PyInstaller specific. Second, our work exposes significant issues of well-known sandboxes that allow malware to evade their checks. As a result, we show that stealth and evasive malware can be efficiently developed, bypassing with ease state of the art malware detection tools without raising any alert.","output":"Python and Malware: Developing Stealth and Evasive Malware Without Obfuscation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Healthcare practitioners (HCPs) play a crucial role in recognising, responding to, and supporting female patients experiencing intimate partner abuse (IPA). However, research consistently identifies barriers they perceive prevent them from doing this work effectively. These barriers can be system-based (e.g. lack of time or training) or personal/individual. This review of qualitative evidence aims to synthesise the personal barriers that impact HCPs' responses to IPA. METHODS Five databases were searched in March 2020. Studies needed to utilise qualitative methods for both data collection and analysis and be published between 2010 and 2020 in order to qualify for inclusion; however, we considered any type of healthcare setting in any country. Article screening, data extraction and methodological appraisal using a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Program checklist for qualitative studies were undertaken by at least two independent reviewers. Data analysis drew on Thomas and Harden's thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies conducted in 20 countries informed the final review. A variety of HCPs and settings were represented. Three themes were developed that describe the personal barriers experienced by HCPs: I can't interfere (which describes the belief that IPA is a \\"private matter\\" and HCPs' fears of causing harm by intervening); I don't have control (highlighting HCPs' frustration when women do not follow their advice); and I won't take responsibility (which illuminates beliefs that addressing IPA should be someone else's job). CONCLUSION This review highlights the need for training to address personal issues in addition to structural or organisational barriers. Education and training for HCPs needs to: encourage reflection on their own values to reinforce their commitment to addressing IPA; teach HCPs to relinquish the need to control outcomes so that they can adopt an advocacy approach; and support HCPs' trust in the critical role they can play in responding. Future research should explore effective ways to do this within the context of complex healthcare organisations.","output":"Personal barriers to addressing intimate partner abuse: a qualitative meta-synthesis of healthcare practitioners' experiences."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In recognition of the interconnected nature of complex challenges such as COVID-19, a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach, referred to as One Health, has been employed to address sustainable development and strengthen global health security. Although significant investments have been made to build global health capacity, there has not been a large-scale effort to capture the lived experiences of those working in One Health-related sectors.Methods: We collected and analyzed perspectives from students, graduates, workers, and employers in One Health through a multinational online survey across numerous health disciplines and sectors. Respondents were recruited through professional networks.Findings: A total of 828 respondents from 66 countries participated, representing governmental and academic institutions and students, among others;57% were female, and 56% had completed professional health degrees. Interpersonal communication, communication with non-scientific audiences, and the ability to work in transdisciplinary teams were valued in the workplace. Employers indicated difficulty recruiting workers, while workers indicated limited availability of positions.Interpretation: Successful One Health workers use interpersonal skills and scientific knowledge to address complex health challenges. A misalignment in One Health definitions and expectations may be hindering the matching of job seekers and employers. As One Health has evolved to address food insecurity, emerging diseases, and antimicrobial resistance, it holds promise for supporting an interdisciplinary global health workforce that can make substantial progress on Sustainable Development Goals and improve global health security for all.Funding Information: This research was supported in part by and benefited from intellectual contributions from USAIDs PREDICT Project (JM and ET) and One Health Workforce -- Next Generation Projects (JM)Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests.Ethics Approval Statement: The project was determined to be exempt by the University of California, Davis, Institutional Review Board (IRB ID: 1312001-1).","output":"How to Build an Interdisciplinary, Multisectoral Global Health Workforce: Lessons From One Health Professionals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current 2019-nCoV outbreak is becoming extremely noxious and has affected the whole world.

For other respiratory tract infections community hand hygiene interventions are supported by evidence from randomised trials, but information on how effectiveness in reducing transmission scales with achieved changes in hand hygiene behaviour is lacking. This information is of critical importance when considering the potential value of substantially enhancing community hand hygiene frequency to help suppress COVID-19. Here, we developed a simple model-based framework for understanding the key determinants of the effectiveness of changes in hand hygiene behaviour in reducing transmission and use it to explore the potential impact of interventions aimed at achieving large-scale population-wide changes in hand hygiene behaviour. Our analyses show that the effect of hand hygiene is highly dependent on the duration of viral persistence on hands and that hand washing needs to be performed very frequently or immediately after hand contamination events in order to substantially reduce the probability of infection. Hand washing at a lower frequency, such as every 30 minutes or with a delay of 15 minutes after contamination events, may be adequate to reduce the probability of infection when viral survival on hands is longer, such as when hands are contaminated with mucus. Immediate hand washing after contamination is more effective than hand washing at fixed-time intervals even when the total number of hand washing events is similar. This event-prompted hand washing strategy is consistently more effective than fixed-time strategy regardless of hand contamination rates and should be highlighted in hand hygiene campaigns.","output":"The Potential Impact of Intensified Community Hand Hygiene Interventions on Respiratory tract Infections: A Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease and became a public health emergency worldwide. In the present study, comparison among most vigorously affected select cities across different countries, Delhi (India), Madrid (Spain), Lombardy (Italy), and New York and New Jersey (USA), were carried out up to July 2020. Predictive modelling was employed by using machine learning algorithms to predict the spread of the virus during August to November 2020. The results indicated that population density and urban density have a stronger connection with the spread of COVID-19 across the cities of Madrid, New York, and New Jersey. Conversely, Milan has exhibited a higher infection rate despite low population density (420 persons/km2) because of delayed human-human transmission measures and lockdowns. Relatively lower infection was recorded in Delhi even with higher population density (11,312 persons/km2) and higher urban compactness, which can be attributed to timely lockdowns and social distancing measures.

Objectives: To assess the role of anxiety about appearance and self-compassion on the practice of physical exercise and use of IPEDs during lockdown. Methods: An international online questionnaire was carried out using the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) in addition to questions on the use of IPEDs. Results: The sample consisted of 3,161 (65% female) adults from Italy (41.1%), Spain (15.7%), the United Kingdom (UK) (12.0%), Lithuania (11.6%), Portugal (10.5%), Japan (5.5%), and Hungary (3.5%). The mean age was 35.05 years (SD = 12.10). Overall, 4.3% of the participants were found to engage in excessive or problematic exercise with peaks registered in the UK (11.0%) and Spain (5.4%). The sample reported the use of a wide range of drugs and medicines to boost image and performance (28%) and maintained use during the lockdown, mostly in Hungary (56.6%), Japan (46.8%), and the UK (33.8%), with 6.4% who started to use a new drug. Significant appearance anxiety levels were found across the sample, with 18.1% in Italy, 16.9% in Japan, and 16.7% in Portugal. Logistic regression models revealed a strong association between physical exercise and IPED use. Anxiety about appearance also significantly increased the probability of using IPEDs. However, self-compassion did not significantly predict such behavior. Anxiety about appearance and self-compassion were non-significant predictors associated with engaging in physical exercise. Discussion and Conclusion: This study identified risks of problematic exercising and appearance anxiety among the general population during the COVID-19 lockdown period across all the participating countries with significant gender differences. Such behaviors were positively associated with the unsupervised use of IPEDs, although no interaction between physical exercise and appearance anxiety was observed. Further considerations are needed to explore the impact of socially restrictive measures among vulnerable groups, and the implementation of more targeted responses.","output":"Exercise and Use of Enhancement Drugs at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicultural Study on Coping Strategies During Self-Isolation and Related Risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019-2020 We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus","output":"Emergence of deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during 2019-2020.

The current study aimed to explore the relationship between different dietary patterns, cognitive performance, and potential cardio-metabolic mechanisms for this relationship. Participants were recruited using a diet screening tool to ensure that the cohort had a range of diet quality ranging from relatively poor to relatively healthy. In a sample of 141 middle-aged adults (age: M = 52.84 years, SD = 6.87 years), multiple 24 h diet recalls were collected and used to score adherence to the Mediterranean diet, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) diet, and Mediterranean-DASH diet intervention for neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet. Metabolic risk was assessed using the metabolic syndrome severity score (MetSSS) and arterial stiffness. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Swinburne University Computerized Cognitive Assessment Battery (SUCCAB). Adherence to the MIND diet was significantly related to Stroop Processing domain (? = 0.19, p = 0.035). None of the dietary patterns were significantly related to MetSSS or arterial stiffness.

The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event. However, it is not possible to ascertain which adverse events were directly related to tocilizumab therapy. In patients with severe COVID\\\\19, tocilizumab was associated with dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement and reduced ventilatory support requirements.

Improvements include: ingestion of complex sequence assembly data categories (metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assemblies, single cell amplified genomes, and metagenome assembled genomes), prediction of the Least Common Ancestor (LCA) for a peptide shared across multiple organisms, increased performance through updates to the backend architecture, and development of a web portal (https://metatryp.whoi.edu). Major expansion of the marine database confirms low occurrence of shared tryptic peptides among disparate marine microorganisms, implying tractability for targeted metaproteomics. METATRYP was designed for ocean metaproteomics and has been integrated into the Ocean Protein Portal (https://oceanproteinportal.org); however, it can be readily applied to other domains. We describe the rapid deployment of a coronavirus-specific web portal (https://metatryp-coronavirus.whoi.edu/) to aid in use of proteomics on coronavirus research during the ongoing pandemic. A Coronavirus-focused METATRYP database identified potential SARS-CoV-2 peptide biomarkers and indicated very few shared tryptic peptides between SARS-CoV-2 and other disparate taxa, sharing 0.1% peptides or less (1 peptide) with the Influenza A & B pan-proteomes, establishing that taxonomic specificity is achievable using tryptic peptide-based proteomic diagnostic approaches. Statement of significance When assigning taxonomic attribution in bottom-up metaproteomics, the potential for shared tryptic peptides among organisms in mixed communities should be considered. The software program METATRYP v 2 and associated interactive web portals enables users to identify the frequency of shared tryptic peptides among taxonomic groups and evaluate the occurrence of specific tryptic peptides within complex communities.

Home-based exercise might be an adequate means to increase physical activity by improving health- (i.e., muscle strength) and skill-related components of physical fitness (i.e., balance), particularly in times of restricted physical activity due to pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of home-based balance exercises conducted during daily tooth brushing on measures of balance and muscle strength in healthy older adults. METHODS: Fifty-one older adults were randomly assigned to a balance exercise group (n = 27; age: 65.1  1.1 years) or a passive control group (n = 24; age: 66.2  3.3 years). The intervention group conducted balance exercises over a period of eight weeks twice daily for three minutes each during their daily tooth brushing routine. Pre- and post-intervention, tests were included for the assessment of static steady-state balance (i.e., Romberg test), dynamic steady-state balance (i.e., 10-m single and dual-task walk test using a cognitive and motor interference task), proactive balance (i.e., Timed-Up-and-Go Test [TUG], Functional-Reach-Test [FRT]), and muscle strength (i.e., Chair-Rise-Test [CRT]). RESULTS: Irrespective of group, the statistical analysis revealed significant main effects for time (pre vs. post) for dual-task gait speed (p < .001, 1.12  d  2.65), TUG (p < .001, d = 1.17), FRT (p = .002, d = 0.92), and CRT (p = .002, d = 0.94) but not for single-task gait speed and for the Romberg-Test. No significant group  time interactions were found for any of the investigated variables. CONCLUSIONS: The applied lifestyle balance training program conducted twice daily during tooth brushing routines appears not to be sufficient in terms of exercise dosage and difficulty level to enhance balance and muscle strength in healthy adults aged 60C72 years. Consequently, structured balance training programs using higher exercise dosages and/or more difficult balance tasks are recommended for older adults to improve balance and muscle strength.","output":"The performance of balance exercises during daily tooth brushing is not sufficient to improve balance and muscle strength in healthy older adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The telomere biology disorders (TBDs) include a range of multisystem diseases characterized by mucocutaneous symptoms and bone marrow failure. In dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), the clinical features of TBDs stem from the depletion of crucial stem cell populations in highly proliferative tissues, resulting from abnormal telomerase function. Due to the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and lack of a conclusive laboratory test it may be challenging to reach a clinical diagnosis, especially if patients lack the pathognomonic clinical features of TBDs. METHODS: Clinical sequencing was performed on a cohort of patients presenting with variable immune phenotypes lacking molecular diagnoses. Hypothesis-free whole-exome sequencing (WES) was selected in the absence of compelling diagnostic hints in patients with variable immunological and haematological conditions. RESULTS: In four patients belonging to three families, we have detected five novel variants in known TBD-causing genes (DKC1, TERT and RTEL1). In addition to the molecular findings, they all presented shortened blood cell telomeres. These findings are consistent with the displayed TBD phenotypes, addressing towards the molecular diagnosis and subsequent clinical follow-up of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly support the utility of WES-based approaches for routine genetic diagnostics of TBD patients with heterogeneous or atypical clinical presentation who otherwise might remain undiagnosed.

All of these subspecies are endemic and also listed by the IUCN as endangered or threatened with extinction due to extensive deforestation. Nevertheless, in order to mitigate conflicts with macaques, the above article recommended buffer zones that \\"should be at least 100-200 m wide, devoid of trees, shrubs and food sources: pasture could serve this purpose\\" [Dittus et al., 2019, p. 100]. This recommendation is presented without an explicit statement that buffer zones should not be carved out of existing primate habitats. Therefore, it could be misused by corrupt politicians and timber contractors to justify deforestation, even by expanding existing pastures that do not meet the width specifications prescribed by the article. These actions could undermine the survival of both langurs that rely exclusively on a vegetarian diet. Therefore, in my opinion, buffer zones as proposed by Dittus et al. [2019] are not a valid recommendation to mitigate human-monkey conflicts (HMCs) in Sri Lanka. I consider several other statements in the article also to have questionable relevance to mitigating HMCs in Sri Lanka. However, I discuss a commercially viable activity reported by Dittus et al.

However, they do not discuss the enterprise's proven ability to promote peaceful coexistence with monkeys.Therefore, I explain how the enterprise could help communities throughout Sri Lanka to accrue financial benefits, by practicing peaceful coexistence with all monkey subspecies and promoting their conservation at the same time.

Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in assessing the severity of the infection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients, radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually. Therefore, an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can cause possible misjudgment.

The main purpose of the current study is to find out whether there is any difference in the incidence of IPV during and before the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and whether any sociodemographical factors are related to the incidence of IPV against pregnant women during quarantine. A cross-sectional, correlational design was in this study. The snowball sampling technique was adopted to select the participants, which produced a nonrepresentative sample of 215 pregnant women. The participants completed the Arabic version of the World Health Organization's Domestic Violence Questionnaire Screening Tool (DVQST). We found that women were exposed to different types of IPV before and during the quarantine. The most prevalent form of IPV was control and humiliation (n 172, 80%) and the least prevalent was sexual violence ((n 33, 15.3%), (n 24, 11.2%), respectively). However, there were statistically significant lower DVQST scores during the COVID-19 quarantine than before the quarantine. All types of IPV are significantly correlated with each other and with relationship problems (marital conflict, verbal fighting, understanding each other). While the findings are not generalizable to the general population of pregnant women in Jordan because the sample consisted only of women of high socioeconomic status due to the use of a nonprobability sampling technique, national campaigns should be developed and implemented in order to reduce IPV and change community behaviors and attitudes toward violence against women.

Furthermore, there is an urgent need to identify and explore the most important socioeconomic risk factors associated with the COVID-19 disease among incident cancer patients, one of the most vulnerable groups of the population. Findings from this study provide invaluable evidence needed for risk classification and stratification among incident cancer patients, based on the information from the first pandemic wave in the UK. We identified the clinical and socio-demographic profile of cancer patients at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. The results from the study added knowledge on impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable cancer patients in the UK, and can shed light on possible treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19, including future vaccination prioritisation policy. ABSTRACT: We explored the role of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 incidence among cancer patients during the first wave of the pandemic. We conducted a case-control study within the UK Biobank cohort linked to the COVID-19 tests results available from 16 March 2020 until 23 August 2020. The main exposure variable was socioeconomic status, assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Among 18,917 participants with an incident malignancy in the UK Biobank cohort, 89 tested positive for COVID-19. The overall COVID-19 incidence was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95%CI 3.8C5.8). Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive (RR 2.6, 95%CI 1.1C5.8). Other independent risk factors were ethnic minority background, obesity, unemployment, smoking, and being diagnosed with a haematological cancer for less than five years. A consistent pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 among incident cancer patients in the UK highlights the need to prioritise the cancer patients living in the most deprived areas in vaccination planning. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.","output":"Socioeconomic Inequalities and Ethnicity Are Associated with a Positive COVID-19 Test among Cancer Patients in the UK Biobank Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The UK Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) emphasises the need for high levels of engagement with communities and individuals to ensure the effectiveness of any COVID-19 testing programme. A novel pilot health surveillance programme to assess the feasibility of weekly community RT-LAMP (Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva samples collected at home was developed and piloted by the University of Southampton and Southampton City Council. METHODS: Rapid qualitative evaluation was conducted to explore experiences of those who took part in the programme, of those who declined and of those in the educational and healthcare organisations involved in the pilot testing who were responsible for roll-out. This included 77 interviews and 20 focus groups with 223 staff, students, pupils and household members from four schools, one university, and one community healthcare NHS trust. The insights generated and informed the design and modification of the Southampton COVID-19 Saliva Testing Programme and the next phase of community-testing. RESULTS: Discussions revealed that high levels of communication, trust and convenience were necessary to ensure peoples engagement with the programme. Participants felt reassured by and pride in taking part in this novel programme. They suggested modifications to reduce the programmes environmental impact and overcome cultural barriers to participation. CONCLUSIONS: Participants and stakeholders motivations, challenges and concerns need to be understood and these insights used to modify the programme in a continuous, real-time process to ensure and sustain engagement with testing over the extended period necessary.

While the protection offered by vaccines (and booster doses) offers a method of mitigating the worst effects, by the end of 2021 the distribution of vaccine was highly heterogeneous with some countries achieving over 90% coverage in adults by the end of 2021, while others have less than 2%. In part, this is due to the availability of sufficient vaccine, although vaccine hesitancy also plays a role. Methods: We use an age-structured model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, matched to national data from 152 countries, to investigate the global impact of different vaccine sharing protocols during 2021. We assume a direct relationship between the emergence of variants with increased transmissibility and the cumulative amount of global infection, such that lower global prevalence leads to a lower reproductive number within each country. We compare five vaccine sharing scenarios, from the current situation, through sharing once a particular within-country threshold is reached (e.g. all over 40s have received 2 doses), to full sharing where all countries achieve equal age-dependent vaccine deployment. Findings: Compared to the observed distribution of vaccine uptake, we estimate full vaccine sharing would have generated a 1.5% (PI -0.1 - 4.5%) reduction in infections and a 11.3% (PI 0.6 - 23.2%) reduction in mortality globally by January 2022. The greatest benefit of vaccine sharing would have been experienced by low and middle income countries, who see an average 5.2% (PI 2.5% - 10.4%) infection reduction and 26.8% (PI 24.1% - 31.3%) mortality reduction. Many high income countries, that have had high vaccine uptake (most notably Canada, Chile, UK and USA), suffer increased infections and mortality under most of the sharing protocols investigated, assuming no other counter measures had been taken. However, if reductions in vaccine supply in these countries had been offset by prolonged use of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, we predict far greater reductions in global infection and mortality of 64.5% (PI 62.6% - 65.4%) and 62.8% (PI 44.0% - 76.3%), respectively. Interpretation: By itself, our results suggest that although more equitable vaccine distribution would have had limited impact on overall infection numbers, vaccine sharing would have substantially reduced global mortality by providing earlier protection of the most vulnerable. If increased vaccine sharing from high income nations had been combined with slower easing of non pharmaceutical interventions to compensate for this, a large reduction in both infection and mortality globally would be expected, confounded by a lower risk of new variants arising.","output":"The impacts of increased global vaccine sharing on the COVID-19 pandemic; a retrospective modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Covid\\\\19 pandemic is a significant global health threat.

This contactless method is a promising technology to continuously monitor the vital signs of patients in clinical environments. In this study, we investigated both skin temperature trend measurement and the extraction of respiration-related chest movements to determine the respiratory rate using low-cost hardware in combination with advanced algorithms. In addition, the frequency of medical examinations or visits to the patients was extracted. We implemented a deep learning-based algorithm for real-time vital sign extraction from thermography images. A clinical trial was conducted to record data from patients on an intensive care unit. The YOLOv4-Tiny object detector was applied to extract image regions containing vital signs (head and chest). The infrared frames were manually labeled for evaluation. Validation was performed on a hold-out test dataset of 6 patients and revealed good detector performance (0.75 intersection over union, 0.94 mean average precision). An optical flow algorithm was used to extract the respiratory rate from the chest region. The results show a mean absolute error of 2.69 bpm. We observed a computational performance of 47 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module for YOLOv4-Tiny, which proves real-time capability on an embedded GPU system. In conclusion, the proposed method can perform real-time vital sign extraction on a low-cost system-on-module and may thus be a useful method for future contactless vital sign measurements.","output":"A Deep Learning-Based Camera Approach for Vital Sign Monitoring Using Thermography Images for ICU Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antecedentes y objetivo: La pandemia actual por COVID-19 est generando un elevado nmero de pacientes, que necesitan ingreso hospitalario por neumona y que, tras su alta hospitalaria, precisan de un control evolutivo por persistencia de sintomatologa.

Background and Aim: The current COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in a high number of patients who need hospital admission for pneumonia and in many cases subsequent follow-up due to persistent symptoms. Since there is little existing evidence on the physiotherapy treatment approach, and there are restrictions to usual consultation, the aim is to check whether Physical Therapy Primary Care (PTPC) intervention through remote consultation is effective. Material and Methods: A 47-year-old male patient underwent a physiotherapy intervention through remote consultation (RC) over the phone 7 days after being discharged. On the one hand, dyspnoea was followed up by employing the modified Borg scale and modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC), where physical function is assessed through the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). On the other hand, the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) was assessed through the EuroQol-5D questionnaire, and vital signs (temperature, heart rate and oxygen pressure) were monitored for 28 days. The intervention consisted of an educational programme for health and exercise therapy. Results and Conclusions: The physiotherapy phone consultation programme allowed the treatment and follow up of this patient (physiological variables, SPPB and HRQL) which resulted in improvement. Therefore, we suggest future trials are worth undertaking to study in-depth interventions based on remote consultation directed at these patients after discharge.","output":"Eficacia del tratamiento fisioterpico en Atencin Primaria, mediante consulta no presencial, a un paciente dado de alta de neumona Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic, transmittable and invasive pneumococcal disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in December 2019 and January 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China and fast spread later on the middle of February 2020 in the Northern part of Italy and Europe.

The spread of fine droplets and particles can be understood, to leading order, by considering the movement of passive contaminants. A scaled (1:10) model of an isolation room (with water instead of air) was used to analyse the dilution of a passive contaminant (food dye), released either instantaneously or at a constant rate. The high level of turbulence, typical of isolation rooms, ensures that the dye concentration is uniform within the model room and mixing is perfect, and the measured mean concentration can be predicted theoretically. In a second series of experiments, the exchange generated by a door opening/closing is measured for different opening angles. A dipolar vortex is generated at the tip of the door which moves into the centre of the room, with a large coherent structure moving along the wall. The exchange volume is comparable to the swept volume of the door. Larger droplets and particles do not move passively. Their movement within a turbulent flow is studied by combining a Lagrangian model of particle movement with a kinematic simulation of a pseudo turbulent flow. The results show that while the mean fall velocity of particles is largely unchanged, turbulence significantly enhances horizontal and vertical dispersion. The horizontal spread as a function of the level of turbulence and droplet properties is estimated.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A total of 422 COVID-19-confirmed patients (via reverse transcriptionCPCR test) were enrolled in this study (male=271, female=150, 1 unreported). We have compiled medical records of the patients and descriptively reported their demographic, socioeconomic and clinical features, treatment history, health outcomes, and postdischarge complications. RESULT: Patients were predominantly male (64%), between 35 and 49 years (28%), with at least one comorbidity (52%), and had COVID-19 symptoms for 1 week before hospitalisation (66%). A significantly higher proportion (p<0.05) of male patients had diabetes, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease, while female patients had asthma (p<0.05).

This requires either visits to tertiary centres for phlebotomy and physician review or utilisation of primary care services. Objectives This study aims to validate remote capillary blood testing in an outpatient setting and analyse impact on clinical pathways. Methods A single-centre prospective cross-sectional validation and parallel observational study was performed. Remote finger prick capillary blood testing was validated compared to local standard venesection using comparative statistical analysis: paired t-test, correlation and Bland-Altman. Capillary was considered interchangeable with venous samples if all 3 criteria were met: non-significant paired t-test (i.e. p>0.05), Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) >0.8 and 95% of tests within 10% difference through Bland-Altman (Limits of agreement). In parallel, current clinical pathways including phlebotomy practice was analysed over 4 weeks to review test predictability. A subsequent pilot cohort study analysed potential impact of remote capillary blood sampling on shared decision making and outpatient clinical pathways. Results 117 paired capillary and venous blood samples were prospectively analysed. Interchangeability with venous blood was seen with HbA1c (%), total protein and CRP. Further tests, although not interchangeable, are likely useful to enable longitudinal remote monitoring (e.g. liver function, total IgE, and vitamin D). 65% of outpatient clinic blood tests were predictable with 16% of patients requiring further contact due to actions required. Pilot implementation of remote capillary sampling showed patient and clinician-reported improvement in shared decision-making given contemporaneous blood test results. Conclusions Remote capillary blood sampling can be used accurately for specific tests to monitor chronic disease, and when incorporated into an outpatient clinical pathway can improve shared decision making and patient experience.

A potential improvement from convalescent plasma could be the preparation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (hIVIG). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Convalescent plasma was collected from an existing network of plasma donation centers. A caprylate/chromatography purification process was used to manufacture hIVIG. Initial batches of hIVIG were manufactured in a versatile, small-scale facility designed and built to rapidly address emerging infectious diseases. RESULTS: Processing convalescent plasma into hIVIG resulted in a highly purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) product with more concentrated neutralizing antibody activity. hIVIG will allow for the administration of greater antibody activity per unit of volume with decreased potential for several adverse events associated with plasma administration. IgG concentration and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 were increased over 10-fold from convalescent plasma to the final product.

Furthermore, the VRD sensitivity for different Ct-value groups (Ct <20; Ct 20-25, Ct 25-30 and Ct > 30) and different intervals since symptom onset (< 7 days; > 7 days) were examined. Design: Prospective performance evaluation study. Setting: Municipal Health Service (GGD) COVID-19 test centres in West-Brabant, the Netherlands Participants: In order to evaluate clinical specificity, 352 symptomatic adults (> 18 years) who presented at a participating GGD test centre for a COVID- 19 test between September 28 and October 7 2020 were included. In order to evaluate clinical sensitivity, 123 symptomatic adults (> 18 years) who were tested positive with qRT-PCR in a participating GGD test centre between September 26 and October 6 were included. Results: An overall clinical specificity of 100% (95%CI : 98.9%-100%) and sensitivity of 80.7% (95% CI: 73,2%-86,9%) was found for the VRD compared to qRT-PCR. Sensitivity was the highest for low Ct-value categories and for specimen obtained within the first days after disease onset. For specimen obtained within 7 days after onset of symptoms, the overall sensitivity was 91.0% (95%: CI 82,4%-96,3%) and 98,6% (95%: CI 92,3%-100%) for samples with qRT-PCR Ct-value beneath 30. Conclusion: The VRD is a promising diagnostic test for COVID-19 community screening for symptomatic individuals within 7 days after symptom onset in function of disease control. The clinical sensitivity was highest when viral load was high, which correlated with the duration of symptoms.

We sought to characterise patients discharged following a COVID-19 hospitalisation within a large integrated health system in the United States. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 2180 COVID-19 patients discharged between 1 April 2020 and 31 July 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause observation stay or inpatient readmission within 30 days from discharge. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the association between key socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with risk of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: The 30-day readmission rate was 7.6% (n = 166); 30-day mortality rate was 1% (n = 19). Most readmissions were respiratory-related (58%) and occurred at a median time of 5 days post discharge. Adjusted models showed that prior hospitalisations (Odds Ratio = 2.36, [95% Confidence Interval: 1.59-3.50]), chronic pulmonary disease (1.57 [1.09-2.28]), and discharge to home health (1.46 [1.01-2.11]) were significantly associated with 30-day readmission. Longer duration from diagnosis to index admission was borderline associated with lower odds of readmission (0.95 [0.91-1.00]).

The Na and fluid retention, along with hypertension that ensued, although not severe, caused acute heart failure (sub-pulmonary edema) by worsening the mitral insufficiency. This occurred due to a less efficient calcific mitral annulus contraction during systole and an increasing mitral transvalvular gradient, as the transvalvular mitral gradient has an exponential relation to flow. After the suspension of the nephrotoxic drugs and starting intravenous furosemide, she rapidly improved. At 6 months follow-up, she is stable, in an NYHA 1-2 functional class, despite the only partial recovery of the renal function. CONCLUSION: Progressive renal failure can functionally worsen even minimal mitral valvulopathy. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity can always be suspected in case of renal failure of unknown etiology. The suspension of the culprit drugs can improve renal function and dramatically improve the clinical symptoms even in a nonagenarian.","output":"Cardiorenal Syndrome Triggered by Slowly Progressive Drugs Toxicity-Induced Renal Failure along with Minimal Mitral Disease: A Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in wastewater is being rapidly developed and adopted as a public health monitoring tool worldwide.

The ongoing pandemic constitutes a major health burden of world proportions that is also having a devastating impact on whole economies worldwide, the knock-on effects of which could be catastrophic especially in poorer countries. Alternative measures to ameliorate the impact and hamper or minimally slow down disease progression are urgently called for. This review discusses past and currently evolving data on the etiological agent of the current pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, and its host cell receptors with a view to disclosing alternative drugs for palliative or therapeutic approaches. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits marked tropism for cells that harbor the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at their plasmalemma, predominantly in cells lining the oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and bronchoalveolar cells, making these epithelial mucosae the most likely viral receptor cell targets and entry routes. Secondly, the crystal structures of several coronavirus spike proteins in complex with their cell host target receptors, and of SARS-Cov-2 in complex with an inhibitor, are now available at atomic resolution through X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy studies. Thirdly, viral entry of other viruses has been successfully blocked by inhibiting viral endogenous proteases or clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis, the same internalization pathway followed by ACE2 and some viruses. Fourthly, the target cell-surface receptor molecules and SARS-CoV-2 possess other putative sites for drugs potentially modulating receptor activity or virus processing. A multi-pronged pharmacological approach attacking more than one flank of the viral-receptor interactions is worth considering as a front-line strategy.","output":"While We Wait for a Vaccine Against SARS-CoV-2, Why Not Think About Available Drugs?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant harbors 37 amino acid substitutions in the spike (S) protein, 15 of which are in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), thereby raising concerns about the effectiveness of available vaccines and antibody therapeutics.

Severe reductions of plasma neutralizing activity were observed against Omicron compared to the ancestral pseudovirus for vaccinated and convalescent individuals. Most (26 out of 29) receptor-binding motif (RBM)-directed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) lost in vitro neutralizing activity against Omicron, with only three mAbs, including the ACE2-mimicking S2K146 mAb1, retaining unaltered potency. Furthermore, a fraction of broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus mAbs recognizing antigenic sites outside the RBM, including sotrovimab2, S2X2593 and S2H974, neutralized Omicron. The magnitude of Omicron-mediated immune evasion and the acquisition of binding to mouse ACE2 mark a major SARS-CoV-2 mutational shift.

The detection model was developed on a dataset of 1381 patients (181 COVID-19 patients plus 1200 non COVID control patients). A second, independent dataset of 197 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 500 control patients was used to assess the performance of the model. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model had an AUC of 0.882 (95% CI: 0.851C0.913) in the independent test dataset (641 patients). The optimal decision threshold, considering the cost of false negatives twice as high as the cost of false positives, resulted in an accuracy of 85.18%, a sensitivity of 69.52%, a specificity of 91.63%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.46% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 59.44%.

Knowledge of current diagnostic practices and the coverage of the national Salmonella surveillance system are important to correctly interpret surveillance data and trends over time, to estimate the true burden of salmonellosis in Belgium, and to evaluate the appropriateness of implementing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at this central level. METHODS: The coverage of the NRC was defined as the proportion of all diagnosed human Salmonella cases in Belgium reported to the NRC and was assessed for 2019 via a survey among all licensed Belgian medical laboratories in 2019, and for 2016C2020 via a capture-recapture study using the Sentinel Network of Laboratories (SNL) as the external source. In addition, the survey was used to assess the impact of the implementation of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) at the level of peripheral laboratory sites, as a potential threat to national public health surveillance programs. RESULTS: The coverage of the NRC surveillance system was estimated to be 83% and 85%, based on the results of the survey and on the two-source capture-recapture study, respectively. Further, the results of the survey indicated a limited use of CIDTs by peripheral laboratories in 2019. CONCLUSION: Given the high coverage and the limited impact of CIDTs on the referral of isolates, we may conclude that the NRC can confidently monitor the epidemiological situation and identify outbreaks throughout the country. These findings may guide the decision to implement WGS at the level of the NRC and may improve estimates of the true burden of salmonellosis in Belgium.","output":"Coverage of the national surveillance system for human Salmonella infections, Belgium, 2016-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary The inflammatory process aims at opposing an early responseto the viral infections.

Being worn closely attached to the people's face, they are continuously subjected to routine movements, i.e., facial expressions, breathing, and talking. These motional forces represent an unusual source of wasted mechanical energy that can be rather harvested by electromechanical transducers and exploited to power mask-integrated sensors. Typically, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are exploited to this aim; however, most of the current devices are too thick or wide, not really conformable, and affected by humidity, which make them hardly embeddable in a mask, in contact with skin. Different from recent attempts to fabricate smart energy-harvesting cloth masks, in this work, a wearable energy harvester is rather enclosed in the mask and can be reused and not disposed. The device is a metal-free hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerator (hPENG) based on soft biocompatible materials. In particular, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes in the pure form and with a biobased plasticizer (cardanol oil, CA) are electrospun onto a laser-ablated polyimide flexible substrate attached on a skin-conformable elastomeric blend of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoflex. The multilayer structure of the device harnesses the piezoelectricity of the PVDF nanofibers and the friction triboelectric effects. The ultrasensitive mechanoelectrical transduction properties of the composite device are determined by the strong electrostatic behavior of the membranes and the plasticization effect of cardanol. In addition, encapsulation based on PVDF, PDMS, CA, and parylene C is used, allowing the hPENG to exhibit optimal reliability and resistance against the wet and warm atmosphere around the face mask.

It has an incidence of up to 10%. Symptoms can include dyspnea (53%), cough (35%), fever (12%), and chest pain (7%). CASE: An 81-year-old male with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, intra-lesional hematoma, and portal vein thrombosis presented with one day of dyspnea. In the ED, he was found to be hypoxic to 80% on room air. The examination was unremarkable except for bilateral crackles on auscultation. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and arterial blood gas were within normal limits. CT chest revealed bilateral multifocal airspace opacities. Due to the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, he was transferred to the ICU for care. Blood cultures were sent. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin was initiated for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. The patient continued to worsen clinically. All initial infectious workup was negative including blood cultures, tuberculosis and fungal workup, and respiratory viral pathogen PCR. COVID-19 and influenza PCR was negative thrice. Of note, the patient completed his second cycle of immunotherapy with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab, four days prior to admission. He was started on methylprednisolone 2mg/kg/d on hospital day (HD) 5 for likely ICI-induced pneumonitis. Despite steroid therapy, no clinical improvement was noted. He was additionally given a single dose of infliximab 5mg/kg to which he improved clinically initially. However, he later grew Aspergillus in his bronchoalveolar lavage and passed away from multi-organ failure on HD 22. DISCUSSION: We describe a case of HCC with hematoma. Given the risk of bleeding with first-line therapy (Sorafenib), a combination of Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab was used instead. ICI-induced pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific clinical picture or radiologic findings. Anti-VEGF antibodies like Bevacizumab are more likely to cause pulmonary hemorrhage than pneumonitis. ICI-induced pneumonitis is divided into 4 grades. This patient was categorized as Grade 3. The patient received infliximab as he did not respond to initial therapy consisting of empirical antibiotics and IV methylprednisolone. In patients on ICI, who present with respiratory symptoms, clinicians should have a high degree of suspicion for pneumonitis.

Exclusion criteria: pregnancy, traumatic hernias, pre-existing ventral hernias, burns, and body mass index 40 kg/m2. The primary outcome was successful fascial closure by direct suture of the fascia without mesh or component separation. Secondary outcomes were abdominal wall complications. Results Thirty-eight patients were investigated, 20 in the device group and 18 in the control group. Primary closure of the fascia by direct suture without mesh or component separation was achieved in 17 patients (85%) in the device group and only 10 patients (55.6%) in the control group (p=0.0457).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During an outpatient follow-up visit, chest CT, pulmonary function and COVID-19 related symptoms were assessed approximately 10 weeks after diagnosis. Demographics, baseline (time of diagnosis) CT score and blood results were collected from patient files. Association between lung function and clinical characteristics (baseline), blood markers (baseline), chest CT (baseline and follow-up) and symptom score (followup) was analysed. Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi squared tests were used for statistical comparison between subgroups with and without restriction. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Two hundred-twenty subjects were evaluated at a median follow-up of 7412 (SD) days. Median symptom and median CT score at follow-up were 1(IQR=0- 2) and 2(IQR=0-6) respectively. Forty-six percent of patients had normal lung function, while TLC and TLCO below the lower limit of normal were observed in 38% and 22% of subjects respectively. This restrictive pulmonary impairment was associated with length of hospital stay (8 vs 6 days; p=0.003), admission to the intensive care unit (27% vs 13%;p=0.009), and invasive mechanical ventilation (10% vs 0.7%;p=0.001), but not with symptom score or CT score at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-four percent of COVID-19 survivors had abnormal lung function 10 weeks after diagnosis. Restriction was the most prevalent pulmonary function, with the more critically ill patients being more prone to this condition.

The analysis demonstrated a strong correlation (R2 > 0.7) between increment in air pollution and an increase in the risk of COVID-19 transmission within London boroughs. Particularly, strong correlations (R2 > 0.72) between the risk of COVID-19 fatality and nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter pollution concentrations were found. Although this study assumed the same level of air pollution across a particular London borough, it demonstrates the possibility to employ air pollution as an indicator to rapidly identify the city's vulnerable regions. Such an approach can inform the decisions to suspend or reduce the operation of different public transport modes within a city.

Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples. METHODS: A virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS (without enrichment) and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted. RESULTS: The VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also points to the risk of cross-contamination between samples. CONCLUSIONS: The VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector, or research question. The risk of cross-contamination needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user friendly, and even non-experts can easily use the VirBaits workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible as shown for SARS-CoV-2.

However, mobile phone technology can provide sophisticated solutions to cope with a pandemic environment. Thus, as a pilot study in this research, the author focused on Polish consumers mobile phone usage behaviour towards their online shopping buying behaviour before and during the Covid-19 pandemic time. An online field survey was conducted to collect primary data from the respondents during the month of April 2021, and the total number of participants was recorded as 102. In order to reach conclusions, mainly two types of statistical hypothesis tests were carried out. Hypothesis test 1 was conducted to determine whether the respondents were demonstrating a significant usage increase in the average number of online shopping transactions per month and during the Covid-19 pandemic time. Hypothesis test 2 was conducted to determine whether there was a difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month during the pandemic time of the respondents based on their age group. Descriptive and inferential statistics, including the matched-pairs test and one-way ANOVA, were applied to the analysis. The researcher is in a position confirm that there is a significant difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is no significant difference in the average number of online shopping transactions per month during the pandemic time made by representants of two generations, generation X and Millennials.

METHODS Observational study. 210 bags of fluid supplemented with KCl being administered to hospitalized dogs and cats intravenously (IV) were sampled over a 3-month period. Measured K+ concentration ([K+]) was compared to the intended [K+] of the bag. In a second experiment, 60 stock fluid bags were supplemented to achieve a concentration of 20 mmol/L K+, mixed well and [K+] was measured. In another 12 bags of 0.9% NaCl, K+ was added without mixing the bag, and [K+ ] of the delivered fluid was measured at regular time points during constant rate infusion. RESULTS The measured [K+] was significantly higher than intended [K+] (mean difference 9.0 mmol/L, range 6.5 to >280 mmol/L, P < .0001). In 28% of clinical samples measured [K+] was 5 mmol/L different than intended [K+]. With adequate mixing, K+ supplementation of fluids can be accurate with the mean difference between measured and intended [K+] of 0.7 (95% CI -0.32 to 1.7) mmol/L.

Labour is a key input in production, and thus a good proxy for the state of the economy. We find that changes in the restrictiveness of mandated social distancing, as measured by the Oxford Stringency Index, exert a strong impact on unemployment. The bulk of the reaction of unemployment to a change in the social distancing restrictions does not arise immediately, but with a delay of 2C4 weeks. In addition, the impact is asymmetric.

METHODS We analyzed online microarray expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for differentially expressed miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis-related disease liver tissues, examined the specific effects of the candidate miRNA on TGF--induced HSC activation, and screened for the targets of the candidate miRNA in the TGF-/SMAD signaling. Then, the predicted miRNA-mRNA binding, the specific effects of the target mRNA, and the dynamic effects of miRNA and mRNA on TGF--induced HSC activation were investigated. RESULTS The miR-503 expression was upregulated in TGF--activated HSCs. miR-503 overexpression enhanced, while miR-503 inhibition attenuated TGF--induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. miR-503 targeted SMAD7 to inhibit SMAD7 expression.

OSA can have a significant impact on physical and mental health and, when left untreated, is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular ill health. Besides cardiorespiratory implications excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, limited memory function and lack of concentration are some further symptoms caused by OSA. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy is the evidence-based treatment to maintain upper airway patency in patients with moderate to severe OSA. Proper adherence to CPAP therapy successfully abolishes nocturnal apnoeas and hypopnoeas, and diminishes consequences of uncontrolled OSA, such as treatment resistant hypertension. However, long term adherence to CPAP remains an unresolved limitation of this method. Although alternatives to CPAP therapy may be less efficacious, there is a variety of non-CPAP treatments that includes conventional lifestyle advice, postural advice, the use of mandibular advancement devices (MADs), surgical treatment options, such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tonsillectomy, or maxillomandibular advancement, and the use of electrical stimulation of the upper airway dilator muscles. Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation is available as an invasive (HNS) and a transcutaneous (TESLA) approach. For the management of difficult-to-treat patients with OSA, particularly in those in whom first line therapy proved to be unsuccessful, a multidisciplinary team approach may be helpful to incorporate the available options of non-CPAP therapy and provide appropriate choices. Symptom control, patient-related outcome measures and long-term cardiovascular health should be prioritised when choosing long-term therapies to treat OSA. The inclusion of patients in the choice of successful management options of their condition will facilitate better long-term adherence.

No effective antiviral drugs against it are commercially available. We recently reported that the culture supernatant of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, the porcine pleuropneumonia causative agent, has an antiviral activity in vitro against PRRSV in SJPL cells. Objectives of this study were (i) to identify the mechanism behind the antiviral activity displayed by A. pleuropneumoniae and (ii) to characterize the active molecules present in the bacterial culture supernatant. METHODS: Antibody microarray analysis was used in order to point out cellular pathways modulated by the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant. Subsequent, flow cytometry analysis and cell cycle inhibitors were used to confirm antibody microarray data and to link them to the antiviral activity of the A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant. Finally, A. pleuropneumoniae supernatant characterization was partially achieved using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Using antibody microarray, we observed modulations in G2/M-phase cell cycle regulation pathway when SJPL cells were treated with A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. These modulations were confirmed by a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase when cells were treated with the A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant. Furthermore, two G2/M-phase cell cycle inhibitors demonstrated the ability to inhibit PRRSV infection, indicating a potential key role for PRRSV infection.

TYMV encodes a precursor replication polyprotein that is processed by the endoproteolytic activity of its internal cysteine proteinase domain (PRO). We recently reported that PRO is actually a multifunctional enzyme with a specific ubiquitin hydrolase (DUB) activity that contributes to viral infectivity. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 150-residue PRO. Strikingly, PRO displays no homology to other processing proteinases from positive-stranded RNA viruses, including that of alphaviruses. Instead, the closest structural homologs of PRO are DUBs from the Ovarian tumor (OTU) family. In the crystal, one molecule's C-terminus inserts into the catalytic cleft of the next, providing a view of the N-terminal product complex in replication polyprotein processing. This allows us to locate the specificity determinants of PRO for its proteinase substrates. In addition to the catalytic cleft, at the exit of which the active site is unusually pared down and solvent-exposed, a key element in molecular recognition by PRO is a lobe N-terminal to the catalytic domain. Docking models and the activities of PRO and PRO mutants in a deubiquitylating assay suggest that this N-terminal lobe is also likely involved in PRO's DUB function.

This is achieved by the use of multiple specificity determinants, as recognition of substrate patches distant from the cleavage sites allows a relaxed specificity of PRO at the sites themselves.

We investigated if such discharges provide a pathway for environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Samples of wastewater, surface water, and sediment collected close to six CSOs on the River Thames were assayed over 8 months for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectious virus. Bivalves were sampled as sentinel species of viral bioaccumulation. Sediment and water samples from the Danube and Sava rivers in Serbia, where raw sewage is also discharged in high volumes, were assayed as a positive control. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or infectious virus in UK samples, in contrast to RNA positive water and sediment samples from Serbia. Furthermore, we show that infectious SARS-CoV-2 inoculum is stable in Thames water and sediment for < 3 days, while RNA remained detectable for at least seven days. This indicates that dilution of wastewater likely limits environmental transmission, and that infectivity should be embedded in future risk assessments of pathogen spillover.","output":"No evidence for environmental transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK's largest urban river system: London as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A selective approach for multiple wastewater recovery is nowadays desirable and technologically feasible, to provide water at specific quality standards for each reuse objective. This fit-for-purpose approach to water reuse could both save water and would reduce production cost and energy demand by eliminating unnecessary treatment and long-range conveyance, as it typically aims at local reuses. The appropriate choice of technologies for such approaches is perhaps the most critical planning and design decision when evaluating systems for implementation or refurbishing. This article examines wastewater reuse goals (direct potable use, indirect potable use, non-potable uses and industrial uses) and related requirements as relevant case studies, and issues that may arise during implementation. It then proposes an overview of current conventional and advanced technologies and their possible combination to meet foreseen uses under a multiple barrier treatment (MBT) approach, which implies a sequence of complementary processes at an increasing level of protection for both conventional and emerging pollutants according to reuse goals.

METHODS: In 2018, a team of internal oncologists, gynecological oncologists, radio-oncologists, nutritionists, psycho-oncologists, and study nurses met several times to define the content of counseling. To inform the team, an intensive literature review was conducted. RESULTS: Counseling content was determined for complementary treatment options for the most frequent side effects of oncological therapies. Counseling sessions were formulated as frontal lectures (slide presentations), given at regular intervals for patients and relatives. These lectures were highly appreciated by patients.

Targeting the main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is an appealing approach for drug development because this enzyme plays a significant role in the viral replication and transcription. The available crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro determined in the presence of different ligands and inhibitor-like compounds provide a platform for the quick development of selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In this study, we utilized the structural information of co-crystallized SARS-CoV-2 Mpro for the structure-guided drug discovery of high-affinity inhibitors from the PubChem database. The screened compounds were selected on the basis of their physicochemical properties, drug-likeliness, and strength of affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Finally, we have identified 6-Deaminosinefungin (PubChem ID: 10428963) and UNII-O9H5KY11SV (PubChem ID: 71481120) as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro which may be further exploited in drug development to address SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Both compounds are structural analogs of known antivirals, having considerable protease inhibitory potential with improved pharmacological properties. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations suggested SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with these compounds is stable during the simulation period with minimal structural changes.

Significant progress has been made in light-field depth estimation. Nevertheless, the balance between computational time and the accuracy of depth estimation is still worth exploring. The geometry in light field imaging is the basis of depth estimation, and the abundant light-field data provides convenience for applying deep learning algorithms. The Epipolar Plane Image (EPI) generated from the light-field data has a line texture containing geometric information. The slope of the line is proportional to the depth of the corresponding object. Considering the light field depth estimation as a spatial density prediction task, we design a convolutional neural network (ESTNet) to estimate the accurate depth quickly. Inspired by the strong image feature extraction ability of convolutional neural networks, especially for texture images, we propose to generate EPI synthetic images from light field data as the input of ESTNet to improve the effect of feature extraction and depth estimation. The architecture of ESTNet is characterized by three input streams, encoding-decoding structure, and skipconnections. The three input streams receive horizontal EPI synthetic image (EPIh), vertical EPI synthetic image (EPIv), and central view image (CV), respectively. EPIh and EPIv contain rich texture and depth cues, while CV provides pixel position association information. ESTNet consists of two stages: encoding and decoding. The encoding stage includes several convolution modules, and correspondingly, the decoding stage embodies some transposed convolution modules. In addition to the forward propagation of the network ESTNet, some skip-connections are added between the convolution module and the corresponding transposed convolution module to fuse the shallow local and deep semantic features. ESTNet is trained on one part of a synthetic light-field dataset and then tested on another part of the synthetic light-field dataset and real light-field dataset. Ablation experiments show that our ESTNet structure is reasonable. Experiments on the synthetic light-field dataset and real light-field dataset show that our ESTNet can balance the accuracy of depth estimation and computational time.","output":"Depth Estimation from Light Field Geometry Using Convolutional Neural Networks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 71-year-old Pakistani man with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus presenting with worsening mental status, abdominal pain, and oral intake for the past seven days was found to have pyogenic hepatic abscess with unculturable bacteria and subsequently found to have rare Brevibacterium bacteremia.","output":"Brevibacterium Bacteremia in the Setting of Pyogenic Liver Abscess: A Case Report with Accompanying Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, labor force is greatly confined by quarantine (social distancing), and limited units of labor and capital are available at the workplace.

Historically, this has been face-to-face with logistical difficulties, high cost, low trainee uptake and challenging in recruiting examiners. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to virtual consultations and examinations, the team implemented an innovative virtual Skills test. The main aims were to improve the test's quality and the trainee uptake, adapt the test delivery to a Health Education England (HEE) online platform, and establish cost-effectiveness in the post-COVID world. METHOD: A working group was formed to develop the Skills test, and in May 2019, the test was delivered face-to-face, implementing 5 cycles of 8 stations over 3 days. The same group adapted the test for online delivery, and in August 2020, 3 cycles of 8 stations were delivered. Feedback was collected, with adaptations made for a second Skills Test in December 2020. RESULT: 96.4% of trainees rated their overall experience and the test organisation in the 2019 test as excellent or good (82.1% and 85.7 excellent, respectively). 93.5% of examiners rated their overall experience and the test organisation as excellent or good (45.1% excellent for both). In the August test, 95.8% of trainees rated their overall experience as excellent or good (58.3% excellent). 100% of trainees rated the test organisation and the online format as excellent or good (70.8% and 50% excellent, respectively). Although 100% of examiners rated the overall experience, the test organisation and online format as excellent or good, some felt the stations were not long enough to allow for technical issues. In the December test, higher proportions of trainees rated the overall experience (80%), organisation of the test (80%) and online format (70%) as excellent. CONCLUSION: The virtual test is shown to be a viable and successful alternative to the face-to-face test in preparing trainees for their CASC, and trainees felt it was excellent preparation for the new online CASC format.

Some educational institutions introduced new strategies to reduce the psychosocial burden associated with online learning during home confinement. Thus, The primary aims were to determine the consequences of COVID-19 for the psychological well-being and fatigue levels of higher education students and to explore the effects of a new academic assessment approach in reducing home confinement stress. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among students of 7 disciplines in all 16 higher colleges of technology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Mental Well-being and Learning Behaviours Scale and the modified Copenhagen Burnout Inventory were used to evaluate students psychological well-being and fatigue levels. A t-test and ANOVA were performed to determine the differences in perceived psychological well-being and fatigue associated with students characteristics. Second, multiple linear regression models performed to identify the independent predictors of fatigue level. Results: One thousand four hundred students participated. The majority were female (78.5%) and aged from 21-25 years (58.1%). Around 14% of respondents were married with children. Nearly 40% were satisfied with the new assessment approach introduced during the COVID pandemic and 45.5% perceived it as having reduced their home confinement stress. The mean psychological distress score of 3.00 (SD  0.71) indicates a moderate impact of COVID-19 on psychological well-being. Students psychological distress was positively correlated with fatigue level (0.256, p <0.001) and negatively correlated with the perceived impact of the new assessment approach on student lifestyle (-0.133), physical health (-0.149) and coping with stress (-0.125). Male students experienced significantly lower fatigue and better psychological well-being than female students. Conclusion: The study reveals that new assessment approaches which emerged during home confinement reduced students perception of stress and of impaired lifestyle. However, students still had a considerable burden of psychological distress, requiring further preventive measures to maintain their psychological well-being during future outbreak events. Educational institutions should consider additional strategies to improve students preparedness for online teaching, which could help maintain their psychological well-being.","output":"Mental Health, Learning Behaviour and Perceived Fatigue Among University Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak: a Cross-sectional Multicentric Study in the UAE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This special issue focuses on instances of Other Initiated Repair (OIR) during the conversations and communicative interactions of individuals with communication impairments.

The current study examined how older adults' resilience and optimism affected mental and emotional well-being in the midst of pandemic crisis. Methods The study used data sampled from two waves of the Eurofound COVID-19 survey collected from 27 European countries in April, during the first lockdown, and July 2020 when restrictions and measures were mildly lifted-up. The first round sample included 11,211 older adults (Mean age = 69.71  5.15, 70% females, 86% retired) and second round sample included 4,424 (Mean age = 69.93  4.47, 61% females). Analysis focused on resilience, optimism, WHO Well-being Index, psychological distress, and subjective well-being (self-rated health, life satisfaction, happiness). Covariates included socio-demographic information and financial and health care situations since pandemic crisis. Results Mental health, subjective well-being, and psychological distress in older adults tended to change over time, while resilience and optimism were relatively stable. Regression analysis indicated that older adults who scored higher for resilience and optimism reported greater life satisfaction and happiness, better health perception, higher levels of mental health, and lower psychological distress when controlled for socio-demographic variables and adversities related to pandemic outbreak. Conclusions Resilience and optimism might have a potential to help older adults cope with exposure to stressful life events and later life adversity, but inconclusive.

METHODS: The data of all confirmed malaria cases reported in Sri Lanka from 2017 to 2019 were extracted from the national malaria database. These included detailed histories, the time to malaria diagnosis, platelet counts, and in 2019, the trail of diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: Over the 3 years, 158 malaria cases (157 imported and one introduced) were reported. Platelet counts were available in 90.5% (n = 143) of patients among whom 86% (n = 123) showed a thrombocytopenia (<150,000 cells/l) and in nearly a third (n = 52) a severe thrombocytopenia (<50,000 cells/l). Only 30% of patients (n = 48) were diagnosed with malaria within 3 days of the onset of symptoms, while in 37% (n = 58) it took 7 or more days. Platelet counts where significantly higher in patients who had symptoms for 7 days or more compared to those who had symptoms for <7 days ((2) = 6.888, P = 0.009).

This new understanding of the role of ISGs may, in turn, help the recent advancement of novel therapeutics aiming to augment innate signaling pathways in an attempt to control viral infection and pathogenesis.","output":"Interferon-Stimulated Genes as Enhancers of Antiviral Innate Immune Signaling."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Predicting the COVID-19 outbreak has been studied by many researchers in recent years.

This research examined feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of delivering a 6-week yoga-based meditation intervention to clinical teams of hospice professionals (HPs) at a large non-profit hospice organization. The intervention was designed to increase mind-body integration and combat burnout. The manuscript was written for different audiences including research scientists who study interoception, burnout, meditation, or yoga, designers of meditation interventions, and hospice organizations looking for ways to mitigate HP burnout. 2) Methods. The intervention was launched within clinical teams, beginning with a half hour online introduction to the program and exposure to the week 1 meditation at each teams monthly all-staff meeting. Throughout the program, HPs could access the meditations on their own via their workplace computers, tablets, and smartphones. Online pre- and post-intervention surveys with 151 HPs assessed burnout using the Professional Fulfillment Index and mind-body integration using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness sub-scales. 3) Results. Half of HPs expressed a desire to continue to have access to the meditations after the 6-week program ended. Due to covid-19 work from home restrictions, three-fourth of HPs did a meditation at home, 29% in a car between patient visits (not while driving), and 23% at the office. Higher interoceptive awareness was significantly related to lower burnout, particularly lower work exhaustion. Meditation frequency was significantly related to higher interoceptive awareness but not to burnout. 4) Conclusions. Findings showed that yoga-based meditation intervention was feasible and acceptable and associated with higher interoceptive awareness. The results point to a role for interoceptive awareness in reducing the risk for burnout.","output":"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Outcomes of a Yoga-Based Meditation Intervention for Hospice Professionals to Combat Burnout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigated plasma and brain disposition of quetiapine lipid core nanocapsules (QLNC) in na?ve and schizophrenic (SCZ-like) rats and developed a semi-mechanistic model to describe changes in both compartments following administration of drug in solution (FQ) or nanoencapsulated.

Methods: Essential workers were selected from a seroprevalence survey cohort in Geneva, Switzerland and were linked to a state centralized registry compiling SARS-CoV-2 infections. Primary outcome was the number of virologically-confirmed infections from serological assessment (between May and September 2020) to January 25, 2021, according to baseline antibody status and stratified by three pre-defined occupational groups (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity, involving brief regular contact or others). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of infection. Results: 10457 essential workers were included (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity accounted for 3057 individuals, those involving regular brief contact, 3645, and 3755 workers were classified under ''Other essential occupations''). After a follow-up period of over 27 weeks, 5 (0.6%) seropositive and 830 (8.5%) seronegative individuals had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with an incidence rate of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.9 to 3.4) cases per person-week, respectively.

In 2016, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced broadband Internet as a basic service available for all Canadians. However, approximately one million Canadians still do not have access to broadband services as of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the situation more challenging, as social, economic, and educational activities have increasingly been transferred online. The condition is more unfavorable for Indigenous communities. A key challenge in deploying rural and remote broadband Internet is to plan and implement high-capacity backbones, which are now available only in denser urban areas.

As TMEM16F plays an important role in the stimulation of the pro-coagulant activity of platelets, and considering that platelet abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, we investigated whether Spike directly affects platelet activation and pro-thrombotic function and tested the effect of Niclosamide and Clofazimine on these processes. Methods We produced SARS-CoV-2 Spike or VSV-G protein-pseudotyped virions, or generated cells expressing Spike on their plasma membrane, and tested their effects on platelet adhesion (fluorescence), aggregation (absorbance), exposure of phosphatidylserine (flow cytometry for annexin V binding), calcium flux (flow cytometry for fluo-4 AM), and clot formation and retraction. These experiments were also conducted in the presence of the TMEM16F activity inhibitors Niclosamide and Clofazimine. Results Here we show that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes platelet activation, adhesion and spreading, both when present on the envelope of virions or upon expression on the plasma membrane of cells. Spike was effective both as a sole agonist or by enhancing the effect of known platelet activators, such as collagen and collagen-related peptide. In particular, Spike exerted a noticeable effect on the procoagulant phenotype of platelets, by enhancing calcium flux, phosphatidylserine externalisation, and thrombin generation. Eventually, this resulted in a striking increase in thrombin-induced clot formation and retraction. Both Niclosamide and Clofazimine almost abolished this Spike-induced pro-coagulant response. Conclusions Together, these findings provide a pathogenic mechanism to explain thrombosis associated to COVID-19 lung disease, by which Spike present in SARS-CoV-2 virions or exposed on the surface of infected cells, leads to local platelet stimulation and subsequent activation of the coagulation cascade. As platelet TMEM16F is central in this process, these findings reinforce the rationale of repurposing drugs targeting this protein, such as Niclosamide, for COVID-19 therapy.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein activates TMEM16F-mediated platelet pro-coagulant activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the spring of 2020, remote learning was implemented in schools throughout the world due to the pandemic of SARS CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19.

In response to a need for online experimentation, bioinformatics lessons centered around SARS-CoV-2 were developed. This article presents a multipart bioinformatics lesson that allows students to (1) compare spike protein sequences from the database portal NCBI Virus, to investigate whether this protein would be a good target for a vaccine against COVID-19;and (2) create phylogenetic trees and demonstrate evolutionary relatedness of human coronaviruses.

Availability of critical care beds has become a hot topic, and in many countries, we have seen a huge increase in the provision of temporary intensive care bed capacity. However, there is a limit where the hospitals may run out of resources to provide critical care, which is heavily dependent on trained staff, just-in-time supply chains for clinical consumables and drugs and advanced equipment. In the first (good) phase, we can still do clinical prioritisation and decision-making as usual, based on the need for intensive care and prognostication: what are the odds for a good result with regard to survival and quality of life. In the next (bad phase), the resources are mostly available, but the system is stressed by many patients arriving over a short time period and auxiliary beds in different places in the hospital being used. We may have to abandon admittance of patients with doubtful prognosis. In the last (ugly) phase, usual medical triage and priority setting may not be sufficient to decrease inflow and there may not be enough intensive care unit beds available. In this phase different criteria must be applied using a utilitarian approach for triage. We argue that this is an important transition where society, and not physicians, must provide guidance to support triage that is no longer based on medical priorities alone.","output":"The good, the bad and the ugly: pandemic priority decisions and triage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that causes significant changes in brain connectivity and visual impairment. Degree centrality (DC), a graph-based assessment of network organization was performed to explore the connectivity changes in NMOSD patients and their correlation with clinical consequences. METHODS: Twenty-two NMOSD patients and 22 healthy controls (HC) were included. Participants underwent visual acuity examination and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain. We first performed DC analysis to identify voxels that showed changes in whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) with other voxels. DC was calculated by the fMRI graph method and comparison between the two groups was done by two-sample t-test. GraphPad Prism was used to assess the association between DC changes and clinical consequences. RESULTS: Out of the 22 NMOSD patients, 7 (31.82%) had ON once while 15 (68.18%) had ON twice or more. Decreased DC value (P < 0.001) in the left frontal superior orbital gyrus (ORBsup), left angular gyrus (ANG) and right parietal superior gyrus (SPG) was found in NMOSD patients when compared with healthy controls respectively. Reduced visual acuity significantly correlated (R2 = 0.212, P = 0.040) with DC values in SPG while the frequency of ON significantly correlated (R2 = 0.04, P = 0.040) with DC values in the ANG in NMOSD patients.

RNA interference has emerged as a powerful tool to gain insight into gene function. For this purpose, lentiviral vectors that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into mammalian cells represent a powerful tool to achieve stable gene silencing. In order to interfere with DC-SIGN function, we developed shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors capable of conditionally suppressing DC-SIGN expression. Selectivity of inhibition of human DC-SIGN and L-SIGN and chimpanzee and rhesus macaque DC-SIGN was obtained by using distinct siRNAs. Suppression of DC-SIGN expression inhibited the attachment of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 to DC-SIGN transfectants, as well as transfer of HIV-1 to target cells in trans. Furthermore, shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors were capable of efficiently suppressing DC-SIGN expression in primary human DCs. DC-SIGN-negative DCs were unable to enhance transfer of HIV-1 infectivity to T cells in trans, demonstrating an essential role for the DC-SIGN receptor in transferring infectious viral particles from DCs to T cells. The present system should have broad applications for studying the function of DC-SIGN in the pathogenesis of HIV as well as other pathogens also recognized by this receptor.","output":"Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference of DC-SIGN expression inhibits human immunodeficiency virus transmission from dendritic cells to T cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Risk factors for acute ischemic stroke following flow-diverter treatment of intracranial aneurysms are poorly understood. Using the International Retrospective Study of Pipeline Embolization Device (IntrePED) registry, we studied demographic, aneurysm, and procedural characteristics associated with postoperative acute ischemic stroke following Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified patients in the IntrePED registry with post-PED-treatment acute ischemic stroke. The rate of postoperative acute ischemic stroke was determined by demographics, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, and procedure characteristics (including anticoagulation use, platelet testing, number of devices used, sheaths, and so forth). Categoric variables were compared with (2) testing, and continuous variables were compared with the Student t test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained by using univariate logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine which factors were independently associated with postoperative stroke. RESULTS Of 793 patients with 906 aneurysms, 36 (4.5%) patients had acute ischemic stroke. Twenty-six (72.2%) strokes occurred within 30 days of treatment (median, 3.5 days; range, 0-397 days). Ten patients died, and the remaining 26 had major neurologic morbidity. Variables associated with higher odds of acute ischemic stroke on univariate analysis included male sex, hypertension, treatment of MCA aneurysms, treatment of fusiform aneurysms, treatment of giant aneurysms, and use of multiple PEDs. However, on multivariate analysis, the only one of these variables independently associated with stroke was treatment of fusiform aneurysms (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.11-6.75; P = .03). Fusiform aneurysms that were associated with stroke were significantly larger than those not associated with stroke (mean, 24.5  12.5 mm versus 13.6  6.8 mm; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Ischemic stroke following PED treatment is an uncommon-but-devastating complication.

Although many immunomodulatory and antiviral drug therapies have been tested, the only effective therapy against severe COVID-19 pneumonia among the general population is a regimen of high-dose corticosteroids for cases of severe associated inflammation. In solid-organ transplant recipients with long-term immunosuppression, data on disease presentation and evolution are scarce, and the benefit of high-dose corticosteroids remains uncertain for cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we report 2 cases of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome that occurred in lung transplant recipients in March and April 2020, respectively. Both cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred in patients with long-term azithromycin treatment prescribed to prevent chronic allograft dysfunction. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with severe inflammation and was cured after early administration of high-dose corticosteroids in both cases, with progressive and complete resolution of lung lesions evidenced on thoracic computed tomography scan.

Activation of these cells results in the production of various mediators responsible for inflammation and RA pathogenesis. On the other hand, the depletion of macrophages using specific antibodies or chemical agents can prevent their synovial tissue infiltration and subsequently attenuates inflammation. Their plasticity is a major feature that helps the switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) to an anti-inflammatory state (M2). Therefore, understanding the precise strategy targeting pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages should be a powerful way of inhibiting chronic inflammation and bone erosion. In this review, we demonstrate potential consequences of different epigenetic regulations on inflammatory cytokines production by monocytes. In addition, we present unique profiles of monocytes/macrophages contributing to identification of new biomarkers of disease activity or predicting treatment response in RA. We also outline novel approaches of tuning monocytes/macrophages by biologic drugs, small molecules or by other therapeutic modalities to reduce arthritis. Finally, the importance of cellular heterogeneity of monocytes/macrophages is highlighted by single-cell technologies, which leads to the design of cell-specific therapeutic protocols for personalized medicine in RA in the future.","output":"Tuning Monocytes and Macrophages for Personalized Therapy and Diagnostic Challenge in Rheumatoid Arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: This paper details the impact of COVID-19 on foot and ankle activity in the UK.

PATIENTS & METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, UK-based, national audit on foot and ankle patients who underwent surgery between 13th January and 31st July 2020. Data was examined pre- UK national lockdown, during lockdown (23rd March to 11th May 2020) and post-lockdown. All adult patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in an operating theatre during the study period included from 43 participating centres in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Regional, demographic and COVID-19 related data were captured. RESULTS: 6644 patients were included. In total 0.53% of operated patients contracted COVID-19 (n = 35). The rate of COVID-19 infection was highest during lockdown (2.11%, n = 16) and lowest after lockdown (0.16%, n = 3). Overall mean activity during lockdown was 24.44% of pre-lockdown activity with decreases in trauma, diabetic and elective foot and ankle surgery; the change in elective surgery was most marked with only 1.73% activity during lock down and 10.72% activity post lockdown as compared to pre-lockdown. There was marked regional variation in numbers of cases performed, but the proportion of decrease in cases during and after lockdown was comparable between all regions. There was also a significant difference between rates of COVID-19 and timing of peak, cumulative COVID-19 infections between regions with the highest rate noted in South East England (3.21%). The overall national peak infection rate was 1.37%, occurring during the final week of lockdown. General anaesthetic remained the most common method of anaesthesia for foot and ankle surgery, although a significant increase in regional anaesthesia was witnessed in the lock-down and post-lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: National surgical activity reduced significantly for all cases across the country during lockdown with only a slow subsequent increase in elective activity.

As front-line health care workers, this crisis significantly affected emergency medicine residents and their respective programs. We sought to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the education and training of emergency medicine residents across the United States and Puerto Rico. Methods: A survey was sent out to Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited United States and Puerto Rico emergency medicine residency programs (264 programs at the time) via email correspondence to the Program Directors and the Program Coordinators. The survey stratified program type (practice setting, length of training, institution type, moonlighting allowed) and impact of COVID-19 on residents (off-service rotations, weekly conferences, effect on research, and resident wellness initiatives). Comparison was made by United States and Puerto Rico regions divided by Northeast, South, Midwest, and West, as these closely correlated with the differences in areas of COVID-19 spread and saturation. REDCap was used as the platform for data capture. Results: A total of 134 emergency medicine residency programs completed the survey. Northeast (44%), South (26%), Midwest (17%) and West (13%) programs by regions were reviewed. Overall, the majority of programs were in an urban setting (70%), and academic practice comprised 58%, followed by community at 40% (p=NS). The curriculum was a 3-year format for 71% of the programs (p=0.002). Overall half of the programs stated their institution was declared a site of pandemic emergency status by the ACGME, with 70% in Northeast and 39% of the Midwest, followed by the West and South regions (p=0.011). The impact of COVID-19 on off-service rotations for the emergency medicine residencies was not significant;Northeast had a high impact in 34% of the programs, moderate impact for Midwest (35%) and minimal impact in the South (34%) and West (29%) programs. Weekly lectures were switched to virtual format and smaller groups. Of note, clinical research for prospective studies was negatively impacted throughout all the regions (p=0.034), however retrospective studies were not affected. Additionally, 88% of programs reported changes since the start of COVID-19 to assure residents with new initiatives and activities such as improving wellness and reducing burnout and stress. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the training of emergency medicine residents in various aspects. Northeast programs were more affected compared to the other regions. Weekly didactic sessions largely transitioned to a virtual format and/or small group sessions. Off-service rotations overall were not significantly affected.

The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate characteristics of clinical and serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of young patients with IBD receiving biologics. Methods: Starting May 2020 we obtained serum on patients with IBD at the time of infusion with either infliximab or vedolizumab, along with baseline demographic and clinical data, as well possible SARSCoV2 exposure history (patient, family member). To measure antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, we used a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay that takes advantage of the high dynamic range of fluorescent molecules using flow cytometry. We immobilized biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (S-RBD) or Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (N) to detect specific IgG antibodies to the virus in patient serum. Spike protein-RBD-specific antibodies were detectable in serial dilutions up to 100,000-fold of serum samples. Titration curves from COVID-19 convalescent and healthy controls were used to normalize the area under the curve (AUC) values to quantitate the antibody levels. Antibody isotypes were measured using anti-Ig (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgG1-4) specific secondary antibodies conjugated to a fluorescent tag. We used a sensitive and high throughput SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay using a lentivirus that expresses Spike protein to assess specific inhibition of viral entry.

Results: 410 subjects were studied (mean age 17 years, 59% male, 305 (74%) Crohn's disease, 105 (25%) ulcerative colitis/IBD-U, 341 (83%) on infliximab, 69 (17%) vedolizumab, 13% concomitant methotrexate. 27/410 (6.6%) were positive for S-RBD and Nucleocapsid specific IgG. AUC values varied from 3150 to 285724 (Fig 1). S-RBD specific IgA+ 4/27 (15%) and IgG1+ 20/27 (74%) were found. Other isotypes undetectable. Patients' serum efficiently neutralized the virus at up to 10,000-fold serial dilution in only 10/27 (37%). (Fig 2). No differences in age, gender, diagnosis, or specific therapies were noted for (+) vs (-) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody status. 13/27 (48%) patients were asymptomatic. Non-exclusive symptoms were rhinorrhea 9 (33%), headache 8 (30%), sore throat 4 (15%). cough 4 (15%), diarrhea 4 (15%), chills 3 (11%), loss of smell/taste 2 (7%), fever 1 (4%). No patient was hospitalized. 4 (15%) had a family member with PCR+ COVID-19. Conclusions: We found a significant prevalence of anti SARS-CoV-2 antibody in our IBD population with the majority of + patients having non-neutralizing antibody. The role of biologics in mitigating clinical and serologic response to SARS-CoV-2 requires exploration.","output":"731 FAILURE TO DEVELOP NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES FOLLOWING SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN YOUNG PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE RECEIVING BIOLOGICS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), cause significant mortality and morbidity worldwide These viruses have been identified as important causative agents of acute respiratory disease in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals Clinical signs of infection range from mild upper respiratory illness to more serious lower respiratory illness, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia Additionally, these illnesses can have long-lasting impact on patient health well beyond resolution of the viral infection Aside from influenza, there are currently no licensed vaccines against these viruses However, several research groups have tested various vaccine candidates, including those that utilize attenuated virus, virus-like particles (VLPs), protein subunits, and nanoparticles, as well as recent RNA vaccines, with several of these approaches showing promise Historically, vaccine candidates have advanced, dependent upon the ability to activate the humoral immune response, specifically leading to strong B cell responses and neutralizing antibody production More recently, it has been recognized that the cellular immune response is also critical in proper resolution of viral infection and protection against detrimental immunopathology associated with severe disease and therefore, must also be considered when analyzing the efficacy and safety of vaccine candidates These candidates would ideally result in robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses as well as high-affinity neutralizing antibody This review will aim to summarize established and new approaches that are being examined to harness the cellular immune response during respiratory viral vaccination","output":"Harnessing Cellular Immunity for Vaccination against Respiratory Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are the only great apes that inhabit hot, dry, and open savannas.

RESULTS: Black race, increased age, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, obesity, and congestive heart failure were independently associated with a decreased rate of surgery for obstructive sleep apnea. Asian race, hypertension, arrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, and liver disease were independently associated with an increased rate of surgery for obstructive sleep apnea. CONCLUSION: Racial disparities in health outcomes related to health care access and in economic resources have an enormous impact on public health and social equity. We found differences in rates of surgery for obstructive sleep apnea based on race.

This report evaluates the psychometric properties of a brief self- and clinician-rated measure of factors related to the risk of suicide attempt or completion. METHOD Adult outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 240) were enrolled from July 2007 through February 2008 and treated in an 8-week, open-label trial with the clinician's choice of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor at 6 primary care and 9 psychiatric clinical care settings in the National Institute of Mental Health-funded Depression Trials Network. Diagnosis of MDD was determined by the Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire and an MDD checklist based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Suicidal ideation and behavior are 1 of 9 symptoms of MDD (depressed mood, loss of interest, appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, reduced concentration or indecisiveness, fatigue or decreased energy, psychomotor agitation or retardation, feelings of worthlessness, or excessive guilt). The newly developed Concise Health Risk Tracking (CHRT) scale was administered both as the CHRT Self-Report (CHRT-SR) and Clinician Rating (CHRT-C) scales. Psychometric evaluations were conducted on both scales. RESULTS The internal consistency (Cronbach ) was .77 for the 7-item CHRT-C and .78 for the 7-item CHRT-SR with a consistent factor structure, and 3 independent factors (current suicidal thoughts and plans, perceived lack of social support, and hopelessness) for both versions. CONCLUSIONS The 7-item CHRT-C and the 7-item CHRT-SR have excellent psychometric properties and can be used to monitor suicidal risk in clinical practice and research settings. Whether either scale will predict suicide attempts or completions in actual practice would require a very large prospective study sample.

This essay is an effort to disentangle this realitys consequencesboth in and outside the labas framed by the quandaries of ethnographic engagement. Encounters with lab staff and, in turn, with audiences unfamiliar with laboratory life, together provide crucial entry points for considering how the messiness of the moral might facilitate an unbounded approach to lab animal worlds. Within the lab, one encounters specialized ethical principlesoften codified as lawthat delimit strict boundaries of in/appropriate human thought and action. Such principles determine quotidian practices of welfare and care that, in peculiar ways, privilege animal health (as key to reliable data) while obscuring, erasing, or denying human forms of self care. As such, they presuppose a regulatory ability to formulate, shape, and (re)direct human action. Yet attentiveness to the messiness of the moral of lab work exposes other realities: indeed, lab personnel regularly engage in a host of subversive responses that test or cross the boundaries of mandated behavior that (re)invigorate the meaning of moral acts of care as interspecies responsibility. The ethnographers ability to witness, record, and write about these actions within the lab rests comfortably on the relativist principle of suspended judgment. Once one moves outside the lab, however, I ask, wherein lies ethnographic responsibility, when one's accounts of the moral messiness of quotidian lab practices become unbounded and go public? I argue that a dialectical inter- and intraspecies frameworkinspired by the existential anthropologist Michael Jacksonoffers the ethnographer (and still other scholars) possibilities for forging a productively unbounded methodological analytic in and beyond domains of animal science.","output":"Animal research unbound: The messiness of the moral and the ethnographers dilemma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the course of the corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic, many digital solutions for mobile devices (e.g., apps) were presented in order to provide additional resources supporting the control of the pandemic.

However, as a prerequisite for an effective application, such apps highly depend on being used by large numbers of the population. Consequently, it is important that these apps offer a high usability for everyone. We therefore conducted an exploratory study to learn more about the usability of the German COVID-19 contact tracing app Corona-Warn-App (CWA). More specifically, N = 15 participants assessed the CWA, relying on a combined eye tracking and retrospective think aloud approach. The results indicate, on the one hand, that the CWA leaves a promising impression for pandemic control, as essential functions are easily recognized.

Patients received either dexmedetomidine (group D) or propofol (group P). Both groups received the continuous infusion of remifentanil for pain control. The primary outcomes were opioid consumption and differences in partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) between pre- and postprocedure RFA. In addition, hemodynamic parameters, patient satisfaction, and interventional radiologist satisfaction were determined.There were significant differences in opioid consumption (50.1  16.8 ng/kg/min [group D] vs 71.2  18.7 ng/kg/min [group P]; P = 0.001) and delta PaCO2 (10.4  6.4 mm Hg vs 17.2  9.2 mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.016). Moreover, respiratory rates were significantly different between groups during RFA (P < 0.001). However, blood pressure and heart rate did not significantly change during RFA.

Our analysis of empirical documentation of migration factors as well as theoretical demographic models shows three predominate types of US cities affected by climate migration pathways: (1) vulnerable citiesthose that will suffer significant losses in population and tax revenue; (2) recipient citiesthose that serve as unsuspecting or unwilling receiving communities from sudden-onset disasters without preparation; and (3) climate destinationscities seeking to rebrand their communities as climate havens that welcome displaced residents through equitable planning and preparation. Despite the evidence of such migration trends, there currently is limited guidance for governments at any scale to plan and prepare for these changes. Forced or unplanned migrations will have a profound and disproportionate impact on communities of color, the elderly, and other at-risk populations that are already experiencing the compounding effects of climate and environmental injustices. A lack of adequate preparation and resources dedicated to minimizing the impacts of planned and unplanned migration pathways could exacerbate existing economic, environmental, and social inequalities. Drawing from case studies in cities across the country that illustrate the typology outlined above, this paper presents a framework with preliminary strategies for policy makers to bridge knowledge gaps and design responses for both short- and long-term planning initiatives. In particular, we encourage the use of typological frameworks for implementing scenario planning that can help cities navigate the challenges of planning for future climate-migration to plan for more sustainable, inclusive, and equitable cities for all.","output":"Vulnerable City, recipient city, or climate destination?

We assessed the test characteristics and cost-effectiveness of the Cytosponge? in post-RFA patients. METHODS We performed a multicenter study of dysplastic BE patients after at least one round of RFA. A positive Cytosponge? before endoscopy was defined as intestinal metaplasia (IM) on cytological assessment and/or TFF3 immunohistochemistry. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated. Multivariable regression was used to estimate the odds of a positive Cytosponge? in BE. A microsimulation cost-effectiveness model was performed to assess outcomes of various surveillance strategies: endoscopy-only, Cytosponge?-only, and alternating endoscopy/Cytosponge?. RESULTS Of 234 patients, Cytosponge? adequately sampled the distal esophagus in 175 (75%). Of the 142 with both endoscopic and histologic data, 19 (13%) had residual/recurrent BE. For detecting any residual Barrett's, Cytosponge? had a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 85%, accuracy of 84%, and ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0.74. The adjusted odds of a positive Cytosponge? in BE were 17.1 (95% CI: 5.2-55.9). Cytosponge?-only surveillance dominated all the surveillance strategies, being both less costly and more effective. Cytosponge?-only surveillance required <1/4th the endoscopies, resulting in only 0.69 additional EAC cases/1,000 patients, and no increase in EAC deaths when compared to currently-practiced endoscopy-only surveillance. CONCLUSIONS A positive Cytosponge? test was strongly associated with residual BE after ablation. While the assay needs further refinement in this context, it could serve as a cost-effective surveillance examination.","output":"UTILITY AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF A NON-ENDOSCOPIC APPROACH TO BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS SURVEILLANCE AFTER ENDOSCOPIC THERAPY."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous scoring models, such as the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, do not adequately predict the mortality of patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.

The data of 16,940 mechanically ventilated patients were divided into the training-validation (83%, n = 13,988) and test (17%, n = 2952) sets. Machine learning algorithms including balanced random forest, light gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boost, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression were used. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of machine learning algorithms with those of the APACHE II and ProVent score results. The extreme gradient boost model showed the highest AUC (0.79 (0.77C0.80)) for the 30-day mortality prediction, followed by the balanced random forest model (0.78 (0.76C0.80)). The AUCs of these machine learning models as achieved by APACHE II and ProVent scores were higher than 0.67 (0.65C0.69), and 0.69 (0.67C0.71)), respectively. The most important variables in developing each machine learning model were APACHE II score, Charlson comorbidity index, and norepinephrine.

Despite the volume of competency frameworks developed in the healthcare professions, guidance remains unclear and is inconsistently adhered to (perhaps in part due to a lack of organizing frameworks), there is variability in methodological choices, inconsistently reported outputs, and a lack of evaluation of frameworks. As such, we proposed the need for improved guidance. In this paper, we outline a six-step model for developing competency frameworks that is designed to address some of these shortcomings. The six-steps comprise [1] identifying purpose, intended uses, scope, and stakeholders; [2] theoretically informed ways of identifying the contexts of complex, real-world professional practice, which includes [3] aligned methods and means by which practice can be explored; [4] the identification and specification of competencies required for professional practice, [5] how to report the process and outputs of identifying such competencies, and [6] built-in strategies to continuously evaluate, update and maintain competency framework development processes and outputs.

Prostate cancer is known to metastasize to the lungs in terminal patients. However, isolated lung metastasis without bone or lymph node involvement is quite rare, with minimal reports noted in the literature. Biopsy must be obtained to rule-out other etiologies. Case Report: A 57-year-old African American male with a history of homelessness, extensive substance abuse, and schizophrenia presented to the hospital with worsening auditory hallucinations. Plain films of the chest were obtained due to prior COVID-19 infection in April and the presence of a slight dry cough. Multiple new bilateral pulmonary nodules were noted. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral, spiculated, peripheral and centrally located masses, the largest measuring &gt;1 cm. Upon admission, further work-up resulted in negative HIV, Hepatitis C and B, and tuberculosis testing, but UDS demonstrated cocaine and methadone. Testicular ultrasound and echocardiogram were unremarkable. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mildly enlarged prostate with a nodule projecting towards the bladder. There was no obvious lymphadenopathy or spinal lesions. A CT-guided biopsy of the largest nodule was performed after consultation with pulmonology. He was then discharged to inpatient psychiatry for treatment of his schizophrenia. Biopsy results demonstrated adenocarcinoma consistent with metastatic prostate disease (PSA+, PASP+, GATA3+). No serum PSA was able to obtained for baseline as the patient had left the psychiatric treatment facility prior to biopsy results returning. Discussion: Amongst malignant tumors in men, prostate cancer has the highest incidence and the second highest mortality. Incidence is largest amongst black men. Screening is often based on patient preference and family history of the cancer. The screening test of choice involves prostate-specific antigen (PSA), but this has a relatively low sensitivity and specificity. Symptomatology is not reliable, but in metastatic disease back pain is often the most common initial symptom. Rarely, metastatic prostate cancer manifests with isolated pulmonary involvement with either solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules. Upon discovery of bilateral nodules, biopsy should be performed promptly to rule out malignancy. In prostate cancer, biopsies will be PSA+ and often PSAP+. ' This case highlights the unfortunate reality of the social barriers of healthcare. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of adhering to a specific and standardized approach when bilateral pulmonary nodules are present. Early biopsy is crucial in ruling out metastatic disease.","output":"Prostatic Metastasis: Bypassing the Usual Suspects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current testing for COVID-19 relies on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab specimen Saliva samples have advantages regarding ease and painlessness of collection, which does not require trained staff and may allow self-sampling We enrolled 776 persons at various field-testing sites and collected nasopharyngeal and pooled saliva samples One hundred sixty two had a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR, 61% were mildly symptomatic and 39% asymptomatic The sensitivity of RT-PCR on saliva samples vs nasopharygeal swabs varied depending on the patient groups considered or on Ct thresholds There were 10 (6 2%) patients with a positive saliva sample and a negative nasopharyngeal swab, all of whom had Ct values &lt;25 for three genes For symptomatic patients for whom the interval between symptoms onset and sampling was &lt;10 days sensitivity was 77% but when excluding persons with isolated N gene positivity (54/162), sensitivity was 90% In asymptomatic patients, the sensitivity was only 24% When we looked at patients with Cts &lt;30, sensitivity was 83 or 88 9% when considering two genes The relatively good performance for patients with low Cts suggests that Saliva testing could be a useful and acceptable tool to identify infectious persons in mass screening contexts, a strategically important task for contact tracing and isolation in the community","output":"Prospective Comparison of Saliva and Nasopharyngeal Swab Sampling for Mass Screening for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic thrust the field of public health into the spotlight.

Although a self-limiting illness, it may sometimes have serious hemorrhagic manifestations, and the outcome of dengue hemorrhagic fever has similar clinical manifestations as in other infections, which could result in death. Therefore, autopsy procedures are required under certain circumstances such as in hemorrhagic fevers, sometimes to confirm or to clarify the diagnosis that may have epidemiological consequences. Normally, the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the Pathology Center of Adolfo Lutz Institute receives autopsy samples from different hospitals in Sao Paulo State to confirm a previous diagnosis, especially hemorrhagic fever of infectious etiology. For this diagnosis, we have been using a mouse polyclonal antibody to dengue virus that often does not provide a clear conclusion, because of background staining or no relevant immunostaining, which hampers the histopathological analysis. Accordingly, in the present study, anti-DENV-NS1 monoclonal antibody (4H2) was tested to determine its accuracy in immunohistochemical analysis. Twenty-four autopsy cases of hemorrhagic febrile syndrome showing histopathological alterations compatible with dengue disease were studied: twenty cases were confirmed by RT-PCR for DENV-2 and in four by RT-PCR for yellow fever virus. Samples from autopsied cases of deaths caused by other infectious diseases (two meningitis C and two severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by influenza A H1N1) were included as negative control cases.

Interpretation bias assessed with the picture task was linked to higher levels of fear of negative evaluation, the core symptom of social anxiety, but not to social anxiety symptoms in general. The verbal task was linked to both social fears and thus still seems the preferred method to investigate interpretation bias related to social fears in adolescents. However, we do believe that with further improvement of the pictorial task, it could be a useful addition to the research field.

However, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines can be used. Phillyrin (KD-1), a representative ingredient of Forsythia suspensa, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and antiviral activities. However, little is known about the antiviral abilities and mechanism of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). PURPOSE: The study was designed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of KD-1 against the novel SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E and its potential effect in regulating host immune response in vitro. METHODS: The antiviral activities of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E were assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect and plaque-reduction assay. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. Western blot assay was used to determine the protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) p65, p-NF-&#954;B p65, I&#954;B&#945;, and p-I&#954;B&#945; in Huh-7 cells, which are the key targets of the NF-&#954;B pathway. RESULTS: KD-1 could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E replication in vitro. KD-1 could also markedly reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1?, MCP-1, and IP-10) at the mRNA levels. Moreover, KD-1 could significantly reduce the protein expression of p-NF-&#954;B p65, NF-&#954;B p65, and p-I&#954;B&#945;, while increasing the expression of I&#954;B&#945; in Huh-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: KD-1 could significantly inhibit virus proliferation in vitro, the up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E by regulating the activity of the NF-DoB signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that KD-1 protected against virus attack and can thus be used as a novel strategy for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"Phillyrin (KD-1) exerts anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities against novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) by suppressing the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Esse artigo busca analisar a relao entre os recursos pblicos investidos nas universidades federais e sua capacidade de implementao de respostas  COVID-19 O artigo contribui, inicialmente, com um mtodo de categorizao para avaliao do direcionamento das prticas de combate  COVID-19 pelas universidades federais A anlise dos dados sinaliza uma tendncia de relao positiva entre o nvel de gastos executados e a capacidade de implementao de respostas por meio de projetos de pesquisa e de extens?o, principalmente, para o desenvolvimento de tecnologias Essa reorientao enseja uma discuss?o sobre desdobramentos para as polticas pblicas de Cincia, Tecnologia e Inovao e para o fortalecimento do Sistema Federal de Educao Superior, de modo a garantir a infraestrutura necessria para a resoluo de problemas complexos, como os gerados pela pandemia da COVID-19 Alternate abstract: This article aims to analyze the relationship between public resources invested in federal universities and their capability to respond to COVID-19 The article presents a categorization method to evaluate the practices of combating COVID-19 organized by federal universities Data analysis indicates a positive relationship between the level of expenditures and the ability to implement research and extension projects, mainly for the development of technologies The discussion presents consequences for the public policies of Science, Technology, and Innovation to strengthen the Federal System of Higher Education, to guarantee the necessary infrastructure to solve complex problems such as those generated by COVID-19 Alternate abstract: Este artculo busca analizar la relacin entre los recursos pblicos invertidos en universidades federales y su capacidad para implementar respuestas a la COVID-19 Por lo tanto, el artculo inicialmente contribuye con un mtodo y una forma de categorizacin para evaluar la aplicacin de prcticas para combatir la COVID-19 por parte de las universidades federales El anlisis de los datos se?ala una tendencia de relacin positiva entre el nivel de gastos ejecutados y la capacidad de implementar respuestas a travs de proyectos de investigacin y extensin, principalmente para el desarrollo de tecnologas Esta reorientacin da lugar a una discusin sobre los desdoblamientos de las polticas pblicas de Ciencia, Tecnologa e Innovacin y para el fortalecimiento del sistema federal de educacin superior, a fin de garantizar la infraestructura necesaria para resolver problemas complejos como los generados por la COVID-19","output":"Prticas das universidades federais no combate  COVID-19: a relao entre investimento pblico e capacidade de implementao"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used to diagnose human pathogens. RT-PCR data are traditionally analyzed by estimating the threshold cycle (CT ) at which the fluorescence signal produced by emission of a probe crosses a baseline level. Current models used to estimate the CT value are based on approximations that do not adequately account for the stochastic variations of the fluorescence signal that is detected during RT-PCR. Less common deviations become more apparent as the sample size increases, as is the case in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work, we employ a method independent of CT value to interpret RT-PCR data. In this novel approach, we built and trained a deep learning model, qPCRdeepNet, to analyze the fluorescent readings obtained during RT-PCR. We describe how this model can be deployed as a quality assurance tool to monitor result interpretation in real time. The model's performance with the TaqPath COVID19 Combo Kit assay, widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, is described. This model can be applied broadly for the primary interpretation of RT-PCR assays and potentially replace the CT interpretive paradigm.","output":"Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time PCR Improved by Deep Learning Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. Hospitals around the world began to implement infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to stop further spread and prevent infections within their facilities. Healthcare organizations were challenged to develop response plans, procure personal protective equipment (PPE) that was in limited supply while continuing to provide quality, safe care. METHODS: As a comprehensive cancer center with immunocompromised patients, our efforts began immediately. Preventative measures were established and, as of September 2020, over 14,000 patients have been tested within the facility. From March 2020 through September 2020, only one case of hospital acquired (HA) COVID-19 was identified among our patients. Two cases of suspected community acquired (SCA) cases were also identified. Following the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, IPC measures were implemented within the facility as information science about the virus developed. This article addresses the IPC measures taken, such as enhancing isolation precautions, implementing screening protocols, disinfecting and reusing N95 respirators, by the center throughout the pandemic as well as the challenges that arouse with a new and emerging infectious disease. CONCLUSIONS: The infection control measures implemented at our comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed our center to continue to provide world class cancer care with minimal COVID-19 infection transmission among patients and team members.","output":"Preventing the Spread: A Comprehensive Cancer Centers Journey to Prevent the Spread of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) During the 2020 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Marine fouling is a worldwide problem, which is harmful to the global marine ecological environment and economic benefits. The traditional antifouling strategy usually uses toxic antifouling agents, which gradually exposes a serious environmental problem. Therefore, green, long-term, broad-spectrum and eco-friendly antifouling technologies have been the main target of engineers and researchers. In recent years, many eco-friendly antifouling technologies with broad application prospects have been developed based on the low toxicity and non-toxicity antifouling agents and materials. In this review, contemporary eco-friendly antifouling technologies and materials are summarized into bionic antifouling and non-bionic antifouling strategies (2000C2020). Non-bionic antifouling technologies mainly include protein resistant polymers, antifoulant releasing coatings, foul release coatings, conductive antifouling coatings and photodynamic antifouling technology. Bionic antifouling technologies mainly include the simulated shark skin, whale skin, dolphin skin, coral tentacles, lotus leaves and other biology structures.

A need for disaster medicine response training for University of Alabama medical students in an appropriately socially distanced format was identified during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic. METHODS: Our emergency medicine faculty in collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency Center for Disaster Preparedness (FEMA CDP) created and implemented a novel virtual disaster medicine and pandemic response course for third year medical students at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The course was administered via a teleconferencing platform (Zoom, Zoom Video Communications, Inc.) in the spring of 2020 to greater than 130 medical students. RESULTS: Using pre and post course surveys, we assessed a change in student confidence levels for their ability to explain topics covered in the course and their understanding of a chosen disaster. The students reported an average increase of 2.183 on a 5\\\\point scale, with a score of 5 representing completely confident and a score of 1 representing not at all confident. This course established the feasibility of a virtual instructor led training (VILT) format for disaster medicine education and provided a template for the delivery of over 300 courses to more than 4,000 first responders and medical professionals through the FEMA CDP. CONCLUSIONS: Through collaboration with the FEMA CDP, our UAB faculty were able to successfully deliver a novel virtual disaster preparedness and response course. The course resulted in subjective improvement of students content understanding while also establishing the feasibility and effectiveness of a VILT format that could be readily applied to future courses in undergraduate medical education and beyond.","output":"Disaster Medicine and Pandemic Response: A Novel Curriculum to Improve Understanding of Complex Care Delivery During the COVID\\\\19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, children appear largely spared from the direct effects of disease, suggesting age as an important predictor of infection and severity. They remain, however, impacted by far-reaching public health interventions. One crucial question often posed is whether children generally transmit SARS-CoV-2 effectively. METHODS: We assessed the components of transmission and the different study designs and considerations necessary for valid assessment of transmission dynamics. We searched for published evidence about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children employing a narrative review methodology through 25 June, 2020. RESULTS: Transmission dynamics must be studied in repre - sentative pediatric populations with a combination of study designs including rigorous epidemiological studies (e.g. in households, schools, daycares, clinical settings) and laboratory studies while taking into account the social and socio-economic contexts. Viral load (VL) estimates from representative pediatric samples of infected children are missing so far. Currently available evidence suggests that the secondary attack rate stratified by age of the infector is lower for children, however this age pattern needs to be better quantified and understood. CONCLUSION: A generalizable pediatric evidence base is urgently needed to inform policy making now, later when facing potential subsequent waves, and extending through a future in which endemicity alongside vaccination may become the enduring reality.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic required rapid public compliance with advice from health authorities. Here, we ask who was most likely to do so during the first wave of the pandemic. DESIGN: Quota-sampled cross-sectional and panel data from eight Western democracies (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). METHODS: We fielded online public opinion surveys to 26,508 citizens between 19 March and 16 May. The surveys included questions about protective behaviour, perceptions of the pandemic (threat and self-efficacy), as well as broader attitudes towards society (institutional and interpersonal trust). We employ multilevel and fixed-effects regression models to analyse the relationship between these variables. RESULTS: Consistent with prior research on epidemics, perceptions of threat turn out as culturally uniform determinants of both avoidant and preventive forms of protective behaviour. On this basis, authorities could foster compliance by appealing to fear of COVID-19, but there may be normative and practical limits to such a strategy. Instead, we find that another major source of compliance is a sense of self-efficacy. Using individual-level panel data, we find evidence that self-efficacy is amendable to change and exerts an effect on protective behaviour. Furthermore, the effects of fear are small among those who feel efficacious, creating a path to compliance without fear. In contrast, two other major candidates for facilitating compliance from the social sciences, interpersonal trust and institutional trust, have surprisingly little motivational power during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: To address future waves of the pandemic, health authorities should thus focus on facilitating self-efficacy in the public.","output":"Compliance without fear: Individual-level protective behaviour during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) destroys angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and breaks the balance of renin-angiotension system (RAS) by interacting with ACE2.

The present research examined in a cohort study sample of young Swiss men how their gambling activities and gambling-related problems differed across the spectrum from offline to online gambling. Sample: A general-population based sample from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF), consisting of 5,352 young Swiss men (mean age 28.26 years old). Measures: The spectrum from exclusively offline to almost exclusively online (>90% of gambling money spent online) gambling was measured using one question about the proportion of gambling money spent online. Total money gambled and time spent on gambling were also assessed. GD severity (range 0C9) was measured using items reflecting the nine DSM-5 GD criteria. The number of gambling-related problems (e.g., financial difficulties, range 0C10), other addictive disorders and mental health problems were also inquired about. Methods: We estimated a generalised linear model using a count model (negative binomial link function) for GD severity and gambling-related problems associated with the amounts and proportions of money gambled online and offline. Results: The number of GD criteria were associated with money gambled online (IRR [95%CI] = 2.81 [2.43, 3.24]) and offline (IRR = 2.68 [2.40, 3.00]). This was also found for the number of gambling-related problems (IRR = 2.43 [2.13, 2.79] and IRR = 2.89 [2.59, 3.23]). Compared with exclusively-offline gamblers, mixed gamblers (26C90% of money gambled online) showed the highest levels of GD symptoms and gambling-related problems, followed by the almost-exclusively-online gamblers (91% money gambled online) and, overall, these associations were still significant after adjustment for overall involvement in gambling (time spent and money gambled). Levels of other addictive disorders and mental health problems were higher among mixed gamblers than among offline-only gamblers, but levels among almost-exclusively-online gamblers were not. Conclusions: Symptoms of gambling disorder and gambling related problems are highest among gamblers engaging in both offline and online gambling.

The StMungo (Scribble-to-Mungo) tool is a bridge between multiparty session types and typestates. StMungo translates a communication protocol, namely a sequence of sends and receives of messages, given as a multiparty session type in the Scribble language, into a typestate specification and a Java API skeleton. The generated API skeleton is then further extended with the necessary logic, and finally typechecked by Mungo. The Mungo tool extends Java with (optional) typestate specifications. A typestate is a state machine specifying a Java object protocol, namely the permitted sequence of method calls of that object. Mungo statically typechecks that method calls follow the objects protocol, as defined by its typestate specification. Finally, if no errors are reported, the code is compiled with javac and run as standard Java code. In this tutorial paper we give an overview of the stages of the [St]Mungo toolchain, starting from Scribble communication protocols, translating to Java classes with typestates, and finally to typechecking method calls with Mungo.

Based on several previous studies, it is known that online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic greatly influenced students' interest in learning biology. However, it is not yet known the level of interest in learning itself due to the effect of online learning, and it is not yet known the magnitude of the influence of interest in learning biology during online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research was conducted in 2nd-grade science in Senior High School No. 13 Semarang using a survey method with correlational analysis. The data collection techniques in this study were questionnaires and documentation which were analyzed by testing the hypothesis using the correlation test and regression test. The results showed that the percentage of students' interest in learning biology online during the COVID-19 pandemic was 68.16%. The results of the correlation test show that there is a relationship between interest in learning biology with the cognitive biology learning outcomes of students. The results of the regression test and the value of R squared indicated that students' interest in learning biology affects learning outcomes of cognitive biology. The percentage of the influence of students' interest in learning biology on the cognitive biology learning outcomes is 34%.

During the same period, 105,577 cases among children and adolescents aged 5-17 years and 771,409 cases among adults aged 18-79 years were reported in LAC. School-associated case rates remained low among students, ranging from 110 per 100,000 in September to 859 in December 2020. Case rates among all children and adolescents aged 5-17 years in the county were higher during most of the period, ranging from 167 per 100,000 in September to 2938 in December 2020. School-associated case rates among staff members were lowest in September 2020, peaked in December 2020, and fell sharply through March 2021.

This condition with poorly understood incidence and etiology is characterized by the locoregional development of scar tissue, leading to subcutaneous cording, motion impairment and pain. The early identification of patients at risk for AWS would improve their clinical management. Here, we sought to characterize the prevalence of and the risk factors associated with AWS in BC women after surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS All patients with BC that underwent axillary surgery referred to an Outpatient Service for Oncological Rehabilitation were retrospectively collected. These women were assessed two weeks after the surgical procedure for their clinicopathologic features, type of therapeutic interventions, and AWS presence, laterality, pain, localization, cords type, and number of cords. RESULTS Altogether, 177 patients (mean aged 60.65  12.26 years) were included and divided into two groups: AWSPOS (n=52; 29.4%) and AWSNEG (n=125; 70.6%). Patients with tumor N 1 (OR=3.7; p<0.001), subjected to mastectomy, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and chemotherapy showed significant correlations with AWS onset (p<0.05). The range of shoulder motion limitation (OR=11.2; p<0.001) and the presence of breast cancer related lymphedema (OR=3.5; p=0.020) were associated with AWS. CONCLUSIONS Mastectomy, ALND, chemotherapy, low staging tumors, shoulder range of motion limitations, and BCRL represent risk factors for AWS onset.

A complex regulatory network is needed to preserve a population of na?ve cells over lifetime that exhibit sufficient diversity of antigen receptors to respond to new antigens, while also sustaining immune memory. In parallel, cells need to maintain their proliferative potential and the plasticity to differentiate into different functional lineages. Initial signs of waning immune competence emerge after 50 years of age, with increasing clinical relevance in the 7th -10th decade of life. Morbidity and mortality from infections increase, as drastically exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Many vaccines, such as for the influenza virus, are poorly effective to generate protective immunity in older individuals. Age-associated changes occur at the level of the T cell population as well as the functionality of its cellular constituents. The system highly relies on the self-renewal of na?ve and memory T cells, which is robust but eventually fails. Genetic and epigenetic modifications contribute to functional differences in responsiveness and differentiation potential. To some extent, these changes arise from defective maintenance; to some, they represent successful, but not universally beneficial adaptations to the aging host.

While previous studies suggest social media usage increases the risk of developing anxiety symptoms, how induced anxiety affects attitudes and behaviors is less discussed, let alone during a global pandemic. Little is known about the relationship between older adults using social media during a pandemic and their anxiety, their attitudes toward social trust in information, and behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between using social media for COVID-19-related information and anxiety symptoms as well as the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms on social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors among older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong between May and August 2020. A rapid warm-call protocol was developed to train social workers and volunteers from participant nongovernmental organizations to conduct the telephone surveys. Questions related to COVID-safe behaviors, social trust in information, social media use, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic information were asked. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the community level was used to account for the risk of contracting COVID-19. Ordinary least squares regressions examined the associations between social media use and anxiety symptoms, and how they were associated with social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors. Structural equation modeling further mapped out these relationships to identify the mediation effects of anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: This study collected information regarding 3421 adults aged 60 years and older. Use of social media for COVID-19-related information was associated with more anxiety symptoms and lower social trust in information but had no significant relationship with COVID-safe behaviors. Anxiety symptoms predicted lower social trust in information and higher COVID-safe behaviors. Lower social trust in information was predicted by using social media for COVID-19 information, mediated by anxiety symptoms, while no mediation effect was found for COVID-safe behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who rely on social media for COVID-19-related information exhibited more anxiety symptoms, while showing mixed effects on attitudes and behaviors. Social trust in information may be challenged by unverified and contradictory information online. The negligible impact on COVID-safe behaviors suggested that social media may have caused more confusion than consolidating a consistent effort against the pandemic. Media literacy education is recommended to promote critical evaluation of COVID-19-related information and responsible sharing among older adults.","output":"Consuming Information Related to COVID-19 on Social Media Among Older Adults and Its Association With Anxiety, Social Trust in Information, and COVID-Safe Behaviors: Cross-sectional Telephone Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The true impact and long-term damage to organs such as the lungs after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remain to be determined.

Both immune and neuronal systems undergo significant postnatal development and are sensitive to developmental programming by environmental experiences. Negative experiences from infection to psychological stress at a range of different time points (in utero to adolescence) can permanently alter the function of the neuroimmune system: given its prominent role in normal brain development and function this dysregulation may increase vulnerability to psychiatric illness. In contrast, positive experiences such as exercise and environmental enrichment are protective and can promote resilience, even restoring the detrimental effects of negative experiences on the neuroimmune system. This suggests the neuroimmune system is a viable therapeutic target for treatment and prevention of psychiatric illnesses, especially those related to stress.

He began to develop palmoplantar keratoderma at 2 years old and his sister has similar clinical manifestation characterized with nail discoloration and thickening. A previously reported heterozygous mutation, p.Ile462Asn, was identified in KRT6A in the proband and his affected sister. SNaPshot sequencing revealed mosaicism at a level of 2.5% and 4.7% in DNA from blood and hair bulbs from the unaffected mother. HiSeq deep sequencing demonstrated low-grade mosaicism in the patient's younger sister and parents.

The intestinal tract was distended and contained a yellow clear fluid. The small intestinal wall was thin and transparent. Histologic changes were characterized by atrophy and fusion of the villi, decreased height and vacuolation of the intestinal epithelial cells, by a reduced number of goblet cells, crypt hypertrophy and dilatation, and by edema and increased cellularity of the lamina propria mucosae. Ultrastructurally the viral agent infected the intestinal absorptive epithelial cells, undifferentiated epithelial cells and goblet cells of the villi, and occasionally fibroblasts and endothelial cells of the lamina propria mucosae. Morphologic evidence indicated that virus multiplication occurred only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum became dilated, and electron\\\\dense, granulo\\\\fibrillar material filled their cysternae to form smooth membrane\\\\bounded viral factories in the supranuclear cytoplasm of infected intestinal epithelial cells.

The hospital length of stay for drug-susceptible TB ranges from 20 to 60 days in most of countries, ranging from a mean of 10 days (USA) to around 90 days in the Russian Federation. Hospitalization is longer for MDR-TB (50-180 days). The most frequently stated reasons for recommending hospital admission include: severe TB, infection control concerns, co-morbidities and drug adverse events which cannot be managed at out-patient level. The review also provides suggestions on hospital requirements for safe admissions as well as patient discharge criteria, while underlining the relevance of patient-centred care through community/home-based care.","output":"Tuberculosis, COVID-19 and hospital admission: Consensus on pros and cons based on a review of the evidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the adverse events (AEs) related to the use of off-label drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out using available data pertaining to off-label drug were sourced from U.S. FDA spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting database (FAERS) and Korea Adverse Event Reporting System database (KIDS-KD) for the years 2014 to 2018. The number and frequencies of AE cases were calculated. Disproportionality was analyzed using the proportional reporting ratio (PRR), the reporting odds ratio (ROR), the information component (IC), and the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) methods. RESULTS: The reported AEs associated with off-label drug use were more common among older patients compared with younger patients. Gastric nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic procedure (4.16C4.57%) and haemorrage term (4.16C5.29%) were the most common AE symptoms and antithrombotic agents and immunosuppressants were the drugs most commonly reported to cause AEs in FAERS. Secondary term events (43.45C48.62%) including inappropriate schedule of drug administration and medication error were the most common AEs, and immunosuppressants and antipsychotics were the most common AE-related drugs from KIDS-KD. The numbers of reported AEs in new drug categories such as other antineoplastic agents trended to increase from 2014 to 2018 in both datasets. CONCLUSION: The numbers of reported AEs with off-label drug increased annually. AEs associated with off-label drugs may have a significant impact on older patients.

However, to date, no unified phylogenetic classification system has been developed. To fill this gap, we classified historical PDCoV reference strains into two major genogroups (G-I and G-II) and three subgroups (G-II-a, G-II-b and G-II-c). In addition, no genetic research on the whole PDCoV genome or spike gene has been conducted on isolates from Taiwan so far. To delineate the genetic characteristics of Taiwanese PDCoV, we performed whole-genome sequencing to decode the viral sequence. The PDCoV/104-553/TW-2015 strain is closely related to the G-II-b group, which is mainly composed of PDCoV variants from China. Additionally, various mutations in the Taiwanese PDCoV (104-553/TW-2015) strain might be linked to the probability of recombination with other genogroups of PDCoVs or other porcine coronaviruses. These results represent a pioneering phylogenetic characterization of the whole genome of a PDCoV strain isolated in Taiwan in 2015 and will potentially facilitate the development of applicable preventive strategies against this problematic virus.","output":"Phylogenetic Classification of Global Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) Reference Strains and Molecular Characterization of PDCoV in Taiwan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examined initial newspaper coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak (January?May 2020) in the United States and China, countries with contrasting media systems and pandemic experiences.

OBJECTIVE - To establish a CCP donation program based on the availability of recovered COVID-19 patients and the practical limitations to recruit clinically valid donors in a multicultural setting. DESIGN - From March to June 2020, we developed a program for collection of COVID-19 CCP as part of the treatment options for patients affected with COVID-19. From an initial population of 3,746 candidates, only those with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results in at least two separate tests were considered. This filter reduced the eligible donor pool to 488 patients. After other exclusions were applied, such as language barrier, age, accessibility to donation, comorbidities, etc., the final count was 267 potentially eligible donors, which represented only 54.7 % (267/488) of preselected candidates. RESULTS - Eighty donors were called. Approximately a third of the calls provided additional challenges as outlined by the following four reasons: limited functional understanding of English; schedule availability due to rotating work timetables; transportation restrictions since public transport services were severely restricted during lockdown; and lost to follow up. Finally, a total of 38 valid donors participated, from which 45 apheresis procedures were performed. CONCLUSIONS - As a summary of our experience, we can conclude that despite the limitations we were able to establish an effective program.

The dose and timing of NO injection govern the inspired and intrapulmonary effect site concentrations achieved with different administration modes. Here we test the effectiveness and target reliability of a new mode injecting pulsed NO boluses exclusively during early inspiration. METHODS: An in vitro lung model was operated under various ventilator settings. Admixture of NO through injection into the inspiratory limb was timed either (i) selectively during early inspiration (pulsed delivery), or as customary, (ii) during inspiratory time or (iii) the entire respiratory cycle. Set NO target concentrations of 5C40 parts per million (ppm) were tested for agreement with the yield NO concentrations measured at various sites in the inspiratory limb, to assess the effectiveness of these NO administration modes. RESULTS: Pulsed delivery produced inspiratory NO concentrations comparable with those of customary modes of NO administration. At low (450 ml) and ultra-low (230 ml) tidal volumes, pulsed delivery yielded better agreement of the set target (up to 40 ppm) and inspiratory NO concentrations as compared to customary modes. Pulsed delivery with NO injection close to the artificial lung yielded higher intrapulmonary NO concentrations than with NO injection close to the ventilator. The maximum inspiratory NO concentration observed in the trachea (68  30 ppm) occurred with pulsed delivery at a set target of 40 ppm. CONCLUSION: Pulsed early inspiratory phase NO injection is as effective as continuous or non-selective admixture of NO to inspired gas and may confer improved target reliability, especially at low, lung protective tidal volumes.","output":"In vitro validation and characterization of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide administration during early inspiration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Debating the role of a court during a national crisis is not a novel scholarly exercise.

A little-known limitation of this approach is that, for some subjects and for some time points, the sum of the subject-specific probabilities for the different event types (eg, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death) can exceed one. METHODS: We used data on 8238 patients hospitalized with congestive heart failure in Ontario, Canada. We fit 2 Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards models, one for cardiovascular death and one for noncardiovascular death and estimated the probability of death due to each cause within 5 years of hospital admission. We also fit 2 cause-specific hazard models for the 2 event types and combined the estimated cause-specific hazard functions to obtain subject-specific estimates of the probabilities of each of the 2 event types occurring within 5 years. RESULTS: When adding the probabilities of 5-year cardiovascular death and 5-year noncardiovascular death obtained from the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models, 8.6% of subjects had an estimated probability of 5-year all-cause mortality that exceeded 1 (100%). This problem was avoided by fitting 2 cause-specific hazard models, one for each outcome type, and combining the estimated cause-specific hazard functions to obtain subject-specific estimates of the risk of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular death. CONCLUSIONS: The Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model may be problematic to use for a comprehensive assessment of absolute risks of multiple outcomes, while the combination of 2 cause-specific hazard models shows better statistical behaviour.

We present the first case of EH subsequent to sepsis-related immunological suppression in pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: Septic shock developed in a 30-year-old primiparous woman at 14 weeks of pregnancy during admission for hyperemesis gravidarum. Although her life-threatening status due to sepsis improved by prompt treatment, on day 3 of treatment in the intensive care unit, blisters suddenly erupted on her face and neck and spread over her body. EH was diagnosed according to HSV type-1 antigen positivity and a past medical history of EH and atopic dermatitis. Antiviral agents were administered immediately, with positive results. Her general condition improved quickly, without central nervous system defects. This is the first report of EH following septic shock in early pregnancy. At present, we speculate that EH develops as a complication due to immunological changes in the late phase of sepsis because sepsis is mainly characterized by both an inflammatory state in the acute phase and an immunosuppressive state in the late phase. Pregnancy can also contribute to its pathogenesis, as it causes an immunosuppressive state. Mortality due to EH is relatively high; in this case, a history of EH and atopic dermatitis contributed to the initiation of prompt medical interventions for the former, with improvement in the patients severe condition. The combination of immunological changes in sepsis and pregnancy can cause HSV reactivation, resulting in EH recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, if dermatological symptoms develop in a pregnant woman with a history of EH and/or atopic dermatitis treated for sepsis, EH should be suspected based not only on clinical features but also on immunological changes along with sepsis, and prompt medical interventions should be initiated.","output":"Eczema herpeticum subsequent to septic shock in early pregnancy: a first case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical disability impacts psychosocial wellbeing in people with multiple sclerosis.

However, DNA methylations in the peripheral blood tissues are usually measured at the bulk level based on a heterogeneous population of white blood cells.

Therefore, it is crucial to get fine-grained results by detecting mediation CpG sites in a cell-type-specific way. However, there is a lack of methods and software to achieve this goal.

MICS follows the standard mediation analysis paradigm and consists of three key steps. In step1, we assess the exposure-mediator association for each cell type; in step 2, we assess the mediator-outcome association for each cell type; in step 3, we combine the cell-type-specific exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome associations using a multiple testing procedure named MultiMed [Sampson JN, Boca SM, Moore SC, et al.

Currently, no studies had systematically examined the variables in detecting severe COVID-19. METHOD: Systematic searching of electronic databases identified observational studies which recruited participants with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were divided into different groups according to disease severity were identified. RESULTS: To analysis 41 studies with 5064 patients were included.Patients who are elderly (SMD, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.8), male (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.39 to 2.11) and have comorbidities or flu-like symptoms were significantly associated with the development to severe cases. Severe cases were associated with significant increased WBC (OR, 5.83; 95% CI, 2.76 to 12.32), CRP (OR, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.62 to 8.03), D-dimer (SMD, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.28), AST (OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 3.18 to 6.77) and LDH (OR, 7.94; 95% CI, 2.09 to 30.21).

Methods: A total of 65 adults (29 males and 36 females) with normal clinical pulmonary function test (PFT) and paired inspiratoryCexpiratory chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. The inspiratory and expiratory volumetric indexes of the total lung (TL) and 5 lobes (left upper lobe [LUL], left lower lobe [LLL], right upper lobe [RUL], right middle lobe [RML], and right lower lobe [RLL]) were obtained by Philips IntelliSpace Portal image postprocessing workstation, including inspiratory lung volume (LV(in)), expiratory lung volume (LV(ex)), volume change (?LV), and well-aerated lung volume (WAL, lung tissue with CT threshold between ?950 and ?750 HU in inspiratory scan). Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between CT quantitative indexes of the total lung and ventilatory function indexes (including total lung capacity [TLC], residual volume [RV], and force vital capacity [FVC]). Multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to explore the influence of each lobe on ventilation. Results: At end-inspiratory phase, the LV(in-TL) was 4664.6 (4282.7, 5916.2) mL, the WAL(TL) was 4173 (3639.6, 5250.9) mL; both showed excellent correlation with TLC (LV(in-TL): r = 0.890, p < 0.001; WAL(TL): r = 0.879, p < 0.001). From multiple linear regression analysis with lobar CT indexes as variables, the LV(in) and WAL of these two lobes, LLL and RUL, showed a significant relationship with TLC. At end-expiratory phase, the LV(ex-TL) was 2325.2 (1969.7, 2722.5) mL with good correlation with RV (r = 0.811, p < 0.001), of which the LV(ex) of RUL and RML had a significant relationship with RV. For the volumetric change within breathing, the ?LV(TL) was 2485.6 (2169.8, 3078.1) mL with good correlation with FVC (r = 0.719, p < 0.001), moreover, WAL(TL) showed a better correlation with FVC (r = 0.817, p < 0.001) than that of ?LV(TL). Likewise, there was also a strong association between ?LV, WAL of these two lobes (LLL and RUL), and FVC. Conclusions: The quantitative indexes derived from paired inspiratoryCexpiratory chest CT could reflect the clinical pulmonary ventilatory function, LLL, and RUL give greater impact on ventilation.

This issue is particularly acute for infectious diseases like malaria, which often impact rural and remote communities the hardest. In Guyana, a country located in South America, poor connectivity among remote malaria-endemic regions hampers surveillance efforts, making reporting delays a key challenge for elimination. Here, we analyze 13 years of malaria surveillance data, identifying key correlates of time lags between clinical cases occurring and being added to the central data system. We develop nowcasting methods that use historical patterns of reporting delays to estimate occurred-but-not-reported monthly malaria cases. To assess their performance, we implemented them retrospectively, using only information that would have been available at the time of estimation, and found that they substantially enhanced the estimates of malaria cases. Specifically, we found that the best performing models achieved up to two-fold improvements in accuracy (or error reduction) over known cases in selected regions. Our approach provides a simple, generalizable tool to improve malaria surveillance in endemic countries and is currently being implemented to help guide existing resource allocation and elimination efforts.","output":"A nowcasting framework for correcting for reporting delays in malaria surveillance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Point-of-care testing (POCT) platforms support patient-centered approaches to health care delivery and may improve patient care. We evaluated implementation of a POCT platform at a large, acute care hospital in the Midwestern United States. METHODS: We used lactate testing as part of a sepsis bundle protocol to evaluate compliance and mortality outcomes. Respiratory team members were surveyed to assess perception of efficiency, ease of use, timely patient care, and overall engagement with the POCT system. Annualized cost per test of a benchtop analyzer and a POCT platform were compared across 3 years for each platform. RESULTS: Lactate testing volume increased from 61% to 91%, which was associated with improved sepsis bundle protocol compliance. Employees reported high levels of engagement, improvements in efficiency and time savings, and better patient care with POCT. Average cost per test was $10.02 for the benchtop system and $6.21 for the POCT platform. POCT saved our institution $88,476 annually in labor costs. DISCUSSION: Combined with a robust training program emphasizing the use of lactate testing in the context of the overall clinical picture, POCT enabled adherence to the sepsis bundle protocol and may have contributed to lower mortality. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with unanticipated benefits of using POCT; it has enhanced our ability to deal with stringent infectious disease protocols, saving time and minimizing patient and staff exposure.

Children represent a minority of Ebola Virus Disease cases globally. Yet, the different Ebola outbreaks in Africa had a wide impact on childrens lives and children rights. OBJECTIVE: Review the published literature to date on Childrens rights during Ebola outbreaks. Outcomes shall contribute to get a better understanding of the main limitations or violations of childrens rights, identify potential gaps in the literature and support the promotion and protection of childrens rights for current and future health crisis. METHODS: A scoping review from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and Web of Science was performed using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Articles, reports and editorial, published on Ebola Outbreaks between 1976 and 2020 were retrieved. The UNCRC clusters of rights and treaty specific guidelines were used as a framework. Documents were found through a targeted search of websites from international or regional organisations involved in Ebola crises and childrens protection. RESULTS: 48 articles and reports were reviewed. Few documents focused solely on childrens rights. Several articles covered the topic of children and Ebola outbreaks. Most of the data are linked to basic health, education, discrimination of orphans and survivors. 31% of the reviewed articles underline the violence against the children (rape, abuse, Female genital mutilations), while 21% focus on the right to education. 23% cover the topic of orphans. Impact on mental health and SRH were amongst the other covered topics. CONCLUSION: A lack of data on childrens rights and their violations during epidemics is observed. Regional and international collaboration is needed to document the situation of children in health emergencies.

Little is known about the relationship between circadian rhythm and sepsis in humans. We aimed to investigate circadian variations in the host response in a human endotoxaemia model. DESIGN AND METHODS A cross-over study, where 12 healthy young men received E. coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) 0.3 ng/kg at 12 noon and, on another day, at 12 midnight. Blood samples were analysed for pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines: tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R)-1 and -2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6, and IL-10 as well as YKL-40 and the oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after LPS administration. RESULTS The levels of MDA and IL-10 where significantly higher during the day time (P<0.05) whereas levels of TNF-alpha, sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, IL-1Ra, IL-6, and YKL-40 were higher (P<0.01 for all comparisons) during the night time. No significant differences were seen in the levels of AA and DHA.

For that purpose, sequences are preprocessed by feature extraction and the resulting feature vectors are analyzed by prototype-based classification to remain interpretable. In particular, we propose to use variants of learning vector quantization (LVQ) based on dissimilarity measures for RNA sequence data. The respective matrix LVQ provides additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations and, additionally, can be equipped with easy to realize reject options for uncertain data. Those options provide self-controlled evidence, i.e., the model refuses to make a classification decision if the model evidence for the presented data is not sufficient. This model is first trained using a GISAID dataset with given virus types detected according to the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic tree clustering. In a second step, we apply the trained model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus dataset. For these data, we can either assign a virus type to the sequences or reject atypical samples. Those rejected sequences allow to speculate about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences. Moreover, this rejection analysis improves model robustness. Last but not least, the presented approach has lower computational complexity compared to methods based on (multiple) sequence alignment.

However, direct viral infection is not the only way that the former can affect the latter. Most adverse maternal events that end in hospitals have their genesis upstream in communities. Hospitals often represent a last opportunity to reverse a process that begins at a remove in space and time. The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Community-based organizations including legal professionals, health-home coordinators, and advocacy groups, surround almost every hospital, and can be willing partners with interested departments. COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that it is time to step out of the footprint of our institutions, and to recognize that the need to find upstream opportunities to prevent downstream tragedies.

Methods: This retrospective institutional review board-approved study included patients with resected HCCs and available histopathological classification. Three radiologists independently reviewed preoperative CT and MRI exams. The readers evaluated the presence of imaging features according to LI-RADS v2018 definitions and provided a LI-RADS category in patients at high risk of HCC. Differences in LI-RADS features and categorisations were assessed for not otherwise specified (NOS-HCC), steatohepatitic (SH-HCC), and macrotrabecular-massive (MTM-HCC) types of HCCs. Results: Two hundred and seventy-seven patients (median age 64.0 years, 215 [77.6%] men) were analysed, which involved 295 HCCs. There were 197 (66.7%) NOS-HCCs, 62 (21.0%) SH-HCCs, 23 (7.8%) MTM-HCCs, and 13 (4.5%) other rare subtypes. The following features were more frequent in MTM-HCC: elevated -foetoprotein serum levels (p <0.001), tumour-in-vein (p <0.001 on CT, p 0.052 on MRI), presence of at least 1 LR-M feature (p 0.010 on CT), infiltrative appearance (p 0.032 on CT), necrosis or severe ischaemia (p 0.038 on CT), and larger size (p 0.006 on CT, p 0.011 on MRI).

Within this context, phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference has become a popular method to study disease transmission. In a Bayesian context, these approaches have the benefit of accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty, and popular implementations provide the possibility to parameterize the transition rates between locations as a function of epidemiological and ecological data to reconstruct spatial spread while simultaneously identifying the main factors impacting the spatial spread dynamics. Recent developments enable researchers to make use of travel history data of infected individuals in the reconstruction of pathogen spread, offering increased inference accuracy and mitigating sampling bias. Here, we describe a detailed workflow to reconstruct the spatial spread of a pathogen through Bayesian phylogeographic analysis in discrete space using these novel approaches, implemented in BEAST.

However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap. Objective: To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record-based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample. Main Outcomes and Measures: Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre- or post-Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden. Results: A total of 664a?722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378a?307 [56.9%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.","output":"Association Between Immune Dysfunction and COVID-19 Breakthrough Infection After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Large-scale school closures have been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19 However, the impact of school closures and re-opening on epidemic dynamics remains unclear Methods We simulated COVID-19 transmission dynamics using an individual-based stochastic model, incorporating social-contact data of school-aged children during shelter-in-place orders derived from Bay Area (California) household surveys We simulated transmission under observed conditions and counterfactual intervention scenarios between March 17-June 1, and evaluated various fall 2020 K-12 reopening strategies Findings Between March 17-June 1, assuming children &lt;10 were half as susceptible to infection as older children and adults, we estimated school closures averted a similar number of infections (13,842 cases;95% CI: 6,290, 23,040) as workplace closures (15,813;95% CI: 9,963, 22,617) and social distancing measures (7,030;95% CI: 3,118, 11,676) School closure effects were driven by high school and middle school closures Under assumptions of moderate community transmission, we estimate that fall 2020 school reopenings will increase symptomatic illness among high school teachers (an additional 40 7% expected to experience symptomatic infection, 95% CI: 1 9, 61 1), middle school teachers (37 2%, 95% CI: 4 6, 58 1), and elementary school teachers (4 1%, 95% CI: -1 7, 12 0) Results are highly dependent on uncertain parameters, notably the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and extent of community transmission amid re-opening The school-based interventions needed to reduce the risk to fewer than an additional 1% of teachers infected varies by grade level A hybrid-learning approach with halved class sizes of 10 students may be needed in high schools, while maintaining small cohorts of 20 students may be needed for elementary schools Interpretation Multiple in-school intervention strategies and community transmission reductions, beyond the extent achieved to date, will be necessary to avoid undue excess risk associated with school reopening Policymakers must urgently enact policies that curb community transmission and implement within-school control measures to simultaneously address the tandem health crises posed by COVID-19 and adverse child health and development consequences of long-term school closures","output":"The effect of school closures and reopening strategies on COVID-19 infection dynamics in the San Francisco Bay Area: a cross-sectional survey and modeling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic pain is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly public health problem.1 Recent estimates suggest that approximately 20% of all adult Americans report chronic pain (i.e., pain on most days) and approximately 8% report high impact chronic pain (i.e., pain that interferes with work and daily functioning on most days).2 Unfortunately, despite evidence of the benefits of integrated, multimodal care that emphasizes nonopioid and nonpharmacological approaches for the management of chronic pain, it is more common for chronic pain to be managed by a single provider following a biomedical model of care and with limited education and training in pain management, resulting in opioidcentric treatment.

We investigated whether self-reported chronic pain was associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation or mortality. UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37 to 73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including chronic pain (>3 months, in at least 1 of 7 prespecified body sites) and chronic widespread pain (>3 months, all over body), were linked to COVID-19 hospitalisations or mortality. Univariable or multivariable Poisson regression analyses were performed on the association between chronic pain and COVID-19 hospitalisation and Cox regression analyses of the associations with COVID-19 mortality. Multivariable analyses adjusted incrementally for sociodemographic confounders, then lifestyle risk factors, and finally long-term condition count. Of 441,403 UK Biobank participants with complete data, 3180 (0.7%) were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 1040 (0.2%) died from COVID-19. Chronic pain was associated with hospital admission for COVID-19 even after adjustment for all covariates (incidence rate ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.24; P < 0.001), as was chronic widespread pain (incidence rate ratio 1.33; 95% CI 1.06-1.66; P = 0.012). There was clear evidence of a dose-response relationship with number of pain sites (fully adjusted global P-value < 0.001). After adjustment for all covariates, there was no association between chronic pain (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.89-1.15; P = 0.834) but attenuated association with chronic widespread pain (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04-2.16, P-value = 0.032) and COVID-19 mortality.

RESULTS: Although low-ratio counties show the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, confirmed cases in high-ratio counties (more than 25% of the total population is 65 and older) increase exponentially with time in urban areas. High-ratio rural counties hit their peak later and recover more slowly compared to low- and medium-ratio rural counties. DISCUSSION: Both urban and rural counties with larger older populations are more vulnerable and their disadvantages in COVID-19 infections are more rapidly exacerbated over time in urban areas.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is the most recent, but hardly the only, example. Because pregnant patients are often specifically excluded from trials of new therapies, this is often the dilemma that patients and providers face when considering new treatments. In this study, we used the COVID-19 vaccine as an exemplar to question the broader issue of how society, in general, and obstetricians, in particular, should balance obligations to pregnant womens right of access to new therapeutic agents with the physicians desire to protect the fetus from potential risks. We will argue that in almost all circumstances (with few exceptions, as will also be discussed), maternal benefit and respect for autonomy create the uncertainty that absent safety data bring. Consequently, if pregnant women choose to try new interventions and treatments, such as the COVID-19 vaccination, they should be offered those new regimens and their decision supported. In addition, we will argue that the right solution to avoid the dilemma of absent data is to include pregnant individuals in clinical trials studying new treatments, drugs, and other therapies. We will also discuss the basis for our opinion, which are mainstream obstetrical ethics, precedents in law (supreme court ruling that forbids companies to exclude women from jobs that might pose a risk to the fetus), and historic events (thalidomide). The ethical framework includes the supposition that sacrifice to improve fetal outcome is a virtue and not a mandate. Denying a pregnant patient treatment because of threats to their life can create absurd and paradoxical consequences. Either requiring abortion or premature delivery before proceeding with treatments to optimize maternal health, or risking a patients own life and ability to parent a child by delaying treatment brings clear and significant risks to fetal and/or neonatal outcomes. With rare exceptions, properly and ethically balancing such consequential actions cannot be undertaken without considering the values and goals of the pregnant patient. Therefore, active participation of both the pregnant patient and their physician in shared decision making is needed.","output":"Balancing risks: making decisions for maternal treatment without data on fetal safety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of digital marketing (DM), e-commerce (EC), business sustainability (BS) and financial performance (FP) of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) during Pandemic Covid19 in Indonesia.

Consistent basic data suggest that these same checkpoints are critical negative regulators of atherosclerosis. Therefore, our objectives were to test whether ICIs were associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and a higher risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular events. Methods: The study was situated in a single academic medical center. The primary analysis evaluated whether exposure to an ICI was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in 2842 patients and 2842 controls, matched by age, a history of cardiovascular events and cancer type. In a second design, a case-crossover analysis was performed with an \\"at-risk period\\" defined as the two-year period after and the \\"control period\\" as the two-year prior to treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and ischemic stroke). Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Additionally, in an imaging sub-study (n=40), the rate of atherosclerotic plaque progression was compared from before and after starting an ICI. All study measures and outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: In the matched cohort study, there was a 3-fold higher risk for cardiovascular events after starting an ICI (HR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.0-5.5]; P<0.001). There was a similar increase in each of the individual components of the primary outcome. In the case-crossover, there was also an increase in cardiovascular events from 1.37 to 6.55 per 100 person-years at two years (adjusted HR, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.5-6.5]; P<0.001). In the imaging study, the rate of progression of total aortic plaque volume was >3-fold higher with ICIs (from 2.1%/year pre-to 6.7%/year post). This association between ICI use and increased atherosclerotic plaque progression was attenuated with concomitant use of statins or corticosteroids. Conclusions: Cardiovascular events were higher after initiation of ICIs, potentially mediated by accelerated progression of atherosclerosis. Optimization of cardiovascular risk factors and increased awareness of cardiovascular risk, prior to, during and after treatment, should be considered among patients on an ICI.","output":"Association Between Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors with Cardiovascular Events and Atherosclerotic Plaque."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Male digit ratio (2D:4D) correlates positively with the national case fatality rate (CFR) for COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 may be influenced by a counterbalance between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). SARS-CoV2 cleaves with ACE2 and enters cells leaving an unopposed effect of ACE in the lungs. Both 2D:4D and the ACE I/D polymorphism are covariates of oxygen metabolism. COVID-19 leads to lung damage and a reduction in oxygen saturation of the blood. Here, we examine the interrelationships between 2D:4D, ACE polymorphism, and COVID-19 CFR. METHODS: National frequencies/rates were obtained for 2D:4D from the BBC Internet study (n = 41), published values of ACE I/II (n = 39), and COVID-19 CFR from three World Health Organization situation reports (n = 41). RESULTS: 2D:4D was negatively associated with national ACE I/II frequencies. However, there was a positive relationship between male 2D:4D and CFR (right and left 2D:4D, two, and three situation reports respectively). The relationships between ACE I/II and CFR were non-significant. Relationships between male 2D:4D and CFR's were independent of female 2D:4D and ACE I/II. CONCLUSIONS: The ACE I/D polymorphism may influence 2D:4D such that ACE II individuals have lower 2D:4D than ACE  individuals. Low 2D:4D and ACE II individuals show efficient oxygen metabolism. Therefore, low 2D:4D and ACE II together may protect against COVID-19 severity. The sex-dependent positive correlation between male 2D:4D and CFR is independent of ACE I/II, suggesting that the sex-dependent variation in the ACE2 gene may also influence the 2D:4D phenotype.","output":"Understanding COVID-19: A hypothesis regarding digit ratio (2D:4D), ACE I/D polymorphism, oxygen metabolism and national case fatality rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: There is a need to develop relevant, acceptable initiatives that facilitate physical activity participation in young people with disability FitSkills was developed to support young people with disability to exercise The primary aims are to investigate if FitSkills can be scaled up from a small, university-led programme to run as a larger community-university partnership programme, and to determine its effectiveness in improving physical activity participation and health-related quality of life for young people with disability The secondary aims are to evaluate cost-effectiveness, changes in attitudes towards disability and other health-related outcomes for young people with disability METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial using a cohort design and embedded health economic evaluation will compare the effect of FitSkills with a control phase FitSkills matches a young person with disability with a student mentor and the pair exercise together at their local gymnasium for 1 hour, two times per week for 12 weeks (24 sessions in total) One hundred and sixty young people with disability aged 13 to 30 years will be recruited Eight community gymnasia will be recruited and randomised into four cluster units to have FitSkills introduced at 3-month intervals Primary (feasibility, participation and health-related quality of life) and secondary outcomes will be collected longitudinally every 3 months from trial commencement, with eight data collection time points in total The Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model will be used to support knowledge translation and implementation of project findings into policy and practice ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee (HEC17-012), Australian Catholic University (2017-63R), Deakin University (2017-206) and the Victorian Department of Education and Training (2018_003616) Results will be disseminated through published manuscripts, conference presentations, public seminars and practical resources for stakeholder groups TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12617000766314 TRIAL SPONSOR: La Trobe University","output":"FitSkills: protocol for a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial of a community-based exercise programme to increase participation among young people with disability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Seasonal influenza kills many hundreds of thousands of people every year.

To develop herd immunity against COVID-19, at least 70C85% of the population must be vaccinated. As the situation with COVID-19 changes, the public's perception keeps fluctuating. We designed a survey to determine the prevalence of vaccinated individuals and the rate of infectivity post-vaccination. We also aimed to study the clinical manifestations and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus post-vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 10, 2021 to July 10, 2021 across India through a pre-tested validated semi-structured self-administered electronic questionnaire, to the study subjects with objectives explained and the confidentiality of the data and results had been assured. The questionnaires were prepared using Google forms and the link was sent across social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where people are actively engaged following the restrictions and protocols of social distancing. General demographic data, followed by their lifestyle and comorbid conditions, and data on their vaccination, infectivity, and side effects were collected. RESULTS: We included 2334 participants in the study, of which the majority of the study participants were in the age group of 25C34 years (38.6%). 1729 were vaccinated individuals of which 80.7% had received Covishield and 17.8% had received Covaxin. Around 61.1% have received both doses among 1729 vaccinated individuals and 38.9% had received only one dose of vaccine. The majority of the fully vaccinated individuals had a gap of 4C5 weeks for the second dose (37.1%) followed by 5C6 weeks (11.2%). Post-vaccination 50.8% had experienced muscle pain, 46% had experienced fatigue, 36.5% weakness, and 12.3% back pain. Among vaccinated 26% turned out to be COVID-19 positive and 44.5% non-vaccinated got infected. The odds of infection among non -vaccinated individuals was 2.27 times higher than vaccinated individuals. Individuals who encountered the viral antigen for the second time experienced either through vaccination or infection demonstrated exaggerated inflammatory response which is explained by the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon without life-threatening complications. CONCLUSION: Although more than 50% of the vaccinated individuals experienced some form of musculoskeletal side effects, we noted a high acceptance rate (74%) of vaccination among the participants. The vaccinated individuals were two times safer from infection compared to the non-vaccinated individuals.","output":"Incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 virus post COVID-19 vaccination: A cross-sectional study in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work describes and applies a methodology for estimating the impact of recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) particle filters on the control of size-resolved infectious aerosols in indoor environments using a modified version of the Wells-Riley model for predicting risks of infectious disease transmission.

GBS among Saudis has been seldom investigated, which leaves both clinicians and researchers with scarcity in knowledge. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence and clinical prognosis of GBS among pediatrics admitted with acute paralysis at a large healthcare facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed patients medical records between 2005 and 2015. Eligible cases were children (<14 years old) admitted to the hospital complaining of acute paralysis and later diagnosed with one form or variant of GBS. Pearsons chi-square, Fishers exact test, and binary logistic regression were employed to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The prevalence of GBS was 49%. The male-to-female ratio was 1.45:1. The mean  standard deviation age was 73.7 years. There were 34 (69.4%) cases with progression to maximum paralysis in 2 weeks, while 15 (30.6%) cases occurred beyond 2 weeks. Males (n=24, 82.8%) were more likely to endure progression to maximum paralysis in 2 weeks after the disease onset, compared to females (n=10, 50%), P=0.014. All cases complaining of respiratory problems exhibited a progression to maximum paralysis in 2 weeks, compared to those with no respiratory problems, P=0.027. Residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset was highly associated with GBS patients of age 8C14 years (n=15, 65.2%), compared to younger patients (n=8, 30.8%), P=0.016. Patients admitted in colder seasons (n=14, 63.6%) were more likely to suffer residual paralysis too, compared to those in warmer seasons (n=9, 33.3%), P=0.035. GBS cases who complained of facial weakness (n=9, 75%) and ocular abnormalities (n=10, 71.4%) were also more likely to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset, P=0.025 and P=0.03, respectively. CONCLUSION: Male gender could be a determinant of rapid progression to maximum paralysis, while the older age group in pediatrics is expected to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset. GBS can be accounted as a rare disease, especially in pediatrics, so confirmed cases should be investigated comprehensively for research purposes.","output":"Prevalence and outcomes of Guillain-Barr syndrome among pediatrics in Saudi Arabia: a 10-year retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the revolutionary finding of Helicobacter pylori as a common bacterial infection, that a high research effort for its eradication has been conducted. Epitope based-vaccine presents advantages over protein-based, as they can be designed to contain epitopes from diverse proteins, therefore, more easily representing the immune-variability of the bacterial population, while minimizing the toxicity associated to some whole proteins. In the present work, an iterative method, to design antigenic and conserved B-epitopes from diverse virulent factors of H. pylori, was established. The method considered the trade-off between epitopes antigenicity and conservation among the bacterial population. For the method validation, five virulent factors from H. pylori were selected. From each virulent factor, two epitopes were predicted, each with twelve residues of aminoacids.

Despite near hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribution of resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.","output":"Urgent need for individual mobile phone and institutional reporting of at home, hospitalized, and intensive care unit cases of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Humans have outsized effects on ecosystems, in part by initiating trophic cascades that impact all levels of the food chain.1,2 Theory suggests that disease outbreaks can reverse these impacts by modifying human behavior,3,4 but this has not yet been tested.

METHODS: This mixed-method survey collected data using snowball sampling.

It explored the degree to which patients with IA agreed with each recommendation for PE (0=do not agree at all and 10=agree completely) and their rationale for their agreement level in free text questions. Descriptive statistics summarised participants demographics and agreement levels. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the free text data. Sixteen subcategories were developed, describing the reasons for agreement or disagreement with the recommendations, which constituted the categories. RESULTS: The sample comprised 2779 participants (79% female), with a mean (SD) age 55.1 (13.1) years and disease duration 17.1 (13.3) years. Participants strongly agreed with most recommendations (median 10 (IQR: 9C10) for most recommendations). Reasons for agreement with the recommendations included the benefit of using PE to facilitate collaborative care and shared decision making, the value of flexible and tailored PE, and the value of gaining support from other patients. Reasons for disagreement included lack of resources for PE, not wanting information to be tailored by healthcare professionals and a reluctance to use telephone-based PE. CONCLUSION: The EULAR recommendations for PE have been disseminated among patients with IA. Overall, agreement levels were very high, suggesting that they reflect patients preferences for engaging in collaborative clinical care and using PE to facilitate and supplement their own understanding of IA.

The immune response is induced through the production of EVs incorporating Nefmut-derivatives released by muscle cells. In the perspective to a possible translation into the clinic of the Nefmut-based vaccine platform, we aimed at increasing its safety profile by identifying the minimal part of Nefmut retaining the EV-anchoring protein property. We found that a C-terminal deletion of 29-amino acids did not affect the ability of Nefmut to associate with EVs. Furthermore, the EV-anchoring function was preserved when antigens from both HPV16 (i.e., E6 and E7) and SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., S1 and S2) were fused to its C-terminus. By analyzing the immune responses induced after intramuscular injection of DNA vectors expressing fusion products based on the four viral antigens, we found that the Nefmut C-terminal deletion did not impact on the levels of antigen Cspecific CD8+ T lymphocytes as evaluated by IFN- EliSpot analysis and intracellular cytokine staining. In addition, immune responses at distal sites remained unaffected, as indicated by the similar percentages of SARS-CoV-2 S1- and S2-specific CD8+ T cells detected in spleens and lung airways of mice injected with DNA vectors expressing the viral antigens fused with either Nefmut or NefmutPL. We concluded that the C-terminal Nefmut truncation does not affect stability, EV-anchoring, and CD8+ T cell immunogenicity of the fused antigen.

Our results show that, despite numerous vaccinations in the past, further vaccinations are necessary to immunize the population and to keep the number of severe and critical cases low in the coming months. Considering that not all people can or want to receive vaccination, we compare different age-specific vaccination approaches. Applied Methods: We use the agent-based epidemiological simulator Covasim for discussing the impact of different vaccination strategies. We calibrate it to reproduce the historical course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Aschaffenburg, Germany; for this, we model and integrate numerous public health interventions imposed on the local population. As for some of the political actions rigorous quantification is currently not available, we fit those unknown (free) model parameters to published data on the measured epidemiological dynamics. Then we calculate the state of immunization of the population, gained through infections and vaccinations, at any time in the past, including models for time-dependent immunity decay that have been made available in Covasim. Finally, we define and compare scenar-ios of different vaccination regimes, especially with regard to vaccinating adolescents and providing booster vaccinations to the elderly. Key message: Without further vaccinations, we expect a strong increase in severe and critical cases. In order to restrict their growth our simulations suggest that in all considered cases vaccinations of unvaccinated people is more effective than booster vaccinations for already fully vaccinated people. This applies even to vaccinations of young people who are not themselves at high risk of developing severe or critical illness. We attribute this observation to the fact that immunization of adolescents indirectly protects vulnerable age groups by preventing the spread of the virus more ef-fectively than further immunizing other age groups. This indicates that with the pandemic ongoing, strategies focussed on minimizing individual health risks by vaccinations may no longer coincide with those needed to minimize the num-ber of severe and critical cases.","output":"COVID-19 scenarios for comparing the effectiveness of age-specific vaccination regimes, exemplified for the city of Aschaffenburg (Germany)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the study is to outline the scenarios of further institutional transformation of the Ukrainian agricultural sector based on concept of sustainable development.

Our objective was to externally validate three such risk scores. METHODS: We applied the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) for HIV-negative children, the RISC-Malawi, and the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) scores to hospitalized children in the Pneumonia REsearch Partnerships to Assess WHO REcommendations (PREPARE) data set. The PREPARE data set includes pooled data from 41 studies on pediatric pneumonia from across the world. We calculated test characteristics and the area under the curve (AUC) for each of these clinical prediction rules. RESULTS: The RISC score for HIV-negative children was applied to 3574 children 0-24 months and demonstrated poor discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-0.73) in the identification of children at risk of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality. The RISC-Malawi score had fair discriminatory value (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.74-0.77) among 17 864 children 2-59 months. The PERCH score was applied to 732 children 1-59 months and also demonstrated poor discriminatory value (AUC = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: In a large external application of the RISC, RISC-Malawi, and PERCH scores, a substantial number of children were misclassified for their risk of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality. Although pneumonia risk scores have performed well among the cohorts in which they were derived, their performance diminished when externally applied.

Although these viruses share many similarities, important differences with regard to pathogenicity, type of immune response, and molecular mechanisms during virus infection are different between and within New World and Old World viral infections. Viruses rely exclusively on the host cellular machinery to translate their genome, and therefore to replicate and propagate. miRNAs are the crucial factor in diverse biological processes such as antiviral defense, oncogenesis, and cell development. The viral infection can exert a profound impact on the cellular miRNA expression profile, and numerous RNA viruses have been reported to interact directly with cellular miRNAs and/or to use these miRNAs to augment their replication potential. Our present study indicates that mammarenavirus infection induces metabolic reprogramming of host cells, probably manipulating cellular microRNAs. A number of metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, d-Glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, thiamine metabolism, and pools of several amino acids were impacted by the predicted miRNAs that would no longer regulate these pathways.

In this study, we characterized the development and function of CCR5+CD8+ T cells in rhesus macaques with or without Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. We also investigated the effects of the CCR5 antagonist MVC on functional CCR5+CD8+ T-cell responses in vitro. The data show that CCR5+CD8+ T cells have an effector memory phenotype and increase with age in systemic and mucosal lymphoid tissues as a heterogeneous population of polyfunctional CD8 T cells. In addition, CCR5 is highly expressed on SIV gag-specific (CM9+) CD8+ T cells in SIV-infected macaques, yet CCR5+CD8+ T cells are significantly reduced in mucosal lymphoid tissues with disease progression. Furthermore, in vitro MVC treatment reduced activation and cytokine secretion of CD8+ T cells via a CCR5-independent pathway.

Forgetting about the appointment was a barrier for 38% of participants despite reminder systems being in place.

It is of extreme importance to develop an efficient statistical model of COVID-19 spread, which could help in the global fight against the virus. We propose a clustering-segmented autoregressive sigmoid (CSAS) model to explore the space-time pattern of the log-transformed infectious count. Four key characteristics are included in this CSAS model, including unknown clusters, change points, stretched S-curves, and autoregressive terms, in order to understand how this outbreak is spreading in time and in space, to understand how the spread is affected by epidemic control strategies, and to apply the model to updated data from an extended period of time. We propose a nonparametric graph-based clustering method for discovering dissimilarity of the curve time series in space, which is justified with theoretical support to demonstrate how the model works under mild and easily verified conditions. We propose a very strict purity score that penalizes overestimation of clusters. Simulations show that our nonparametric graph-based clustering method is faster and more accurate than the parametric clustering method regardless of the size of data sets. We provide a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to identify multiple change points and calculate a confidence interval for a mean response.

Clinical experience suggests a lower documented prevalence. This could cause longer admissions and complications, such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). We carried out a service evaluation to investigate the recognition and management of catatonia on inpatient units in Southern Health Foundation Trust (SHFT). We reviewed the local documented prevalence of catatonia, treatment offered and prevalence of complications.MethodWe retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of 95 consecutive admissions to four adult inpatient units in SHFT, starting on 1st August 2020. We reviewed notes for the admission to establish whether catatonia was suspected and identified. We applied the screening questions from the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) to the documented mental state examinations (MSE) prior to, and shortly after, admission. We also recorded the prescriptions issued during the first 72 hours of admission, and whether patients developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome or required admission to a general hospital during admission.ResultCatatonia was documented as a possibility for 2 patients (2.1%). One showed possible posturing and stupor, while there were no documented symptoms for the other. In both cases the possibility was discounted by the clinical team. Twelve patients (12.6%) showed one or more possible or confirmed signs of catatonia. Eleven of these were prescribed regular antipsychotic medication on admission, but only 3 were prescribed regular benzodiazepines. NMS was more likely to be suspected in patients with a BFCRS of 1 or more compared with those with a score of 0, with an odds ratio of 8.1 (95% CI [1.03-64.0], Fisher's exact test = 7.79, p = .076).ConclusionCatatonia is likely under-recognised and under-treated locally among psychiatric inpatients. Although only approaching statistical significance, the higher rate of suspected NMS in patients showing possible catatonia is noteworthy and needs further investigation. Regular benzodiazepines were not frequently prescribed in this group, while antipsychotics, prescribed in all of these patients, can precipitate NMS. Alternatively, this finding could reflect the overlap in clinical presentation between NMS and catatonia. Data collection was limited by the frequent use of remote clerking, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the quality of mental state examinations was often not sufficient to draw any conclusions on the possible presence or absence of catatonic symptoms. This project has highlighted practice in need of improvement, which will be further prospectively investigated and improved via a Quality Improvement Project.","output":"Preliminary investigation into the identification and management of catatonia in patients admitted to adult inpatient units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by severe, antibody-mediated astrocyte loss with secondary demyelination and axonal damage, predominantly targeting optic nerves and the spinal cord. Recent publications have alluded to increased disease activity during pregnancy, and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in patients with NMOSD. Our objective was to systematically review published literature to help counsel and manage women with NMOSD contemplating pregnancy. Methods: We searched five databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE, for English-language publications describing pregnancies in women with NMOSD. Article selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment using Joanna Briggs' critical appraisal tool for case reports and case series, were performed in duplicate. Pooled incidences were calculated where possible, and a narrative summary was provided. Results: Of 2,118 identified titles, 22 case reports and seven case series, representing 595 pregnancies in 389 women, were included. The mean maternal age was 28.12  5.19 years. At least 20% of cases were first diagnosed during pregnancy. There were no maternal deaths. Pooled estimates for clinical outcomes could not be obtained due to inadequate reporting. NMOSD-related disability and relapses increased considerably during pregnancy and especially in the immediate postpartum period. Although a high proportion of early pregnancy losses were reported, an association with disease activity or therapeutic interventions could not be established. Apart from one publication which reported an increased risk of preeclampsia, there was no increase in adverse obstetric outcomes including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction or congenital malformations. Initial attacks and relapses were successfully managed with oral or intravenous corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, and refractory cases with immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and immunoadsorption. Conclusion: Increased NMOSD-related disability and relapses during pregnancy the postpartum period may respond to aggressive management with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, which are safely administered during pregnancy and lactation. Emerging safety data on monoclonal antibodies during pregnancy, make these attractive options, while intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange and immunoadsorption can be safely used to treat severe relapses. The complex interplay between NMOSD and pregnancy outcomes would be best understood through prospective analysis of data collected through an international registry.

However, evidence for media effects are inconsistent in the literature. This study investigated this \\"lift big-get big\\" culture and effects of imagery on males' beliefs regarding RT. Method: An online survey was conducted with male participants (N = 110) randomized to different images (hyper-muscular/lean/control) and RT information (\\"lift big-get big\\"/\\"evidence based RT\\"/control). Results: Descriptive data suggested belief in necessity of heavy loads and free weights was pervasive. There was a small significant effect of condition for multivariate analysis of beliefs regarding RT. Univariate analyses showed significant effects of condition regarding the importance of free weights and heavy loads for strength, and free weights for hypertrophy. Small to moderate effects were found comparing \\"evidence-based RT\\" with a hyper-muscular physique to \\"lift big-get big\\" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques, the latter more likely to agree free weights and heavy loads are necessary for strength. A small effect was found comparing \\"lift big-get big\\" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques and the control condition, the former more likely to agree free weights are necessary for hypertrophy. Conclusions: Although hyper-muscular bodies alone did not influence RT beliefs, new information, i.e., \\"evidence-based RT\\" combined with a hyper-muscular physique had a small effect.

The detection model based on convolutional neural network is an essential method for assisted diagnosis with artificial intelligence. However, it also has the disadvantages of complex structure and a large number of parameters, and the detection accuracy needs to be further improved. Therefore, an improved lightweight YOLOv4 pulmonary tuberculosis detection model named MIP-MY is proposed. Firstly, over 300 actual cases are selected to make a common dataset by professional physicians, which is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Subsequently, by introducing the inverted residual channel attention and the pyramid pooling module, a new structure of MIP is created and used as the backbone extractor of MIP-MY, which could further decrease the number of parameters and fuse context information. Then the multiple receptive field module is added after the three effective feature layers of the backbone extractor, which effectively enhances the information extraction ability of the deep feature layer and reduces the miss detection rate of small pulmonary tuberculosis lesions. Finally, the pulmonary tuberculosis detection model MIP-MY with lightweight and multiple receptive field characteristics is constructed by combining each improved modules with multiscale structure. Compared to the original YOLOv4, the model parameters of MIP-MY is reduced by 47%, while the mAP value is raised to 95.32% and the miss detection rate is decreased to 6%. It is verified that the model can effectively assist radiologists in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.","output":"Lightweight YOLOv4 with Multiple Receptive Fields for Detection of Pulmonary Tuberculosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ascertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R(0)  2.4  0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.","output":"Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study focuses on social media brand engagement in the context of shared and collaborative consumption businesses, a novel trend in the hospitality industry.

This happens, we argue, because experts usually interact with society through a strongly naturalistic framework, which often places experts' epistemic authority (understood as neutrality and objectivity) at the centre, sometimes at the expenses of other pluralistic values (such as axiological ones) that people (often non-experts) cherish. In this paper, we argue that we need to supplement such a strong naturalistic framework used to promote epistemic authority with a number of virtues -both intellectual and ethical- which include i. intellectual humility, ii. courage, iii. wisdom and cares, as well as iv. relational autonomy. To illustrate this claim, we discuss these ideas in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and analyse a set of real-life examples where important decisions have been delegated to experts merely based on their epistemic authority. We use the illustrative failures described in the case studies above-mentioned to call for a revision of current understandings of expertise (merely based on epistemic soundness). Specifically, we argue that in social contexts we increasingly need experts in action;that is, people with certified specialist knowledge, who can however translate it into practical suggestions, decisions, and/or public policies that are ethically more balanced and that ultimately lead to fairer, more inclusive, and more representative decisions. ? 2021 RAS Institute of Philosophy.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. And, it also aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August, 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting, as well as the HADS. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD = 6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in the final analysis. The Bangla HADS was psychometrically sound, and demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability ( = 0.83), and excellent construct validity. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were 69.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, for less severe symptomology (at least borderline abnormal), and 41.2% and 15.7% for more severe (at least abnormal) symptomology. Regression analyses with the total HADS score as a dependent variable revealed significant (p < 0.05) associations with female gender, moderate and poor health status, infrequent physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about ones profession because of the pandemic and associated experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Psychotherapists (N = 1547) completed an online survey. They entered their number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via Internet) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria as well as (retrospectively) in the months before.

Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (p < 0.001). No differences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged.

Telehealth offers alternatives to traditional forms of substance use treatment. PURPOSE To synthesize recent findings on the efficacy of telehealth for SUDs. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library from January 2015 through August 2021 (English language only). STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with a diagnosis of SUD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases. DATA EXTRACTION One investigator abstracted data and assessed study quality, and a second checked for accuracy. DATA SYNTHESIS This rapid review synthesized evidence from 17 RCTs. Evidence is very uncertain that telehealth provided as videoconference therapy (1 RCT) or web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (3 RCTs) has similar effects to in-person therapy for improving abstinence from alcohol or cannabis. Low-strength evidence suggests that web-based CBT has similar effects for improving abstinence in multiple SUDs (2 RCTs). Low-strength evidence suggests that adding supportive text messaging to follow-up care improves abstinence and amount of alcohol per day (2 RCTs) but does not improve emergency department visits or frequency of consumption (2 RCTs). Enhanced telephone monitoring likely reduces readmissions for SUD detoxification compared with usual follow-up alone (1 RCT) but does not reduce days of substance use (low-strength evidence). LIMITATION Narrative synthesis, heterogeneity of telehealth interventions, no assessment of publication bias, and study methodology. CONCLUSION Evidence is very uncertain that telehealth is similar to in-person care for SUD outcomes. Limited evidence suggests some benefit of adding telehealth to usual SUD care.

These treatment tables can have adverse effects, such as pulmonary oxygen toxicity (POT). It is caused by reactive oxygen species damaging effect in lung tissue and is often experienced after multiple days of therapy. The subclinical pulmonary effects have not been determined. The primary aim of this study was to measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath, indicative of subclinical POT after a TT6. Since the exposure would be limited, the secondary aim of this study was to determine whether these VOCs decreased to baseline levels within a few hours. Methods: Fourteen healthy, non-smoking volunteers from the Royal Netherlands Navy underwent a TT6 at the Amsterdam University Medical Centerlocation AMC. Breath samples for GC-MS analysis were collected before the TT6 and 30 min, 2 and 4 h after finishing. The concentrations of ions before and after exposure were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The VOCs were identified by comparing the chromatograms with the NIST library. Compound intensities over time were tested using Friedman tests, with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Bonferroni corrections used for post hoc analyses. Results: Univariate analyses identified 11 compounds. Five compounds, isoprene, decane, nonane, nonanal and dodecane, showed significant changes after the Friedman test. Isoprene demonstrated a significant increase at 30 min after exposure and a subsequent decrease at 2 h. Other compounds remained constant, but declined significantly 4 h after exposure. Discussion and Conclusion: The identified VOCs consisted mainly of (methyl) alkanes, which may be generated by peroxidation of cell membranes. Other compounds may be linked to inflammatory processes, oxidative stress responses or cellular metabolism. The hypothesis, that exhaled VOCs would increase after hyperbaric exposure as an indicator of subclinical POT, was not fulfilled, except for isoprene. Hence, no evident signs of POT or subclinical pulmonary damage were detected after a TT6. Further studies on individuals recently exposed to pulmonary irritants, such as divers and individuals exposed to other hyperbaric treatment regimens, are needed.","output":"Pulmonary Oxygen Toxicity Through Exhaled Breath Markers After Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Table 6"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cancer is a wide group of diseases, which was responsible for 9.6 million deaths in 2018.

Since December 2020, due to the lack of specific guidelines, multidisciplinary groups started to investigate the minimum requirements for Massive Vaccination Centers (MVC). The aim of the paper is to shed light on the process of development of a scalable model for MVC layout design and implementation. METHODS: The methodology included two phases and six steps: 1) Study of MVC with i) acquisition of process data from experimental study on an early set up vaccination hub; ii) review of scientific literature on MVC; iii) review of existing available guidelines and international examples; 2) Design proposal with iv) functional and space requirements collection; v) standard MVC layout design and vi) scalable model definition. RESULTS: The resulting layout is compact, has a good wayfinding and address safety reducing cross-contamination risks. Different vaccine lines have been designed with a central dilution area for process efficiency. Healthcare staff wellbeing is guaranteed by the provision of resting spaces, short distances, and the correct sizing of space for the different activities. To ensure optimal vaccination capacity at the peak of vaccination, a modular and scalable model of different sizes has been designed ranging from 400 to 12000 m(2).

Objective: We aim to explore the clinical and immunological features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among COVID-19 patients. Design and Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 306 hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 129 diabetic and 177 non-diabetic patients) were analyzed. The serum concentrations of laboratory parameters including cytokines and numbers of immune cells were measured and compared between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. Results: Compared with non-diabetic group, diabetic cases more frequently had lymphopenia and hyperglycemia, with higher levels of urea nitrogen, myoglobin, D-dimer and ferritin. Diabetic cases indicated the obviously elevated mortality and the higher levels of cytokines IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;, as well as the distinctly reduced Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios compared with non-diabetic cases. The longitudinal assays showed that compared to that at week 1, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly elevated at week 2 after admission in non-survivors of diabetic cases, whereas there were greatly reductions from week 1 to week 2 in survivors of diabetic cases. Compared with survival diabetic patients, non-survival diabetic cases displayed distinct higher serum concentrations of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, and lower Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios at week 2.

Longitudinal mediation analyses revealed that coping strategies were not significant mediators; however, changes in adaptive coping were associated with subsequent-week OC symptom reductions. Regardless of perceived COVID-19 impact, implementing adaptive coping strategies may prospectively reduce OC symptoms.

Pulmonary involvement in KD is distinctly uncommon and is not commonly recognized. We describe our experience of managing children with KD wherein the initial presentation was predominantly pulmonary. METHODS: Six hundred and two children have been diagnosed with KD during the period January 1993 to May 2017 in the Allergy Immunology Unit, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. Data were collected from inpatient records in Allergy Immunology Unit and follow\\\\up files in the Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic. RESULTS: Of 602 children, 11 (1.83%) had a predominant pulmonary presentation of KD. Mean age at diagnosis of KD was 2.5 years. Fever, cough and respiratory distress were the presenting complaints in all patients. First sign of KD was noted at a mean duration of 14.5 days from the onset of symptoms. Periungual desquamation was the most common clinical sign (72.7%). Persistent fever in spite of antimicrobials, thrombocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C\\\\reactive protein levels pointed toward a diagnosis of KD in our patients. Parenchymal consolidation was evident on chest X\\\\ray in all patients, pleural effusion in six, empyema in three, and pneumothorax in two patients. Coronary artery abnormalities were evident in three patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given after a mean period of 22.4 days of onset of fever. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of KD is often delayed in children who have a predominantly pulmonary presentation.

STUDY DESIGN A 4-year retrospective review of cases of uvular injury and their resolution was conducted in adult patients who received general anesthesia at our institution. METHODS An extensive review was conducted of the quality assurance (QA) database maintained by the Department of Anesthesiology at our tertiary academic medical center. The database was searched for cases of uvular injury that occurred in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia that between January 2007 and December 2010. The medical records of identified patients were then obtained to evaluate the presentation, treatment and ultimate resolution of injury. RESULTS Ten cases of uvular injury were reported in the 28,788 general anesthetics conducted over a 3-year period in adult patients. This correlates to an incidence of 0.034%. Uvular injury occurred in mostly male patients (80%) during elective cases in the supine position. All cases were associated with endotracheal intubation. Additional objects, such as gastric tubes and esophageal temperature probes, were placed in the pharynx of 80% of these patients. Urologic procedures were associated with 50% of reported cases. Treatment ranged from observation to medical therapy. There were no permanent symptoms in any of the patients. CONCLUSION Uvular injury is a relatively rare complication that occurs in patients during the perioperative period who receive general anesthesia. While endotracheal intubation is closely associated with this type of injury, further study is required to elucidate the mechanism and other associated etiologic factors.","output":"Uvular injury during the perioperative period in patients undergoing general anesthesia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were trying to understand the severity of the disease, many comparisons were drawn between this disease and influenza These comparisons have been a major cause of confusion and misinterpretation Comparisons with seasonal flu, the influenza virus that comes every winter, led to the idea that the severity of the disease was similar, not taking into account that the virus that causes COVID-19 is new in the population, or that, unlike influenza, no vaccine or efficient antiviral treatment is known The other comparison was with pandemic influenza, in particular the Spanish Influenza that caused tens of millions of deaths in 1918 The virus responsible for the 1918 pandemic was new in the population, expanded quickly, and caused a significant number of deaths in young adults That was a time of global war, when influenza viruses were not even known to be the causative agent, and treatments were less developed","output":"How Does the COVID-19 Outbreak Compare to Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Coronavirus COVID-19 further transmitted to several countries globally. The status of the infected cases can be determined basing on the treatment process along with several other factors.

The proposed classifier used different seven variables, namely, country, infection reason, sex, group, confirmation date, birth year, and region. The most effective variables on recovered and fatal cases are analyzed based on the neural network model. RESULTS The results found that the proposed predictive classifier efficiently predicted recovered and death cases. Besides, it is found that discovering the infection reason would increase the probability to recover the patient. This indicates that the virus might be controllable based on infection reasons. In addition, the earlier discovery of the disease affords better control and a higher probability of being recovered.

However, little research has investigated the association between EL, ADHD and comorbid symptoms in preschoolers. This study assessed dimensional EL in preschoolers and its link with ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention) and behavioural and emotional problems (e.g. aggression and anxiety). METHOD One hundred and fifty-four preschoolers aged 3-6 years old were rated on questionnaires by parents. EL was assessed with the index from the Conners Rating Scale-Revised and behavioural and emotional problems with an adapted version of the Social Behavior Questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions analyses were conducted. RESULTS Higher EL was associated with higher hyperactivity-impulsivity, inattention, anxiety and aggression problems. After controlling for other behavioural and emotional problems and sociodemographic variables, EL remained associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Emotional lability seems to be a potential marker for ADHD symptoms with internalizing problems in preschoolers and could be a target for diagnosis and early interventions. This finding should be treated with caution as the study was limited by the low response rate of the participants and consequently the small sample size.","output":"Is emotional lability a marker for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and aggression symptoms in preschoolers?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction has been reported as characteristic symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study evaluated olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in mild COVID-19 patients using validated assessment methods. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted for mild COVID-19 patients who were isolated at the Gyeonggi International Living and Treatment Support Center (LTSC), Korea. Olfactory function was assessed using the Korean version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD) and Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT). Gustatory function was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale and 6-n-propylthiouracil, phenylthiocarbamide, and control strips. All patients underwent nasal and oral cavity endoscopic examination. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients at the LTSC, 15 patients (24.2%) complained of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction on admission. Four of 10 patients who underwent functional evaluation did not have general symptoms and 2 were asymptomatic. The mean short version of QOD-negative statements and QOD-visual analogue scale scores were 13  6 and 4.7  3.6, respectively. The mean CC-SIT score was 8  2. No patients showed anatomical abnormalities associated with olfactory dysfunction on endoscopic examination. The mean Likert scale score for function was 8  2, and there were no abnormal lesions in the oral cavity of any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction was 24.2% in mild COVID-19 patients.

The purpose of this study was to determine overlapping pathways between iPD vs. Controls and those associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were performed on gene expression data from tissues donated by idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients (iPD). These included dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNV), substantia nigra (SN), whole blood (WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples (PBMC). Enriched pathways detected by GSEA results were subsequently compared to (a) those retrieved by two independently constructed SARS-CoV-2 C host interactomes, as well as (b) previously published pathway data. For all analyses, a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Analysis of iPD data revealed multiple immune response and viral parasitism -related pathways (FDR < 0.05). Head-to-head comparisons as well as confirmatory analyses revealed several pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms overlapping between iPD tissues and SARS-CoV-2 induced transcriptomic changes: Parkinson's Disease and Huntington's Disease (overlapping in DMNV, ION, SN, and WB; FDR < 0.05), NAFLD (overlapping in DMNV, SN, PBMC and WB; FDR < 0.05), mRNA surveillance and proteostasis pathways (All datasets; FDR < 0.5), among others.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n=12), severe cases(group B, n=15) and critical cases (group C, n=24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher's exact test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H test and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A(69% sensitivity, 83% specificity and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these three groups with high sensitivity(B+C vs. A, 90%; C vs. B, 92%), specificity(100%, 87%) and accuracy(92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score(>10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(>4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(>-779HU) and full width at half maximum(>128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(Q50%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died.

Music performance is a competitive and achievement-oriented career. Research suggests musicians face vocation-specific challenges to physical health and mental wellbeing but has yet to investigate music students beliefs about wellbeing and success. With a self-report questionnaire (n = 99, Bachelor/Master students) we investigated new music students quality of life (WHO-5; WHOQoL-BREF) and self-efficacy (ASKU). Through qualitative workshops (17 groups, n = 5C8) we explored students understanding of the term wellbeing, and how this relates to success. Over half new music students (55%) believed the institution has 40C60% responsibility for their wellbeing. A simple linear regression showed that self-efficacy could predict better wellbeing, explaining 12% of the variance. Self-efficacy predicts wellbeing for new music students (1 = 8.81, p = 0.001). The 17 flipcharts generated 121 inputs clustered into themes. Four themes solely described wellbeing (Health, Safety, Vitality, and Attitude) and four separately depict success (Achieving Objectives, Recognition, Career, and Financial Goods). Some themes intersected as elements of both constructs (Intersection: Relationships & Environment, Development, Happiness, Meaningfulness, Balance and Authenticity). Four further themes illustrated the relationship between the two (Reciprocity, Conditionality, Stability and Perspectivity).

We aimed to study which commonly used markers of disease activity correlate best with inflammatory burden in patients with UC using leukocyte scintigraphy (single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT-CT]) as the gold standard. METHODS Patients with different severity of UC underwent colonoscopy with biopsies and leukocyte SPECT-CT scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and clinical questionnaires were collected. The maximum uptake of technetium-labeled leukocytes was calculated as a SPECT score for each colon segment and a summed activity score for 5 colonic segments combined. RESULTS Thirty patients with UC were included; 14 of 30 (47%) had left-sided colitis, and 16 of 30 (53%) had pancolitis. One patient (3%) had inactive UC, 5 of 30 (17%) had mild, 11 of 30 (37%) had moderate, and 13 of 30 (43%) had severe disease activity based on the endoscopic Mayo score. The endoscopic Mayo score correlated better with the SPECT score than with the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) (r = 0.50; P < 0.01 and r = 0.32; P = 0.08, respectively). The Geboes UC histologic score correlated equally well as the Mayo score (r = 0.50; P < 0.01). We found a significant correlation between scintigraphy and fecal calprotectin (r = 0.44; P = 0.02) but not with serum CRP (r = 0.25; P = 0.18). Fecal calprotectin reflected inflammatory burden significantly better in left-sided colitis (r = 0.80; P = 0.001) than in pancolitis (r = 0.22; P = 0.41). CONCLUSIONS The inflammatory burden in patients with UC, measured by SPECT-CT, is better reflected by the endoscopic Mayo score and the Geboes histologic score than by the UCEIS.

METHODS We collected retrospective post-vaccination SARS-COV-2 serology results available in a university hospital for PLHIV vaccinated between March and September, 2021 who were tested for anti-spike antibodies from 8 to 150 days following dose 2. Antibody titers were compared in PLHIV with CD4+T-cells < 200/L, 200 < CD4+T-cells < 500/L and CD4+T-cell > 500/l at vaccination. RESULTS 105 PLHIV were included: n = 54 in the CD4 < 500/L group (n = 18 with CD4 < 200/L, n = 36 with 200 < CD4 < 500/L) and 51 in the CD4 > 500/L group. They received 2 doses of BNT162b2 (75%), mRNA-1273 (8.5%) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (16.5%). The median time from vaccine dose 2 to serology was consistent across all groups (73 days, interquartile range [29-97], p = 0.14). Seroconversion rates were 100% in the CD4 > 500/L group but 89% if CD4 < 500/L (22% and 5.5% seronegative in the CD4 < 200/l and 200 < CD4 < 500/L groups, respectively). Median antibody titers were 623.8 BAU/mL [262.2-2288] in the CD4 < 500/l group versus 334.3 BAU/mL [69.9-933.9] in the CD4 < 500/L group (p = 0.003).

The virus was also identified later in China. Prevalence of PCV3 in Zhejiang province in southeastern China is not clear though it has been reported in many parts of China. RESULTS: PCV3 infection and its co-infection with other swine viral pathogens in pig herds of Zhejiang province were retrospectively investigated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and its sero-prevalence by indirect ELISA. PCV3 was found positive in 67.1% of the 283 clinical samples taken from 2014 to 2017 as shown by qPCR. Single infection with PCV3 accounted for only one-third of the samples, and majority were of co-infections, predominantly with PEDV (41.6%) but generally low with other swine viruses. Indirect ELISA using the PCV3 capsid protein as the coating antigen revealed an average sero-positive rate of 52.6% (40.8 to 60.8%) in 2345 serum samples from 2011 to 2017, with earliest yet high positive findings in samples taken in 2012. Of 203 serum samples, the qPCR method showed more positive findings than ELISA (81.3% vs 56.2%). With 89 serum samples negative by ELISA, vast majority (n = 81) were found positive by qPCR. There was negative correlation in levels of PCV3 DNA and anti-capsid antibody response. ORF2-based phylogenetic analysis revealed three major groups (PCV3a, PCV3b and PCV3c) of the 200 strains, 38 from this study and 162 reference strains from GenBank. Most of the strains from this study were clustered into PCV3c. Of the putative signature residues of the capsid protein (aa 24, 27, 77 and 150) relative to the three groups, only the PCV3a group strains showed a distinct pattern of residues VKSI (95% of the strains), while the other two groups did not have such a signature pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provided further evidence that the novel virus PCV3 was widely distributed in China and might have emerged in Zhejiang province before 2014, most probably back in 2012 when there was high PCV3 sero-prevalence. PCV3 might be viremic in pigs and could spread by fecal shedding.

We employed a cross-sectional predictive design. The sample comprised 277 university students, of which 252 were female (91.00%). Their ages ranged from 18 to 45 years, with a mean of 20.35 (SD = 2.29). Non-probabilistic chance sampling was used. For data collection, we used an anonymous online form, contacted students by mail, and invited them to participate in the study. Questionnaires were available between 217 and 227 days of decreed quarantine in Venezuela. The results indicated average levels of academic self-efficacy (Me = 4; IQR = 2), emotional intelligence: clarity (Me = 27; IQR = 10), attention (Me = 25; IQR = 10) y repair (Me = 25; IQR = 12), and psychological well-being (Me = 35; IQR = 5).

Discussions on antecedents of individuals willingness to reveal private data from individual differences perspective are limited. Drawing on information boundary theory, we examine how self-construal prompts a different regulatory focus (promotion focus versus prevention focus), thus, affects individuals willingness to disclose private data. METHODS: A mixed-method approach was used to examine our hypothesis. Study 1 (N = 93, participants in China) manipulated self-construal in lab experiments and examined participants actual disclosure behavior in the emerging IoT context of connected cars. Study 2 (an online survey, N = 200, participants in US) measured chronic self-construal in another disclosure context (healthcare app), replicating the preliminary effect and examined the mediating effect of the regulatory focus. Study 3 (an online experiment, N = 284, participants in US) tested the moderating effect of message framing. RESULTS: Study 1 showed that participants primed an independent self-construal were more willing to share private information, whether it is real driving data or private identity information. Study 2 showed that independent (interdependent) self-construal individuals tend to have promotion focus (prevention focus), thus leading to higher (lower) willingness to disclose personal health information. Study 3 demonstrated that independent (interdependent) self-construal individuals are more willing to share information when presented with gain-framing (loss-framing) information. CONCLUSION: Independent (interdependent) self-construal positively (negatively) affects individuals willingness to disclose and these effects will be mediated by regulatory focus and moderated by message farming. Our study provides a theoretical paradigm that is new to the willingness to disclose literature, and offers an effective, actionable strategy on how institutions and firms can facilitate individuals personal information disclosure.","output":"I Am Willing to Disclose, but We are Unwilling: The Impact of Self-Construal on Individuals Willingness to Disclose"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recognition that bacterial infections induce signal transduction responses in infected epithelial cells also provides new avenues to consider as novel forms of therapy. For example, the chemokine interleukin-8, which attracts neutrophils to sites of mucosal infection, is produced by epithelial cells of gastric and intestinal origin in response to bacterial infection. Inhibitors of chemokine production or inhibition of the biologic effects of neutrophil chemoattractants have the potential to reduce both mucosal inflammatory responses and the attendant clinical sequelae. Eukaryotic cells also respond to infection with elevations in cytosolic second messengers, including inositol triphosphate (IP3) and calcium ([Ca2+]i). In intestinal epithelium, these second messengers can mediate the diarrheal response to infection. Calcium/calmodulin inhibitors may have a beneficial effect in treating those gastrointestinal infections mediated through changes in the level of cytosolic free calcium. DuPont and colleagues showed, for example, that oral therapy with zaldaride maleate relieves symptoms of disease and shortens the duration of diarrhea in travelers with ETEC-induced diarrhea.

S is present on virions as pre-fusion trimers in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is stochastically open or closed. Neutralizing antibodies have been described against both open and closed conformations. The long-term success of vaccination strategies depends upon inducing antibodies that provide long-lasting broad immunity against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains. Here we have assessed the results of immunization in a mouse model using an S protein trimer stabilized in the closed state to prevent full exposure of the receptor binding site and therefore interaction with receptor. We compared this with other modified S protein constructs, including representatives used in current vaccines. We found that all trimeric S proteins induced a T cell response and long-lived, strongly neutralizing antibody responses against 2019 SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern B.1.248 and B.1.351. Notably, the protein binding properties of sera induced by the closed spike differed from those induced by standard S protein constructs. Closed S proteins induced more potent neutralizing responses than expected based on the degree to which they inhibit interactions between the RBD and ACE2. These observations suggest that closed spikes recruit different, but equally potent, immune responses than open spikes, and that this is likely to include neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Together with their improved stability and storage properties we suggest that closed spikes may be a valuable component of refined, next-generation vaccines.ImportanceVaccines in use against SARS-CoV-2 induce immune responses against the spike protein. There is intense interest in whether the antibody response induced by vaccines will be robust against new variants, as well as in next-generation vaccines for use in previously infected or immunized individuals. We assessed the use as an immunogen of a spike protein engineered to be conformationally stabilized in the closed state where the receptor binding site is occluded. Despite occlusion of the receptor binding site, the spike induces potently neutralizing sera against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. Antibodies are raised against a different pattern of epitopes to those induced by other spike constructs, preferring conformational epitopes present in the closed conformation. Closed spikes, or mRNA vaccines based on their sequence, can be a valuable component of next generation vaccines.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein stabilized in the closed state induces potent neutralizing responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), a common human respiratory pathogen, is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease in children and adults. Currently, no antiviral drugs are available to treat CoV infections; thus, potential drug targets need to be identified and characterized. Here, we identify HCoV-NL63 replicase gene products and characterize two viral papain-like proteases (PLPs), PLP1 and PLP2, which process the viral replicase polyprotein. We generated polyclonal antisera directed against two of the predicted replicase nonstructural proteins (nsp3 and nsp4) and detected replicase proteins from HCoV-NL63-infected LLC-MK2 cells by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot assays. We found that HCoV-NL63 replicase products can be detected at 24 h postinfection and that these proteins accumulate in perinuclear sites, consistent with membrane-associated replication complexes. To determine which viral proteases are responsible for processing these products, we generated constructs representing the amino-terminal end of the HCoV-NL63 replicase gene and established protease cis-cleavage assays. We found that PLP1 processes cleavage site 1 to release nsp1, whereas PLP2 is responsible for processing both cleavage sites 2 and 3 to release nsp2 and nsp3. We expressed and purified PLP2 and used a peptide-based assay to identify the cleavage sites recognized by this enzyme. Furthermore, by using K48-linked hexa-ubiquitin substrate and ubiquitin-vinylsulfone inhibitor specific for deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), we confirmed that, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV PLpro, HCoV-NL63 PLP2 has DUB activity.

Coughing with a mask resulted in the most significant decrease in droplets; however, particles still escaped from the top of the mask. Coughing with the slit-lamp shield alone blocked most of forward particle dispersion; however, significant distributions of respiratory droplets were found on the slit-lamp joystick and table. Coughing with both a mask and slit-lamp shield resulted in the least dispersion to the simulated examiner and the simulated patient. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated particle sizes of 3-100 m. CONCLUSIONS: Masking had the greatest effect in limiting spread of respiratory droplets, whereas slit-lamp shields and gloves also contributed to limiting exposure to droplets from SARS-CoV-2 during slit-lamp examination.","output":"Assessment of Respiratory Droplet Transmission During the Ophthalmic Slit-Lamp Exam: A Particle Tracking Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving tool and provides organ support for patients with respiratory failure.

This could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator associated conditions and finally increased mortality. In this study, we explore the viability and compare machine learning methods to generate personalized predictive alerts indicating violation of the safe tidal volume per ideal body weight (IBW) threshold that is accepted as the upper limit for lung protective ventilation (LPV), prior to application to patients. We process streams of patient respiratory data recorded per minute from ventilators in an intensive care unit and apply several state-of-the-art time series prediction methods to forecast the behavior of the tidal volume metric per patient, one hour ahead. Our results show that boosted regression delivers better predictive accuracy than other methods that we investigated and requires relatively short execution times. Long short-term memory neural networks can deliver similar levels of accuracy but only after much longer periods of data acquisition, further extended by several hours computing time to train the algorithm. Utilizing Artificial Intelligence, we have developed a personalized clinical decision support tool that can predict tidal volume behavior within [Formula: see text] accuracy and compare alerts recorded from a real world system to highlight that our models would have predicted violations one hour ahead and can therefore conclude that the algorithms can provide clinical decision support.","output":"Comparing Regression and Neural Network techniques for personalised predictive analytics to promote lung protective We repeated this process for all points in the time series, for each patient and report the RMSE value per method.ventilation in Intensive Care Units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we describe the detection of a SARS-CoV-2 genome through metatranscriptome next-generation sequencing directly from the nasopharyngeal swab of a suspected case of local transmission of Covid-19, in Brazil.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1202 patients' medical records after CABG were evaluated by a research-made checklist. Tarone-Ware test was used to determine the predictors of patients' LOS in the ICU. Cox regression model was used to determine the risk factors and risk ratios associated with ICU LOS. RESULTS: The mean ICU LOS after CABG was 55.2717.33 hours. Cox regression model showed that having more than two chest tubes (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.005-1.287, Relative Risk [RR]=1.138), occurrence of atelectasis (95% CI 1.000-3.007, RR=1.734), and occurrence of atrial fibrillation after CABG (95% CI 1.428-2.424, RR=1.861) were risk factors associated with longer ICU LOS. The discrimination power of this set of predictors was demonstrated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and it was 0.69. A simple risk scoring system was developed based on three identified predictors that can raise ICU LOS. CONCLUSION: The simple risk scoring system developed based on three identified predictors can help to plan more accurately a patient's LOS in hospital for CABG and can be useful in managing human and financial resources.","output":"Predictors of Length of Stay in Intensive Care Unit after Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: Development a Risk Scoring System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the mental health of people under risk.

Unlike general goal-oriented dialogues, a conversation between a patient and a therapist is considerably implicit, though the objective of the conversation is quite apparent. In such a case, understanding the intent of the patient is imperative in providing effective counselling in therapy sessions, and the same applies to a dialogue system as well. In this work, we take forward a small but an important step in the development of an automated dialogue system for mental-health counselling. We develop a novel dataset, named HOPE, to provide a platform for the dialogue-act classification in counselling conversations. We identify the requirement of such conversation and propose twelve domain-specific dialogue-act (DAC) labels. We collect  12.9K utterances from publicly-available counselling session videos on YouTube, extract their transcripts, clean, and annotate them with DAC labels. Further, we propose SPARTA, a transformer-based architecture with a novel speaker- and time-aware contextual learning for the dialogue-act classification.

The unique mosaic M segment might confer the virus high replication capacity, showing that the recombination might play an important role in inducing high pathogenicity of the virus.

Transmission by asymptomatic carriers of the new variant is also unknown. Mutation pressure by antiviral agents or vaccines have not yet been induced; however, additional mutations are expected following global vaccination and, later, after administration of validated treatments. Thus, preparedness for fast emergence of new variants is prudent. One can also expect less virulent but highly transmissible variants, which could facilitate herd immunity. Development of clinical and rapid laboratory tests is required to follow up the vaccinated individuals for a secondary infection potentially by the new variant.

Here, we estimated the rate of mutation accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and investigated the repeatability of its evolution when facing a new cell type but no immune or drug pressures. Methodology We performed experimental evolution with two strains of SARS-CoV-2, one carrying the originally described spike protein (CoV-2-D) and another carrying the D614G mutation that has spread worldwide (CoV-2-G). After 15 passages in Vero cells and whole genome sequencing, we characterized the spectrum and rate of the emerging mutations and looked for evidences of selection across the genomes of both strains. Results From the mutations accumulated, and excluding the genes with signals of selection, we estimate a spontaneous mutation rate of 1.2510-6 nt-1 per infection cycle for both lineages of SARS-CoV-2. We further show that mutation accumulation is heterogeneous along the genome, with the spike gene accumulating mutations at rate five-fold higher than the genomic average. We also observe the emergence of mutators in the CoV-2-G background, likely linked to mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and/or in the error-correcting exonuclease protein. Conclusions and implications These results provide valuable information on how spontaneous mutations emerge in SARS-CoV-2 and on how selection can shape its genome towards adaptation to new environments. Lay summary Mutation is the ultimate source of variation. We estimated how the SARS-COV-2 viruscause of the COVID-19 pandemicmutates. Upon infecting cells, its genome can change at a rate of 0.04 per replication.

METHOD: We performed a prospective audit of clinic and theatre data (16th March to 30th April 2020), from the paediatric orthopaedic department at the BRCH against the 'BOAST COVID-19 standards'. We also performed a retrospective audit. RESULTS: Patients booked into acute fracture clinic (AFC) and fracture clinic follow-up (FFO) reduced by 40% and 48% respectively from 2019 to 2020. A virtual fracture clinic (VFC) was implemented with an increasing trend seen. The number of patient initiated follow-up appointments increased in AFC and FFO from 16% to 75% and 12% to 35% respectively.

Many studies have illustrated the utility of chest CT scan in the diagnoses of COVID-19. This paper evaluates the value of classical machine learning techniques and the convolutional neural networks in aiding physicians to further classify patients into either COVID-19 positive or negative according to their chest CT findings, and thus facilitating their work. To address this problem, this paper proposes classical neural networks using statistical features and deep CNN models to further classify a dataset of preprocessed chest CT images, using several classifiers and to evaluate the results. This latter showed that the best proposed method was a four layers CNN with SVM classifier with 99.6% accuracy.

However, their interdependencies remain elusive. Methods: COV-ADAPT is a prospective, observational cohort study of 417 healthcare workers who received homologous vaccination with Astra (ChAdOx1-S; AstraZeneca) or BNT (BNT162b2; Biontech/Pfizer) or heterologous vaccination with Astra/BNT. We assessed the humoral (anti-spike-RBD-IgG, neutralizing antibodies, antibody avidity) and cellular (spike-induced T cell interferon-y release) immune response in blood samples up to 2 weeks before (T1) and 2 to 12 weeks following secondary immunization (T2). Findings: Initial vaccination with Astra resulted in lower anti-spike-RBD-IgG responses compared to BNT (70+/-114 vs. 226+/-279 BAU/ml, p<0.01) at T1, whereas T cell activation did not differ significantly. Booster vaccination with BNT proved superior to Astra at T2 (anti-spike-RBD-IgG: Astra/BNT 2387+/-1627 and BNT/BNT 3202+/-2184 vs. Astra/Astra 413+/-461 BAU/ml, both p<0.001; spike-induced T cell interferon-y; release: Astra/BNT 5069+/-6733 and BNT/BNT 4880+/-7570 vs. Astra/Astra 1152+/-2243 mIU/ml, both p<0.001). No significant differences were detected between BNT-boostered groups at T2. For Astra, we observed no booster effect on T cell activation. We found associations between anti-spike-RBD-IgG levels (Astra/BNT and BNT/BNT) and T cell responses (Astra/Astra and Astra/BNT) from T1 to T2. There were also links between levels of anti-spike-RBD-IgG and T cell at both time points (all groups combined). All regimes yielded neutralizing antibodies and increased antibody avidity at T2. Interpretation: Interdependencies between humoral and cellular immune responses differ between common SARS-CoV-2 vaccination regimes.

The lack of an established vaccine for this disease has caused millions of illnesses and hundreds of thousands of deaths globally. Mathematical models have become crucial tools in determining the potential and seriousness of the disease and in helping the types of strategic intervention measures to be taken to prevent and control the intensity of the spread of the disease. In this study, a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 is proposed and analyzed to predict the transmission dynamics of the disease in Ethiopia. Analytically, the basic reproduction number is determined. To observe the dynamics of the system, a detailed stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the proposed model is carried out. Our result shows that the DFE is stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable otherwise. Also, the parameters of the assumed model are estimated using the actual data of COVID-19 from Ethiopia reported for three months between March and June 2020. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number and found that reducing the rate of transmission is the most important factor in achieving disease control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model for the actual COVID-19 data in Ethiopia. In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. Thus, results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with the sensitivity results of the system. The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease.

METHODS This is a prospective study of 1915 participants (male, 40.5%), aged 19-74 year who were free of MetS at baseline. Dietary intakes were gathered using a validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire at baseline (2006-2008), and with 3-year intervals afterwards. Alternative approach was used for snack foods from all available questionnaires during follow-up. Snack foods were divided into 4 categories, including total snacks, biscuits and cakes, candies and chocolate, and salty snacks. Total snack foods intake and its subgroup (serving/week) were modeled as tertiles. MetS was diagnosed according to the Joint Interim Statement criteria. Physical activity level (PAL) categorized as low/medium and high levels. Information regarding smoking (Smoker/Non-smoker), education (higher/lower education), and occupation (employed/non-employed) was gathered using questionnaire. The Cox regression was used, regarding interaction between snack foods, SES, and PAL on the MetS risk. RESULTS A total of 591 incident MetS cases were diagnosed during 8.9 years of follow-up.

AKI occurred in 81 patients (81%), including 44, 10 and 27 patients with AKI stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The severity of AKI was associated with mortality at day 28 (p = 0.013). Before adjustment, the third fraction of complement (C3), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin levels were higher in AKI patients. After adjustment for confounders, both severity (modified SOFA score per point) and AKI were associated with outcome. When forced in the final model, C3 (OR per log 0.25; 95% CI 0.01C4.66), IL-6 (OR per log 0.83; 95% CI 0.51C1.34), or ferritin (OR per log 1.63; 95% CI 0.84C3.32) were not associated with AKI and did not change the model. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we did not find any association between complement activation or inflammatory markers and AKI. Proportion of patients with AKI during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher than previously reported and associated with outcome.","output":"Acute kidney injury in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing population of older adults and improved effective treatments for inflammatory rheumatic diseases will increase the demand for more healthcare resources that already struggle with staggering outpatient clinic waiting times.

The white patches distinguished the crow from hundreds of other members of its species thriving in the area. This crow's atypical plumage was due to a congenital genetic condition called leucism, a partial or complete loss of coloration. The incidence of leucism in wild bird populations scarcely exceeds 1%. Observing an abnormally colored bird provides insight into intraspecific phenotypic variability as well as how variations persist in nature.

At first, it was thought that the patients who use immunmodulator therapy could be even at higher risks of disease complications. However, it has been also speculated about that using immunmodulators could be an advantage for the clinical prognosis. Therefore, several immunmodulators are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19.

SQ have a large range of biological properties and are potent inhibitors and modulators of inflammation, targeting specific components of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-B) signaling pathway and nitric oxide (NO) generation. Because SQs can be isolated from over 1600 genera and 2500 species grown worldwide, they are an attractive source of phytochemical therapeutics. The chemical structure and biosynthesis of SQs is complex, and the SQ scaffold represents extraordinary structural variety consisting of both acyclic and cyclic (mono, bi, tri, and tetracyclic) compounds. These structures can be decorated with a diverse range of functional groups and substituents, generating many stereospecific configurations. In this review, the effect of SQs on inflammation will be discussed in the context of their complex chemistry. Because inflammation is a multifactorial process, we focus on specific aspects of inflammation: the inhibition of NF-kB signaling, disruption of NO production and modulation of dendritic cells, mast cells, and monocytes. Although the molecular targets of SQs are varied, we discuss how these pathways may mediate the effects of SQs on inflammation.","output":"The Complexity of Sesquiterpene Chemistry Dictates Its Pleiotropic Biologic Effects on Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Human enteric adenovirus Ad41 is associated with children gastroenteritis. To infect gastrointestinal cells, the invading virus must be acid-stable and resistant to inactivation by bile salts and proteases. In addition, it has to cross the mucus barrier before it infects mucosa cells. We show that Ad41 infectivity is not diminished by acid exposure, a condition limiting the infectivity of the respiratory Ad. This feature can be attributed to a large extent to the global basic charge of enteric Ad virions and to the stability of Ad41 fiber, a viral protein mediating virus attachment. Upon exposure to pH shock, the respiratory Ad2 loses its ability to interact with lipids while enteric Ad41 still binds to the major phospholipids of gastric and intestine mucus. In addition, contrary to respiratory Ad, enteric Ad41 interacts with several sphingolipid components of plasma membranes.

Methods: We analyzed an observational registry of patients tested for COVID-19 at the Cleveland Clinic because of symptoms or other qualifying criteria from 3/8/2020-5/8/2020. Overlap propensity-score weighted logistic/linear regressions investigated associations between pneumococcal vaccination status and COVID-19- related clinical outcomes. Results: 18,197 patients (median age 50.2 yrs [IQR 30.4], 40% male, 67% white) were included. 2785 (15.3%) tested SARS-CoV-2-positive and 738(26.5%) were hospitalized. Prior pneumococcal vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients did not reduce ICU admission, oxygen usage, radiographic infiltrates, or need for mechanical ventilation. Pneumococcal vaccine recipients were less likely to test positive for SARSCoV- 2 (OR 0.77, 95% CI [0.68,0.87]). Pneumococcal vaccine recipients aged 15-65 years testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had increased risk of hospitalization (OR 1.54 [1.001, 2.38] and death (OR 12.51 [1.92,81.36]) compared to non-recipients, and those &gt;65 years were more likely to develop pneumonia (OR 8.45, 95% CI [1.77,40.42]). Conclusions: Pneumococcal vaccination status serves as a marker of underlying co-morbidities with greater risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19 for those age 15-65 and of pneumonia for those &gt;65, with no impact on other important adverse outcomes.

The murine susceptibility is noteworthy in that it persists beyond the development of resistance to other, nonfungal pathogens and the maturation of most immune functions. As the susceptibility to blastomycosis appeared to be related to an early event after infection, primary effector cell function was studied. We found that peritoneal inflammatory cells, enriched for neutrophils, from immature (3-week-old) mice killed nonphagocytizable Blastomyces dermatitidis cells less (25%) than did cells from mature (8-week) mice (70%) (P<0.01), a defect intrinsic to the neutrophils. This correlated with an impaired immature cell oxidative burst. Killing of phagocytizable Candida albicans was not significantly different, 73 versus 87%. Thioglycolate-elicited cells were more impaired; killing of B. dermatitidis was insignificant, and killing of C. albicans was more impaired in immature (16% killing) than in mature (45%) cells (P<0.02). Peripheral blood neutrophils from mature animals killed B. dermatitidis (41%) more than did those from immature animals (10%) (P<0.02); C. albicans was killed efficiently by both. Resting or activated peritoneal macrophages from both types of animals showed no differences in B. dermatitidis killing.

Cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the full-length DCPD protein bound DHBV particles, whereas cells expressing truncated versions of DCPD protein that fail to bind the pre-S protein did not. The DHBV binding to DCPD-reconstituted cells was blocked by a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes DHBV infection of primary duck hepatocytes (PDH) and also by a pre-S peptide previously shown to inhibit DHBV infection of PDH. In addition to promoting virus binding, DCPD expression was associated with internalization of viral particles. The entry process was prevented by incubation of reconstituted cells with DHBV at 4 degrees C and by the addition of energy-depleting agents known to block DHBV entry into PDH. These results demonstrated that DCPD is a DHBV receptor.

What should be considered when designing mobile health for epilepsy? We used PRISMA methodology to search within App Store and Google Play Store from February to April of 2021, reaching 55 potential apps. A more thorough analysis regarding particular features was performed on 26 of those apps. The content of these apps was evaluated in five categories, regarding if there was personalisable content;features related to medication management;what aspects of seizure log were present;what type of communication prevailed;and if there was any content related to seizure alarm or seizure action plans. Moreover, the 26 apps were evaluated through using MARS by six raters, including two neurologists. The analysis of MARS categories was performed for the top and bottom apps, to understand the core differences. Overall, the lowest MARS scores were related to engagement and information, which play a big part in long-term use, and previous studies raised the concern of assuring continuous use, especially in younger audiences. With that in mind, we identified conceptual improvement points, which were divided in three main topics: customisation, simplicity and healthcare connection. Moreover, we summarised some ideas to improve m-health apps catered around long-term adherence.

Short-chain PFAAs and novel alternatives together accounted for over 70% in groundwater, revealing their prevalence in replacing legacy perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Novel alternatives for PFOA were mainly hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA), while those for PFOS were 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS). PFAAs (maximum total: 1339a?ng/L) and novel alternatives (maximum total: 208a?ng/L) in groundwater were mostly derived from the FIP, and exhibited an exponentially decreasing trend with increasing distance. Compared with those in groundwater, more diverse sources of PFAAs and novel alternatives in surface soil were identified. The transport of these chemicals may be retarded by clayed surface soils with high organic matter contents. High aquifer permeability could generally promote the dilution and migration of PFAAs and novel alternatives in groundwater, as well as reduce the differences in their spatial distribution. Shorter-chain components with smaller molecules and higher hydrophilicity exhibited greater migration capacities in the aquifer. In addition, different levels of health risk from PFOS and PFOA were zoned based on drinking groundwater, and high risks tended to be distributed in areas with relatively poor aquifer water yield due to higher pollutant accumulation.","output":"Exploring the source, migration and environmental risk of perfluoroalkyl acids and novel alternatives in groundwater beneath fluorochemical industries along the Yangtze River, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Algorithmic decision support is increasingly used in a whole array of different contexts and structures in various areas of society, influencing many people's lives.

On top of trial delays or even discontinuation which have been observed in all disease areas, NPIs altered transmission pattern of many seasonal respiratory viruses which followed regular patterns for decades before the pandemic. Clinical trial design based on pre-pandemic historical data therefore needs to be put in question. In this article, we show how knowledge-based mathematical modeling can be used to address this issue. We set up an epidemiological model of respiratory tract infection (RTI) sensitive to a time dependent between-host transmission rate and coupled this model to a mechanistic description of viral RTI episodes in an individual patient. By reducing the transmission rate when the lockdown was introduced in the United Kingdom in March 2020, we were able to reproduce the perturbed 2020 RTI disease burden data. Using this setup, we simulated several NPIs scenarios of various strength (none, mild, medium, strong) and conducted placebo-controlled in silico clinical trials in pediatric patients with recurrent RTIs (RRTI) quantifying annual RTI rate distributions. In interventional arms, virtual patients aged 1-5 years received the bacterial lysate OM-85 (approved in several countries for the prevention of pediatric RRTIs) through a pro-type I immunomodulation mechanism of action described by a physiologically based pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics approach (PBPK/PD). Our predictions showed that sample size estimates based on the ratio of RTI rates (or the post-hoc power of fixed sample size trials) are not majorly impacted under NPIs which are less severe (none, mild and medium NPIs) than a strict lockdown (strong NPI). However, NPIs show a stronger impact on metrics more relevant for assessing the clinical relevance of the effect such as absolute benefit. This dichotomy shows the risk that successful trials (even with their primary endpoints being met) still get challenged in risk benefit assessment during the review of market authorization. Furthermore, we found that a mild NPI scenario already affected the time to recruit significantly when sticking to eligibility criteria complying with historical data. In summary, our model predictions can help rationalize and forecast post-COVID-19 trial feasibility. They advocate for gauging absolute and relative benefit metrics as well as clinical relevance for assessing efficacy hypotheses in trial design and they question eligibility criteria misaligned with the actual disease burden.","output":"Viral kinetic modeling and clinical trial simulation predicts disruption of respiratory disease trials by non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles (BMSC-sEV) can be used as a potential cell-free strategy for periodontal tissue regeneration, and we aim to investigate the effect and possible mechanism of BMSC-sEV in periodontal tissue regeneration in this study.

The human periodontal stem cells (hPDLCs) were co-cultured with BMSC-sEV in vitro to detect the effects of BMSC-sEV on hPDLCs migration, proliferation and differentiation. The BMSC-sEV loaded by hydrogel was injected into experimental periodontitis rats to verify the therapeutic effect and possible mechanism. The results showed that BMSC-sEV was 30-150 nm vesicles and expressed the exosomes protein CD63 and tumor susceptibility 101 (TSG101), which could promote the migration, proliferation, osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs. The BMSC-sEV-hydrogel had a therapeutic effect on periodontitis rats. After administration for four to eight weeks, micro-CT and histological analysis showed the alveolar bone loss (ABL), inflammatory infiltration and collagen destruction in BMSC-sEV-hydrogel group were less than that in PBS-hydrogel group and periodontitis group.

Online channel-based messaging apps such as Slack offer an opportunity to engage students in remote, multimodal collaborative learning by reproducing a classroom environment in the virtual space. AIM: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and proof of concept for an online Slack community in undergraduate dermatology education. METHODS: Undergraduate medical students participated in an online classroom for a 6-week programme encompassing case-based discussions, seminars and journal clubs. The platform was facilitated by junior doctors (n = 10) and patient educators (n = 6). Students and faculty completed a post-course evaluation. Students additionally completed a pre- and post-intervention dermatology quiz. Mixed methods analyses included quantitative analyses to explore data trends and qualitative phenomenographic analyses to assimilate key underlying themes. RESULTS: Students (n = 65) were enrolled to join the platform. The evaluation was completed by students (n = 52) from UK universities (n = 27). The majority of students (n = 27) interacted with the platform as passive observers (&#8804; 5 active interactions with the channel), with a small group (n = 4) of 'super-users' (&#8805; 100 active interactions).

METHODS: We established two high-throughput employee testing centers in Seattle, Washington with drive-through and walk-through options for symptomatic employees in the University of Washington Medicine system and its affiliated organizations. Using data from these testing centers, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic employees and describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes among employees with COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 12 and April 23, a total of 3,477 symptomatic employees were tested for COVID-19 at two employee testing centers; 185 (5.3%) employees tested positive for COVID-19.

Yet their view rests on an unfounded interpretation of the Geneva Declaration language. More problematically, their paper confuses shared and collective responsibility, misattributing the scope of individual physician obligations in potentially harmful ways. In response, this reply delineates between shared and collective responsibility, and suggests that to defend the obligation of medical outreach Strous and Karni propose, it is better conceptualised as a collective responsibility of the medical profession, rather than a shared responsibility of individual physicians.

However, not all patients benefit from PR to the same extent. This analysis aimed to identify the impact of different factors on PR outcomes in post-COVID-19 patients. Methods: This prospective observational study included 184 post-COVID-19 patients. The achievement of the predicted reference walking distance (6 min walking distance (6-MWD)) served as a parameter with which to identify responders and non-responders to PR. Several parameters (e.g., Functional Independent Measurement (FIM); pulmonary function testing (Forced Vital Capacity, FVC); 6MWD) were assessed in order to estimate their impact on PR success. Logistic regression models and classification and regression trees were used for multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 94 patients (51%) reached their reference 6MWD by the end of PR. FVC (0.95 (0.93C0.97)), 6MWD at admission (0.99 (0.99C1.00)), and FIM motoric (0.96 (0.93C0.99)) correlated with the risk not reaching the reference distance. The most important variable was the 6MWD at admission. Classification and regression tree identified 6MWD  130 m at admission and FVC predicted of >83% as the strongest predictor for reaching predicted 6-MWD. Conclusion: Post-COVID-19 patients with lower 6MWD, lower motoric FIM scores and lower FVC at admission have a high risk of not reaching their target values of physical performance despite intensive rehabilitation.

METHODS: A total of 104 people with MS, including 46 of them with COVID-19 disease history, were enrolled in the study. All patients were evaluated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF), the EuroQoL Instrument (EQ-5D-3L), the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). RESULTS: People with MS in the COVID-19 positive group had a significantly lower IPAQ-Total score (p = 0.014). Besides, the FCV-19S scores of COVID-19 positive patients were significantly higher (p = 0.006). EQ-5D-3L Index and EQ-5D-3L VAS scores were higher in the group with COVID-19 (p(1) = 0.021, p(2) = 0.014, respectively). FCV-19S had a moderate correlation with EDSS (r = -0.362). IPAQ-Total was moderately associated with MS duration, EDSS and FSS (r(1) = -0.471, r(2) = -0.389, r(3) = -0.388, respectively). The EQ-5D-3L Index was moderately correlated with FSS (r(1) = -0.404). There was a weakly significant relationship between EQ-5D-3L Index and BMI, MS duration, PSQI and CAS (r(1) = -0.471, r(2) =-0.389, r(3) = -0.388, r(4) = -0.326, respectively). On the other hand, EQ-5D-3L was moderately associated with VAS and EDSS and PSQI (r(1) = -0.393, r(2) = -0.357, respectively).

Patient-facing progressive web application, clinician dashboard and support website integrate patient-reported outcomes (PROs), self-management resources, structured clinical summary, wearable and home NIV data with asynchronous patient-clinician messaging. We commenced the implementation-effectiveness observational cohort RECEIVER trial in September 2019, with the primary endpoint of sustained patient usage and secondary endpoints including admissions, mortality, exacerbations, service workload and quality of life. We paused recruitment in March 2021 and provided LenusCOPD as routine care in the 'DYNAMIC-SCOT' COVID-19 response service scale-up. Methods 83 RECEIVER trial participants and 142 DYNAMIC-SCOT participants had completed minimum 1 year follow-up when we censored data on 31st August 2021. We established a control cohort with 5 patients matched per RECEIVER participant from de-identified contemporary routine clinical data. Results Sustained patient app utilisation was noted in both cohorts. Median time to admission or death was 43 days in control, 338 days in RECEIVER and 400 days in DYNAMIC-SCOT participants who had had a respiratory-related admission in the preceding year. The 12-month risk of admission or death was 74% in control patients, 53% in RECEIVER and 47% in the DYNAMIC-SCOT sub-cohort participants. There was a median of 2.5 COPD exacerbations per patient per year with stable quality of life across follow up and a manageable workload for clinical users.

Infection may occur with or without evidence of disease. Disease may represent only the tip of the iceberg of infection. Prevalence of disease is the proportion of a defined population that meets specific criteria at a point in time, and incidence refers to the proportion of a defined population in which the onset occurs during a specifiable interval. Risk is an instantaneous rate of incidence. Prevalence, incidence, and risk in infectious diseases are quantitative inferences derived from assessment of implications  caveats derived from variables that often are elusive, such as antibiotic resistance to plasmid mediated determinants transferable between species of enteric bacteria, or such as increases in population density among insect vectors influenced by climatic conditions favorable to the insects. Carefully orchestrated manipulation of the etiologic agent or the host response is made possible by ever-expanding understanding of the molecular biology of pathogenicity on the one hand and cellular and humoral immunity on the other. Such understanding often leads to new caveats or destroys old ones based on incomplete information. This paper deals with a selected limited number of infectious diseases of dairy cattle. Knowledge developed around the cited parameters in 13 infectious diseases during the past quarter century is brought into focus. Ten geographically dispersed specialists in infectious diseases of cattle were asked to identify priorities among the array of transmissible diseases important to North America.

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) induced post-ablation is critical for tumour survival and progression. A combination therapy of thermal ablation and polymer conjugated Hsp90 chemotherapy was designed and evaluated for complete tumour eradication of HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS A thermo-responsive, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-based tri-block biopolymer was developed and conjugated with a potent Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA). The anti-cancer efficacy of conjugates was evaluated in HCC cell cultures with and without hyperthermia (43 C). The conjugates were also administered twice weekly in a murine HCC model as a single treatment or in combination with single electrocautery as the ablation method. RESULTS ELP-GA conjugates displayed enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro and effective heat shock inhibition under hyperthermia. The conjugates alone significantly slowed the tumour growth without systemic toxicity. Four doses of thermo-responsive ELP-GA conjugates with concomitant simple electrocautery accomplished significant Hsp90 inhibition and sustained tumour suppression. CONCLUSION Hsp90 inhibition plays a key role in preventing the recurrence of HCC, and the combination of ablation with targeted therapy holds great potential to improve prognosis and survival of HCC patients.","output":"Tumour eradication using synchronous thermal ablation and Hsp90 chemotherapy with protein engineered triblock biopolymer-geldanamycin conjugates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus, also known as COVID19, is a dangerous disease that has put many people's lives in jeopardy around the world by damaging the lungs directly.

Lower respiratory tract infections such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are the main current causes of mortality worldwide. Several scores and biomarkers have been proposed to identify patients at risk of dying, with unclear results. Presepsin is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of the membrane of monocytes and macrophages and its utility has been proven in sepsis as a predictor of severity and treatment response. However, it is unknown the utility of this biomarker as a mortality predictor among COVID-19 and CAP patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the utility of serum presepsin to identify patients at risk of dying due to COVID-19 and CAP. Methods. A prospective observational study was conducted at Clinica Universidad de La Sabana, Colombia. We included 240 patients who required hospital admission due to CAP or COVID-19. Plasma samples were collected within 24 hours of admission. The presepsin concentration was quantified using the PATHFAST system. Afterwards, a two-tailed test was used to compare mortality rates among patients and their presepsin plasma concentration. Lastly, the ROC was calculated to determine presepsin's sensibility as a mortality predictor. Results. A total of 88 patients with CAP and 152 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. The median [with IQR] in Presepsin plasma concentration was higher in all patients who died (920 [573 - 2340] vs 573 [307,5 - 1052,5], p-value< 0.0001). Furthermore, comparing to the study group, the median concentration of presepsin was higher in patients deceased by COVID-19 than those who survived. (1358 [642,8 - 2976,8] vs 570 [333,2 - 1007,5], p-value< 0.0001). In addition, the area under the curve (AUC) ROC of presepsin to predict risk of mortality was 0.769. DeLong's test comparing ROC curves in COVID-19 and CAP patients had a p-value=0.073. Conclusion. Plasma concentrations of presepsin plasma were higher among COVID-19 patients who died. Moreover, serum concentration of presepsin were not useful to identify CAP patients at risk of dying. However, practical use of Presepsin as a prognostic biomarker of severity is yet to be assessed as further studies are needed.","output":"Presepsin as a Prognostic Biomarker for Mortality in COVID-19 Patients vs Community-Adquired Pneumonia (CAP) Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Complete COVID-19 data for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are critical to equitable pandemic response.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients with locally advanced ESCC who were treated with NAC followed by radical resection were prospectively enrolled from September 2015 to May 2018. MRI and IVIM were performed within 1 week before and 2-3 weeks after NAC, prior to surgery. Parameters including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), true diffusion coefficient (D), pseudodiffusion coefficient (D*), and pseudodiffusion fraction (f) before and after NAC were measured. Pathologic response was evaluated according to the AJCC tumor regression grade (TRG) system. The changes in IVIM values before and after therapy in different TRG groups were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was used to determine the best cutoff value for predicting the pathologic response to NAC. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were identified as TRG 2 (responders), and eighteen as TRG 3 (non-responders) in pathologic evaluation. The ADC, D, and f values increased significantly after NAC. The post-NAC D and &#916;D values of responders were significantly higher than those of non-responders. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.722 for post-NAC D and 0.859 for &#916;D in predicting pathologic response.

Mental health care for health care workers (HCWs), should receive serious consideration. The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes of HCWs and to examine known predictors of outcomes during the first pandemic wave. METHODS: 1,556 HCWs who participated in the COVID-19 IMPACT project, an international online survey examining the behavioral and psychological impacts of COVID-19 among 9,565 people from 78 countries/regions and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression symptoms and sleep changes. Predictors examined included sociodemographic factors, and perceived social support. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that, half of the HCWs had moderate levels of perceived stress and depression symptoms. Predictors associated with higher HCWs stress and depression symptoms included female gender, not having children, living with parents, lower educational background and having lower social support. Half of the HCWs (n = 800, 51.4%) continued to sleep about the same and one in four slept more or slept less. Positive predictors of sleep changes were being older, widower, not working, living with parents, and having children. Surprisingly, HCWs had less perceived stress and depression and higher levels of perceived social support than the general population.

The development of hypofractionation practices in recent years tends to increase the workload of the stages of preparation for irradiation and to decrease the number of fractions per patient. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze the evolution of these practices in a single centre and to assess the organizational issues involved. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All radiation therapy records management data were extracted from the Radiation Therapy Information System. Radiotherapy sessions were identified by patient and by ICD (International Classification of Diseases) code. The filling rate of the treatment equipment was calculated using actual data from the radiotherapy department. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of scans (+16%), the number of patients treated (+11.6%) and the volume of hours available for treatment (+12%). Also, there was a decrease in the total number of fractions (?5%), in the average number of fractions performed per treatment sequence (?19%), in the occupancy rate of the machines (?7%) and in the average number of fractions performed per patient treated for malignant tumours of the bronchi and lung (?38%), digestive organs (?37%), secondary (?19%) breast (?15%) and prostate (?15%). The number of fractions administered per treatment sequence between 2015 and 2019 decreased significantly for patients in age groups [20C69] (P < 0.001) and [> 70] (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A paradox appears between the increase in the total number of patients treated and the decrease in the loading rate of linacs. This shift of workload has an impact on the quality and safety of care and on the organizational and investment strategies. It also has an economic impact where the model of reimbursement is based on per fraction pricing.

Since then, the outbreak has indeed spread across all continents, threatening the public health of numerous countries. Although the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of COVID-19 is relatively low when optimal level of healthcare is granted to the patients, the high percentage of severe cases developing severe pneumonia and thus requiring respiratory support is worryingly high, and could lead to a rapid saturation of Intensive Care Units (ICUs). To overcome this risk, most countries enacted COVID-19 containment measures. In this study, we use a Bayesian SEIR epidemiological model to perform a parametric regression over the COVID-19 outbreaks data in China, Italy, Belgium, and Spain, and estimate the effect of the containment measures on the basic reproduction ratio R_0. We find that the effect of these measures is detectable, but tends to be gradual, and that a progressive strengthening of these measures usually reduces the R_0 below 1, granting a decay of the outbreak. We also discuss the biases and inconsistencies present in the publicly available data on COVID-19 cases, providing an estimate for the actual number of cases in Italy on March 12, 2020.

It has a broad spectrum of antibacterial actions against a wide range of bacteria, even those resistant to antibiotics. Curcumin has been shown to be effective against the microorganisms that are responsible for surgical infections and implant-related bone infections, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The efficacy of curcumin against Helicobacter pylori and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, alone or in combination with other classic antibiotics, is one of its most promising antibacterial effects. Curcumin is known to have antifungal action against numerous fungi that are responsible for a variety of infections, including dermatophytosis. Candidemia and candidiasis caused by Candida species have also been reported to be treated using curcumin. Life-threatening diseases and infections caused by viruses can be counteracted by curcumin, recognizing its antiviral potential. In combination therapy with other phytochemicals, curcumin shows synergistic effects, and this approach appears to be suitable for the eradication of antibiotic-resistant microbes and promising for achieving co-loaded antimicrobial pro-regenerative coatings for orthopedic implant biomaterials. Poor water solubility, low bioavailability, and rapid degradation are the main disadvantages of curcumin.

The severity of COVID-19 is highly variable and related to known (e.g., age, obesity, immune deficiency) and unknown risk factors. The widespread clinical symptoms encompass a large group of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, raising a crucial question regarding genetic susceptibility, e.g., whether individual differences in immunity play a role in patient symptomatology and how much human leukocyte antigen (HLA) contributes to this. To reveal genetic determinants of susceptibility to COVID-19 severity in the population and further explore potential immune-related factors, we performed a genome-wide association study on 284 confirmed COVID-19 patients (cases) and 95 healthy individuals (controls). We compared cases and controls of European (EUR) ancestry and African American (AFR) ancestry separately. We identified two loci on chromosomes 5q32 and 11p12, which reach the significance threshold of suggestive association (p<1x10-5 threshold adjusted for multiple trait testing) and are associated with the COVID-19 susceptibility in the European ancestry (index rs17448496: odds ratio [OR] = 0.173; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.36 for G allele; p=5.15x 10-5 and index rs768632395: OR = 0.166; 95% CI, 0.07-0.35 for A allele; p= 4.25x10-6, respectively), which were associated with two genes, PPP2R2B at 5q32, and LRRC4C at 11p12, respectively. To explore the linkage between HLA and COVID-19 severity, we applied fine-mapping analysis to dissect the HLA association with mild and severe cases. Using In-silico binding predictions to map the binding of risk/protective HLA to the viral structural proteins, we found the differential presentation of viral peptides in both ancestries. Lastly, extrapolation of the identified HLA from the cohort to the worldwide population revealed notable correlations.

These phenomena are particularly dangerous in internet-based public health surveillance where traditional mitigation and adjustment methods are inapplicable, unavailable, or out of date. Recent theoretical advances in causal modeling can mitigate these threats, but these innovations have not been widely deployed in the epidemiological community. OBJECTIVE The purpose of our paper is to demonstrate the practical utility of causal modeling to both detect unmeasured confounding and selection bias and also guide model selection to minimize bias. We implement this approach in an applied epidemiological study of COVID-19 cumulative infection rate in the New York City Spring 2020 epidemic. METHODS We collected primary data from Qualtrics surveys of Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd workers residing in New Jersey and New York state across two sampling periods; April 11-14th and May 8-11th 2020. The surveys queried the subjects on household health status and demographic characteristics. We constructed a set of possible causal models of household infection and survey selection mechanisms and ranked them by compatibility with the collected survey data. The most compatible causal model was then used to estimate the cumulative infection rate in each survey period. RESULTS There were 527 and 513 responses collected for each period. Response demographics were highly skewed toward younger age in both survey periods. Despite the extremely strong relationship between age and COVID-19 symptoms we recovered minimally biased estimates of cumulative infection rate using only primary data and the most compatible causal model, with a relative bias of +3.8% and -1.9% from the reported cumulative infection rate for the first and second survey periods. CONCLUSIONS We successfully recovered accurate estimates of cumulative infection rate from an internet-based crowd sourced sample despite considerable selection bias and unmeasured confounding in the primary data. This implementation demonstrates how simple applications of structural causal modeling can be effectively used to determine falsifiable model conditions, detect selection bias and confounding factors, and minimize estimate bias through model selection in a novel epidemiological context.

Design: Cross-sectional online survey. Setting: Nationally representative survey in the UK, conducted on the 3rd of August 2021. Participants: Responses from 534 participants, aged 18 and older, residents of the UK. Interventions: This was a cross-sectional survey and each participant replied to the same set of questions. Primary outcome measure and independent variables: The primary outcome measure (dependent variable) was the participants' perceived importance of using immunity certificates, computed as an index of six items. The following individual drivers were used as the independent variables: a) personal beliefs about COVID-19 (using constructs adapted from the Health Belief Model), b) personal views on vaccination, c) willingness to share immunity status with service providers, and d) variables related to respondents' lifestyle and socio-demographic characteristics. Results: Perceived importance of immunity certificates was higher among respondents who felt that contracting COVID-19 would have a severe negative impact on their health ({beta}=0.2564, p=0.0000) and felt safer if vaccinated ({beta}=0.1552, p=0.0000). The prospect of future economic recovery positively influenced perceived importance of immunity certificates.

The primary outcome was a visit to a primary care physician or a psychiatrist for any mental disorder. We stratified analyses by maternal sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In March 2020, the visit rate was 43.5/1000, with a rate difference of 3.11/1000 (95% CI 1.25-4.89) and an IRR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13) compared with the expected rate. In April, the rate difference (10.9/1000, 95% CI 9.14-12.6) and IRR (1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.36) were higher; this level was generally sustained through November 2020. From April-November, we observed elevated visit rates across provider types and for diagnoses of anxiety, depressive and alcohol or substance use disorders. Observed increases from expected visit rates were greater for people 0-90 days postpartum compared with 91-365 days postpartum; increases were small among people living in low-income neighbourhoods. Public health units in the northern areas of the province did not see sustained elevations in visit rates after July; southern health units had elevated rates through to November. INTERPRETATION: Increased visits for mental health conditions among postpartum people during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic suggest an increased need for effective and accessible mental health care for this population as the pandemic progresses.","output":"Postpartum mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based, repeated cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Observational knowledge of the epidemic intensity, defined as the number of deaths divided by global population and epidemic duration, and of the rate of emergence of infectious disease outbreaks is necessary to test theory and models and to inform public health risk assessment by quantifying the probability of extreme pandemics such as COVID-19. Despite its significance, assembling and analyzing a comprehensive global historical record spanning a variety of diseases remains an unexplored task. A global dataset of historical epidemics from 1600 to present is here compiled and examined using novel statistical methods to estimate the yearly probability of occurrence of extreme epidemics. Historical observations covering four orders of magnitude of epidemic intensity follow a common probability distribution with a slowly decaying power-law tail (generalized Pareto distribution, asymptotic exponent = -0.71). The yearly number of epidemics varies ninefold and shows systematic trends. Yearly occurrence probabilities of extreme epidemics, Py, vary widely: Py of an event with the intensity of the \\"Spanish influenza\\" (1918 to 1920) varies between 0.27 and 1.9% from 1600 to present, while its mean recurrence time today is 400 y (95% CI: 332 to 489 y). The slow decay of probability with epidemic intensity implies that extreme epidemics are relatively likely, a property previously undetected due to short observational records and stationary analysis methods. Using recent estimates of the rate of increase in disease emergence from zoonotic reservoirs associated with environmental change, we estimate that the yearly probability of occurrence of extreme epidemics can increase up to threefold in the coming decades.","output":"Intensity and frequency of extreme novel epidemics."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health challenge and provides an opportunity to investigate the unclear relationship between risk perception, social support, and mental health. This study aims to examine the association between risk perception and mental health while taking social support as a moderator. Methods: An online cross-sectional study recruiting 2993 participants was conducted in China, from 1st to 10th, February 2020. The relationship between risk perception, social support, and mental health was examined using multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: This study indicated that risk perception was associated with a higher level of mental health symptoms.

Many studies have shown that the severity of COVID-19 is lower in pediatric populations. It is important to determine why infants and young children are not severely affected by COVID-19. By increasing our awareness of this disease, we can prioritize our limited health resources. Several theories have been proposed to explain such significant differences between the pediatric and adult populations with COVID-19. Some of them are: (1) the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2);(2) cross-immunity with other severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like viruses;(3) obtunded systemic inflammatory response in children;(4) more efficient T cells in them;(5) interactions of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other viruses in the mucosa of the lungs and airways;and (6) a hypothesis that COVID-19 proteins onslaught the heme on the -1 chain of hemoglobin.

Currently, the COVID-19 vaccine has been used in many countries, but it is still unable to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, despite patients receiving full vaccination doses. Therefore, we aimed to appraise the booster effect of the different platforms of vaccines, including inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), viral vector vaccine (AZD122), and mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2), in healthy adults who received the full dose of inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). The booster dose was safe with no serious adverse events. Moreover, the immunogenicity indicated that the booster dose with viral vector and mRNA vaccine achieved a significant proportion of Ig anti-receptor binding domain (RBD), IgG anti-RBD, and IgA anti-S1 booster response. In contrast, inactivated vaccine achieved a lower booster response than others. Consequently, the neutralization activity of vaccinated serum had a high inhibition of over 90% against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and their variants (B.1.1.7Calpha, B.1.351Cbeta, and B.1.617.2Cdelta). In addition, IgG anti-nucleocapsid was observed only among the group that received the BBIBP booster.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors associated with EMS refusal in relation to COVID-19 cases, public health interventions, EMS responses, and prehospital deaths. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Detroit, Michigan, from March 1 to June 30, 2020. Emergency medical services responses geocoded to Census tracts were analyzed by individuals age, sex, date, and community resilience using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index. Response counts were adjusted with Poisson regression, and odds of refusals and deaths were adjusted by logistic regression. EXPOSURES: A COVID-19 outbreak characterized by a peak in local COVID-19 incidence and the strictest stay-at-home orders to date, followed by a nadir in incidence and broadly lifted restrictions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multivariable-adjusted difference in 2020 vs 2019 responses by incidence rate and refusals or deaths by odds. The Social Vulnerability Index was used to capture community social determinants of health as a risk factor for death or refusal. The index contains 4 domain subscores; possible overall score is 0 to 15, with higher scores indicating greater vulnerability. RESULTS: A total of 80 487 EMS responses with intended ED transport, 2059 prehospital deaths, and 16 064 refusals (62 636 completed EMS to ED transports) from 334 Census tracts were noted during the study period. Of the cohort analyzed, 38 621 were women (48%); mean (SD) age was 49.0 (21.4) years, and mean (SD) Social Vulnerability Index score was 9.6 (1.6). Tracts with the highest per-population EMS transport refusal rates were characterized by higher unemployment, minority race/ethnicity, single-parent households, poverty, disability, lack of vehicle access, and overall Social Vulnerability Index score (9.6 vs 9.0, P = .002). At peak COVID-19 incidence and maximal stay-at-home orders, there were higher total responses (adjusted incident rate ratio [aIRR], 1.07; 1.03-1.12), odds of deaths (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.60; 95% CI, 1.20-2.12), and refusals (aOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 2.09-2.60) but fewer completed ED transports (aIRR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78-0.86). With public health restrictions lifted and the nadir of COVID-19 cases, responses (aIRR, 1.01; 0.97-1.05) and deaths (aOR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.81-1.41) returned to 2019 baselines, but differences in refusals (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14-1.41) and completed transports (aIRR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.99) remained.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, EMS transport refusals increased with the COVID-19 outbreaks peak and remained elevated despite receding public health restrictions, COVID-19 incidence, total EMS responses, and prehospital deaths. Voluntary refusal was associated with decreased EMS transports to EDs, disproportionately so among women and vulnerable communities.","output":"Factors Associated With Voluntary Refusal of Emergency Medical System Transport for Emergency Care in Detroit During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is first-line treatment for urinary incontinence (UI) in women. Self-management via a mobile app is a new cost-effective method for PFMT delivery. This study analyzes factors associated with improvement among app users. METHODS: A pragmatic observational study in a community setting. Upon downloading the app T?t?, users answered questions regarding their age, education, residence, and UI symptoms. After 3 months, users answered follow-up questions regarding symptoms and frequency of training and app usage, and the validated Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) questionnaire. Only non-pregnant, non-postpartum adult women with UI who answered the PGI-I questionnaire were included. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze possible associations between these factors with any improvement and with great improvement according to the PGI-I. The models were adjusted for age. RESULTS: The study included 2,153 participants who had completed self-management, that is, 11.5% of eligible women who completed the baseline questionnaire. Of these participants, 65.6% reported improvement of UI. Any improvement was associated with age, frequency of PFMT, and app use, accounting for 27.9% of variability (Nagelkerke R(2)). Lower incontinence severity, frequency of PFMT, and app use were associated with great improvement. CONCLUSION: Self-management of urinary incontinence is easily accessible to many women and improvement rates are comparable with other forms of PFMT. Demographic factors and incontinence severity showed no or incongruent association, whereas regular PFMT and app use predicted any and great improvement. App use showed an additional effect beyond frequency of training.","output":"Self-management of incontinence using a free mobile app: factors associated with improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Murray Valley encephalitis virus is a member of the flavivirus group, a large family of single\\\\stranded RNA viruses, which cause serious disease in all regions of the world.

METHODS Fever characteristics were analyzed in 584 consecutive patients with aSAH. Fever was defined as core body temperature 38.3 C on 2 consecutive days. Subfebrile measurements were those between 37 and 38.2 C. Febrile and subfebrile loads were the number of hours with fever or subfebrile measurements, respectively. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were developed to define predictors of outcome using various categorizations of fever cause, severity, and duration. RESULTS Febrile measurements were observed in 281/584 (48.1 %) patients, recurring over a mean duration of 2.1  3.0 days. Early fever within 24 and 72 h was encountered in 69 (11.9 %) and 110 (18.9 %) of patients, respectively. An infectious source was discovered in 126 (44.8 %) febrile patients. On univariate analysis, days of fever, febrile load, and fever onset within 24 and 72 h were associated with poor outcome (all p < 0.001); but subfebrile load was not (p = 0.56). On multivariate model constructed with all variables associated with outcome on univariate analyses, days of fever remained independently associated with poor outcome (OR 1.14 of poor outcome per day of fever, 95 % CI 1.06-1.22; p = 0.0006) displacing all other fever measures from the final model. CONCLUSIONS Early onset of fever, number of hours with fever, and especially days of fever are associated with poor functional outcome. Conversely, subfebrile load does not influence clinical outcome.

A significant decrease in asthma exacerbations has been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a unique opportunity to study how major asthma triggers correlate with asthma activity. Objective To determine whether changes in respiratory viruses, air pollutants, and/or aeroallergens during the COVID-19 pandemic were concomitant with decreased asthma exacerbations. Methods Health care utilization and respiratory viral testing data between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2020 were extracted from the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Care Networks electronic health record. Air pollution and allergen data were extracted from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency public databases and a National Allergy Bureau-certified station, respectively. Pandemic data (2020) were compared to historical data. Results Recovery of in-person asthma encounters during phased re-opening (June 6th C November 15th, 2020) was uneven: primary care well and specialty encounters reached 94% and 74% of pre-pandemic levels, respectively, while primary care sick and hospital encounters reached 21% and 40% of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. During the pandemic, influenza A and influenza B decreased to negligible frequency when compared to pre-pandemic cases, while RSV and rhinovirus infections decreased to low (though non-negligible) pre-pandemic levels, as well. No changes in air pollution or aeroallergen levels relative to historical observations were noted.

In AprilCMay 2020, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 5517 members of the University of Southern Californias Understanding America Study.

Overall, Democrats perceived more risk associated with COVID-19 than Republicans, including for getting infected, being hospitalized and dying if infected, as well as running out of money as a result of the pandemic. Democrats were also more likely than Republicans to express concerns that states would lift economic restrictions too quickly, and to report mask use and social distancing.

Three retrospective cohort studies utilized the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to assess the impact of frailty on perioperative outcomes in hysterectomies and pelvic organ prolapse repair procedures. One retrospective cohort study utilized a California database to assess frailty in prolapse repair surgeries. One cross-sectional study assessed frailty in new urogynecology patient visits. Four of these studies found that preoperative frailty is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. Overall, the evidence from the included studies is of low quality and at moderate to critical risk of bias.

In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish the National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations to regular ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACIM) visits and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during a time when face-to-face contact should be limited. METHODS Teleconsultations in the ACIM were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). Prior to planned visits physicians made phone calls and interviewed the patient about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation. RESULTS Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020). Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact. In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pooled prevalence of myocarditis and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was 14.0% (95% CI 11.6%C16.8%) and 20.5% (95% CI 17.7%C23.6%), respectively. Further, heterogeneity was observed (I(2) > 50%, p < 0.1). In the subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence of abnormal CMR findings and myocarditis was higher in non-athletes than in athletes (62.5% vs. 17.1% and 23.9% vs. 2.5%, respectively). Similarly, the pooled prevalence of abnormal CMR findings and LGE was higher in the undetermined than in the normal cardiac enzyme level subgroup (59.4% vs. 35.9% and 45.5% vs. 8.3%, respectively). Being an athlete was a significant independent factor related to heterogeneity in multivariate meta-regression analysis (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of recovered COVID-19 patients exhibited one or more abnormal CMR findings. Athletes and patients with normal cardiac enzyme levels showed a lower prevalence of abnormal CMR findings than non-athletes and patients with undetermined cardiac enzyme levels.

Methods After excluding the first 30 days since the announcement of an index case in a country, relevant data for the next forty days was collected from four countries: Belgium, Italy, South Korea and United Kingdom. Two online databases: Our World in Data and worldometer were used for the collection of data which included the number of new COVID-19 cases and the number of tests conducted on a given day. The acquired figures were transformed into per million population of the given country. The growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases was derived and was used as the regress and in a multiple linear regression with the number of tests per million population per day and the number of days since a lock-down was imposed as the regressors. Results It was found that the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases decreased by .051% when the number of daily tests conducted per million population increased by 1. A .532% decrease in the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases was observed with each passing day of a lock-down, which essentially represented the most effective form of social distancing. A significant regression was calculated (F (2, 155) = 35.191, p=.014), with an R2 of .054. Neither the daily number of tests conducted per million population nor the number of days of maintaining social distancing (lock-down) was individually significant contributors to the prediction of the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases (p=.267 and p=.554 respectively). Conclusion An extensive and rapid increase in the daily number of testing capacity and maintaining social distancing can decrease the growth rate of daily COVID-19 cases. Depending on the availability of the required resources, timely implementation of these measures can lead to better outcomes for a given population.","output":"Estimating The Possible Role Of Testing Capacity And Social Distancing In Predicting The Growth Rate Of Daily Covid-19 Cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is a widespread pathogen in European aquaculture of salmonid fish. Distinct viral subtypes have been suggested based on sequence comparisons and some of these have different geographical distributions. In Norway, only SAV subtype 3 have so far been identified. Little is known about viral mechanisms important for pathogenesis and transmission. Tools for detailed exploration of SAV genomes are therefore needed. RESULTS: Infectious cDNA clones in which a genome of subtype 3 SAV is under the control of a CMV promoter were constructed. The clones were designed to express proteins that are putatively identical to those previously reported for the SAVH20/03 strain. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a part of the E2 glycoprotein in order to detect expression of the subgenomic open reading frame (ORF) encoding structural viral proteins. Transfection of the cDNA clone revealed the expression of the E2 protein by IFAT, and in serial passages of the supernatant the presence of infectious recombinant virus was confirmed through RT-PCR, IFAT and the development of a cytopathic effect similar to that seen during infection with wild type SAV. Confirmation that the recovered virus originated from the infectious plasmid was done by sequence identification of an introduced genetic tag. The recombinant virus was infectious also when an additional ORF encoding an EGFP reporter gene under the control of a second subgenomic alphavirus promoter was added. Finally, we used the system to study the effect of selected point mutations on infectivity in Chinook salmon embryo cells. While introduced mutations in nsP2(197), nsP3(263 )and nsP3(323 )severely reduced infectivity, a serine to proline mutation in E2(206 )appeared to enhance the virus titer production.

To eliminate the need for in-person contact for vital sign measurement in the hospital setting, we developed Dr. Spot, a mobile quadruped robotic system. The system includes IR and RGB cameras for vital sign monitoring and a tablet computer for face-to-face medical interviewing. Dr. Spot is teleoperated by trained clinical staff to simultaneously measure the skin temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate while maintaining social distancing from patients and without removing their mask. To enable accurate, contactless measurements on a mobile system without a static black body as reference, we propose novel methods for skin temperature compensation and respiratory rate measurement at various distances between the subject and the cameras, up to 5 m. Without compensation, the skin temperature MAE is 1.3C. Using the proposed compensation method, the skin temperature MAE is reduced to 0.3C. The respiratory rate method can provide continuous monitoring with a MAE of 1.6 BPM in 30 s or rapid screening with a MAE of 2.1 BPM in 10 s.

Dengue and COVID-19, to some extent, have similar clinical and laboratory features, which can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment and patient's isolation. The use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) is easy and convenient for fast diagnosis, however there may be issues with cross-reactivity with antibodies for other pathogens. METHODS: We assessed the possibility of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and dengue antibodies by: (1) testing five brands of COVID-19 IgG / IgM RDTs on 60 RT-PCR-confirmed dengue samples; (2) testing 95 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples on dengue RDT; and (3) testing samples positive for COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM on dengue RDT. RESULTS: We observed a high specificity across all five brands of COVID-19 RDTs, ranging from 98.3 to 100%. Out of the confirmed COVID-19 samples, one patient tested positive for dengue IgM only, another tested positive for dengue IgG only. One patient tested positive for dengue IgG, IgM, and NS1, suggesting a co-infection. In COVID-19 IgG and/or IgM samples, 6.3% of COVID-19 IgG-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG, while 21.1% of COVID-19 IgM-positive samples also tested positive for dengue IgG. CONCLUSION: Despite the high specificity of the COVID-19 RDT, we observed cross-reactions and false-positive results between dengue and COVID-19. Dengue and COVID-19 co-infection was also found.

This requires setting up testing centres for diagnosis of the infected individuals, which usually involves movement of either patient from their residence to the testing centre or personnel visiting the patient, thus aggregating the risk of transmission to localities and testing centres. The purpose of this paper is to investigate and minimize such movements by developing a drone assisted sample collection and diagnostic system. Design/methodology/approach: Effective control of an epidemic outbreak calls for a rapid response and involves testing suspected individuals and isolating them to avoid transmission in the community. This paper presents the problem in a two-phase manner by locating sample collection centres while assigning neighbourhoods to these collection centres and thereafter, assigning collection centres to nearest testing centres. To solve the mathematical model, this study develops a mixed-integer linear programming model and propose an integrated genetic algorithm with a local search-based approach (GA-LS) to solve the problem. Findings: Proposed approach is demonstrated as a case problem in an Indian urban city named Kolkata. Computational results show that the integrated GA-LS approach is capable of producing good quality solutions within a short span of time, which aids to the practicality in the circumstance of a pandemic. Social implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the large-scale outbreak of a transmissible disease may require a restriction of movement to take control of the exponential transmission. This paper proposes a system for the location of clinical sample collection centres in such a way that drones can be used for the transportation of samples from the neighbourhood to the testing centres. Originality/value: Epidemic outbreaks have been a reason behind a major number of deaths across the world. The present study addresses the critical issue of identifying locations of temporary sample collection centres for drone assisted testing in major cities, which is by its nature unique and has not been considered by any other previous literature.

The multiple pathways of exposure included hand contact via contaminated surfaces and an HCWs fingers with droplets, droplet spray, and inhalation of inspirable and respirable particles. We assumed a scenario of medium contact time (MCT) and long contact time (LCT) over 1 day of care by an HCW. SARS-CoV-2 in the particles emitted by coughing, breathing, and vocalization (only in the LCT scenario) by the patient were considered. The contribution of the risk of infection of an HCW by SARS-CoV-2 from each pathway to the sum of the risks from all pathways depended on virus concentration in the saliva of the patient. At a virus concentration in the saliva of 101C105 PFU mL?1 concentration in the MCT scenario and 101C104 PFU mL?1 concentration in the LCT scenario, droplet spraying was the major pathway (60%C86%) of infection, followed by hand contact via contaminated surfaces (9%C32%). At a high virus concentration in the saliva (106C108 PFU mL?1 in the MCT scenario and 105C108 PFU mL?1 in the LCT scenario), hand contact via contaminated surfaces was the main contributor (41%C83%) to infection. The contribution of inhalation of inspirable particles was 4%C10% in all assumed cases. The contribution of inhalation of respirable particles increased as the virus concentration in the saliva increased, and reached 5%C27% at the high saliva concentration (107 and 108 PFU mL?1) in the assumed scenarios using higher doseCresponse function parameter (0.246) and comparable to other pathways, although these were worst and rare cases. Regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions, the relative risk (RR) of an overall risk for an HCW with an intervention vs. an HCW without intervention was 0.36C0.37, 0.02C0.03, and <4.0  10?4 for a face mask, a face shield, and a face mask plus shield, respectively, in the likely median virus concentration in the saliva (102C104 PFU mL?1), suggesting that personal protective equipment decreased the infection risk by 63%C>99.9%.

Therefore, by modeling multiple pathways of exposure, the contribution of the infection risk from each pathway and the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 were indicated quantitatively, and the importance of the use of a face mask and shield was confirmed.","output":"Assessing the risk of COVID-19 from multiple pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2: modeling in health-care settings and effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in early 2020 At the beginning of February, a public welfare activity in epidemic data visualization, jointly launched by China Computer Federation CCF CAD & CG Technical Committee, Alibaba Cloud Tianch, JiqiZhixin, Alibaba Cloud DataV, and DataWhale, was launched with the theme Fighting the Epidemic with One Mind and Talents like Tianchi  Developers in general are expected to focus on several demand scenarios, such as epidemic situation display, epidemic popular science, trend prediction, material-supply situation, and rework and return situation of employees from all sectors and areas, to discover the relationship between complex heterogeneous multi-source data, develop various upbeat works and present useful information to the public in a coherent manner The entry works take the form of data visualization and are divided into two categories: popular science publicity and application scenarios The popular science publicity category includes works for the public, focused on epidemic situation display, epidemic popular science publicity, epidemic prevention and control, and others The application scenario category consists of the works of frontline officers, which can provide anti-epidemic workers with effective data tools for efficient and intuitive epidemic analysis;offer reliable, understandable, and easily transmitted information for disease prevention;and assist governments, enterprises, and institutions in the fight against COVID-19","output":"COVID-19 data visualization public welfare activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19), which began as an epidemic in China and spread globally as a pandemic, has necessitated resource management to meet emergency needs of Covid-19 patients and other emergent cases.

METHODS: We constructed a questionnaire to survey a snapshot of neurosurgical activity, resources, and indications during 1 week with usual activity in December 2019 and 1 week during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in March 2020. The questionnaire was sent to 34 neurosurgical departments in Europe; 25 departments returned responses within 5 days. RESULTS: We found unexpectedly large differences in resources and indications already before the pandemic. Differences were also large in how much practice and resources changed during the pandemic. Neurosurgical beds and neuro-intensive care beds were significantly decreased from December 2019 to March 2020. The utilization of resources decreased via less demand for care of brain injuries and subarachnoid hemorrhage, postponing surgery and changed surgical indications as a method of rationing resources. Twenty departments (80%) reduced activity extensively, and the same proportion stated that they were no longer able to provide care according to legitimate medical needs. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical centers responded swiftly and effectively to a sudden decrease of neurosurgical capacity due to relocation of resources to pandemic care. The pandemic led to rationing of neurosurgical care in 80% of responding centers. We saw a relation between resources before the pandemic and ability to uphold neurosurgical services. The observation of extensive differences of available beds provided an opportunity to show how resources that had been restricted already under normal conditions translated to rationing of care that may not be acceptable to the public of seemingly affluent European countries.","output":"A snapshot of European neurosurgery December 2019 vs. March 2020: just before and during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by governments to contain it have affected many aspects of the daily lives of citizens.

METHODS: A sample of 851 people from the Netherlands who had paid work ( 24 h/week) and worked at least 4 hours per week extra at home because of lockdown measures completed a questionnaire during the first COVID-19 lockdown (April 2020). Respondents reported time spent on paid and unpaid work and leisure before and during the lockdown. Productivity was measured in terms of quantity and quality of paid work.

Sources were thematically synthesised against an adapted version of the UK Governments Pandemic Flu Ethical Framework to identify underpinning ethical principles. The strength of normative engagement and the quality of the sources were also assessed. SETTING: NHS maternity and paediatric surgery services in England. RESULTS: Searches conducted 8 SeptemberC12 October 2020, and updated in March 2021, identified 48 sources meeting the inclusion criteria. Themes that arose include: staff safety; collaborative working C including mutual dependencies across the healthcare system; reciprocity; and inclusivity in service recovery, for example, by addressing inequalities in service access. Embedded in the theme of staff and patient safety is embracing new ways of working, such as the rapid roll out of telemedicine. On assessment, many sources did not explicitly consider how ethical principles might be applied or balanced against one another. Weaknesses in the policy sources included a lack of public and user involvement and the absence of monitoring and evaluation criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that relationality is a prominent ethical principle informing resetting NHS non-COVID-19 paediatric surgery and maternity services. Sources explicitly highlight the ethical importance of seeking to minimise disruption to caring and dependent relationships, while simultaneously attending to public safety. Engagement with ethical principles was ethics-lite, with sources mentioning principles in passing rather than explicitly applying them.

Lactic acid, a byproduct of glucose metabolism, is abundantly present in inflamed tissues and has been shown to regulate functions of several immune cells. Because the endogenous ligands for MRGPRX2 (substance P and LL-37) are elevated during pathologic conditions, such as cancer and asthma, and given that lactic acid levels are also enhanced in these patients, we explored the role of lactic acid in regulating mast cells response via MRGPRX2 and MrgprB2, the mouse orthologue of the human receptor. We found that lactic acid suppressed both the early (Ca2+ mobilization and degranulation) and late (chemokine/cytokine release) phases of mast cell activation; this data was confirmed in LAD2, human skin and mouse peritoneal mast cells. In LAD2 cells, the reduction in degranulation and chemokine/cytokine production mediated by lactic acid was dependent on pH. In agreement with our in vitro studies, lactic acid also reduced passive systemic anaphylaxis to compound 48/80 (a known MRGPRX2/MrgprB2 ligand) and skin inflammation in a mouse model of rosacea that is dependent on MrgprB2 expression on skin mast cells.

GTases are members of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily, which also includes DNA and RNA ligases. GTases catalyze a two-step reaction in which they initially utilize GTP as a substrate to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The GMP moiety is then transferred to the diphosphate end of the RNA transcript in the second step of the reaction to form the Gppp-RNA structure. In the current study, we used a combination of virtual database screening, homology modeling, and biochemical assays to search for novel GTase inhibitors. Using this approach, we demonstrate that mycophenolic acid (MPA) can inhibit the GTase reaction by preventing the catalytic transfer of the GMP moiety onto an acceptor RNA. As such, MPA represents a novel type of inhibitor against RNA guanylyltransferases that inhibits the second step of the catalytic reaction. Moreover, we show that the addition of MPA to S. cerevisiae cells leads to a reduction of capped mRNAs. Finally, biochemical assays also demonstrate that MPA can inhibit DNA ligases through inhibition of the second step of the reaction. The biological implications of these findings for the MPA-mediated inhibition of members of the covalent nucleotidyl superfamily are discussed.","output":"Virtual High-Throughput Screening Identifies Mycophenolic Acid as a Novel RNA Capping Inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to assess physical fitness and its relationship with functional dyspnea in survivors of COVID-19 6 months after their discharge from the hospital. METHODS: Data collected routinely from people referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) following hospitalization for COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Persistent dyspnea was assessed using the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. RESULTS: Twenty-three people with persistent symptoms were referred for CPET. Mean modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score was 1 (SD = 1) and was significantly associated with peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak; %) (rho = -0.49). At 6 months, those hospitalized in the general ward had a relatively preserved VO2peak (87% [SD = 20]), whereas those who had been in the intensive care unit had a moderately reduced VO2peak (77% [SD = 15]). Of note, the results of the CPET revealed that, in all individuals, respiratory equivalents were high, power-to-weight ratios were low, and those who had been in the intensive care unit had a relatively low ventilatory efficiency (mean VE/VCO2 slope = 34 [SD = 5]). Analysis of each individual showed that none had a breathing reserve <15% or 11 L/min, all had a normal exercise electrocardiogram, and 4 had a heart rate >90%. CONCLUSION: At 6 months, persistent dyspnea was associated with reduced physical fitness. This study offers initial insights into the mid-term physical fitness of people who required hospitalization for COVID-19. It also provides novel pathophysiological clues about the underlaying mechanism of the physical limitations associated with persistent dyspnea. Those with persistent dyspnea should be offered a tailored rehabilitation intervention, which should probably include muscle reconditioning, breathing retraining, and perhaps respiratory muscle training. IMPACT: This study is the first, to our knowledge, to show that a persistent breathing disorder (in addition to muscle deconditioning) can explain persistent symptoms 6 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 infection and suggests that a specific rehabilitation intervention is warranted.","output":"Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing to Assess Persistent Symptoms at 6 Months in People With COVID-19 Who Survived Hospitalization: A Pilot Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the COVID-19 epidemic has lasted for months, it has not yet been successfully controlled, and little is known about neonatal COVID-19.

However, thus far, it is not clear whether viral infection plays an important role in the etiology of nonresponding CAP and whether there is a significant difference in the clinical characteristics between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP. METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, nonresponding CAP patients were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and virus detection in BAL fluid by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included. The median age was 62 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Overall, 20 patients (46.5%) were identified with viral infection. Of these viruses, influenza virus (n = 8) and adenovirus (n = 7) were more frequently detected, and others included herpes simplex virus, human enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, human coronavirus 229E, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Compared with nonviral nonresponding CAP, only ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a more common imaging manifestation in viral nonresponding CAP. However, no obvious differences were found in clinical and laboratory findings between the presence and the absence of viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections were particularly frequent in adults with nonresponding CAP. The ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a specific imaging manifestation for viral nonresponding CAP, while the clinical and laboratory data showed no obvious differences between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP.","output":"Detection of Viruses by Multiplex Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid of Patients with Nonresponding Community-Acquired Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community Health Workers (CHWs) are becoming essential members of the HIV workforce as emerging evidence demonstrates their effectiveness in engaging people with HIV into care and treatment. In 2018, among the estimated 37,000 persons who received an HIV diagnosis, the majority were from racial ethnic minority communities. CHWs serve as a bridge between the community and health care system and have the potential to address structural inequities and reduce the stigma, discrimination and other barriers that prevent people with HIV from seeking and staying in care and treatment. Effective CHW integration into the HIV primary care team requires a training and supervision system that is culturally responsive to the complex social and medical needs of people with HIV. This article describes a comprehensive training approach and curricula for CHWs and supervisors and its impact on the health care team. Grounded in a Popular Education model and using the CHW core consensus competency (C3) framework, a team of experts in HIV, training and supervision, including CHWs working in HIV care and treatment developed an 80-h CHW and 20-h supervisor curricula. The trainings were delivered via in-person and virtual sessions over the course of 2 years. Using a mixed method evaluation, 23 CHWs and 22 supervisors across 10 clinic sites in eight states participated in the training sessions. Measures included knowledge and confidence related to HIV-specific content, supporting clients with managing stigma and discrimination, ability to communicate with other team members and helping clients navigate the services system. CHWs reported improved skills with documentation in the electronic health record, helping clients with treatment adherence challenges and educating on lab results. Supervisors reported learning strategies for assigning clients to CHWs, self-care techniques, providing strengths-based feedback, and mentoring and coaching. The participatory practice-based curricula allowed supervisors and CHWs to share experiences and solicit input from peers for problem resolution and implementation of new policies and practices. This training approach focused on HIV specific content with core competency training could serve as a model for CHWs working in primary care settings and with populations experiencing multiple chronic health conditions and social needs.","output":"A Participatory Curricula for Community Health Workers and Supervisors to Increase HIV Health Outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19 emerged in China and rapidly spread to other countries; due to its rapid worldwide spread, the WHO has declared this as a global emergency. As there is no specific treatment prescribed to treat COVID-19, the seeking of suitable therapeutics among existing drugs seems valuable. The structure availability of coronavirus macromolecules has encouraged the finding of conceivable anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics through in silico analysis. The results reveal that quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI) and saquinavir strongly interact with the active site (Cys-His catalytic dyad), thereby are predicted to hinder the activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Out of 113 quinoline-drugs, elvitegravir and oxolinic acid are able to interact with the NTP entry-channel and thus interfere with the RNA-directed 5-3 polymerase activity of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The bioactivity-prediction results also validate the outcome of the docking study. Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 Spike-glycoprotein uses human ACE2-receptor for viral entry, targeting the Spike-RBD-ACE2 has been viewed as a promising strategy to control the infection. The result shows rilapladib is the only quinoline that can interrupt the Spike-RBD-ACE2 complex. In conclusion, owing to their ability to target functional macromolecules of SARS-CoV-2, along with positive ADMET properties, quinoline,1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-[(2-phenylcyclopropyl)sulfonyl]-trans-(8CI), saquinavir, elvitegravir, oxolinic acid, and rilapladib are suggested for the treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Quinolines-Based SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp Inhibitors and Spike-RBD-ACE2 Inhibitor for Drug-Repurposing Against COVID-19: An in silico Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tropical Pacific upwelling-dependent ecosystems are the most productive and variable worldwide, mainly due to the influence of El Ni?o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO can be forecasted seasons ahead thanks to assorted climate precursors (local-Pacific processes, pantropical interactions). However, owing to observational data scarcity and bias-related issues in earth system models, little is known about the importance of these precursors for marine ecosystem prediction. With recently released reanalysis-nudged global marine ecosystem simulations, these constraints can be sidestepped, allowing full examination of tropical Pacific ecosystem predictability. By complementing historical fishing records with marine ecosystem model data, we show herein that equatorial Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) constitute a superlative predictability source for tropical Pacific marine yields, which can be forecasted over large-scale areas up to 2 years in advance. A detailed physical-biological mechanism is proposed whereby Atlantic SSTs modulate upwelling of nutrient-rich waters in the tropical Pacific, leading to a bottom-up propagation of the climate-related signal across the marine food web. Our results represent historical and near-future climate conditions and provide a useful springboard for implementing a marine ecosystem prediction system in the tropical Pacific.","output":"Skillful prediction of tropical Pacific fisheries provided by Atlantic Ni?os"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is increasingly being used for healthcare purposes.

METHODS: Adults admitted between 2000 and 2015 to 20 French ICUs with proven atypical pneumonia were retrospectively described. Patients with MP were compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) pneumonia patients admitted to ICUs. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were included, 71 men and 33 women, with a median age of 56 [44C67] years. MP was the causative agent for 76 (73%) patients and CP for 28 (27%) patients. Co-infection was documented for 18 patients (viruses for 8 [47%] patients). Median number of involved quadrants on chest X-ray was 2 [1C4], with alveolar opacities (n = 61, 75%), interstitial opacities (n = 32, 40%). Extra-pulmonary manifestations were present in 34 (33%) patients. Mechanical ventilation was required for 75 (72%) patients and vasopressors for 41 (39%) patients. ICU length of stay was 16.5 [9.5C30.5] days, and 11 (11%) patients died in the ICU. Compared with SP patients, MP patients had more extensive interstitial pneumonia, fewer pleural effusion, and a lower mortality rate [6 (8%) vs. 17 (22%), p = 0.013]. According MCA analysis, some characteristics at admission could discriminate MP and SP. MP was more often associated with hemolytic anemia, abdominal manifestations, and extensive chest radiograph abnormalities. SP-P was associated with shock, confusion, focal crackles, and focal consolidation. CONCLUSION: In this descriptive study of atypical bacterial pneumonia requiring ICU admission, mortality was 11%.

This study finds that during the second and the third pandemic wave, our data on excess mortality will match very well the somewhat belatedly officially reported COVID-19 deaths if we assume that only 60% of cases were officially detected. Based on principal component analysis of death timing, except for the age bracket below 40, where COVID-19 deaths calculated on the basis of our model explain 55% of excess mortality, for the remaining age groups, combined COVID-19 deaths explain 95% of excess mortality. Based on the share of excess mortality attributable to COVID-19 during the second wave, this infection in Poland caused the death of 73,300 people and not of 37,600 as officially reported. The third wave caused 46,200 deaths instead of the reported 34,700. The first wave was, indeed, as officially reported, very mild, and the number of excess deaths was too low to be used to calculate COVID-19 deaths directly.

Biallelic mutations in either TMC6 or TMC8 are detected in more than half of cases of the pre-malignant skin disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). It is controversial whether EV induced by mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 originates from keratinocyte or lymphocyte defects. Quantification of TMC6 and TMC8 RNA levels in various organs revealed that lymphoid tissues have the highest levels of expression of both genes, and custom antibodies confirmed protein expression in mouse lymphocytes. To study the function of these proteins we generated mice with targeted deletion mutant alleles of Tmc6 or Tmc8. Either TMC6 or TMC8 deficiency induced a reduction in apparent molecular weight and/or amount of the other TMC molecule. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TMC6 and TMC8 formed a protein complex in mouse and human T cells. Mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 additionally interacted with the CIB1 protein to form TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 trimers. We demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 regulated CIB1 levels by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Reciprocally, CIB1 was needed for stabilizing TMC6 and TMC8 levels. These results suggest why inactivating mutations in any of the three human genes lead to similar clinical presentations.

The resulting data allow hospital administrators to compare their patient outcome data against those reported nationally. As Swiss psychiatric hospitals are planned and coordinated at the cantonal level, they vary considerably. In addition, nursing care structures and processes, such as nurse staffing, are only reported and aggregated at the national level, whereas nurse outcomes, such as job satisfaction or intention to leave, have yet to be assessed in Swiss psychiatric hospitals. Because they lack these key figures, psychiatric hospitals quality of care cannot be reasonably described. OBJECTIVE: This studys purpose is to describe health care quality by exploring hospital structures such as nurse staffing and the work environment; processes such as the rationing of care; nurse outcomes, including job satisfaction and work-life balance; and patients symptom burden. METHODS: Match(RN) Psychiatry is a multicenter observational study of Swiss psychiatric hospitals. The sample for this study included approximately 1300 nurses from 113 units of 13 psychiatric hospitals in Switzerlands German-speaking region. In addition, routine patient assessment data from each participating hospital were included. The nurse survey consisted of 164 items covering three dimensionswork environment, patient safety climate, and the rationing of care. The unit-level questionnaire included 57 items, including the number of beds, number of nurses, and nurses education levels. Routine patient data included items such as main diagnosis, the number and duration of freedom-restrictive measures, and symptom burden at admission and discharge. Data were collected between September 2019 and June 2021. The data will be analyzed descriptively by using multilevel regression linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models to explore associations between variables of interest. RESULTS: The response rate from the nurse survey was 71.49% (1209/1691). All data are currently being checked for consistency and plausibility. The Match(RN) Psychiatry study is funded by the participating psychiatric hospitals and the Swiss Psychiatric Nursing Leaders Association (Vereinigung Pflegekader Psychiatrie Schweiz). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the Match(RN) Psychiatry study will systematically evaluate the quality of care in psychiatric hospitals in Switzerland in terms of organizational structures, processes, and patient and nurse outcomes. The participating psychiatric hospitals will benefit from findings that are relevant to the future planning of nurse staffing. The findings of this study will contribute to improvement strategies for nurses work environments and patient experiences in Swiss psychiatric hospitals.

It evaluates their existing legislative frameworks, as well as regulatory and industry guidelines on borrower hardship, and contrasts this with their use of payment holidays during the pandemic. Where there were existing industry guidelines on borrower hardship, lenders were able to spearhead an industry-wide approach towards payment relief without regulatory intervention by governments. Beyond the pandemic, the paper argues that self-regulation has potential for protecting borrower interests by standardising the scope of, and the procedure for, obtaining hardship relief. It argues that there is a need for a greater prevalence of industry codes of conducts governing lenders approach towards borrower hardship across the AsiaCPacific.","output":"Regulating Borrower Hardship in Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong: Payment Holidays During COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine whether Bitcoin can act as a safe haven against adverse movements of stock and bond assets in five major economies during the COVID-19 bear market The empirical analyses are conducted using a Bayesian panel VAR method that captures potential interaction and heterogeneity across country/region-segmented markets We find that Bitcoin in each a given economy contributes to diversification benefits and/or risk mitigation both within and across borders, while its role against traditional assets varies among different economies We also show that the COVID-19 outbreak alters the role of Bitcoin in our target segmented markets except for the US","output":"Is Bitcoin really more than a diversifier?

AIMS: To determine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental-health and pregnancy plans of women with IBD. METHODS: Women with IBD (age 18C45) were asked to anonymously complete surveys on baseline demographics, IBD characteristics, and mental health comorbidities. They were also asked to comment on prior symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and whether they were tested for the virus. Finally, patients were asked to complete three mental health surveys to reflect on anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD7)), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9)), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)) symptoms prior to and during the pandemic. Total scores were reported as continuous variables and means with standard deviations (SD) were compared using paired T-tests. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (12 UC, 17 CD) were included. 14 patients were preconception, 12 were pregnant, and 3 were post-partum. The mean age was 31.4 (SD 3.7). Fifteen of 29 (51.7%) of patients were on anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. Twelve (41.4%) and 6 (20.7%) patients had pre-morbid anxiety and depression prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 symptoms were reported in 8 patients (27.5%). Six patients had undergone COVID-19 testing, all of whom had a negative test. Four patients indicated that COVID-19 had negatively affected their plans for pregnancy, with reasons reported including fear of the hospital (n=1), fear of COVID-19 impact on the fetus (n=2), and uncertainty on the duration of COVID-19 (n=1). During the pandemic, fourteen of 28 (50%) patients experienced symptoms of anxiety (GAD score > 5), with a majority (70%) experiencing mild symptoms (score 5C9). During the pandemic, 60.7% (17/28) and 71.4% (20/28) reported symptoms of depression (PHQ9 > 4) and at least moderate stress (PSS > 14) respectively. Furthermore, compared to pre-pandemic, 57.1% (16/28) and 67.9% (19/28) had an increase in depression and stress symptoms during the pandemic respectively. This appeared to only apply to those with CD, but not UC (Table 1). Compared to pre-pandemic, those with stricturing CD appeared to have higher stress scores whereas those with fistulizing and perianal disease appeared to have higher depression scores during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 1). A lower house-hold income and a reduction in exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to increase the risk of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of women with IBD indicate worsening of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains critical that health-care professionals address these mental health concerns during these otherwise difficult times.

Methods The chemical constituents and action targets of HLJDD were retrieved on Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), SymMap v2, Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM), a High-throughput Experiment- and Reference-guided Database of Traditional Chinese Medicine (HERB), and Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID). UniProt and GeneCards were used to query the target genes that corresponding to the active compounds, and then a compound-target network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.7.2. Gene Ontology (GO) database was used to annotate GO functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used to predict the possible mechanisms of active compounds. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analysis the tissue enrichment. The main active compounds in HLJDD are molecularly docked with their corresponding related targets. Results Seventy-six compounds were screened and 458 corresponding targets in the network were obtained. Gene annotation showed that the targets were involved mainly in 1953 biological processes. 884 signaling pathways was enriched, involving signaling by interleukins, cytokine signaling in immune system, generic transcription pathway, and RNA polymerase II transcription. The targets mainly distributed in the lung, liver, and placenta, involving a variety of immune cells, such as T cells and B cells.

Given the higher probability of thrombotic complications related to COVID-19 and the availability of a dual-layer spectral computed tomography (CT) scanner, we have recently adopted the use of low-dose, non-gated, chest CT scans performed five minutes after contrast administration among patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) undergoing cerebrovascular CT angiography. Dual-layer spectral CT comprises a single X-ray source and two-layer detector with different photon-absorption capabilities. In addition to conventional images, the two distinct energy datasets obtained enable multiparametric spectral analysis without need to change the original scanning protocol. The two spectral features that emerge as most useful for patients with AIS are virtual monoenergetic imaging and iodine-based results. Aside from the evaluation of lung parenchyma, this novel strategy enables ruling out cardioembolic sources and simultaneously providing evidence of pulmonary and myocardial injury in a single session and immediately after CT cerebrovascular angiography. Furthermore, it involves a noninvasive, seemingly accurate, unsophisticated, safer (very low radiation dose and no contrast administration), and cheaper tool for ruling out cardioembolic sources compared to transesophageal echocardiogram and cardiac CT.

Antimicrobial stewardship has been acknowledged as a primary strategy to tackle AMR. An important first step for antimicrobial stewardship is to quantify antimicrobial use (AMU). In Fiji, there are currently no data on AMU in livestock farms. This study aimed to quantify AMU in different livestock enterprises (beef, dairy, broiler, and layer) and farming systems (backyard, semi-commercial and commercial) in Central and Western divisions of Viti Levu, Fiji. A survey with 210 livestock farmers and 26 managers representing 276 enterprises was conducted between May and September 2019. The difference in AMU between different livestock enterprises and farming systems was investigated using ANOVA. In Fiji, the estimated annual antibiotic use in livestock was lower than the global average (44 compared with 118 mg/PCU). However, this use was concentrated in 56% of participant farms (the remaining 44% did not use antimicrobials). Total estimated quarterly anthelmintic use (20,797 mg) was not affected by farming systems but was highest (P < 0.001) in dairy enterprises (24,120 mg) and lowest in broiler enterprises (4 mg). Quarterly antibiotic use was different between the enterprises regardless of the metrics used to quantify the use (P < 0.05). Total estimated quarterly mg/PCU of antibiotic use was highest (P < 0.001) in broiler enterprises (12.4 mg/PCU) and lowest in beef enterprises (0.2 mg/PCU). For all other ESVAC metrics, total estimated antibiotic use was higher in poultry and lower in cattle enterprises. Backyard systems used less antibiotics (total mg) than commercial systems, but for other metrics, the trend was reversed. The use of both antibiotics and anthelmintics (rather than antibiotics or anthelmintics alone, or no AMU) was associated with dairy enterprises ((2) = 123, P < 0.001). Further studies should be conducted to quantify and evaluate the drivers of AMU in Fijian livestock farms. In addition, differences in AMU between different enterprises and farming systems suggest that strategies to reduce AMU should be tailored to specific settings.","output":"Quantification of antimicrobial use in Fijian livestock farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this research was to test the blended learning integrated fieldwork in the Fundamentals of Geology learning.

Patients are often elderly with complex co-morbidities. While monitored anaesthesia care with sedation is commonly used for most cases, few would require general anaesthesia with an endotracheal tube. Both low-flow and high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) are established ways of delivering supplemental oxygen, but it is unclear whether one technique is better than the other. HFNC seems a promising tool for advanced procedures but evidence to support its application in high-risk ERCP cases is limited. The rate of oxygen desaturation during endoscopy has been reported to be as high as 11%C50% and the method of oxygen delivery for ERCP merits further study. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial comparing the efficacy of oxygen supplementation through HFNC versus low-flow nasal cannula during ERCP, in a cohort of patients at risk of adverse respiratory events. A total of 132 patients will be recruited across three sites and randomly assigned to either the low-flow or the HFNC group. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients experiencing hypoxia, defined by any event of SpO2 < 90%. The secondary outcomes include parameters centred on oxygenation, requirement of airway manoeuvres, successful completion of procedure, perioperative complications, patient satisfaction and cost analysis of the consumables. An intention-to-treat principle will be applied while analysing. DISCUSSION: The demand for ERCPs is likely to increase in the future with the aging population.

We aimed to identify roles and underlying tasks in these services central to sustainable functioning of Canadian academic divisions of general surgery. METHODS: Between June 2018 and October 2020, we used a 4-step modified Delphi method (online survey, face-to-face nominal group technique [n = 12], semistructured telephone interview [n = 8] and nominal group technique [n = 12]) to achieve national consensus from an expert panel of all 17 heads of academic divisions of general surgery in Canada on the roles and accompanying tasks essential to education, research and leadership services within an academic division of general surgery. We used 70% agreement to determine consensus. RESULTS: The expert panel agreed that a framework for role allocation in education, research and leadership services was relevant and necessary. Consensus was reached for 7 roles within the educational service, 3 roles within the research service and 5 roles within the leadership service. CONCLUSION: Our framework represents a national consensus that defines role standards for education, research and leadership services in Canadian academic divisions of general surgery.

However, patients needing dental emergency treatment in the ongoing pandemic require relevant intra/extraoral dental radiography for adequate diagnosis and treatment planning. METHODS: This article is aimed at adding to the hot debate: Is delay for intraoral radiographs justified or a possible proxy? As a narrative review, it provides an insight into the reasons for delaying intra-oral dental radiographs during in the pandemic and options of the nontraditional radiographic techniques available until the pandemic subsides. Discussion and Conclusion. Cross-contamination concerns through respiratory droplets grow while using intraoral film holders that stimulate gag reflex, coughing, saliva secretion, and if proper disinfection protocols are not applied. Since the patients' acquiring emergency dental treatment cannot be neglected, the return-to-work guidelines by the health regulatory bodies urge to prioritize extraoral radiographic imaging techniques to curb the infection, offering the best diagnostic efficacy. The dental professionals can consider cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and sectional dental panoramic radiographs (SDPRs), followed by a risk assessment for COVID-19, a safer modality in reducing cross-contamination and assuring an innocuous environment for both patient and coworkers.","output":"Delaying Intraoral Radiographs during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Conundrum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined how the triarchic model of grit (i.e., perseverance of effort, consistency of interests, and adaptability to situations) is related to cultivation of genuine happiness, loneliness, and COVID-19 anxiety in American (n = 643) and Filipino (n = 546) undergraduate students.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir for either 5 days or 10 days. All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days. The primary end point was clinical status on day 14, assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale. RESULTS: In total, 397 patients underwent randomization and began treatment (200 patients for 5 days and 197 for 10 days). The median duration of treatment was 5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 5) in the 5-day group and 9 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) in the 10-day group. At baseline, patients randomly assigned to the 10-day group had significantly worse clinical status than those assigned to the 5-day group (P = 0.02). By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54% in the 10-day group. After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P = 0.14). The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%).

Yet public healthcare does not include routine detection and treatment for these disorders. This pilot study aims to evaluate the implementation outcomes of a health systems strengthening (HSS) intervention for improving the quality of care of perinatal women with CMD and experiences of domestic violence, attending public healthcare facilities in Cape Town. METHODS: Three antenatal care facilities were purposively selected for delivery of a HSS programme consisting of four components: (1) health promotion and awareness raising talks delivered by lay healthcare workers; (2) detection of CMD and domestic violence by nurses as part of routine care; (3) referral of women with CMD and domestic violence; and (4) delivery of structured counselling by lay healthcare workers in patients homes. Participants included healthcare workers tasked with delivery of the HSS components, and perinatal women attending the healthcare facilities for routine antenatal care. This mixed methods study used qualitative interviews with healthcare workers and pregnant women, a patient survey, observation of health promotion and awareness raising talks, and a review of several documents, to evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, fidelity of delivery, and fidelity of receipt of the HSS components. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative interviews, while the quantitative findings for adoption and fidelity of receipt were reported using numbers and proportions. RESULTS: Healthcare workers found the delivery and content of the HSS components to be both acceptable and appropriate, while the feasibility, adoption and fidelity of delivery was poor. We demonstrated that the health promotion and awareness raising component improved womens attitudes towards seeking help for mental health conditions. The detection, referral and treatment components were found to improve fidelity of receipt, evidenced by an increase in the proportion of women undergoing routine detection and referral, and decreased feelings of distress in women who received counselling. However, using a task-sharing approach did not prove to be feasible, as adding additional responsibilities to already overburdened healthcare workers roles resulted in poor fidelity of delivery and adoption of all the HSS components. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptability, appropriateness and fidelity of receipt of the HSS programme components, and poor feasibility, fidelity of delivery and adoption suggest the need to appoint dedicated, lay healthcare workers to deliver key programme components, at healthcare facilities, on the same day.","output":"Implementation outcomes of a health systems strengthening intervention for perinatal women with common mental disorders and experiences of domestic violence in South Africa: Pilot feasibility and acceptability study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a leading infectious disease-related cause of death worldwide, necessitating the development of new and improved treatment regimens. Non-clinical evaluation of candidate drug combinations via the relapsing mouse model (RMM) is an important step in regimen development, through which candidate regimens that provide the greatest decrease in probability of relapse following treatment in mice may be identified for further development. Although RMM studies are a critical tool to evaluate regimen efficacy, making comprehensive apples to apples comparisons of regimen performance in the RMM has been a challenge, in large part due to the need to evaluate and adjust for variability across studies arising from differences in design and execution. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a model-based meta-analysis on data for 17 unique regimens obtained from a total of 1592 mice across 28 RMM studies. Specifically, a mixed-effects logistic regression model was developed that described the treatment duration-dependent probability of relapse for each regimen and identified relevant covariates contributing to inter-study variability. Using the model, covariate-normalized metrics of interest, namely treatment duration required to reach 50% and 10% relapse probability, were derived and used to compare relative regimen performance. Overall, the model-based meta-analysis approach presented herein enables cross-study comparison of efficacy in the RMM, and provides a framework whereby data from emerging studies may be analyzed in the context of historical data to aid in selecting candidate drug combinations for clinical evaluation as TB drug regimens.","output":"Model-Based Meta-Analysis of Relapsing Mouse Model Studies from the Critical Path to Tuberculosis Drug Regimens Initiative Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses globally and a leading cause of disability.

We have previously developed a risk calculator to stratify which adolescents are at high risk of developing depression and in this study explore the views of stakeholders to ascertain the acceptability and feasibility of implementing such a tool in the UK. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 UK-based stakeholders (12 healthcare workers, 12 social workers, 12 school workers, 12 policymakers and 12 parents). Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analysed drawing on framework analysis techniques in NVivo 12. RESULTS Six overarching themes were identified: facilitators of acceptability; barriers to acceptability; role of stakeholders in implementing risk screening; feasibility of delivering the risk calculator in practice; barriers to implementation; and policy and system implications of using it in the current UK health and social care climate. The implementation of a depression risk calculator in the UK was seen as largely acceptable and feasible by most respondents. There was a strong emphasis on the utility of schools to implement this risk calculator, although it was recognized that training and support would be essential.

We identified a cluster of twenty bars located at the epicenter of the outbreak, in close proximity to on-campus residence halls and off-campus housing. Smartphones originating from the two hardest hit residence halls (Sellery and Witte), where about one in five students were infected, were 2.95 times more likely to visit the 20-bar cluster than smartphones originating in two more distant, less affected residence halls (Ogg and Smith). By contrast, smartphones from Sellery-Witte were only 1.55 times more likely than those from Ogg-Smith to visit a group of 68 restaurants in the same area. Physical proximity thus had a much stronger influence on bar visitation than on restaurant visitation (rate ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.29-2.85, p = 0.0007). In a separate analysis, we determined the per-capita rates of visitation to the 20-bar cluster and to the 68-restaurant comparison group by smartphones originating in each of 19 census tracts in the university area, and related these visitation rates to the per-capita incidence of newly positive coronavirus tests in each census tract. In a multivariate regression, the visitation rate to the bar cluster was a significant determinant of infection rates (elasticity 0.90, 95% CI 0.26-1.54, p = 0.009), while the restaurant visitation rate showed no such relationship.

We have studied the association of the viral membrane glycoproteins M and S in the formation of the virion envelope. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis we demonstrated that the M and S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) interact specifically forming heteromultimeric complexes in infected cells. These could be detected only when the detergents used for their solubilization from cells or virions were carefully chosen: a combination of nonionic (NP-40) and ionic (deoxycholic acid) detergents proved to be optimal. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that newly made M and S proteins engaged in complex formation with different kinetics. Whereas the M protein appeared in complexes immediately after its synthesis, newly synthesized S protein did so only after a lag phase of > 20 min. Newly made M was incorporated into virus particles faster than S, which suggests that it associates with preexisting S molecules. Using the vaccinia virus T7-driven coexpression of M and S we also demonstrate formation of M/S complexes in the absence of other coronaviral proteins. Pulse-chase labelings and coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that M and S associate in pre-Golgi membranes because the unglycosylated form of M appeared in M/S complexes rapidly. Since no association of M and S was detected when protein export from the ER was blocked by brefeldin A, stable complexes most likely arise in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment. Sucrose velocity gradient analysis showed the M/S complexes to be heterogeneous and of higher order, suggesting that they are maintained by homo- and heterotypic interactions. M/S complexes colocalized with alpha-mannosidase II, a resident Golgi protein. They acquired Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications but were not detected at the cell surface. Thus, the S protein, which on itself was transported to the plasma membrane, was retained in the Golgi complex by its association with the M protein. Because coronaviruses bud at pre-Golgi membranes, this result implies that the envelope glycoprotein complexes do not determine the site of budding. Yet, the self-association of the MHV envelope glycoproteins into higher order complexes is indicative of its role in the sorting of the viral membrane proteins and in driving the formation of the viral lipoprotein coat in virus assembly.","output":"Envelope glycoprotein interactions in coronavirus assembly"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in limited provision of palliative care and hospital teams have had to rise to the challenge of how to deliver care safely to people with palliative needs.

Integrin-beta 1 (ITGB1), which is also known as CD29, and plays an important role in development of malignant cancers. However, the effect of ITGB1 in promoting the anti-tumor effect of cetuximab is not fully understand. METHODS The model of ITGB1 inhibition and overexpression was firstly constructed in LS174T cells, and the viability of cells in each group was detected using CCK-8 assay. The expression of key factors in tumor formation process at transcription level was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. The expression of key proteins in metastasis process, cell apoptosis and activation of Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway was detected using western blotting analysis. And the concentration of key factors of in tumor formation process in cultured medium of LS174T cells were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS We found that cetuximab could inhibit the proliferation of LS174T cells, and inhibition of ITGB1 enhanced this effect while overexpression of ITGB1 reduced this effect. We further found that cetuximab could inhibit the expression and secretion of extracellular matrix degradation related molecules in cultured medium and transcription level. Besides, we also found that the expression of key factors in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation related proteins were also reduced after cetuximab treatment. These effects might be mediated by Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway and enhanced after inhibition of ITGB1 expression.

Nanoarchitectonics aims to establish a discipline in which functional materials are fabricated from nano-scale components such as atoms, molecules, and nanomaterials using various techniques. Nanoarchitectonics opens ways to form a more unified paradigm by integrating nanotechnology with organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, material chemistry, microfabrication technology, and biotechnology. On the other hand, biological systems consist of rational organization of constituent molecules. Their structures have highly asymmetric and hierarchical features that allow for chained functional coordination, signal amplification, and vector-like energy and signal flow. The process of nanoarchitectonics is based on the premise of combining several different processes, which makes it easier to obtain a hierarchical structure. Therefore, nanoarchitectonics is a more suitable methodology for creating highly functional systems based on structural asymmetry and hierarchy like biosystems. The creation of functional materials by nanoarchitectonics is somewhat similar to the creation of functional systems in biological systems. It can be said that the goal of nanoarchitectonics is to create highly functional systems similar to those found in biological systems. This review article summarizes the synthesis of biomimetic and biological molecules and their functional structure formation from various viewpoints, from the molecular level to the cellular level.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we hypothesized that atorvastatin could prevent the neurons lost in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region after transient global ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) through its anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic activities. METHOD: Twenty-four male Wistar rats 12-13 weeks old and weighing 250-300 g, were divided randomly into four groups: control, I/R, vehicle (I/R treated with NaCl) and experiment (I/R treated with atorvastatin, 10 mg/kg) and rats were sacrificed 96 hours after I/R. Quantitative expression of genes (caspase 8, p53, bax, bcl2, cytochrome c) was studied. The MDA level, SOD, CAT, and GPx activities were measured with biochemical tests. To detect apoptotic cells, TUNEL and Nissl staining were performed. Mitochondria were prepared from the hippocampus rats, used to the quantification of mitochondrial ROS, ATP level, GSH content, membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and determination of mitochondrial swelling. RESULTS: Atorvastatin attenuated the overexpression of bax, cytochrome C, p53, and caspase8 mRNAs and induced expression of bcl-2 mRNA (P<0.001). Atorvastatin treatment increased anti-oxidant enzyme levels (P<0.01). Treatment with atorvastatin reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. It could decrease the cytochrome c release (P<0.01), inhibit the decrease of MMP (P<0.001) and increased the ATP level (P<0.001) in mitochondrial hippocampal in compared with I/R group.

Eleven monozygotic twins participated in an experimental trial in normoxia and hypoxia (10.7% O2). Muscle biopsy samples were obtained before and after a 20-min moderate cycling exercise. In hypoxia at rest, autophagic flux was increased, as indicated by an increased microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 type II/I (LC3-II/I) ratio (+25%) and LC3-II expression (+60%) and decreased p62/SQSTM1 expression (-25%; P<0.05), whereas exercise reversed those changes to a level similar to that with normoxia except for p62/SQSTM1, which was further decreased (P<0.05).

However, the effects of Pelargonium sidoides and a special extract prepared from its roots (EPs 7630) on human immune cells are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that EPs 7630 induced a rapid and dose-dependent production of TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10 by human blood immune cells. This EPs 7630-induced cytokine profile was more pro-inflammatory in comparison with the profile induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. The search for EPs 7630 target cells revealed that T-cells did not respond to EPs 7630 stimulation by production of TNF-, IL-6, or IL-10. Furthermore, pretreatment of T-cells with EPs 7630 did not modulate their TNF-, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion during subsequent activation. In contrast to lymphocytes, monocytes showed clear intracellular TNF- staining after EPs 7630 treatment. Accordingly, EPs 7630 predominantly provoked activation of MAP kinases and inhibition of p38 strongly reduced the monocyte TNF- production. The pretreatment of blood immune cells with EPs 7630 lowered their secretion of TNF- and IL-10 and caused an IL-6 dominant response during second stimulation with viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. In summary, we demonstrate that EPs 7630 activates human monocytes, induces MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulates their production capacity of mediators known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells.","output":"The Pelargonium sidoides Extract EPs 7630 Drives the Innate Immune Defense by Activating Selected MAP Kinase Pathways in Human Monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

Of these, 40 samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (average of 45 days post symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the pre-pandemic era (negative control), that were known to have been infected with other respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses A, B, C and/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, NL63 OC43) were used to assess specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed on five LFAs on a panel of 272 longitudinal samples from 47 patients of known time since symptom onset.Results. For the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band ranged from 55%-97% and 78%-100%, respectively. When assessing the performance of the IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0%-88% and 80%-100% for IgM and 25%-95% and 90%-100% for IgG.

When these patients still have insight, the treatment of mild hallucinations may reduce the risk of progression to more severe symptoms, specifically hallucinations without insight or delusions. On October 22, 2020, a multidisciplinary consensus panel comprising United States-based experts in geriatric psychiatry, geriatric medicine, family medicine, movement disorders, and neuropsychology was convened remotely to discuss best practices for using telemedicine to evaluate, diagnose, and treat psychosis in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. This review reflects the opinions and recommendations discussed at this meeting. Despite drawbacks, telemedicine can offer several advantages over in-person care, particularly for older adults, and may be a unique opportunity for care of patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. While telemedicine may not be suitable for all patients, it allows the involvement of specialists from multiple geographic locations and the extension of care to homebound individuals. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases who are likely to become homebound as the disease advances may benefit greatly from telemedicine as a standard of care. Healthcare provided via telemedicine should be nothing less than what would be offered to the patient in person. Telemedicine may present some difficulties, including technological issues and inherent constraints of remote care, but with proper planning many problems could be diminished. Technical issues associated with telemedicine are inevitable but may be partially offset by providing clear directions ahead of any tele-visit to ensure connectivity and access to the videoconferencing platform. Alternative procedures to communicate should be established in the eventuality of technological issues. Using these strategies, telemedicine can serve as a valuable complement to traditional in-person practices for the diagnosis and management of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinsons disease psychosis or dementia-related psychosis.","output":"Using Telemedicine to Assess and Manage Psychosis Among Outpatients with Neurodegenerative Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity and facilitates an accelerated and enhanced immune response upon re-infection with the same pathogen(1,2).

Here, using spectral flow cytometry combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and T cell receptor sequencing, we longitudinally characterized individual SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cells of patients with COVID-19 from acute infection to 1 year into recovery and found a distinct signature identifying long-lived memory CD8(+) T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8(+) T cells persisting 1 year after acute infection express CD45RA, IL-7 receptor- and T cell factor 1, but they maintain low expression of CCR7, thus resembling CD45RA(+) effector memory T cells. Tracking individual clones of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8(+) T cells, we reveal that an interferon signature marks clones that give rise to long-lived cells, whereas prolonged proliferation and mechanistic target of rapamycin signalling are associated with clonal disappearance from the blood.

Identifying public preferences for obtaining such information may help health authorities to effectively plan successful health preventive and educational intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the types of sources used for obtaining COVID-19 information on the attitudes and practices of the general public in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic, and to identify the socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with the use of different sources of information. METHODS: This study used data from a cross-sectional online survey conducted on residents of Saudi Arabia from March 20 to 24, 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Bivariate analysis of categorical variables was performed to determine the associations between information sources and socioeconomic and demographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to examine whether socioeconomic and demographic variables were associated with the source of information used to obtain information about COVID-19. Moreover, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine how sources of information influence attitudes and practices of adhering to preventive measures. RESULTS: In this analysis of cross-sectional survey data, 3358 participants were included. Most participants reported using social media, followed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as their primary source of information. Seeking information via social media was significantly associated with lower odds of having an optimistic attitude (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.845, 95% CI 0.733-0.974; P=.02) and adhering to preventive measures (aOR 0.725, 95% CI 0.630-0.835; P<.001) compared to other sources of information.

Despite their increased vulnerability, no study has documented the mental health burden of COVID-19 amongst these groups. To address this gap, we conducted a survey of migrant workers involved in large-scale dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. METHODS: Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, questionnaires were distributed to 1011 migrant workers undergoing extended movement restrictions. Mental health symptoms were measured using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As covariates, we assessed participants socio-demographics, quarantine status, COVID-19 health concerns, financial stability, and exposure to news and misinformation. Linear regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with DASS-21 scores. RESULTS: Complete movement restrictions were associated with increased depression and stress symptoms, while being diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with increased anxiety. Participants who harboured fears about their health or job, perceived their health to be poorer, or had greater exposure to COVID-19 rumours reported higher depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Across the cohort, rates of severe or extremely severe depression (3.1%, 95% CI: 2.1-4.3%), anxiety (4.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-5.5%), and stress (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-2.2%) were similar to those observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). CONCLUSIONS: As the first mental health survey of low-waged migrant workers during the pandemic, our findings provide a basis to identify and support at-risk individuals. This is critical as migrant workers often have limited access to healthcare services. At the same time, we documented resilience within the cohort as a whole.","output":"Mental health of international migrant workers amidst large-scale dormitory outbreaks of COVID-19: A population survey in Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the U.S. has largely delegated implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to local governments on the state and county level. This staggered implementation combined with the heterogeneity of the U.S. complicates quantification the effect of NPIs on the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2. We describe a data-driven approach to quantify the effect of NPIs that relies on county-level similarities to specialize a Bayesian hierarchical inference model based on observed fatalities. Using this approach, we estimate change in reproductive rate, Rt, due to implementation of NPIs in 1,417 U.S. counties. We estimate that as of May 28th, 2020 1,177 out of the considered 1,417 U.S. counties have reduced the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 to below 1.0. The estimated effect of any individual NPI, however, is different across counties. Stay-at-home orders were estimated as the only effective NPI in metropolitan and urban counties, while advisory NPIs were estimated to be effective in more rural counties. The expected level of infection predicted by the model ranges from 0 to 28.7% and is far from herd immunity even in counties with advanced spread.

The currently used serological lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) can only detect the presence of antibodies for a single antigen. Here, we fabricated a multiplexed circular flow immunoassay (CFIA) test strip with YOLO v4-based object recognition that can quickly quantify and differentiate antibodies that bind membrane glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or hemagglutinin of influenza A (H1N1) virus in the sera of immunized mice in one assay using one sample. Spot intensities were found to be indicative of antibody titers to membrane glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and were, thus, quantified relative to spots from immunoglobulin G (IgG) reaction in a CFIA to account for image heterogeneity. Quantitative intensities can be displayed in real time alongside an image of CFIA that was captured by a built-in camera. We demonstrate for the first time that CFIA is a specific, multi-target, and quantitative tool that holds potential for digital and simultaneous monitoring of antibodies recognizing various pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Quantitative circular flow immunoassays with trained object recognition to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 membrane glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic social distancing has highlighted the need to minimise loneliness and isolation among older adults (aged 50+). We wanted to know what remotely delivered befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions may help to alleviate social isolation and loneliness and how they work. Methods: : We followed a systematic review of reviews approach. Searches of 11 databases from the fields of health, social care, psychology and social science were undertaken during April 2020. Reviews meeting our PICOS criteria were included if they focussed on the evaluation of remote interventions to reduce levels of social isolation or loneliness in adults aged 50+ and were critically appraised using AMSTAR2. Narrative synthesis was used at a review and study level to develop a typology of intervention types and their effectiveness. Intervention Component Analysis (ICA) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) were used at a study level to explore the characteristics of successful interventions. Results: : We synthesised evidence from five systematic reviews and 18 primary studies. Remote befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions took the form of: (i) supported video-communication;(ii) online discussion groups and forums;(iii) telephone befriending;(iv) social networking sites;and (v) multi-tool interventions. The majority of studies utilised the first two approaches, and were generally regarded positively by older adults, although with mixed evidence around effectiveness. Focussing on processes and mechanisms, using ICA and QCA, we found that the interventions that were most successful in improving social support: (i) enabled participants to speak freely and to form close relationships;(ii) ensured participants have shared experiences/characteristics;(iii) included some form of pastoral guidance. Conclusions: : The findings highlight a set of intervention processes that should be incorporated into interventions, although they do not lead us to recommend specific modes of support, due to the heterogeneity of interventions.","output":"Rapid systematic review of systematic reviews: what befriending, social support and low intensity psychosocial interventions, delivered remotely, may reduce social isolation and loneliness among older adults and how?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Longevity is rightly considered one of the greatest achievements of modern society, an achievement understood as the possibility of increasing the healthy part of life and not only its full duration. This study investigated the phenomenon of regional longevity in Cilento by analyzing the association between longevity indicators and some environmental factors, in order to understand if factors such as altitude, climate, UNESCO protected areas, and hinterland can directly or indirectly influence the measure of healthy living and lead to longevity. Demographic and environmental data were collected through the Archives of the Cilento municipalities, the National Institute of Statistics, the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, and the Italian National Commission for UNESCO. The Geographically Weighted Regression were used to determine the association between longevity indicators and environmental factors. Correlation analysis between the longevity indicators was investigated in order to have a complete picture of longevity in Cilento. It was discovered that Cilento longevity is mainly found in the central area of the territory and from there, by age groups, it widens towards the south-eastern area. This designated area is part of the hilly area of the Cilento, at an altitude between 400 and 700 m above sea level. The towns of this area are part of the UNESCO heritage and are characterized by a transitional climate between Mediterranean and temperate climate. Moreover, the correlation analysis between the six indicators of longevity has confirmed a linear relationship between the six variables and this indicates that in the years to come there will be the probabilities of a generational turn over between the old, great old, nonagenarians and current centenarians, provided that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic subsides.","output":"Extreme Longevity: Analysis of the Direct or Indirect Influence of Environmental Factors on Old, Nonagenarians, and Centenarians in Cilento, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new flavonoid, Jusanin, (1) has been isolated from the aerial parts of Artemisia commutata.

Being new in nature, the inhibition potential of 1 has been estimated against SARS-CoV-2 using different in silico techniques. Firstly, molecular similarity and fingerprint studies have been conducted for Jusanin against co-crystallized ligands of eight different SARS-CoV-2 essential proteins. The studies indicated the similarity between 1 and X77, the co-crystallized ligand SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB ID: 6W63). To confirm the obtained results, a DFT study was carried out and indicated the similarity of (total energy, HOMO, LUMO, gap energy, and dipole moment) between 1 and X77. Accordingly, molecular docking studies of 1 against the target enzyme have been achieved and showed that 1 bonded correctly in the proteins active site with a binding energy of ?19.54 Kcal/mol. Additionally, in silico ADMET in addition to the toxicity evaluation of Jusanin against seven models have been preceded and indicated the general safety and the likeness of Jusanin to be a drug.

OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study explores adolescents experiences of what it is like to have a friend who self-harms by cutting and what this experience means for friendship, the wider peer group and psychological well-being. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted face-to-face with a community sample of eight females aged between 13 and 18 years, living in England. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Four superordinate themes emerged: desperately searching for meaning, I will be there at all costs, too hot to handle and identification. Adolescents were concerned about escalations in their friends behaviours and felt a sense of duty to help, but the majority experienced a dilemma as to whether to disclose to others and all reported some form of distress. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the important, yet complex nature of friendship in this context. Friends play a key role in supporting adolescents who self-harm but need greater support managing this role and the effects. Schools/colleges should educate young people about self-harm to increase their knowledge and skills in relation to supporting a friend with this issue. Furthermore, they should promote environments for talking about mental health openly to give young people increased opportunities for help-seeking.","output":"I Just Pulled Myself Together and Realised I had to be Responsible: Adolescents Experiences of Having a Friend Who Self-Harms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All coronaviruses possess small open reading frames (ORFs) between structural genes that have been hypothesized to play important roles in pathogenesis.

This retrospective, multicenter study investigated the impact of intravenous infusion volume in the early stage of COVID-19 on clinical outcomes. Methods 127 patients from two tertiary hospitals were separated into the conservative and liberal groups based on average daily intravenous infusion volume within the first seven days after admission. Basic information, demographic and epidemiological characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments, and outcome measures were retrieved from medical records. The disease progression and prognosis were analyzed and compared. Results The average daily intravenous infusion volume within 7 days was 500 (150C700) ml/day in the conservative-strategy group (n = 87), and 1100 (1000C1288) ml/day in the liberal-strategy group (n = 40) ( p < 0.001). There were no statistical differences in median age, male-to-female ratio, epidemiology, laboratory findings on admission, comorbidities, and average daily urine output within the seven days ( p > 0.05). The final K + in the liberal group was slightly higher than that at admission, and the final hematocrit level in the conservative group had a significant difference than that at admission ( p < 0.05). The mean ( SD) duration of hospitalization was 22.41  11.99 days in the conservative group and 25.28  12.08 days in the liberal group ( p = 0.120). However, compared to the liberal group, conservative group had statistically lower rates of disease progression (9.3% vs 37.5%, p < 0.001), mechanical ventilation (2.3% vs 27.5%, p < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (2.3% vs 15.0%, p = 0.012). Conclusions Although there appeared to be no significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between using conservative and liberal fluid management strategies, the former was associated with lower rates of disease progression, mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality without increased nonpulmonary-organ dysfunction.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical, demographic, and laboratory parameters that might have predictive value for in-hospital mortality and the need for intensive care and build a model based on them. This study was a prospective, observational, single-center study including non-critical patients admitted to COVID-19 wards. Besides classical clinic-demographic features, basic laboratory parameters obtained on admission were tested, and then new models for each outcome were developed built on the most significant variables. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed by calculating each models probability. A total of 368 non-critical hospitalized patients were recruited, the need for ICU care was observed in 70 patients (19%). The total number of patients who died in either ICU or wards was 39 (10.6%). The first two models (based on clinical features and demographics) were developed to predict ICU and death, respectively; older age, male sex, active cancer, and low baseline saturation were noted to be independent predictors. The area under the curve values of the first two models were noted 0.878 and 0.882 (p < .001; confidence interval [CI] 95% [0.837C0.919], p < .001; CI 95% [0.844C0.922]). Following two models, the third and fourth were based on laboratory parameters with clinic-demographic features. Initial lower sodium and lower albumin levels were determined as independent factors in predicting the need for ICU care; higher blood urea nitrogen and lower albumin were independent factors in predicting in-hospital mortality.

This study examined pharmacy workers' drug knowledge and practice for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (PE/E) management, including antihypertensives and anticonvulsants, and determine factors associated with their knowledge. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with 382 pharmacy workers in public facilities (government) and private pharmacies and drug stores assessed their knowledge of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs. 'Pharmacy workers' include personnel who work at pharmacies, pharmacists, family welfare visitors (FWVs), sub-assistant community medical officers (SACMOs), drug storekeepers. Exploratory and multivariate logistic models were used to describe association between knowledge of medicines used in pregnancy and demographic characteristics of pharmacy workers. RESULTS: Overall, 53% pharmacy workers interviewed were drug store owners in private pharmacies while 27% FWVs/SACMOs, who are government service providers also work as drug prescribers and/or dispensers in public facility pharmacies. Majority of pharmacy workers had poor knowledge compared to correct knowledge on both antihypertensive (77.8% vs 22.3%; p < 0.001) and anticonvulsant drugs (MgSO4) (82.2% vs 17.8%; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed SACMOs and FWVs were greater than 4 times more likely to have correct knowledge on anti-hypertensives (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI:1.3-12.3, P < 0.01) and anticonvulsant drugs (AOR = 4.9, 95% CI:1.3-18.1, P < 0.01) compared to pharmacists. Pharmacy workers who had received training were more likely to have correct knowledge on antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs than those who had no training. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy workers' knowledge and understanding of antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs, particularly for prevention and management of PE/E is limited in Bangladesh. Most pharmacies surveyed are private and staffed with unskilled workers with no formal training on drugs. Expansion of maternal and newborn health programs should consider providing additional skills training to pharmacy workers, as well as regulating these medicines at informal pharmacies to mitigate any harmful practices or adverse outcomes of unauthorized and incorrectly prescribed and used drugs. It is important that correct messaging and medicines are available as drug stores are often the first point of contact for most of the women and their families.","output":"Knowledge of pharmacy workers on antihypertensive and anticonvulsant drugs for managing pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent literature strongly supports the hypothesis that mobility restriction and social distancing play a crucial role in limiting the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was shown that mobility restriction reduced transmission significantly. This study found that, in the period between the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was high positive correlation between trends in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and mobility. These two trends oscillated simultaneously, and increased mobility following the relaxation of lockdown rules was significantly associated with increased transmission. From a public health perspective, these results highlight the importance of tracking changes in mobility when relaxing mitigation measures in order to anticipate future changes in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Parallel trends in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and retail/recreation and public transport mobility during non-lockdown periods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A major challenge to advance lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for RNA therapeutics is the development of formulations that can be produced reliably across the various scales of drug development.

To address this challenge, we present a scalable, parallelized microfluidic device (PMD) that incorporates an array of 128 mixing channels that operate simultaneously. The PMD achieves a >100 production rate compared to single microfluidic channels, without sacrificing desirable LNP physical properties and potency typical of microfluidic-generated LNPs. In mice, we show superior delivery of LNPs encapsulating either Factor VII siRNA or luciferase-encoding mRNA generated using a PMD compared to conventional mixing, with a 4-fold increase in hepatic gene silencing and 5-fold increase in luciferase expression, respectively.

The pigment is deposited onto all shell layers including the shell membranes, but most of it is concentrated in the outermost layer of the calcareous shell and in the cuticle. Recently, the genes that are involved in pigment synthesis have been identified, but the genetic control of synthesis and deposition of brown pigment in the commercial laying hen is not fully understood. The brown coloration of the shell is an important shell quality parameter and has a positive influence on consumer preference. The extent of pigment deposition is influenced by the housing system, hen age, hen strain, diet, stressors, and certain diseases such as infectious bronchitis.

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) may help to overcome these barriers. However, their effectiveness is often contested and poorly understood and warrants further investigation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to develop, test, and refine an evidence-informed program theory on how, for whom, and to what extent training using AR or VR works for upskilling health care workers and to understand what facilitates or constrains their implementation and maintenance. METHODS: We conducted a realist synthesis using the following 3-step process: theory elicitation, theory testing, and theory refinement. We first searched 7 databases and 11 practitioner journals for literature on AR or VR used to train health care staff. In total, 80 papers were identified, and information regarding context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) was extracted. We conducted a narrative synthesis to form an initial program theory comprising of CMO configurations. To refine and test this theory, we identified empirical studies through a second search of the same databases used in the first search. We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool to assess the quality of the studies and to determine our confidence in each CMO configuration. RESULTS: Of the 41 CMO configurations identified, we had moderate to high confidence in 9 (22%) based on 46 empirical studies reporting on VR, AR, or mixed simulation training programs. These stated that realistic (high-fidelity) simulations trigger perceptions of realism, easier visualization of patient anatomy, and an interactive experience, which result in increased learner satisfaction and more effective learning. Immersive VR or AR engages learners in deep immersion and improves learning and skill performance. When transferable skills and knowledge are taught using VR or AR, skills are enhanced and practiced in a safe environment, leading to knowledge and skill transfer to clinical practice. Finally, for novices, VR or AR enables repeated practice, resulting in technical proficiency, skill acquisition, and improved performance. The most common barriers to implementation were up-front costs, negative attitudes and experiences (ie, cybersickness), developmental and logistical considerations, and the complexity of creating a curriculum. Facilitating factors included decreasing costs through commercialization, increasing the cost-effectiveness of training, a cultural shift toward acceptance, access to training, and leadership and collaboration. CONCLUSIONS: Technical and nontechnical skills training programs using AR or VR for health care staff may trigger perceptions of realism and deep immersion and enable easier visualization, interactivity, enhanced skills, and repeated practice in a safe environment. This may improve skills and increase learning, knowledge, and learner satisfaction. The future testing of these mechanisms using hypothesis-driven approaches is required. Research is also required to explore implementation considerations.","output":"How, for Whom, and in Which Contexts or Conditions Augmented and Virtual Reality Training Works in Upskilling Health Care Workers: Realist Synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine associations between per capita income, unemployment rates, and COVID-19 vaccination rates at the county-level across the United States (U.S.), as well as to identify the interaction effects between county-level per capita income, unemployment rates, and racial/ethnic composition on COVID-19 vaccination rates.

For infection control purposes, the usual practice is to discard FFRs after close contact with a patient (single use). However, in some situations, such as during contact with tuberculosis patients, limited FFR reuse (i.e., repeated donning and doffing of the same FFR by the same person) is practiced. A related practice, extended use, involves wearing the same FFR for multiple patient encounters without doffing. Extended use and limited FFR reuse have been recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve FFR supplies. This commentary examines CDC recommendations related to FFR extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use. Analysis of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether FFR extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen- and event-specific. Factors to be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact transmission, the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage, the protection provided by FFR use, human factors, potential for self-inoculation, the potential for secondary exposures, and government policies and regulations. While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR reuse. Limited FFR reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times, but increases the risk of self-inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some FFR models may begin to lose effectiveness after multiple donnings.","output":"Commentary Considerations for Recommending Extended Use and Limited Reuse of Filtering Facepiece Respirators in Health Care Settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines elicit memory T cell responses.

We aimed to assess if 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25OHD) levels are associated with interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels and with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively studied 103 in-patients admitted to a Northern-Italian hospital (age 66.1  14.1 years, 70 males) for severely-symptomatic COVID-19. Fifty-two subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection but mild COVID-19 symptoms (mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients) and 206 subjects without SARS-CoV-2 infection were controls. We measured 25OHD and IL-6 levels at admission and focused on respiratory outcome during hospitalization. RESULTS: Severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients had lower 25OHD levels (18.2  11.4 ng/mL) than mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 patients and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected controls (30.3  8.5 ng/mL and 25.4  9.4 ng/mL, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). 25OHD and IL-6 levels were respectively lower and higher in severely-symptomatic COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care Unit [(ICU), 14.4  8.6 ng/mL and 43.0 (19.0C56.0) pg/mL, respectively], than in those not requiring ICU admission [22.4  1.4 ng/mL, p = 0.0001 and 16.0 (8.0C32.0) pg/mL, p = 0.0002, respectively].

SETTING: Five hospitals in the Maryland and Washington, DC, area. PATIENTS: 832 consecutive COVID-19 admissions from 4 March to 24 April 2020, with follow-up through 27 June 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Patient trajectories and outcomes, categorized by using the World Health Organization COVID-19 disease severity scale. Primary outcomes were death and a composite of severe disease or death. RESULTS: Median patient age was 64 years (range, 1 to 108 years); 47% were women, 40% were Black, 16% were Latinx, and 21% were nursing home residents. Among all patients, 131 (16%) died and 694 (83%) were discharged (523 [63%] had mild to moderate disease and 171 [20%] had severe disease). Of deaths, 66 (50%) were nursing home residents. Of 787 patients admitted with mild to moderate disease, 302 (38%) progressed to severe disease or death: 181 (60%) by day 2 and 238 (79%) by day 4. Patients had markedly different probabilities of disease progression on the basis of age, nursing home residence, comorbid conditions, obesity, respiratory symptoms, respiratory rate, fever, absolute lymphocyte count, hypoalbuminemia, troponin level, and C-reactive protein level and the interactions among these factors.

To improve our understanding of the mechanisms of airborne transmission of viruses, air sampling technologies that can detect the presence of aerosolized viruses, effectively collect them and maintain their viability, and determine their distribution in aerosol particles, are needed. The latest developments in sampling and detection methodologies for airborne viruses, their limitations, factors that can affect their performance and current research needs, are discussed in this review.

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare neurovascular emergency that has been observed in some COVID-19 patients, yet much remains to be learnt of its underlying pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: We present a case series of local patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and CVT; and aim to perform a systematic review of known cases in the current literature. METHODS: We describe two patients with concomitant COVID-19 infection and CVT from a nationwide registry in Singapore. We then conducted a literature search in PubMed and Embase using a suitable keyword search strategy from 1st December 2019 to 11th June 2020. All studies reporting CVT in COVID-19 patients were included. RESULTS: Nine studies and 14 COVID-19 patients with CVT were studied. The median age was 43 years (IQR=36-58) and majority had no significant past medical conditions (60.0%). The time taken from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVT diagnosis was a median of 7 days (IQR=6-14). CVT was commonly seen in the transverse (75.0%) and sigmoid sinus (50.0%); 33.3% had involvement of the deep venous sinus system. A significant proportion of patients had raised D-dimer (75.0%) and CRP levels (50.0%). Two patients reported presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Most patients received anticoagulation (91.7%) while overall mortality rate was 45.5%.

Materials and Methods: The study included 26.438 patients who applied to the Chest Diseases clinic in DUHARH before the COVID-19 pandemic (March 10 2019-March 10 2020) and after (March 11 2020-March 11 2021) and 2.971 patients who were hospitalized in the service. A sample was not selected in the research, and the entire universe was included in the study. The data obtained retrospectively were analyzed from bottom to top and through document analysis management. Frequency and percentage calculations, Spearman Correlation analysis, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate the data. Result: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the average unit cost in the policlinic was 46.14 TL/patient ($8.14/patient), and the average unit cost was 64.69 TL/ patient ($9.23/patient) after the COVID-19 pandemic. The average cost of the pre-COVID-19 pandemic service was calculated as 1.139,64 TL/patient ($200/patient). After the COVID-19 pandemic, the average unit cost in the service was 2.136,27 TL/patient ($304.75/patient). A statistically significant difference in terms of costs was found between the two periods. It was determined that the costs of COVID-19 patients changed in terms of length of stay, age, and sex (p<0.05). Conclusions: Even though the number of patients in the Chest Diseases clinic has decreased during the pandemic process, the costs have increased due to the high cost of COVID-19 patients and the patients needing advanced examination and treatment in this period.

Introduction and objectives: In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, was discovered as the agent of COVID-19 disease. Cardiac arrhythmias have been reported as frequent but their incidence is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the real incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients admitted to Portuguese hospitals and to understand the underlying prognostic implications. Methods: The Portuguese Association of Arrhythmology, Pacing and Electrophysiology (APAPE) conducted a survey in Portuguese hospitals to assess the occurrence of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients, their clinical characteristics, the use of experimental therapies and its impact on QT interval. Results: Twenty hospitals participated, reporting 692 hospitalized patients. An arrhythmic episode occurred in 81 (11.7%) and 64 (79%) had detailed information. New onset arrhythmias occurred in 41 (64%) patients, 45 (70.3%) male, median age 73.5 (61-80.3) years. There were 51 (79.7%) with associated comorbidities, mainly arterial hypertension (41, 64.1%). Of 53 patients (82.3%) under experimental therapy, 7 (10.9%) had an increased QTc interval. Regarding arrhythmias, two patients (3.1%) had ventricular tachycardia, 5 (7.8%) sinus bradycardia, 17 (26.6%) paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 40 (62.5%) atrial fibrillation or flutter. Non-arrhythmic death syndrome nor related complications at the time of reporting. Conclusions: In a population of COVID-19 patients, the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is high but not associated with increased cardiac mortality, although it occurs frequently in extremely ill patients and with multiple organ failure. Regardless of the use of experimental drugs, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias is low and atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias are the most prevalent arrythmias.","output":"Arritmias Cardacas em doentes com COVID-19, tratados em hospitais portugueses.

It was noted in 2006 that there was opportunity for significant expansion of the use of HHD in many countries. China covers a vast area and has a large amount of end-stage renal failure patients. But in mainland China, all dialysis treatments are in-center, and the number of HHD patients is zero. In 2018, our hospital received the permission of the Shanghai government to carry out HHD. CASE PRESENTATION We initiated four incident hemodialysis patients on an HHD regimen, one patient has been dialyzed in the home safely for 8 months. The biochemical parameters of the first patient remained stable on the regimen and he achieved standard Kt/V urea targets. Treatment-related adverse events were not reported during the follow-up. We combined HHD with intelligent \\"Internet Plus\\" real-time remote monitoring and introduced the Internet, especially visualization software, to replace traditional telephone and home visit methods. It is more intuitive and quicker to assist patients in performing home hemodialysis and improve the safety of treatment.

Children in low-income countries are disproportionately affected. This is in large part due to limitations in healthcare resources and medical technologies. Mechanical ventilation can be a life-saving therapy for many children with acute respiratory failure. The scarcity of functioning ventilators in low-income countries results in countless preventable deaths. Some hospitals have attempted to adapt to this scarcity by using hand-bag ventilation, as either a bridge to a mechanical ventilator, or until clinical improvement occurs rendering mechanical ventilation no longer necessary. In instances of hand-bag ventilation, an endotracheal tube is first placed. Family members are then asked to play the role of a ventilator, manually compressing a bag repeatedly to inflate the child's lungs. This approach is fraught with numerous ethical challenges. A careful examination of the data and a nuanced approach to the ethical considerations are imperative. Ethical arguments in support of and in opposition to allowing parental hand-bag ventilation are explored, including the best interests of the child, the child's right to an open future, beneficence and parental protection, legitimising substandard care, and finally, contextual concerns.

Such obese animals would not only allow us to explore obesity but would also represent models to study diseases and conditions that develop with obesity or where obesity represents a risk factor. Indeed, obese subjects, as well as animal models of obesity, develop pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, inflammation and metabolic disorders. Therefore, obese animals would represent models for numerous diseases. Although those diseases can be induced in animals by chemicals or drugs without obesity development, having them developed as consequences of obesity has numerous advantages. These advantages include mimicking natural pathogenesis processes, using diversity in obesity models (diet, animal species) to study the related variabilities and exploring disease intensity and reversibility depending on obesity development and treatments. Importantly, therapeutic implications and pharmacological tests represent key advantages too. On the other hand, obesity prevalence is continuously increasing, and, therefore, the likelihood of having a patient suffering simultaneously from obesity and a particular disease is increasing. Thus, studying diverse diseases in obese animals (either induced naturally or developed) would allow researchers to build a library of data related to the patterns or specificities of obese patients within the context of pathologies. This may lead to a new branch of medicine specifically dedicated to the diseases and care of obese patients, similar to geriatric medicine, which focuses on the elderly population.","output":"Obese Animals as Models for Numerous Diseases: Advantages and Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This qualitative research explored the lived experiences of patients who experienced postponement of elective cardiac and vascular surgery due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: Utilizing a hermeneutical phenomenological qualitative design, we interviewed 47 individuals who experienced a postponement of cardiac or vascular surgery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed and informed by phenomenological research methods. RESULTS: Patients in our study described 3 key issues around their postponement of elective surgery. Patients described robust narratives about the meanings of their elective surgeries as the chance to \\"return to normal\\" and alleviate symptoms that impacted everyday life. Second, because of the meanings most of our patients ascribed to their surgeries, postponement often took a toll on how patients managed physical health and emotional well-being. Finally, paradoxically, many patients in our study were demonstrative that they would \\"rather die from a heart attack\\" than be exposed to the coronavirus.

Design/methodology/approach A conceptual framework is suggested to study the ability of a service firm to make adaptations to pandemic conditions based on the nature of its services: namely, the act of production and the type of recipient and the predisposed ability of the customer to accept the service firm's adaptations to social distancing restrictions. Under this framework, it is demonstrated that service adaptations made due to COVID-19 business restrictions and the customers' acceptance of them determine whether these changes are likely to become permanent. Findings A classification scheme is developed to determine four classes of service firms' adaptations to their normal course of business made under pandemic conditions and suggestions given on how to project which adaptations may persist beyond the pandemic and why. Research limitations/implications A conceptual framework grounded on Lovelock classification to present projections needs to be empirically tested. Practical implications Managerial insights based on the study and suggestions for research on what business practices are most likely to be permanently changed in a post-pandemic world for services are offered.

However, implementing research in emergency settings poses the challenge of producing valuable knowledge rapidly while upholding research ethical standards. Research ethics committees (RECs) therefore must conduct timely and rigorous ethics reviews and oversight of COVID-19 research. In the LA region, there is limited knowledge on how countries have responded to this need. To address this gap, the objective of our project is to explore if LA countries developed policies to streamline ethics review and oversight of research in response to the pandemic while ensuring its adherence to ethical standards, and to analyze to what extent these governance frameworks are in accordance with international guidance. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive and exploratory study assessing the COVID-19 research ethics governance frameworks of 19 LA countries, considering 4 dimensions based on international COVID-19 ethics guidance documents: (i) ethics review organizational model adopted, (ii) measures to coordinate between RECs and other research stakeholders, (iii) operational guidance for RECs, and (iv) key ethical issues for review and oversight of COVID-19 research. RESULTS: 10 out of 19 LA countries have some policy to streamline ethics review of COVID-19 research. Of these countries only 6 issued comprehensive documents following international guidance that contemplate strategies with recommendations for concrete actions for a timely and rigorous review. CONCLUSION: LA countries adopted partial strategies and operational guidance that may demonstrate a lack of a comprehensive view of research ethics for the review and oversight of COVID-19 research. Continuing efforts should be directed to strengthen LA countries' research capacity to respond timely and ethically to future health emergencies. Past lessons and the ones from this pandemic should be the basis to develop international standards and operational guidelines for ethics review and oversight of any research for public health emergencies.

Here, we aimed to establish whether the length of uniportal incision could affect postoperative pain and surgical outcomes in consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS lobectomy for early stage lung cancer. METHODS This was a unicenter Randomized Control Trial (NCT03218098). Consecutive patients undergoing uniportal VATS lobectomy for Stage I lung cancer were randomly assigned to a Small Incision group or Long Incision group in 1:1 ratio based on whether patients received a 4 cm or 8 cm incision. The endpoints were to compare the intergroup difference regarding (i) postoperative pain measured by brief pain inventory (BPI) questionnaire (first endpoint); (ii) operative time; (iii) length of chest drainage; (iv) length of hospital stay; (v) postoperative complications; and (vi) pulmonary functional status (secondary endpoints). RESULTS A total of 48 patients were eligible for the study. Four patients were excluded; the study population included 44 patients: 23 within the Small Incision group, and 21 within the Long Incision group. The 11 BPI scores between the two groups showed no significant difference. Small Incision group presented higher operative time than Long Incision group (138.69 vs. 112.14 minutes; P = 0.0001) while no significant differences were found regarding length of hospital stay (P = 0.95); respiratory complications (P = 0.92); FEV1% (P = 0.63), and 6-Minute Walking Test (P = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS A larger incision for uniportal VATS lobectomy significantly reduced the operative time due to better exposure of the anatomical structures without increasing postoperative pain or affecting the surgical outcome. KEY POINTS A larger incision for uniportal VATS lobectomy significantly reduced the operative time due to better exposure of the anatomical structures without increasing postoperative pain or affecting the surgical outcome. To perform a larger incision could be a valuable strategy, particularly in nonexpert hands or when the patient's anatomy or tumor size make exposure of anatomic structures through smaller incisions difficult.","output":"Does the length of uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy affect postoperative pain?

The seminal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 or its components, testicular disruptions due to viral infection and oxidative damage in the testis have all been evidenced recently. High-dose of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, have been shown to be a useful treatment for COVID-19 patients, to alleviate systemic inflammation and OS. In addition, vitamin C is a major testicular antioxidant that neutralizes excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevents sperm agglutination, prevents lipid peroxidation, recycles vitamin E, and protects against DNA damage. Thus, the present review aims to discuss the mechanism of COVID-19-mediated male reproductive dysfunctions, based on the evidence available so far, and explore the possibility of using vitamin C in alleviating testicular OS and associated damage caused by COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19, oxidative stress, and male reproductive dysfunctions: Vitamin C as a potential remedy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To externally validate an intensive care unit (ICU) mortality prediction model that was created using the Ontario Critical Care Information System (CCIS), which includes the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS). METHODS: We applied the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) recommendations to a prospective longitudinal cohort of patients discharged between 1 July 2015 and 31 December 31 2016 from 90 adult level-3 critical care units in Ontario. We used multivariable logistic regression with measures of discrimination, calibration-in-the-large, calibration slope, and flexible calibration plots to compare prediction model performance of the entire data set and for each ICU subtype. RESULTS: Among 121,201 CCIS records with ICU mortality of 11.3%, the C-statistic for the validation data set was 0.805. The C-statistic ranged from 0.775 to 0.846 among the ICU subtypes. After intercept recalibration to adjust the baseline risk, the mean predicted risk of death matched actual ICU mortality. The calibration slope was close to 1 with all CCIS data and ICU subtypes of cardiovascular and community hospitals with low ventilation rates. Calibration slopes significantly less than 1 were found for ICUs in teaching hospitals and community hospitals with high ventilation rates whereas coronary care units had a calibration slope significantly higher than 1. Calibration plots revealed over-prediction in high risk groups to a varying degree across all cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: A risk prediction model primarily based on the MODS shows reproducibility and transportability after intercept recalibration.

METHODS: Brain [(18)F]FDG PET imaging of 237 patients scanned with one scanner was used for the development of AI technology. The developed algorithm was then tested on [(18)F]FDG PET images of 45 patients scanned with three different scanners, [(18)F]FET PET images of 18 patients scanned with two different scanners, as well as [(18)F]Florbetapir images of 10 patients. A conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) was customized for cross-scanner and cross-tracer optimization. Three nuclear medicine physicians independently assessed the utility of the results in a clinical setting.

Safety zones can be used to protect healthcare workers caring for patients with infectious pathogens. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our hospital developed a Warm Zone model (WZM) to streamline the care of patients with COVID. We established specific areas in our COVID cohort units where staff were permitted to bridge between rooms without doffing gowns, but still doffing gloves and performing hand hygiene between patients. We recognized that a WZM could inadvertently increase risk of nosocomial transmission of pathogens if gowns acted as fomites. For this reason, patients with known infectious pathogens were excluded from the WZM. To measure for unintended harmful consequences of the WZM, our Infection Prevention (IP) department performed surveillance for hospital onset (HO) Clostridioides difficile (CDI), Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and Methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections on units that implemented the WZM. METHODS: Two intensive care units and 3 wards where COVID positive patients were cohorted were included in surveillance. The timeframe for this analysis was 7/1/2020 - 3/31/2021. An electronic surveillance system was used to measure HO infections. The National Healthcare Surveillance Network (NHSN) LabID definitions were used when determining HO CDI and MRSA bloodstream infections (BSI). RESULTS: During the study period, there were no HO CRE, 1 HO CDI, and 2 HO MRSA BSI in cohort units. There was no evidence to suggest that the HO CDI or HO MRSA BSI were associated with use of a WZM. During this time period, there were 14 cases of community onset (CO) CDI, 2 cases of CO MRSA BSI, and one CO CRE. CONCLUSION: During use of a WZM in COVID cohort units, IP did not identify significant increase in HO CDI, CRE, or MRSA BSI compared to non-cohort units. We were limited in our ability to measure acquisition of pathogens because active surveillance screening for colonization was not performed. However, we were able to safely employ a WZM to streamline patient care in COVID cohort areas without evidence of causing nosocomial infections via patient-to-patient transmission.

We analyzed the following data from long-term participants in a decentralized multinational study: symptoms of depression, heart rate (HR) during the day and night; social activity; sedentary state, steps and physical activity of varying intensity. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses with repeated measures were fitted to assess the changes among three time periods (pre, during and post-lockdown) across the groups, adjusting for depression severity before the pandemic and gender. Results. Participants with MDD (N=255) and MS (N=214) were included in the analyses. Overall, depressive symptoms remained stable across the three periods in both groups. Lower mean HR and HR variation were observed between pre and during lockdown during the day for MDD and during the night for MS.

METHODS: Data from 7678 adults ages 18 or older were collected from the four most populous U.S. States, specifically New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and from English-speaking Canada at three timepoints, in May and July 2020, and March 2021 using a web-based survey (www.covid19-database.com). Sociodemographic information was collected, and comprehensive psychological assessments were administered. Univariate analyses were performed to identify the individual determinants of vaccine hesitancy, which were categorized as: 1) vaccine confidence, 2) vaccine complacency, 3) sociodemographic, and 4) other psychological factors. A series of models were computed using these categorizations. RESULTS: Mistrust of vaccine benefit ((SE) = 0.67(0.01), p<0.001, partial (2) = 0.26) and lower perceived seriousness of COVID-19 ((SE) = 0.68(0.02), p<0.001, partial (2) = 0.12) were the principal determinants of vaccine hesitancy.

MEASUREMENTS Clinical characteristics, interventions, and in-hospital maternal and fetal outcomes were obtained through medical chart abstraction. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between influenza A subtype and severe maternal influenza-associated outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or in-hospital death. RESULTS Of 9652 women aged 15 to 44 years and hospitalized with influenza, 2690 (27.9%) were pregnant. Among the 2690 pregnant women, the median age was 28 years, 62% were in their third trimester, and 42% had at least 1 underlying condition. Overall, 32% were vaccinated against influenza and 88% received antiviral treatment. Five percent required ICU admission, 2% required mechanical ventilation, and 0.3% (n = 8) died. Pregnant women with influenza A H1N1 were more likely to have severe outcomes than those with influenza A H3N2 (adjusted risk ratio, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3 to 2.8]).

However, these effects continue to be felt throughout many classrooms as students and instructors struggle to return to any semblance of normalcy. Our research sought to investigate the following question: How do students' interactions with lecture recordings and perceptions of their study strategies differ between the Fall 2020 and Fall 2021 semesters? We examined this question in a large undergraduate anatomy class in the Midwest. During the Fall of 2020, all of our lectures were pre-recorded and posted online. During the Fall of 2021, these same recordings were used again, but in-person active learning sessions were also provided to enhance student engagement with the material. We hypothesized that students having in-person active learning sessions would help students to stay caught up with the lecture recordings compared to when there were no in-person sessions. We also hypothesized that student study strategies would change with the presence of in-person active learning. The present study utilized learning analytics from the course management system to assess student engagement with the video recordings and student survey responses to examine student perceptions and study strategies for each semester. These data were then compared with both lab and lecture exam grades and course outcomes to determine how effectively students are interacting with these materials within the context of each semester. The results found that students continue to struggle with staying caught up on lecture recordings and are even less likely to engage with the lecture recordings when in-person active learning sessions are offered as well. However, this lack of engagement with these resources also corresponded with a significant drop in the average exam grades for the course despite the availability of additional resources.

At N/P 1, only 40% siRNA condensation was achieved with non-grafted polymer, but 95% siRNA was condensed with copolymer PEI25k-(PCL570-PEG5k)(5). Intracellular uptake studies with confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the cellular uptake was increased with graft density, and copolymer PEI25k-(PCL570-PEG5k)(5) was able to deliver siRNA much more efficiently into the cytosol than into the nucleus. The in vitro knockdown effect of siRNA/hyPEI-g-PCL-b-PEG was also significantly improved with increasing graft density, and the most potent copolymer PEI25k-(PCL570-PEG5k)(5) knocked down 84.43% of the GAPDH expression. Complexes of both the copolymers with graft density 3 and 5 circulated much longer than unmodified PEI25 kDa and free siRNA, leading to a longer elimination half-life, a slower clearance and a three- or fourfold increase of the AUC compared to free siRNA, respectively. We demonstrated that the graft density of the amphiphilic chains can enhance the siRNA delivery efficiency and blood circulation, which highlights the development of safe and efficient non-viral polymeric siRNA nanocarriers that are especially stable and provide longer circulation in vivo.","output":"Enhancing in vivo circulation and siRNA delivery with biodegradable polyethylenimine-graft-polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has in multiple ways affected healthcare delivery to non-COVID patients throughout the world.

A 56 % reduction in total transfusion sessions was observed in 2020 (588 sessions given to 176 patients) compared to 1336 sessions in 516 patients over the same period in 2019. The reductions were seen across the different blood components (packed red blood cells [PRBC]: 585 vs. 1840, platelet rich plasma: 372 vs. 1313, single donor platelet 18 vs. 16), with a significant reduction in the mean PRBC transfused per PRBC transfusion session (1.11 vs 1.99, p<0.001) in 2020, compared to 2019. There were however no major differences in the transfusion practices across the different phases of the lockdown.

Specifically, this study focuses on how the anharmonicities and couplings in these ions are reflected in the vibrational spectra by exploring the intensities of the transitions to states with excitation in both the OH and the OO stretching vibrations and changes in the frequency of the OO stretching vibration when the OH stretching vibration is excited. These questions are addressed through the application of several approximate treatments that are based on an adiabatic separation of the high-frequency OH and low-frequency OO stretching vibrations as well as low-order expansions of the potential and dipole surfaces. While an adiabatic approximation captures most of the trends found in the spectra and from an analysis of the two-dimensional model, a vibrational Franck-Condon approach fails to capture the intensities of these transitions. Of the terms in the expansion of the dipole moment function, those that are proportional to rOH and rOH2 are found to provide the largest contributions to the calculated intensities of the transitions involving excitation of both the OH and the OO stretches. This leads to the conclusion that the intensities of these transitions encode information about the frequency and anharmonicity of the OH stretching vibration and how they are affected by changes in the OO distance. The anharmonicity of the potential also leads to changes in the OO stretching frequency with excitation of the OH stretching vibration. The direction of this change in frequency encodes additional information about the strength of the ionic hydrogen bond.","output":"Exploring the Origins of Spectral Signatures of Strong Hydrogen Bonding in Protonated Water Clusters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A descriptive analysis of 416 documents was performed using bibliometric techniques, in order to gather existing knowledge in circular economy (CE) focusing on waste management (2007C2020).

SETTING Ophthalmology department of Centro Hospitalar e Universitrio do Porto (CHUP), Oporto, Portugal. DESIGN Cross-sectional, non-randomized, retrospective study. METHOD ology: Data of all patients waiting for cataract surgery were analysed at the beginning of May 2020, after two months without performing elective surgery. The waiting time since surgical inscription was considered an independent and overriding factor. Also, higher priority was given to patients with white or brunescent cataracts and patients with low visual acuity: corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) 20/200 in binocular patients or CDVA 20/63 in monocular patients. Criteria of medium priority included patients that remained with anisometropia and patients with glaucoma or low to moderate risk of chronic angle closure. Data of scheduled surgeries in the following months were then analyzed. RESULTS A total of 717 patients were waiting for phacoemulsification in our center. 191 patients (26.64%) had more than 4.5 months on the waiting list; the medium waiting time was 3.511.57 months. According to both priority criteria and waiting time, 48.6% (n=348) were categorized as priority cases. A total of 158 patients (22.0%) met the highest priority; 61 patients (8.5%) met the medium priority criteria. In 129 patients (18.0%), priority was considered based solely on higher waiting time. This algorithm allowed us to operate all priority cases within the first three months.

We aimed to identify possible predictors of in-hospital major cardiovascular (CV) events in COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively included patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 10 centers. Clinical, biochemical, electrocardiographic, and imaging data at admission and medications were collected. Primary endpoint was a composite of in-hospital CV death, acute heart failure (AHF), acute myocarditis, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes (ACS), cardiocirculatory arrest, and pulmonary embolism (PE). Results: Of the 748 patients included, 141(19%) reached the set endpoint: 49 (7%) CV death, 15 (2%) acute myocarditis, 32 (4%) sustained-supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, 14 (2%) cardiocirculatory arrest, 8 (1%) ACS, 41 (5%) AHF, and 39 (5%) PE. Patients with CV events had higher age, body temperature, creatinine, high-sensitivity troponin, white blood cells, and platelet counts at admission and were more likely to have systemic hypertension, renal failure (creatinine  1.25 mg/dL), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, and cardiomyopathy.

SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a receptor for cell entry and infection. While both ACE inhibitors and spironolactone can upregulate tissue ACE2, there are important points of discrimination between these approaches. The virus requires proteolytic processing of its spike protein by transmembrane protease receptor serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) to enable binding to cellular ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 contains an androgen promoter, it may be downregulated by the antiandrogenic actions of spironolactone. Furin and plasmin also process the spike protein. They are inhibited by protease nexin 1 or serine E2 (PN1) that is upregulated by angiotensin II but downregulated by aldosterone. Therefore, spironolactone should selectively downregulate furin and plasmin. Furin also promotes pulmonary edema while plasmin promotes hemovascular dysfunction. Thus, a downregulation of furin and plasmin by PN1 could be a further benefit of MRAs beyond their well established organ protection. We review the evidence that spironolactone may be the preferred RASSi to increase PN1 and decrease TMPRSS2, furin and plasmin activities and thereby to reduce viral cell binding, entry, infectivity and bad outcomes.

Saliency detection is generally a complex process to copycat the human vision system in the processing of color images. It is a convoluted process because of the existence of countless properties inherent in color images that can hamper performance. Due to diversified color image properties, a method that is appropriate for one category of images may not necessarily be suitable for others. The selection of image abstraction is a decisive preprocessing step in saliency computation and region-based image abstraction has become popular because of its computational efficiency and robustness. However, the performances of the existing region-based salient object detection methods are extremely hooked on the selection of an optimal region granularity. The incorrect selection of region granularity is potentially prone to under- or over-segmentation of color images, which can lead to a non-uniform highlighting of salient objects. In this study, the method of color histogram clustering was utilized to automatically determine suitable homogenous regions in an image. Region saliency score was computed as a function of color contrast, contrast ratio, spatial feature, and center prior. Morphological operations were ultimately performed to eliminate the undesirable artifacts that may be present at the saliency detection stage. Thus, we have introduced a novel, simple, robust, and computationally efficient color histogram clustering method that agglutinates color contrast, contrast ratio, spatial feature, and center prior for detecting salient objects in color images. Experimental validation with different categories of images selected from eight benchmarked corpora has indicated that the proposed method outperforms 30 bottom-up non-deep learning and seven top-down deep learning salient object detection methods based on the standard performance metrics.","output":"Detecting Salient Image Objects Using Color Histogram Clustering for Region Granularity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one ML algorithm and limited performance evaluation to \\"area under the curve\\" (AUC). To obtain best results possible, it may be important to try multiple algorithms using machine learning (ML) to optimize performance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning (ML) algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we investigated which variables (i.e. vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc.) were most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: The data was retrospectively collected at our institution on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity. Patients were followed up for 30 days or death. This data was used for autoML to build 20 ML models with various algorithms. The main performance of ML models was measured by area under the precision recall curve (AUCPR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP). Finally, dimensionality reduction was conducted to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML was retrained using only these 10 variables and its output models was evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Input from 4313 patients was used. The best model that autoML generated using 48 variables was the stacked ensemble models (AUCPR = 0.807). The two best independent models were the Gradient Boost Models (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) models with AUCPR of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. Deep learning models were significantly inferior with AUCPR = 0.73. The ten most influential variables in generating high performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, troponin, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model again performed the best with AUCPR of 0.791. CONCLUSIONS: By using autoML, we have developed high-performing models that predict survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method to generate ML based clinical decision supporting tools.","output":"Using Automated-Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Patient Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is involved in the replication of a broad range of viruses. Since replication of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is impaired upon proteasomal inhibition, the relevance of the UPS for the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was investigated in this study. We demonstrate that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibits SARS-CoV replication by interfering with early steps of the viral life cycle. Surprisingly, other proteasomal inhibitors (e.g., lactacystin and bortezomib) only marginally affected viral replication, indicating that the effect of MG132 is independent of proteasomal impairment. Induction of autophagy by MG132 treatment was excluded from playing a role, and no changes in SARS-CoV titers were observed during infection of wild-type or autophagy-deficient ATG5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts overexpressing the human SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since MG132 also inhibits the cysteine protease m-calpain, we addressed the role of calpains in the early SARS-CoV life cycle using calpain inhibitors III (MDL28170) and VI (SJA6017). In fact, m-calpain inhibition with MDL28170 resulted in an even more pronounced inhibition of SARS-CoV replication (>7 orders of magnitude) than did MG132. Additional m-calpain knockdown experiments confirmed the dependence of SARS-CoV replication on the activity of the cysteine protease m-calpain. Taken together, we provide strong experimental evidence that SARS-CoV has unique replication requirements which are independent of functional UPS or autophagy pathways compared to other coronaviruses.

Workforce development, mentorship, and training are important components in building laboratory capability and capacity to assess risk of and mitigate emerging disease outbreaks. International partnerships that fund cooperative research through mentoring and on-the-job training are successful examples for enhancing infectious disease surveillance. Cooperative research studies between the Naval Medical Research Center's Rickettsial Diseases Research Program (RDRP) and 17 institutes from nine countries among five continents were conducted to address the presence of and the risk for endemic rickettsial diseases. To establish serological and molecular assays in the collaborative institutes, initial training and continued material, and technical support were provided by RDRP. The laboratory methods used in the research studies to detect and identify the rickettsial infections included (1) group-specific IgM and IgG serological assays and (2) molecular assays. Twenty-six cooperative research projects performed between 2008 and 2020 enhanced the capability and capacity of 17 research institutes to estimate risk of rickettsial diseases. These international collaborative studies have led to the recognition and/or confirmation of rickettsial diseases within each of the partner countries. In addition, with the identification of specific pathogen and non-pathogen Rickettsia species, a more accurate risk assessment could be made in surveillance studies using environmental samples. The discoveries from these projects reinforced international cooperation benefiting not only the partner countries but also the scientific community at large through presentations (n = 40) at international scientific meetings and peer-reviewed publications (n = 18). The cooperative research studies conducted in multiple international institutes led to the incorporation of new SOPs and trainings for laboratory procedures; biosafety, biosurety, and biosecurity methods; performance of rickettsia-specific assays; and the identification of known and unknown rickettsial agents through the introduction of new serologic and molecular assays that complemented traditional microbiology methods.","output":"International Rickettsia Disease Surveillance: An Example of Cooperative Research to Increase Laboratory Capability and Capacity for Risk Assessment of Rickettsial Outbreaks Worldwide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools and universities had to the shift from face-to-face to distance teaching, organizing on-line lectures.

Methods: We included 5224 patients with COVID-19 with an available smoking history in a multicentre international registry Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19 (NCT04334291). Patients were included following an in-hospital admission with a COVID-19 diagnosis. We analysed the outcomes of patients with a current or prior history of smoking compared with the non-smoking group. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital death. Results: Finally, 5224 patients with COVID-19 with available smoking status were analysed.

The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and acceptability of a newly developed, manualized single-session CCC intervention delivered face-to-face with service users in acute and crisis psychology services in South London. The study adopted a within-subjects pre-post-test design. Participants (N = 23) were recruited from five acute psychiatric wards and a crisis resolution home treatment team. Service users had a range of diagnoses of complex and severe mental health conditions, in particular mood, personality, and psychotic disorders. Feasibility data were gathered for number of times the CCC formulation was accepted, duration of CCC intervention, clinician adherence to manualised protocol, and frequency of goal-based activity completion. Acceptability data on pre- and post-CCC mood and post-CCC helpfulness were self-reported by participants. Findings indicated a significant increase in positive mood (large effect) and moderate-high helpfulness rating postintervention. Most participants reported goal-based activity completion. There was high fidelity to the protocol, high percentage of acceptance of the formulation and formulation components completed, and frequent single-session completion. Single-session CCC appears feasible and acceptable in acute and crisis psychology services and yields formulation-driven goal-based activities intended to stabilize mental health crisis. High fidelity to formulation protocol suggests broader applications for single-session CCC, for example, to support clinical staff to manage crisis situations in their work environment or to train nonpsychologist clinicians to deliver the intervention for service users. A randomized controlled trial of single-session CCC would increase validity and generalisability of findings.","output":"Single-session Comprehend, Cope, and Connect intervention in acute and crisis psychology: A feasibility and acceptability study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Global Pandemic COVID-19 caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS COV 2) spreading rapidly and become a serious challenge for the entire healthcare profession It results in a significant burden on the human race There is no effective treatment so far discovered for the SARS CO V 2 As the modified strain of the virus is new the research on various aspect like pathogenesis, prognosis, etc are limited due to lack of time and rapidly spreading The best measure is prevention by maintaining social distancing and other hygienic measures Objective: The surveyor study Aims to determine the level of awareness, perception and professional knowledge of COVID 19, Global pandemic in different aspects like mode of transmission, Preventive and Precaution and approved treatment protocol among Pharmacy students at various stages in the study one of the vital aims is to identify the key source of gained awareness as well as identify which of these were is the most effective in information delivery Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Pharmacy students of Gayatri Colege of Pharmacy, Sambalpur using a questionnaire total of 50 Participants who fully completed the questionnaire were included in the Study Conclusion: The result suggests that Participants basic knowledge about COVID-19 is acceptable Although improvements are advised in the understanding of preventive measures that can be taken, Recommended more focus towards it as it is so helpful in creating Awareness ?

This paper investigates the effects of the tax reform under the Constitutional Amendment Bill 45/2019 on cigarette prices, consumption and tax collection. The reform will introduce a new goods and services tax (GST) and tobacco excise tax (TET). METHODS: The micro data from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) of 2008 and the National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013 are inputs in the simulation in order to determine the smoking behaviour and consumer responses to price changes as accurately as possible across the different Brazilian states. We developed three scenarios for the tobacco tax reform and their effects on cigarette prices, smoking behaviour and tax collection. We also estimate the size of the illicit cigarette market by Brazilian state and simulate the impacts of a 10% reduction in its market share. FINDINGS: Overall, we found that a GST of 27% and a TET of either 51%, 56% or specific 3.89 BRL per pack would lead to considerably higher cigarette prices, lower cigarette consumption and, above all, an increase of cigarette tax collection between 8% and 27% depending on the state. A discretionary 10% reduction in the illicit market would add about 8.5% of extra tax collection per year to the country. CONCLUSIONS: The simulated scenarios demonstrated that, to keep the cigarette prices at least at the same level as those in the current tax scheme, TET should be no less than 77.85% of the retail price. This means that any politically feasible tax reform should result in higher cigarette prices and a reduction in cigarette consumption. Considering the nationwide effect, in all scenarios, the total increase in tobacco tax revenue is around 8.5% or 1.5 billion BRL per year. This extra revenue is highly desirable in an environment of chronic fiscal imbalance and the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","output":"Effects of the Brazilian tax reform plans on the tobacco market"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most effective way to control newly emerging infectious disease, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, is to strengthen preventative or therapeutic public health strategies before the infection spreads worldwide. However, global health systems remain at the early stages in anticipating effective therapeutics or vaccines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While maintaining social distance is the most crucial metric to avoid spreading the virus, symptomatic therapy given to patients on the clinical manifestations helps save lives. The molecular properties of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been quickly elucidated, paving the way to therapeutics, vaccine development, and other medical interventions. Despite this progress, the detailed biomolecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. Given virus invasion of cells is a determining factor for virulence, understanding the viral entry process can be a mainstay in controlling newly emerged viruses. Since viral entry is mediated by selective cellular proteases or proteins associated with receptors, identification and functional analysis of these proteins could provide a way to disrupt virus propagation. This review comprehensively discusses cellular machinery necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding multifactorial traits of the virus entry will provide a substantial guide to facilitate antiviral drug development.","output":"Multifactorial Traits of SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Related to Diverse Host Proteases and Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies were produced to JHMV-DL, a neurotropic member of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or murine coronavirus group.

Eleven different MHV isolates were used in antibody binding assays to study antigenic relationships among the viruses. Each MHV isolate tested had a unique pattern of antibody binding, indicating that each is a distinct strain. Conservation of JHMV-DL antigenic determinants varied among the three proteins, with pp60 showing intermediate conservation, gp180/90 little conservation, and gp25 marked conservation in the different MHV strains. Monoclonal antibodies to pp60 proved most useful in delineating antigenic relationships among MHV strains.

The challenge in outpatient monitoring the highly contagious COVID-19 disease during the ongoing pandemic is to filter severe courses followed by admission to hospital with the aim of preventing an overburdening of clinics. However, little is known of the effect of risk factors on the course of the infection of outpatient patients. To support general practices in managing high risk patients, we designed a COVID-19 surveillance and care tool (CovidCare). It includes an initial assessment of yet known risk factors and symptoms and a continuous telephone monitoring of signs and symptoms. This study aims to investigate the effects of different risk factors on the course of the COVID-19 disease, utilisation of different health care services and to gain insights into the utilisation of CovidCare in general practices. Methods: We will conduct a multi-centered prospective, longitudinal non-controlled observational trial of COVID-19 patients in general practices. Overall, 700 GPs who participate in general-practice centered care by the AOK Baden-Wrttemberg (large German sickness fund) are eligible and will be invited for study participation, including adult, outpatient COVID-19 patients (or urgent suspicion and  50 years) with at least one additional known risk factor, who participate in general-practice centered care. The primary outcome is hospitalisation due to COVID-19. Secondary outcomes are diagnosis of pneumonia, utilisation of palliative care, mortality rate, anxiety and identification of predictive risk factors. Quantitative data analysis will focus on valid descriptive figures and mixed regression models. The accompanying process evaluation is based on interviews and questionnaires from general practice staff and patients. The analysis of the process evaluation is descriptive and explorative. Discussion: The use of the COVID-19 surveillance and care tool is expected to encourage the provision of structured quality of care during the ongoing pandemic. This trial will provide an understanding of the COVID-19-disease and the effect of several risk factors on the course of the disease and health care utilisation.

METHODS AND RESULTS We compared the outcomes of the retrograde versus antegrade-only approach to chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention among 1301 procedures performed at 11 experienced US centers between 2012 and 2015. The mean age was 65.510 years, and 84% of the patients were men with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (45%) and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (34%). Overall technical and procedural success rates were 90% and 89%, respectively, and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 31 patients (2.4%). The retrograde approach was used in 539 cases (41%), either as the initial strategy (46%) or after a failed antegrade attempt (54%). When compared with antegrade-only cases, retrograde cases were significantly more complex, both clinically (previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery prevalence, 48% versus 24%; P<0.001) and angiographically (mean Japan-chronic total occlusion score, 3.11.0 versus 2.11.2; P<0.001) and had lower technical success (85% versus 94%; P<0.001) and higher major adverse cardiovascular events (4.3% versus 1.1%; P<0.001) rates. On multivariable analysis, the presence of suitable collaterals, no smoking, no previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and left anterior descending artery target vessel were independently associated with technical success using the retrograde approach. CONCLUSIONS The retrograde approach is commonly used in contemporary chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention, especially among more challenging lesions and patients. Although associated with lower success and higher major adverse cardiovascular event rates in comparison to antegrade-only crossing, retrograde percutaneous coronary intervention remains critical for achieving overall high success rates.","output":"Outcomes With the Use of the Retrograde Approach for Coronary Chronic Total Occlusion Interventions in a Contemporary Multicenter US Registry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The number of patients, infected with COVID-19, began to increase very rapidly in India from March 2020.

Clinical studies have indicated that patients with severe COVIDC19 exhibit delayed and weak adaptive immune responses; however, the mechanism by which SARSCCoVC2 impedes adaptive immunity remains unclear. Here, by using an in vitro cell line, we report that the SARSCCoVC2 spike protein significantly inhibits DNA damage repair, which is required for effective V(D)J recombination in adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, we found that the spike protein localizes in the nucleus and inhibits DNA damage repair by impeding key DNA repair protein BRCA1 and 53BP1 recruitment to the damage site.

MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred forty patients with NSCLC with BM treated between 2012-2015 were registered in a prospective cohort study (CTRI/2013/01/003299). The baseline quality of life was evaluated using the EORTC general quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 and lung cancer specific module LC13. Minimum important difference (MID) scores for individual domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires were derived (MID = 0.2 x standard deviation) from the reference data for patients with recurrent/metastatic lung cancers. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to identify studies reporting baseline quality of life scores for recurrent/metastatic NSCLC. RESULTS Scores of several functional as well as symptom scales in the current NSCLC population differed by more than the MID from the baseline mean scores in the reference EORTC population as well as that reported from other studies. Differences in mean score from the EORTC reference data ranged from 6.2 and 9.4 points for the role functioning and cognitive functioning domains. In the symptom scales, the largest differences were observed for the financial difficulties (23.9) scores for the QLQ-C30 and peripheral neuropathy (21.7) for LC13 questionnaires. CONCLUSION The current study demonstrates that baseline reference scores need to be established for patients from the Indian subcontinent. The findings from the current study have important implications for studies employing quality of life (QOL) assessment in the Indian NSCLC patient population.","output":"Reference Data for Standardized Quality of Life Questionnaires in Indian Patients with Brain Metastases from Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: Results from a Prospective Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background We present a deep learning (DL)-based automated whole lung and COVID-19 pneumonia infectious lesions (COLI-Net) detection and segmentation from chest CT images. Methods We prepared 2358 ( 347259, 2D slices) and 180 (17341, 2D slices) volumetric CT images along with their corresponding manual segmentation of lungs and lesions, respectively, in the framework of a multi-center/multi-scanner study. All images were cropped, resized and the intensity values clipped and normalized. A residual network (ResNet) with non-square Dice loss function built upon TensorFlow was employed. The accuracy of lung and COVID-19 lesions segmentation was evaluated on an external RT-PCR positive COVID-19 dataset (7333, 2D slices) collected at five different centers. To evaluate the segmentation performance, we calculated different quantitative metrics, including radiomic features. Results The mean Dice coefficients were 0.98&0.011 (95% CI, 0.98-0.99) and 0.91&0.038 (95% CI, 0.90-0.91) for lung and lesions segmentation, respectively. The mean relative Hounsfield unit differences were 0.03&0.84% (95% CI, -0.12-0.18) and -0.18&3.4% (95% CI, -0.8 - 0.44) for the lung and lesions, respectively. The relative volume difference for lung and lesions were 0.38&1.2% (95% CI, 0.16-0.59) and 0.81&6.6% (95% CI, -0.39-2), respectively. Most radiomic features had a mean relative error less than 5% with the highest mean relative error achieved for the lung for the Range first-order feature (-6.95%) and least axis length shape feature (8.68%) for lesions.

Given the effects of COVID-19 in pulmonary tissues, chest radiography imaging plays an important role for the screening, early detection and monitoring of the suspected individuals. Hence, as the pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, there will be a greater reliance on the use of portable equipment for the acquisition of chest X-Ray images due to its accessibility, widespread availability and benefits regarding to infection control issues, minimizing the risk of cross contamination. This work presents novel fully automatic approaches specifically tailored for the classification of chest X-Ray images acquired by portable equipment into 3 different clinical categories: normal, pathological and COVID-19. For this purpose, two complementary deep learning approaches based on a densely convolutional network architecture are herein presented. The joint response of both approaches allows to enhance the differentiation between patients infected with COVID-19, patients with other diseases that manifest characteristics similar to COVID-19 and normal cases. The proposed approaches were validated over a dataset provided by the Radiology Service of the Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru&ntildea (CHUAC) specifically retrieved for this research. Despite the poor quality of chest X-Ray images that is inherent to the nature of the portable equipment, the proposed approaches provided satisfactory results, allowing a reliable analysis of portable radiographs, to support the clinical decision-making process.","output":"Deep convolutional approaches for the analysis of Covid-19 using chest X-Ray images from portable devices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Controversy exists about whether cutting diathermy for skin incisions leads to a cosmetically inferior scar. Cosmetic outcomes were compared between skin incisions created with cutting diathermy versus scalpel. Wound infection rates and postoperative incisional pain were also compared. METHODS This was a randomized double-blind trial comparing cutting diathermy and scalpel in patients undergoing bowel resection. Scar cosmesis was assessed at 6 months after surgery by a plastic surgeon and a research associate using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Patients also used POSAS to self-evaluate their scars. Wound infections within 30 days were recorded, and incision pain scores were measured on the first 5 days after operation. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were randomized to cutting diathermy (31) or scalpel (35). At 6 months, there was no significant difference between the diathermy and scalpel groups in mean(s.d.) VSS scores (49(26) versus 50(19); P = 0837), mean POSAS total scores (192(80) versus 200(74); P = 0684) or subjective POSAS total scores (202(121) versus 213(104); P = 0725). Neither were there significant differences in wound infection rates between the groups (5 of 30 versus 5 of 32; P = 1000). Pain scores on day 1 after operation were significantly lower in the diathermy group (mean 168 versus 313; P = 0018), but were not significantly different on days 2-5. CONCLUSION Cutting diathermy is a cosmetically acceptable technique for abdominal skin incisions. There is no increased risk of wound infection, and diathermy may convey benefit in terms of early postoperative wound pain.

A reliable and effective emergency decision making method is great for reducing various potential losses. Hence, group emergency decision making (GEDM) has drawn great attention in past few years because of its advantages dealing with the emergencies. Due to the timeliness and complexity of GEDM, vagueness and regret aversion are common among decision makers (DMs), and decision information usually needs to be expressed by various mathematical forms. To this end, this paper proposes a novel GEDM method based on heterogeneous probabilistic hesitant information sets (PHISs) and regret theory (RT). Firstly, the PHISs with real numbers, interval numbers and linguistic terms are developed to depict the situation that decision group sways precariously between several projects and best retain the original assessment. In addition, the score functions, the divergence functions and some operations of the three types of PHISs are defined. Secondly, the normalization model of PHISs is presented to remove the influence of different dimensions on information aggregation. Thirdly, group satisfaction degree (GSD) based on the score functions and the divergence functions is combined with RT for completely portraying the regret perception of decision group. Then, we introduce Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory to determine the probabilities of future possible states for emergency events. Finally, an example of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation is given as an application for the proposed GEDM method, whose superiority, stability and validity are demonstrated by employing the comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis.

These are both difficult to diagnose and are associated with an increased mortality. Metabolomics may aid clinicians in diagnosing secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 through identification and quantification of disease specific biomarkers, with the aim of identifying underlying causative microorganisms and directing antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: This is a multi-centre prospective diagnostic observational study. Patients with COVID-19 will be recruited from critical care units in three Scottish hospitals. Three serial blood samples will be taken from patients, and an additional sample taken if a patient shows clinical or microbiological evidence of secondary infection. Samples will be analysed using LCCMS and subjected to bioinformatic processing and statistical analysis to explore the metabolite changes associated with bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients. Comparisons of the data sets will be made with standard microbiological and biochemical methods of diagnosing infection. DISCUSSION: Metabolomics analyses may provide additional strategies for identifying secondary infections, which might permit faster initiation of specific tailored antimicrobial therapy to critically ill patients with COVID-19.","output":"A Metabolomics approach for the diagnosis Of SecondAry InfeCtions in COVID-19 (MOSAIC): a study protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A patient charter is an explicit declaration of the rights of patients within a particular health care setting. In early 2020 the Save the Children Emergency Health Unit deployed to Coxs Bazar Bangladesh to support the establishment of a severe acute respiratory infection isolation and treatment centre as part of the COVID-19 response. We developed a charter of patient rights and had it translated into Bangla and Burmese; however, the charter remained inaccessible to Rohingya and members of the host community with low literacy. METHODS: To both visualise and contextualise the patient charter we undertook a graphic elicitation method involving both the Rohingya and host communities. We carried out two focus group discussions during which we discussed the charter and agreed how best to illustrate the individual rights contained therein. RESULTS: Logistical constraints and infection prevention and control procedures limited our ability to follow up with the original focus group participants and to engage in back-translation as we had planned; however, we were able to elicit rich descriptions of each right. Reflecting on our method we were able to identify several key learnings relating to: 1) our technique for eliciting feedback on the charter verbatim versus a broader discussion of concepts referenced within each right, 2) our decision to include both men and women in the same focus group, 3) our decision to ask focus group participants to describe specific features of each illustration and how this benefited the inclusivity of our illustrations, and 4) the potential of the focus groups to act as a means to introduce the charter to communities.

The extension of the COVID-19 pandemic in our country has led to a significant decline in childhood immunization, which could have severe repercussions increasing the risk of future outbreaks. Hence, the measures of the Ministry of Health to correct the situation. The purpose of this study was to highlight the extent of vaccine release during COVID-19 pandemic and to make recommendations to restore vaccination programmes. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study of the effect of containment measures during this pandemic on the monitoring of childrens vaccinations. We conducted a national survey of pediatricians using an electronic questionnaire administered via Google Forms. We collected, analyzed and interpreted the results. Results: one hundred and three Moroccan pediatricians answered the questionnaire. More than 2-thirds (78.6%) of pediatricians practiced in the private sector and delivered vaccines in the immunization schedule. The majority of pediatricians (95%) were asked about parental vaccine concerns. We noted that 82.5% of parents were reluctant to go to the local health department and 5.8% refused to take vaccination during COVID-19 pandemic. About 22% of pediatricians completely stopped immunization services and 72.8% delayed immunizations from 3 to 4 weeks. Vaccination stoppage involved older children in two thirds of cases. Conclusion: it is essential to maintain public confidence in vaccination.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we collected the first clinical laboratory data of 114 patients on admission, and 80 healthy controls. Meanwhile, we monitored the serum lipid profile, COVID-19 nucleic acid and chest CT scan of a severe patient from the early stage of infection to the recovery period for a total of 80 days. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, the patients had sharply decreased concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (P<0.001). Among the patients, HDL-cholesterol concentration in severe groups was significantly lower than the common groups [1.01 (0.88-1.20) vs 1.21 (1.02-1.48) mmol/l, P<0.001]. The lipid profile of a severe patient showed that serum cholesterol concentration significantly decreased in the early stage and returned to be normal in the recovery period. Moreover, the change of HDL-cholesterol in this patient was consistent with the results of nucleic acid tests and chest CT scans. In correlation analysis, HDL-cholesterol concentration was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP, r=-0.396, P<0.001) and positively correlated with lymphocytes (r=0.336, P<0.001).

The purpose of this study is to analyze the retraction status and reasons of non-Cochrane SRs in the field of medicine. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and Embase from their inception to April 18, 2020, as well as Retraction Watch Database and Google Scholar with no language restriction to find non-Cochrane SRs that were retracted for any reason. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data. We describe the characteristic and reasons of retraction and the duration from publication to retraction. Results: We identified 150 non-Cochrane SRs in medicine retracted between 2004 and 2020. The majority of retracted SRs were led by authors from China and affiliated with hospitals. Most SRs were published in journals with an impact factor []3, and in journal ranked in the third quarter. The largest proportion of retraction notices were issued by the publisher and editor(s) jointly; seven did not report this information. Fraudulent peer-review was the most common reason for retraction, followed by unreliable data meaning errors in study selection or data analysis. The median time between publication and retraction was 14.0 months. SRs retracted due to research misconduct took longer to retract than SRs retracted because of honest error. Conclusions: The situation with retracted SRs is critical globally, and in particular in China. The most common reasons for retraction are fraudulent peer-review and unreliable data, and in most cases the study is retracted more than a year after publication. Efforts should be made to improve the process of peer review and adherence to the COPE retraction guidance, while at the same time authors should strengthen their skills in SR methodology.

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist, suppressing the induction of type I interferon more efficiently than its SARS-CoV ortholog. Phylogenetic analyses and functional assays reveal that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from bats and pangolins also encode truncated ORF3b gene products with strong anti-interferon activity. Furthermore, analyses of approximately 17,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences identify a natural variant, in which a longer ORF3b reading frame was reconstituted. This variant was isolated from two patients with severe disease and further increased the ability of ORF3b to suppress interferon induction. Thus, our findings not only help to explain the poor interferon response in COVID-19 patients, but also describe the emergence of natural SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with an extended ORF3b gene that may potentially affect COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF3b is a potent interferon antagonist whose activity is increased by a naturally occurring elongation variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cytokines are a large group of small proteins secreted by immune and non-immune cells in response to external stimuli.

Furthermore, the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth is crucial for implementing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). These INDCs would be discounted if decreasing carbon emissions would require sacrificing economic growth. This study explored the effect of protectionism (by measuring trade openness based on available data) on the decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth. For this, the heterogenous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions were investigated using in data of 182 countries from 1990 to 2015. The results show that trade openness decreased carbon emissions in high-income and upper-middle-income countries, while having no significant impact on carbon emissions of lower-middle-income countries; even worse, for low-income countries, trade openness increased carbon emissions. The heterogeneous effects of trade openness on carbon emissions indicate that trade openness positively impacts the decoupling economic growth from carbon emission in rich countries, but negatively impacts poor countries. In addition, increasing individual incomes and population distort the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. Renewable energy and high oil prices contributed to the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. These effects are similar in all countries. Targeted policy implications are presented that enable the decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions for countries with different income levels.","output":"The effects of trade openness on decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth - Evidence from 182 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People with weakened immune systems may not develop adequate protection after taking two doses of the mRNA-combined COVID-19 vaccine. The additional dose may improve the level of protection against Covid-19. OBJECTIVES: Current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and determents of third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance among population in the UAE. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is online descriptive cross-sectional community-based study conducted among the students and faculty of Ajman University from 25 August to 20 October 2021. The questionnaire, which was in the English language, encompassed two sections containing 22 items. Section one gathered the demographic details of the respondents, while Section two used 13 questions to evaluate the respondents knowledge of and attitude to the third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. RESULTS: 614 respondents participated in this study. The average knowledge score was 44.6% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [41%, 49%]. Better knowledge scores were observed in postgraduates (OR 4.29; 95% CI 2.28C8.11), employees in the healthcare sector (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.05C2.51), participants who had relatives infected with the Covid-19 (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.05C2.02), participants who had infected with Covid-19 (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.43C3.43) and participants who had received first two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.40C3.11).

CONCLUSION: Necessary steps should be taken by the government and public health authorities, in line with the local culture, to increase vaccination acceptance and foster positive attitudes towards the vaccine. A suitable approach to this would be to develop an educational framework that could demonstrate the risks of vaccine avoidance or delay to the general population.

METHODS We retrospectively enrolled 65 Japanese children (male, 25; female, 40; age <16 years) with new-onset type 1 diabetes. A GST was conducted within 1 month after diagnosis, when glucose toxicity improved. 1 to 2-hour postprandial serum C-peptide values were measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, and 120 months after diagnosis. RESULTS Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the cutoff values of peak serum C-peptide levels used to predict the complete destruction of -cells at 3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis were all 0.20 ng/mL (area under the curve [AUC] 0.867, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.745-0.990; AUC 0.774, 95% CI 0.634-0.914; and AUC 0.804, 95% CI 0.695-0.914, respectively); the values at 24, 36, and 60 months were 0.69 ng/mL (AUC 0.828, 95% CI 0.721-0.936), 0.60 ng/mL (AUC 0.777, 95% CI 0.636-0.918), and 0.70 ng/mL (AUC 0.848, 95% CI 0.715-0.982), respectively. On multivariate analysis, peak serum C-peptide level on a GST, diabetic ketoacidosis, age and HbA1c level at diagnosis were associated with residual -cell function over time. CONCLUSIONS Peak serum C-peptide levels on a GST conducted soon after diagnosis in Japanese children with type 1 diabetes could predict the time to decrease in postprandial serum C-peptide values to less than 0.20 ng/mL.

In this study, we explore the effectiveness of a new telemonitoring system, for monitoring Vegetative State (VS) and Minimally Conscious State (MCS) patients. This was a prospective, mono-center randomized controlled study. We included only traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients who required long-term motor/cognitive assistance having a stable clinical condition. We examined their clinical evolution over ~4 years of the follow-up period. Twenty-two TBI patients were enrolled and equally divided into two groups: one telemonitored at home with our service and the second admitted to a standard long-stay hospitalization (LSH) program. Patients enrolled in the telehealth service (age: 49.9  20.4; 45% female; diagnosis: 36% VS/64% MCS) were demographically and clinically-matched with those admitted to the LSH program (age: 55.1  15; 18% female; diagnosis: 54% VS/46% MCS). Thirty-six percent of patients in the LSH program died before completing follow up evaluation with respect to 18% of death in the group of TBI patients telemonitored at home. At follow-up, patients in LSH and telemonitoring groups showed similar clinical progression, as measured by CRS-r, NCS, WHIM, and LCF scales, as well as by the number of medical complications (i.e., bedsores, infections). Finally, we estimated the total daily cost per patient. Severe TBI patients enrolled in the conventional LSH program cost 262 every single day, whereas the cost per patient in the telehealth service resulted to be less expensive (93).

Factors predicting this unfavorable outcome are unknown, but we hypothesized that diaphragmatic weakness may contribute. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the data of 27 consecutive patients admitted to the general Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from March 19, 2020, to April 20, 2020 and submitted to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) before considering invasive ventilation. Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) inferred by ultrasound was determined before applying CPAP. RESULTS: Eighteen patients recovered with CPAP, whereas nine required invasive mechanical ventilation with longer stay in ICU (p < 0.001) and hospital (p = 0.003). At univariate logistic regression analysis, CPAP failure was significantly associated with low DTF [?: -0.396; OR: 0.673; p < 0.001] and high respiratory rate [?: 0.452; OR: 1.572; p < 0.001] but only DTF reached statistical significance at multivariate analysis [?: -0.384; OR: 0.681; p < 0.001].

Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing capabilities but sensitivity concerns may limit its impact on the management of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be highly sensitive and could help by providing larger testing capabilities without compromising sensitivity. METHODS: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on a commercially available system and assay (naica? system from Stilla Technologies) and investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into groups of 8, 16 and 32 samples for RT-dPCR analysis. RESULTS: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25/448 positive samples. Using 56 groups of 8, RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding to 26 positive samples by individual PCR (positive percentage agreement 95.2% [95% confidence interval: 76.2C99.9%]) and including 2 samples not detected by individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further investigation. 15 of 28 groups of 16 tested positive, corresponding to 25 positive samples by individual PCR (positive percentage agreement 87.5% [95% confidence interval: 61.7C98.4%]). 14 groups of 32 were fully concordant with individual PCR testing but will need to be confirmed on larger datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed approach of group testing by digital PCR has similar diagnostic sensitivity compared to individual RT-PCR testing for group up to 16 samples.

In this context, approaches that reduce the complexity of the sequence space occupied by the SARS-CoV-2 population are necessary for robust clustering. Here, we propose subdividing the global SARS-CoV-2 population into six well-defined subtypes and 10 poorly represented genotypes named tentative subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons and structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ORF8) genes. The six subtypes and the additional genotypes showed amino acid replacements that might have phenotypic implications. Notably, three mutations (one of them in the Spike protein) were responsible for the geographical segregation of subtypes. We hypothesize that the virus subtypes detected in this study are records of the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 diversification that were randomly sampled to compose the virus populations around the world.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY In September 2020, a nationwide cross-sectional survey study among Dutch intensive care nurses was carried out to measure prevalence rates of symptoms of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and need for recovery (NFR), objectified by the HADS-A, HADS-D, IES-6 and NFR questionnaires, respectively. Associated risk factors were determined using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post traumatic stress disorder were reported by 27.0%, 18.6% and 22.2% of the 726 respondents, respectively. The NFR was positive, meaning not being recovered from work, in 41.7%. Working in an academic hospital, being afraid of infecting relatives and experiencing insufficient numbers of colleagues were associated with more mental symptoms, while having been on holiday was associated with reduced depression symptoms and need for recovery. CONCLUSION The first COVID-19 surge had a high impact on the mental well-being of intensive care nurses, increasing the risk for drop out and jeopardising the continuity of care.

After its discovery in China in late 2019, the virus spreads fiercely through various social transmissions, causing more than 60 million confirmed cases and close to 1.9 million deaths by early 2021. On 11th March 2020, the WHO went on to declare the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. To lessen societal pressure and restore normalcy, many countries committed to vaccination have introduced the COVID-19 immunity passports, certificates, or licenses, collectively called the COVID-19 immunity certificate. This is to legally certify that the certificate bearer has been vaccinated and is immune to COVID-19. However, there exists several practical and legal obstacles to efficiently track/trace the certificates. Matter of fact, this kind of certificate is to impose restrictions on who can and who cannot participate in an official social activity. This has regrettably promoted the fabrication of the certificate and is casting doubt on the vaccination integrity. In this paper, we thus propose a novel blockchain-based system for establishing trust on the certificate bearer and to eradicate vaccination immunity certificate fraud.

One emerging biomaterials technology is microneedle (MNs) delivery. MNs are arrays of micrometer-sized needles that are painless and efficiently deliver cargo to the specialized immunological niche of the skin. MNs typically do not require cold storage and eliminate medical sharps. Nearly all materials exhibit intrinsic properties that can bias immune responses toward either pro-immune or inhibitory effects. Thus, because MNs are fabricated from degradable polymers to enable cargo loading and release, understanding the immunological profiles of these matrices is essential to enable new MN vaccines and immunotherapies. Additionally, understanding the mechanical properties is important because MNs must penetrate the skin and conform to a variety of skin or tissue geometries. Here we fabricated MNs from important polymer classes C including extracellular matrix biopolymers, naturally-derived polymers, and synthetic polymers C with both high- and low-molecular-weights (MW). We then characterized the mechanical properties and intrinsic immunological properties of these designs. The library of polymer MNs exhibited diverse mechanical properties, while causing only modest changes in innate signaling and antigen-specific T cell proliferation. These data help inform the selection of MN substrates based on the mechanical and immunological requirements needed for a specific vaccine or immunotherapy application.","output":"Mapping the Mechanical and Immunological Profiles of Polymeric Microneedles to Enable Vaccine and Immunotherapy Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, sentiment analysis of two critical events is presented using machine learning (ML) techniques. COVID-19 has put immense pressure across the globe and sentiment analysis of data from Twitter using ML techniques has become a hot topic. We extract the COVID-19 and Expo2020 data from twitter. First, we evaluate the Twitter data of these two significant events for sentiment analysis and then use the classification algorithm to find out the usefulness of the proposed methodology. A hybrid approach that uses supervised learning model Support Vector Machine (SVM) combined with Bayes Factor Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (BFTAN) technique is proposed to accurately classify the input tweet while keeping in mind the different challenges of sentiment analysis. Our study has four main contributions: a) hybrid classification techniques are thoroughly explored for sentiment analysis, b) a novel hybrid classification approach is proposed for sentiment analysis, c) a new Twitter dataset related to COVID-19 that can be used for future research, d) empirical study to show that the hybrid-classification approach can achieve comparable performance in improving accuracy, identifying the polarity of comparative sentences, distinguishing the intensity of opinion words, considering negative words, and handling sarcasm as well. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is robust in producing correct classification results with the tradeoff of poor time efficiency. Also, the accuracy of the proposed model is comparable to other classifiers, which is encouraging. Class distribution of each dataset demonstrates that more than 60% of tweets are negative.

We conducted telephone interviews with a multi-state sample of 17 QI leaders in 15 systems. We analyzed data qualitatively via thematic analysis to describe QI leaders' perspectives on prioritizing and implementing HPV vaccine QI. All QI leaders endorsed HPV vaccination as beneficial, and some had already prioritized increasing uptake to improve adolescent health and meet payor reimbursement standards. Those not prioritizing HPV vaccination cited concerns including the relatively small size of adolescent patient populations, lack of buy-in among providers, and the need to focus on health services perceived as more profitable or urgent. When implementing HPV vaccine QI programs, QI leaders reported key barriers to be the lack of robust data systems and acceptable QI metrics, limited time, and pressures of a fee-for-service clinical environment. Facilitators included automation and standardization in QI efforts and passionate vaccine champions. Almost all QI leaders reported future plans to implement HPV vaccine QI projects. Findings suggest that many healthcare systems are motivated to improve HPV vaccination.

MethodsParticipants without any symptoms were enrolled from October 18, 2021 to January 24, 2022 and performed Ag-RDT and RT-PCR tests every 48 hours for 15 days. This study represents a non-pre-specified analysis in which we sought to determine if sensitivity of Ag-RDT differed in participants with Delta compared to Omicron variant. Participants who were positive on RT-PCR on the first day of the testing period were excluded. Delta and Omicron variants were defined based on sequencing and date of first RT-PCR positive result (RT-PCR+). Comparison of Ag-RDT performance between the variants was based on sensitivity, defined as proportion of participants with Ag-RDT+ results in relation to their first RT-PCR+ result, for different duration of testing with rapid Ag-RDT. Subsample analysis was performed based on the result of participants second RT-PCR test within 48 hours of the first RT-PCR+ test. ResultsFrom the 7,349 participants enrolled in the parent study, 5,506 met the eligibility criteria for this analysis. A total of 153 participants were RT-PCR+ (61 Delta, 92 Omicron); among this group, 36 (23.5%) tested Ag-RDT+ on the same day, and 84 (54.9%) tested Ag-RDT+ within 48 hours as first RT-PCR+. The differences in sensitivity between variants were not statistically significant (same-day: Delta 16.4% [95% CI: 8.2-28.1] vs Omicron 28.2% [95% CI: 19.4-38.6]; and 48-hours: Delta 45.9% [33.1-59.2] vs. Omicron 60.9% [50.1-70.9]). This trend continued among the 86 participants who had consecutive RT-PCR+ result (48-hour sensitivity: Delta 79.3% [60.3-92.1] vs. Omicron: 89.5% [78.5-96.0]). Conversely, the 38 participants who had an isolated RT-PCR+ remained consistently negative on Ag-RDT, regardless of the variant. ConclusionsThe performance of Ag-RDT is not inferior among individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant as compared to the Delta variant. The improvement in sensitivity of Ag-RDT noted with serial testing is consistent between Delta and Omicron variant.

Studies confirmed significant genome differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that the distinctions in pathogenicity might be related to genomic diversity. However, the relationship between genomic differences and SARS-CoV-2 fitness has not been fully explained, especially for open reading frame (ORF)-encoded accessory proteins. RNA viruses have a high mutation rate, but how SARS-CoV-2 mutations accelerate adaptation is not clear. This study shows that the host-genome similarity (HGS) of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV, especially in the ORF6 and ORF8 genes encoding proteins antagonizing innate immunity in vivo. A power law relationship was discovered between the HGS of ORF3b, ORF6, and N and the expression of interferon (IFN)-sensitive response element (ISRE)-containing promoters. This finding implies that high HGS of SARS-CoV-2 genome may further inhibit IFN I synthesis and cause delayed host innate immunity. An ORF1ab mutation, 10818G>T, which occurred in virus populations with high HGS but rarely in low-HGS populations, was identified in 2594 genomes with geolocations of China, the USA and Europe. The 10818G>T caused the amino acid mutation M37F in the transmembrane protein nsp6. The results suggest that the ORF6 and ORF8 genes and the mutation M37F may play important roles in causing COVID-19. The findings demonstrate that HGS analysis is a promising way to identify important genes and mutations in adaptive strains, which may help in searching potential targets for pharmaceutical agents.","output":"The discovery of gene mutations making SARS-CoV-2 well adapted for humans: host-genome similarity analysis of 2594 genomes from China, the USA and Europe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sequelae of COVID-19 can be severe and longlasting. We compared frequencies of fatigue, depression and cognitive dysfunction in survivors of SARS-CoV-2-infection and sepsis. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 355 symptomatic post-COVID patients who visited our out-patient clinic for post-COVID-19 care. We compared them with 272 symptomatic patients from the Mid-German Sepsis Cohort, which investigates the long-term courses of sepsis survivors. Possible predictors for frequent clinical findings (fatigue, signs of depression, cognitive dysfunction) in post-COVID were investigated with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Median age of the post-COVID patients was 51 years (range 17C86), 60.0% were female, and 31.8% required hospitalization during acute COVID-19. In the post-COVID patients (median follow-up time: 163 days) and the post-sepsis patients (180 days), fatigue was found in 93.2% and 67.8%, signs of depression were found in 81.3% and 10.9%, and cognitive dysfunction was found in 23.5% and 21.3%, respectively. In post-COVID, we did not observe an association between fatigue or depression and the severity of acute COVID-19. In contrast, cognitive dysfunction was associated with hospitalization (out-patient versus in-patient) and more frequent in post-COVID patients treated on an ICU compared to the MSC patients. CONCLUSION: In post-COVID patients, fatigue and signs of depression are more common than in sepsis survivors, independent from the acute SARS-CoV-2-infection. In contrast, cognitive dysfunction is associated with hospitalization. Despite the differences in frequencies, owing to the similarity of post-COVID and post-sepsis sequelae, this knowledge may help in implementing follow-up approaches after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Indeed, constitutive expression of a viral FLIP homologue in myeloid cells triggered a STAT3-linked, progressive and fatal inflammatory syndrome in mice, characterized by elevated cytokine output, lymphopenia, lung injury and multiple organ dysfunctions that mimicked human CRS.

Full texts were reviewed for the selection of studies on scoring systems specially designed to discern between unnatural and natural outbreaks. Results: A total of 1,753 papers were reviewed, of which we identified the following five scoring systems specifically designed for detecting unnatural outbreaks: (1) the GrunowCFinke epidemiological assessment tool, (2) potential epidemiological clues to a deliberate epidemic, (3) bioterrorism risk assessment scoring, (4) and (5) two modified scoring systems based on (3). Various criteria ranging from the information on perpetrators, type of agents, spatial distribution, and intelligence of deliberate release were involved. Of these systems, the GrunowCFinke assessment tool remains the most widely used, but has low sensitivity for correctly identifying unnatural epidemics when tested against actual historical outbreaks.

ApoE has been involved with prevention of tissue damage and promotion of adaptative immune response in the lungs. This study investigated frequencies distribution of alleles that alter the ApoE expression in lung tissues to trace a profile of these variants and associate them to COVID-19 clinical outcomes. Data about APOE expression levels was obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and the allele frequencies of APOE variants was acquired from the populations included in the phase 3 release of the 1000 Genomes Project. A total of 128 variants showed a significant impact on the APOE expression in lung tissues (p < 0.0001). Linkage Disequilibrium analysis revealed that 98 variants were closely grouped into seven distinct haplotype blocks, of which six were composed of variants that significantly decrease APOE gene expression in the lungs. Most of the haplotypes with higher impact on APOE expression showed greater frequencies in Europeans and lower in Africans, which implies that European populations might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ARTISAN (Aspiration and Resilience Through Intergenerational Storytelling and Art-based Narratives) is a 5-week, 15-h participatory art and group-based intervention that focuses on resilience building and loneliness alleviation among the young and old through a structured multimodal framework held at a museum space. Developed with a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, this intervention is evaluated using an open-label waitlist randomized controlled trial design (RCT) comprised of community-dwelling youth and older adults randomized into an intervention group (n = 35) or a waitlist-control group (n = 33). Participants were assessed on standardized self-reported psychometric measures including loneliness, resilience, quality of life, social support, life satisfaction and national identity at three time points. Qualitative data generated during each intervention session as well as acceptability focus groups were recorded and transcribed. Linear mixed modeling analyses revealed that participants in the intervention group experienced improvements in life satisfaction compared to participants in the waitlist-control group (95% CI: 0.22 to 0.77, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.53) immediately after the completion of ARTISAN. Subgroup analyses for youth participants indicated improvements in quality of life (95% CI: 0.16 to 0.52, p < 0.001, d = 1.31) and national identity (95% CI: 0.18 to 0.80, p = 0.002, d = 0.43) in comparison to the waitlist-control group. At 5-weeks follow-up, the intervention group participants continued to experience high levels of life satisfaction (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.42, p = 0.017, d = 0.47), enhancements in resilience (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.55, p = 0.011, d = 0.46), as well as a significant reduction in loneliness (95% CI: ?0.34 to ?0.08, p = 0.001, d = 0.61) compared to baseline, reflecting the effectiveness and positive residual effects of the ARTISAN intervention.

With an increasing number of the elderly population, and early cancer screening and treatment, the number of cancers cases are rising, while the mortality rate is decreasing. However, the number of cancer survivors is increasing yearly. With the prolonged life span of cancer patients, the adverse effects of anti-tumor therapy, especially CVD, have gained enormous attention. The incidence of cardiovascular events such as cardiac injury or cardiovascular toxicity is higher than malignant tumors' recurrence rate. Numerous clinical studies have also shifted their focus from the study of a single disease to the interdisciplinary study of oncology and cardiology. Previous studies have confirmed that anti-tumor therapy can cause CVD. Additionally, the treatment of CVD is also related to the tumors incidence. It is well established that the increased incidence of CVD in cancer patients is probably due to an unmodified unhealthy lifestyle among cancer survivors or cardiotoxicity caused by anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, some patients with CVD have a relatively increased cancer risk because CVD and malignant tumors are highly overlapping risk factors, including gender, age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and obesity. With advancements in the diagnosis and treatment, many patients simultaneously suffer from CVD and cancer, and most of them have a poor prognosis. Therefore, clinicians should understand the relationship between CVD and tumors, effectively identify the primary and secondary prevention for these diseases, and follow proper treatment methods.","output":"Cardio-Oncology: A Myriad of Relationships Between Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This paper uses a SEIR(D) model to analyse the time-varying transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea throughout its multiple stages of development.

Medical history included renal transplant due to ESRD from IgA nephropathy, DM and treated latent TB with no prior or family history of thyroid disease. She had COVID 7 months ago, complicated by allograft rejection. She was tachycardic, febrile but not in acute distress. Neck exam revealed diffuse thyromegaly with tenderness on right lobe without bruit, palpable cervical lymphadenopathy nor tremors. Labs showed WBC 12.8x10(9)/L (4.8-10), and ESR 50 ml/hr (20-40). On admission, she developed AKI and immunosuppressant meds were discontinued. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotic. CT chest reported moderate loculated right pleural effusion with mid and lower lobe consolidation. Blood and urine culture, pleural fluid, sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and QuantiFERON-TB were negative. Upon persistent fever, RIPE therapy (rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol) was started and stopped after 10 days due to transaminitis and negative TB PCR. Further labs showed TSH 0.04 mIU/ml (0.27-4.2), FT4 2.81 ng/dl (0.93-1.7), TT3 127 ng/dl (80-200), negative TPO and TSI. Endocrinology was consulted for thyroiditis. Ibuprofen and Propranolol were initiated with continuation of prednisone. Repeat thyroid labs normalized in 4 days. US thyroid noted diffuse, heterogenous thyromegaly without hypervascularity or abscess. CT neck showed diffuse thyromegaly 4.2x7.2x7.5 cm in size; right thyroid lobe extended to posterior clavicle with enhanced capsule, without discrete lymph node or vascularity changes, suggestive of thyroiditis. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of left thyroid lobe drained 3 ml purulent fluid and AFB were seen on direct smear. She was diagnosed as TT, but unable to restart RIPE therapy due to worsening liver function. She expired after cardiac arrest due to intracranial bleeding and brain abscess. Thyroid tuberculosis is a rarely reported clinical entity. This is the first reported case of secondary TB (TT) in post-COVID infected patient from reactivation of latent TB. In our case, follicular destruction caused initial hyperthyroidism with later recovery. It can be difficult to distinguish subacute from suppurative thyroiditis due to TB. Imaging may not always show clear abscess formation. FNA is crucial for diagnosis, and drainage of any abscess. Anti-TB meds can be given, surgery is rarely required.

The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved.

For the determinants of the number of cases and deaths, four models consisting of social and health indicators were created. Methods: In this quantitative research, 93 countries in the model were used to obtain determinants of the confirmed cases and determinants of the COVID-19 fatalities. Results: The results obtained from Model I, in which the number of cases was examined with social indicators, showed that the number of tourists, the population between the ages of 15 and 64, and institutionalization had a positive effect on the number of cases. The results obtained from the health indicators of the number of cases show that cigarette consumption affects the number of cases positively in the 50th quantile, the death rate under the age of five affects the number of cases negatively in all quantiles, and vaccination positively affects the number of cases in 25th and 75th quantile values. Findings from social indicators of the number of COVID-19 deaths show that life expectancy negatively affects the number of deaths in the 25th and 50th quantiles. The population over the age of 65 and CO(2) positively affect the number of deaths at the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles. There is a non-linear relationship between the number of cases and the number of deaths at the 50th and 75th quantile values. An increase in the number of cases increases the number of deaths to the turning point; after the turning point, an increase in the number of cases decreases the death rate. Herd immunity has an important role in obtaining this finding. As a health indicator, it was seen that the number of cases positively affected the number of deaths in the 50th and 75th quantile values and the vaccination rate in the 25th and 75th quantile values. Diabetes affects the number of deaths positively in the 75th quantile. Conclusion: The population aged 15C64 has a strong impact on COVID-19 cases, but in COVID-19 deaths, life expectancy is a strong variable. On the other hand, it has been found that vaccination and the number of cases interaction term has an effect on the mortality rate.

Recently, several patients infected with novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were given HCQ, and showed a discrepant response. HCQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, and inflammatory cascade by interfering with lysosomal and endosomal activities, and autophagy, impeding virus-membrane fusion, and inhibiting cytokine production resulted from inflammatory pathways activation. Despite ongoing administration of HCQ in a wide spectrum of disorders, there are some reports about several side effects, especially retinopathy in some patients treated with HCQ. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and its isoforms are the main metabolizers of HCQ and CQ. Pharmacokinetic properties of CYP enzymes are influenced by CYP polymorphism, non-coding RNAs, and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, and histone acetylation. Accumulating evidence about side effects of HCQ in some patients raise the possibility that different response of patients to HCQ might be due to difference in their genome. Therefore, CYP450 genotyping especially for CYP2D6 might be helpful to refine HCQ dosage. Also, regular control of retina should be considered for patients under HCQ treatment. The major focus of the present review is to discuss about the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of CQ and HCQ that may be influenced by epigenetic mechanisms, and consequently cause several side effects especially retinopathy during SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","output":"Molecular effects and retinopathy induced by hydroxychloroquine during SARS-CoV-2 therapy: Role of CYP450 isoforms and epigenetic modulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Estimating an epidemics trajectory is crucial for developing public health responses to infectious diseases, but incidence data used for such estimation are confounded by variable testing practices.

In addition, lower nonreactivity and awareness were found to partially mediate the relationship between high impulsivity and online CB. Specifically, lower awareness accounted for 30.77% of this relationship and lower nonreactivity accounted for 7.93% of the relationship between impulsivity and CB.

However, little is known about the long-term durability of the induced immune response resulting from the vaccination. Methods In a longitudinal observational study in employees at a German hospital we compared the humoral and cellular immune response in 184 participants after two doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine (BNT162b2) with a mid-term follow-up after 9 months. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies were determined using both a quantitative and a semi-quantitative assay. For a qualitative assessment of the humoral immune response, we additionally measured neutralizing antibodies. Cellular immune response was evaluated by measuring Interferon-gamma release after stimulating blood-cells with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides using a commercial assay. Results In the first analysis, a 100% humoral response rate was described after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine with a mean antibody ratio of 8.01 {+/-} 1.00. 9 months after the second dose of BNT162b2, serological testing showed a significant decreased mean antibody ratio of 3.84 {+/-} 1.69 (p < 0.001). Neutralizing antibodies were still detectable in 96% of all participants, showing an average binding inhibition value of 68.20% {+/-} 18.87%.

However, the emergence and rapid spread of highly transmissible variants combined with slowing down the pace of vaccination created uncertainty around the future trajectory of the epidemic. In this study we analyze the expected benefits of offering vaccination to children age 5-11 under differing conditions for in-person schooling. Methods: We adapted a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington, to handle multiple variants with increased transmissibility and virulence as well as differential vaccine efficacies against each variant. Reactive social distancing is implemented driven by fluctuations in the number of hospitalizations in the county. We simulate scenarios offering vaccination to children aged 5-11 with different starting dates and different proportions of physical interactions (PPI) in schools being restored. The impact of improving overall vaccination coverage among the eligible population is also explored. Cumulative hospitalizations, percentage reduction of hospitalizations and proportion of time at maximum social distancing over the 2021-2022 school year are reported. Findings: In the base-case scenario with 85% vaccination coverage of 12+ year-olds, our model projects 4945 (median, IQR 4622-5341) total COVID-19 hospitalizations and 325 (median, IQR 264-400) pediatric hospitalizations if physical contacts at schools are fully restored (100% PPI) for the entire school year compared to 3675 (median, IQR 2311-4725) and 163 (median, IQR 95-226) if schools remained closed. Reducing contacts in schools to 75% PPI or 50% PPI through masking, ventilation and distancing is expected to decrease the overall cumulative hospitalizations by 2% and 4% respectively and youth hospitalizations by 8% and 23% respectively. Offering early vaccination to children aged 5-11 with 75% PPI is expected to prevent 756 (median, IQR 301-1434) hospitalizations and cut hospitalizations in the youngest age group in half compared to no vaccination. It will largely reduce the need of additional social distancing over the school year. If, in addition, 90% overall vaccination coverage is reached, 60% of remaining hospitalizations will be averted and the need of extra mitigation measures almost certainly avoided. Conclusions: Our work highlights that in-person schooling is possible if reasonable precaution measures are taken at schools to reduced infectious contacts. Rapid vaccination of all school-aged children will provide meaningful reduction of the COVID health burden over this school year but only if implemented early. Finally, it remains critical to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with the current surge in Delta variant cases.","output":"Improving vaccination coverage and offering vaccine to all school-age children will allow uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County, WA: Modeling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media platforms now serve billions of users by providing convenient means of communication, content sharing and even payment between different users. Due to such convenient and anarchic nature, they have also been used rampantly to promote and conduct business activities between unregistered market participants without paying taxes.

This paper presents a machine learning based Regtech tool for international tax authorities to detect transaction-based tax evasion activities on social media platforms. To build such a tool, we collected a dataset of 58,660 Instagram posts and manually labelled 2,081 sampled posts with multiple properties related to transaction-based tax evasion activities. Based on the dataset, we developed a multi-modal deep neural network to automatically detect suspicious posts. The proposed model combines comments, hashtags and image modalities to produce the final output. As shown by our experiments, the combined model achieved an AUC of 0.808 and F1 score of 0.762, outperforming any single modality models.

A systematic review found that Xuefu Zhuyu (XFZY) has a promising effect on PD management, yet there is a dearth of high-quality evidence in support of this claim. We want to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XFZY for PD patients. METHODS: This is a protocol for a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 248 participants with PD will be recruited at 6 centers and randomized into two groupsa herbal treatment group and a placebo group. The participants will receive either XFZY or placebo, three times per day, for 3 menstrual cycles, with a 12-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be the mean change in pain intensity as measured by VAS, while the change in menstrual pain duration, the change in peak pain intensity as measured by VAS, the Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS), quality of life EQ-5D-5L, cumulative painkiller consumption, and health economics will be included as secondary outcomes. Adverse events will also be reported.

Therefore, we examined the risk of severe infection course and hospital admission in a large cohort of patients with IEI. In this multicenter nationwide retrospective survey-based trial, the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected by investigating physicians from 8 national referral centers for the diagnosis and treatment of IEI using a COVID-19-IEI clinical questionnaire. In total, 81 patients with IEI (including 16 with hereditary angioedema, HAE) and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled, and were found to have a 2.3-times increased (95%CI: 1.44C3.53) risk ratio for hospital admission and a higher mortality ratio (2.4% vs. 1.7% in the general population). COVID-19 severity was associated with the presence of clinically relevant comorbidities, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia, but not with age or BMI. No individuals with HAE developed severe disease, despite a hypothesized increased risk due to perturbed bradykinin metabolism. We also demonstrated a high seroconversion rate in antibody-deficient patients and the safety of anti-spike SARS CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma. Thus, IEI except for HAE, represent significant risk factors for a severe COVID-19.

We previously demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein contains multiple conformational epitopes (Conf I-VI) that confer the major target of neutralizing Abs. Here we show that the recombinant RBDs derived from the S protein sequences of Tor2, GD03, and SZ3, the representative strains of human 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV, respectively, induce in the immunized mice and rabbits high titers of cross-neutralizing Abs against pseudoviruses expressing S proteins of Tor2, GD03, and SZ3. We also demonstrate that the Tor2-RBD induced-Conf I-VI mAbs can potently neutralize both human SARS-CoV strains, Tor2 and GD03. However, only the Conf IV-VI, but not Conf I-III mAbs, neutralize civet SARS-CoV strain SZ3. All these mAbs reacted significantly with each of the three RBD variants (Tor2-RBD, GD03-RBD, and SZ3-RBD) that differ at several amino acids. Regardless, the Conf I-IV and VI epitopes were completely disrupted by single-point mutation of the conserved residues in the RBD (e.g., D429A, R441A, or D454A) and the Conf III epitope was significantly affected by E452A or D463A substitution. Interestingly, the Conf V epitope, which may overlap the receptor-binding motif and induce most potent neutralizing Abs, was conserved in these mutants. These data suggest that the major neutralizing epitopes of SARS-CoV have been apparently maintained during cross-species transmission, and that RBD-based vaccines may induce broad protection against both human and animal SARS-CoV variants.","output":"Cross-neutralization of human and palm civet severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses by antibodies targeting the receptor-binding domain of spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Under specific pathogen-free conditions, 1.3% to 1.8% of litters born in our inbred 101/H and C3HeB/FeJ mouse colonies had pups with steatorrhea and runting.

METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The populations were adult and pediatric patients with confirmed UTI by reference standard urine culture. The index test for the diagnosis of UTI was any molecular diagnostic technique. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of UTI with measures of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve. The operative characteristics were determined, and a meta-analysis was performed. The evaluation of each included study was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. RESULTS: We identified 1230 studies with the search strategies. Ultimately, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, and seven were included for the meta-analysis. Four molecular techniques were identified; however, it was only possible to synthesize the information from two of them. In multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) meta-analysis, overall sensitivity was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.86) and specificity was 0.83 (95% CI 0.52-0.95). For the DOR, the overall result was 21 (95% CI 4.8-95). For reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, sensitivity was 0.94 (95% CI 0.73-0.99) and specificity was 0.59 (95% CI 0.063-0.96). For the DOR, the overall result was 23 (95% CI 1.1-467). CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR and RT-PCR are molecular techniques that might be comparable to standard urine culture for UTI diagnosis.

RESULTS: The pandemic led researchers to change recruitment plans, interrupt timelines for assessments and intervention delivery, and move to remote intervention and assessment protocols. The necessity of these changes add emphasis to the importance, in study design and analysis, of intention to treat approaches, flexibility, within\\\\site stratification, interim power projections, and sensitivity analyses.

METHOD: A single-center observational study was conducted in the ophthalmology clinics of Peking University Third Hospital. Two air quality detectors were equipped to assess the generated particulate matter (PM) concentration simultaneously within 30a? s after IOP measurement in the outpatient hall. Detector A was fixed next to the NCT as a reference, while Detector B was fixed 1 meter away. The participants were divided into two groups depending on the position of Detector B. The generation of aerosol was compared within different groups and time intervals. RESULTS: 144 participants were enrolled in the final analysis. At a 1a? m distance from the NCT, the PM2.5 concentration significantly increased at the 30a? s (Z = 2.898, Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.038) while the PM10 concentration increased immediately after the IOP measurement (Z = 2.967, Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.030). The PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at 1a? m were significantly higher immediately (Z = -2.183, P = 0.029; Z = -2.502, P = 0.012) and 30a? s (Z = -2.021, P = 0.043; Z = -2.071, P = 0.038) after the IOP measurements when the Detector B was vertical to the air jet on the lateral side.

The procedure of modeling consists of two essential components: the first component is to solve the mathematical model numerically, the so-called forward modeling. The second component is to identify the unknown parameter values in the model, which is known as inverse modeling and leads to identifying the epidemiological model more precisely. The main goal of this paper is to develop the forward and inverse modeling of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using novel computational methodologies in order to accurately estimate and predict the pandemic. This leads to governmental decisions support in implementing effective protective measures and prevention of new outbreaks. To this end, we use the logistic equation and the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) system of ordinary differential equations to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We deploy an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision-makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks. According to our Bayesian analysis for the logistic model, the growth rate and the carrying capacity are estimated respectively as 0.28 and 14974. Moreover for the parameters of the SIR model, namely the transmission rate and recovery rate, we estimate 0.36 and 0.06, respectively. Additionally, we obtained an average infectious period of 17 days and a transmission period of 3 days for COVID-19 in Austria. We also estimate the reproduction number over time for Austria. This quantity is estimated around 3 on March 26, when the first recovery was reported. Then it decays to 1 at the beginning of April. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision-making. According to our analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) is estimated as 4% and a prediction of the number of fatalities for the coming 10 days is also presented. Additionally, the ICU bed usage in Austria indicates that around 2% of the active infected individuals are critical cases and require ICU beds. Therefore, if Austrian governmental protective measures would not have taken place and for instance if the number of active infected cases would have been around five times larger, the ICU bed capacity could have been exceeded.","output":"Uncertainty quantification in epidemiological models for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-sectional study assesses health care factors associated with excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 in US counties in 2020.","output":"Association of Health Care Factors With Excess Deaths Not Assigned to COVID-19 in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic affects the processes of routine care for chronic patients. A better understanding helps to increase resilience of the health system and prepare adequately for next waves of the pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in 16 primary care practices: 6 solo working, 4 monodisciplinary and 7 multidisciplinary. Twenty-one people (doctors, nurses, dieticians) were interviewed, using semi-structured video interviews. A thematic analysis was done using the domains of the Chronic Care Model (CCM). RESULTS: Three themes emerged: changes in health care organization, risk stratification and self-management support. All participating practices reported drastic changes in organization with a collective shift towards COVID-19 care, and reduction of chronic care activities, less consultations, and staff responsible for self-management support put on hold. A transition to digital support did not occur. Few practitioners had a systematic approach to identify and contact high-risk patients for early follow-up. A practice with a pre-established structured team collaboration managed to continue most chronic care elements. Generally, practitioners expected no effects of the temporary disruption for patients, although they expressed concern about patients already poorly regulated. CONCLUSION: Our findings show a disruption of the delivery of chronic care in the Belgium prim care context. In such contexts, the establishment of the CCM can facilitate continuity of care in crisis times. Short term actions should be directed to facilitate identifying high-risk patients and to develop a practice organization plan to organize chronic care and use digital channels for support, especially to vulnerable patients, during next waves of the epidemic.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on chronic care according to providers: a qualitative study among primary care practices in Belgium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination is critical for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the progress of COVID-19 vaccination varies from different countries, and global vaccine inequity has been a worldwide public health issue. This study collected data from the Our World in Data COVID-19 vaccination data set between 13 December 2020 and 1 January 2022. The measurement reflecting the pandemic situation included New cases, New deaths, Hospital patients, ICU patients, and the Reproduction rate. Indicators for measuring the vaccination coverage included Total vaccinations per hundred and People vaccinated per hundred. The Human Development Index (HDI) measured the countrys development level. Findings indicated that countries with higher HDI have more adequate vaccine resources, and global vaccine inequity exists. The study also found that vaccination significantly mitigates the pandemic, and reaching 70% immunization coverage can further control the epidemic. In addition, the emergence of Omicron variants makes the COVID-19 epidemic situation even worse, suggesting the importance and necessity of addressing vaccine inequity. The globe will face a greater challenge in controlling the pandemic if lower-vaccinated countries do not increase their vaccination coverage. Addressing the issue of vaccine inequity needs the cooperation of HIC, LMIC, public health departments, and vaccine producers.

In the second phase, total interpretive structural modelling (TISM) has been applied to examine inter-relationships between the barriers for an Indian automobile case company. Matrice d'impacts croiss multiplication applique  un classment (MICMAC) analysis has also been performed to analyse the driving and dependence power of the barriers.FindingsIn total, 11 barriers are identified from the first phase of the study. In the second phase, the TISM digraph is created which qualitatively explains the reason behind how one barrier leads to another. MICMAC analysis classifies these variables in four clusters namely autonomous, linkage, dependent and independent. These clusters characterise the barriers based on their driving and dependent power which helps managers in strategically tackling them while taking understanding from the TISM digraph.Research limitations/implicationsThree research implications can be made from the study. First, a comprehensive definition of supply chain which helps in understanding of resilience based on disruption phases and recovery. Second, 11 barriers are identified which hinder resilience in automotive sector. Their relationships are modelled using TISM which also gives why a particular relationship exists. Last, MICMAC analysis classifies barriers based on how high or low the driving and dependence power exists.Practical implicationsThe study offers significant implications for supply chain managers helping them in building resilience by identifying barriers and reducing their effect. Barriers are identified for case company which might help managers to tackle them during disruptions. The final TISM digraph depicts the why between the inter-relationships between the barriers to resilient supply chains. TISM shows that non-commitment of top management is the major root barrier which has been causing the other problems. MICMAC analysis is also performed along with discussion as to how autonomous, linkage, dependent and independent barriers can be tackled to build resilience.Originality/valueTISM is considered as an effective methodology for conceptual framework development as it also explains why between the relationships besides explaining the what as against ISM. Identification and understanding of barriers and their interrelationship will help supply chain managers to analyse the influence and inter-dependence of barriers on the resilience of the supply chain.

Our model was able to achieve a balanced accuracy of 80.4% on a held out dataset used from the AVEC-19 challenge. Additionally, we implemented various partitioning techniques to determine if our model was generalizable enough.

As such, prolonged glial activation, as is thought to occur during a persistent viral infection of the CNS, may contribute to both neurodegeneration and demyelination. However, the effects of virus-induced glial activation on oligodendrocytes are not fully understood. METHOD: To determine the effects of glial activation on oligodendrocyte viability we treated primary glial cultures isolated from neonatal rats or mice with the RNA viral mimic poly(I:C) and in some cases other TLR ligands. TLR3 expression was determined by western blot. Cytokine levels were measured by RT-PCR, ELISA, and intracellular cytokine staining. Oligodendrocyte precursor (preOL) viability was determined by Alamar blue assays and immunocytochemistry. RESULT: Stimulation of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) resulted in microglia activation, TNF production and preOL toxicity. This toxic effect of poly(I:C) was indirect as it failed to affect preOL viability in pure cultures despite the fact that preOLs express TLR3. Poly(I:C)-induced loss of preOLs was abolished in TNF or TNFR1 deficient mixed glial cultures, suggesting that TNF/TNFR1 signaling is required for poly(I:C) toxicity. Furthermore, although both microglia and astrocytes express functional TLR3, only microglia produced TNF in culture. Consistent with these findings, other TLR agonists similarly triggered TNF production and preOL toxicity in mixed glial cultures. CONCLUSION: Activation of microglia by poly(I:C) promotes TNF/TNFR1-dependent oligodendroglial cell death. These data indicate that during an ongoing viral infection of the CNS, microglial TNF may be detrimental to oligodendrocytes.","output":"Poly(I:C) promotes TNF/TNFR1-dependent oligodendrocyte death in mixed glial cultures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents two epidemiological models that have been developed in order to study the disease dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and exit strategies from the lockdown which has been imposed on many countries world-wide.

We investigate the potential effects of a combination of measures such as continuation of hygienic constraints after leaving lockdown, isolation of infectious persons, repeated and adaptive short-term contact reductions and also large-scale use of antibody tests in order to know who can be assumed to be immune and participate at public life without constraints. We apply two commonly used modeling approaches: extended SEIR models formulated both as System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation, in order to get insight into the disease dynamics of a complete country like Germany and also into more detailed behavior of smaller regions. We confirm the findings of other models that without intervention the consequences of the pandemic can be catastrophic and we extend such findings with effective strategies to overcome the challenge.

The proposed model is useful to explore the dynamic interaction among a set of covariates and their effects on the functional response. The proposed model includes many important models investigated recently as special cases. By tensor product B-spline approximating the unknown bivariate coefficient functions, a three-step efficient estimation procedure is developed to iteratively estimate bivariate varying-coefficient functions, the vector of index parameters, and the covariance functions of random effects. We also establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators including the convergence rate and their asymptotic distributions. In addition, we develop a test statistic to check whether the dynamic interaction varies with time/spatial locations, and we prove the asymptotic normality of the test statistic. The finite sample performance of our proposed method and of the test statistic are investigated with several simulation studies. Our proposed DISeF model is also used to analyze the COVID-19 data and the ADNI data. In both applications, hypothesis testing shows that the bivariate varying-coefficient functions significantly vary with the index and the time/spatial locations. For instance, we find that the interaction effect of the population ageing and the socio-economic covariates, such as the number of hospital beds, physicians, nurses per 1,000 people and GDP per capita, on the COVID-19 mortality rate varies in different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. The healthcare infrastructure index related to the COVID-19 mortality rate is also obtained for 141 countries estimated based on the proposed DISeF model.

The survey included parental self-report measurements on parenting stress and child's negative emotionality (T1 and T2 each), and targeted prevention programs (T1 only). An autoregressive cross-lagged panel design was used to analyze the association of parenting stress and the child's negative emotionality, including use of targeted prevention programs as moderator. We also tested if targeted prevention programs can reduce parenting stress or child's negative emotionality using Propensity Score Matching (PSM). RESULTS: Parenting stress at T1 affected children's negative emotionality at T2, but children's negative emotionality at T1 did not affect parenting stress at T2. When targeted prevention was included as moderator, the correlation disappeared among program users. With PSM, there was no direct effect on parenting stress or child's negative emotionality. But a subsample of parents with high parenting stress at T1 who used targeted prevention at T1 reported less child's negative emotionality problems at T2 than parents who scored high in parenting stress but did not receive targeted prevention at T1. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the spillover from parenting stress to child's negative emotionality may be modified by prevention. Prevention programs may help to build resources and have a direct positive effect on the child, especially for parents with high parenting stress.","output":"Long-term effects of targeted prevention programs for families with young children.

Furthermore, it is difficult to find this information conveniently organized or in a form relevant to nutrition protocols. Current gaps in training and research surveillance exist in clinical nutrition research because training modules emphasize drugs and devices, promote reliance on monitoring boards, and lack nutrition expertise on human nutrition research teams. Additionally, because eating is essential, ongoing, and highly individualized, it is difficult to distinguish risks associated with interventions from eating under free-living conditions. Controlled-feeding trials provide an option to gain more experimental control over food consumed, but at a price of less external validity, and may pose human behavior issues that are unrelated to the intervention. This paper covers many of the expected practices for documentation and regulation that may be encountered in planning and conducting nutrition intervention trials with examples and references that should be useful to clinical nutrition researchers, funders of research, and research institutions. Included are definitions and guidance on clinical nutrition research oversight (institutional review boards, data safety and monitoring boards, US FDA); participant safety; standard operating procedures; training of investigators, staff, and students; and local culture and reporting requirements relevant to diet-related clinical research conduct and documentation.","output":"Perspective: US Documentation and Regulation of Human Nutrition Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Context Resilience represents the ability of systems to anticipate, withstand, or adapt to challenges Times of great stress and disturbance offer opportunity to identify and confirm key contributors to agri-food system resilience The COVID-19 pandemic and its related consequences constituted major shock, challenging the resilience of many agri-food systems worldwide Objective This paper aimed to report the immediate effects of the COVID-19 crisis on various key actors from Flemish food supply chains By analysing and assessing the observed impacts of and reactions to this crisis from a resilience perspective, it also aimed to gain empirical evidence on resilience-enhancing characteristics of agri-food systems to sudden shocks Methods A first, quantitative step of our mixed method approach measured 718 farmers' experienced impacts and applied strategies following the crisis through an online survey A second, qualitative step captured impacts and responses from other key actors downstream the food supply chain through 22 in-depth interviews and 18 on-line questionnaires Data gathering and interpretation followed a conceptual framework for analysing resilience of agri-food systems to external challenges, that we developed based on the literature The framework states that resilience actions stem from three types of resilience capacities: anticipatory, coping and responsive capacities These are determined by both resources allocated by system actors, as well as by resilience attributes from the system Results and conclusions The COVID-19 crisis induced a simultaneous dropped demand for food products in the hospitality industry and risen demand in retail This shifted demand significantly disturbed food production, processing and marketing processes in terms of labour organization, planning, operation, logistics, and economic returns Perceived impacts varied extensively across actors from the agri-food system, mostly depending on their marketing strategy, customer base, and flexibility and diversity of their practices Reported reactions to this crisis revealed that resilience capacities varied according to actors' abilities to negotiate prices, adjust production processes, and maintain or reorient sales Some agri-food sectors showed higher responsive capacity because of a higher connectivity and self-organization within the system Significance Our findings suggest that flexibility and diversity, despite their tendency to diminish price optimums, increase resilience capacities, which may be more beneficial to systems for thriving in turbulent and uncertain environments A more tangible, operationalized understanding of resilience is necessary to effectively improve agri-food system resilience Our conceptual framework proved a valuable tool for operationalizing resilience assessments to major shocks","output":"COVID-19 impacts on Flemish food supply chains and lessons for agri-food system resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the global health burden caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), there have been numerous studies aimed to understand its clinical course and to determine risk factors that may impact prognosis.

Pasta samples (T1-T10) having different proportions of rice flour (RF, 60-80%), wheat flour (WF, 40-12%), malted green gram flour (MGGF, 5 and 10%) and guar gum (GG, 1-3%) were prepared using a single screw extruder. Pasta made of 100% WF served as the control (T0). The cooked or rehydrated samples were evaluated for their cooking properties (optimum cooking time, cooking loss and swelling index), whiteness and yellowness indices, textural and organoleptic parameters. Substitution of WF by RF significantly reduced the cooking time, and improved the whiteness and swelling indices of the samples. However, reduction in WF increased the cooking loss, compromised textural and organoleptic attributes in samples with high RF content (80%); nevertheless, addition of GG and MGGF reduced these losses and improved the sensory qualities (p < 0.05). Irrespective of the composition of rice-based pasta, the optimal cooking time ranged within 2-4 min (unlike T0) and these samples could also be rehydrated in hot water within a short span of 5 min to attain textural qualities at par with their cooked counterparts and with sensorial scores well above the limit of acceptable range (5) (except T3 (80%RF + 20%WF)); nonetheless the cooked ones led to higher preference from the sensory panel. Adhesiveness of the rehydrated samples was lesser than their cooked counterparts, while vice versa was observed in case of their instrumental firmness/hardness. Among these, T7 (70%RF + 19%WF + 10%MGGF + 1%GG) and T9 (80%RF + 13%WF + 5%MGGF + 2%GG) exhibited high protein content (1.17-1.29 times higher than T0) and the most desired low in vitro starch digestibility and calorific values (1.16-1.25 fold reduction).

Higher body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate as well as higher of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and lower serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were associated with the presence of pneumonia. Ground-glass opacity was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Patients were administered neuraminidase inhibitors (20%), lopinavir/ritonavir (32.9%), and ciclesonide inhalation (11.4%). Mechanical ventilation and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on 14 (20%) and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively; two patients died. The median duration of intubation was 12 days. The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring. The severity of COVID-19 depends on the presence of pneumonia. High serum LDH, AST and CRP levels and low serum albumin level and lymphocyte count were found to be predictors of pneumonia.

Method: : This study was carried out with the aim of determining the laboratory indicators of ICU admission. Data from 126 COVID-19 patients (ICU patients, n = 18, Non-ICU, n = 98) were analyzed from a Caribbean Territory. Results: : The median age for the non-ICU patients was 59.0 (IQR = 23.5) years while the ICU patients had a median age of 62.5 (IQR = 17.5). The univariate analysis indicted that laboratory indicators that were significantly associated with ICU admission included WBC (P = 0.037), lymphocyte (P = 0.016), LDH (P = 0.002), AST (P = 0.005) and CRP (P = 0.0001). However, multivariate analysis that included WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, PLT, AST, LDH, ALT, and CRP indicated that only AST was associated with high odds of patients being admitted to ICU (OR .002, 95% CI 0.000-.004, P = 0.017).

Even if the system is in principle observable, high dimensionality poses fundamental limits on the computational tractability and performance of a full-state observer. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we instead require the system to be functionally observable, meaning that a targeted subset of state variables can be reconstructed from the available measurements. Here, we develop a graph-based theory of functional observability, which leads to highly scalable algorithms to 1) determine the minimal set of required sensors and 2) design the corresponding state observer of minimum order. Compared with the full-state observer, the proposed functional observer achieves the same estimation quality with substantially less sensing and fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale networks. We apply the proposed methods to the detection of cyberattacks in power grids from limited phase measurement data and the inference of the prevalence rate of infection during an epidemic under limited testing conditions. The applications demonstrate that the functional observer can significantly scale up our ability to explore otherwise inaccessible dynamical processes on complex networks.","output":"Functional observability and target state estimation in large-scale networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health care workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to the risk of infections and could become vectors of onward transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS: All residents and fellows at a large academic medical center were invited to participate in a web-based survey in May of 2020. Participants responded to questions regarding demographic characteristics, specialty, primary assigned responsibility during the previous 2 weeks (clinical, education, or research), perceived concern over missed educational opportunities, and burnout. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between missed educational opportunities and the measured variables. RESULTS: 22% (301 of 1375) of the trainees completed the survey. 47% of the participants were concerned about missed educational opportunities. Trainees assigned to education at home had 2.85 [95%CI 1.33-6.45] greater odds of being concerned over missed educational opportunities as compared with trainees performing clinical work.

In modern Western medicine, during non-crisis times, principlism provides the four guiding principles in biomedical ethics-autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice; autonomy typically emerges as the decisive principle. The physician-patient relationship is a deontological construct in which the physician's primary duty is to the individual patient and the individual patient is paramount. For this reason, we term the non-crisis ethical framework that guides modern medicine Deontological Principlism. During times of crisis, resources become scarce, standards of care become dynamic, and public health ethics move to the forefront. Healthcare providers are forced to work in non-ideal conditions, and interactions with individual patients must be considered in the context of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare to shift to a more utilitarian framework with a greater focus on promoting the health of communities and populations.

Methods County level data from January 22-April 28 was downloaded from USAfacts.org to create heat maps with ArcMapTM for diagnosed COVID-19 cases and mortality. The data was analyzed using spatial and space-time scan statistics and the SaTScanTM software, to detect geographical cluster with high incidence and mortality, adjusting for multiple testing. Analyses were adjusted for age. While the spatial clusters represent counties with unusually high counts of COVID-19 when averaged over the time period January 22-April 20, the space-time clusters allow us to identify groups of counties in which there exists a significant change over time. Results There were several statistically significant COVID-19 clusters for both incidence and mortality. Top clusters with high rates included the areas in and around New York City, New Orleans and Chicago, but there were also several small rural clusters. Top clusters for a recent surge in incidence and mortality included large parts of the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic Region, and several smaller areas in and around New York and New England.

We conducted a retrospective study to analyze S-2 positive (+) patients on CDT to describe the S-2 duration and its impact on CDT. Methods:Two hundred ninety-nine patients with cancer were tested with nasopharyngeal (NP) S-2 PCR assay at Columbia University Medical Irving Center (CUIMC), a Minority-NCI Community Oncology site, of which 77 (26%) tested positive. We retrospectively analyzed 26 S-2 (+) patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving CDT who consented to the study. NP PCR was repeated every 1 to 2 weeks until 2 successive negative (?) PCRs were obtained prior to restarting CDT. Time to 2 (?) PCR and serology results were recorded. Cycling thresholds (Ct) were obtained for S-2 specific targets and represented an indirect measure of viral load. Results: Demographics of N = 26 patients are: Hispanic (N = 17, 65%), Black (N = 1, 4%), White (N = 7, 27%), and undeclared (N = 1, 4%). Among the tumor histologies represented, gastrointestinal (N = 9, 35%), breast (N = 5, 19%), and sarcoma (N = 3, 12%) were most common. Median time to 2 (?) PCR was 32 days. Twenty patients required greater than 14 days to achieve 2 sequential (?) swabs. CDT was delayed in 21 patients (81%) of whom three experienced disease progression, likely attributed to an interruption in CDT, which was delayed by a mean of 53 days. Interestingly, nine (41%) patients had Ct values greater than 34 for the pan SARS target and seven (32%) patients had Ct values greater than 34 for the SARS-COV-2 target. Sixteen of 16 patients on CDT, tested positive for IgG antibodies at the time of consent, despite protracted viral detectability by NP PCR. Conclusion: Patients receiving CDT appear to have prolonged detectable S-2 by PCR, which can lead to interruption of CDT and POD in patients. We believe and recommend that patients with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 and aggressive malignancies are at greatest risk for cancer related morbidity and mortality due to CDT cessation and should be considered for continued CDT without interruption. Ct values and serology testing are tools that can help identify those patients on CDT who may be at greatest risk of worsening COVID-19 or of spreading S-2.","output":"A double-edged sword: Prolonged detection of SARS-COV-2 in patients receiving cancer directed therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An estimation of the impact of climatic conditionsmeasured with an index that combines temperature and humidity, the IPTCCon the hospitalizations and deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 is proposed.

Firstly, a Granger causal analysis is developed and reveals that past values of the IPTCC contain information that allow for a better prediction of hospitalizations or deaths than that obtained without the IPTCC. Finally, a vector autoregressive model is estimated to evaluate the dynamic response of hospitalizations and deaths after an increase in the IPTCC. It is estimated that a 10-point increase in the IPTCC causes hospitalizations to rise by 2.9% (90% CI 0.7C5.0) one week after the increase, and by 4.1% (90% CI 2.1C6.4) and 4.4% (90% CI 2.5C6.3) in the two following weeks. Over ten weeks, the cumulative effect is estimated to reach 20.1%. Two weeks after the increase in the IPTCC, deaths are estimated to rise by 3.7% (90% CI 1.6C5.8).

Material and Methods: We performed a comprehensive search for peer- and nonpeer- reviewed literature published between 1905 and 2020. Results: Face mask wearing in hospital settings to prevent disease transmission from health care workers to their patients originates with the first use of the mask in surgery in 1897 by German surgeon Johann von Mikulicz. During the first half of the 20th century, various scientific investigators focused on determining the most effective type of medical mask. The role of the face mask in the general population as a preventive intervention during public health emergencies is supported by historical reports spanning from the European Bubonic Plague in 1619, to the Great Manchurian Plague of 1910-1911, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and the current coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although the face mask has helped against airborne disease transmission, its benefits during pandemics have been filtered through the prism of political leanings and geopolitical interests.

METHODS: This study included 172 SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs who were infected between the 25th of February and the 7th of April 2020. A nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were used to indicate. RESULTS: Initially, the most common sources of infection were other positive HCWs (49%). Medical doctors and nursing assistants were most frequently infected, with infection rates of 53/1000 and 50/1000, respectively. COVID-19 departments were less affected than internal medicine, surgery, intensive care, or emergency room. The most commonly reported symptom was mild cough, while loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) were reported as moderate and severe by 30-40% of HCWs. The time necessary for 50% of workers to recover from the infection was 23 days, while it took 41 days for 95% of HCWs to become virus-free.

The signaling role of salicylic acid (SA) in regulating crosstalk between endogenous plant growth regulators' levels was investigated in barley (Hordeum vulgare L. 'Ince'; 2n = 14) leaves and roots under salt stress. Salinity (150 and 300 mM NaCl) markedly reduced leaf relative water content (RWC), growth parameters, and leaf water potential (LWP), but increased proline levels in both vegetative organs. Exogenous SA treatment did not significantly affect salt-induced negative effects on RWC, LWP, and growth parameters but increased the leaf proline content of plants under 150 mM salt stress by 23.1%, suggesting that SA enhances the accumulation of proline, which acts as a compatible solute that helps preserve the leaf's water status under salt stress. Changes in endogenous phytohormone levels were also investigated to identify agents that may be involved in responses to increased salinity and exogenous SA. Salt stress strongly affected endogenous cytokinin (CK) levels in both vegetative organs, increasing the concentrations of CK free bases, ribosides, and nucleotides. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, auxin) levels were largely unaffected by salinity alone, especially in barley leaves, but SA strongly increased IAA levels in leaves at high salt concentration and suppressed salinity-induced reductions in IAA levels in roots. Salt stress also significantly increased abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene levels; the magnitude of this increase was reduced by treatment with exogenous SA. Both salinity and SA treatment reduced jasmonic acid (JA) levels at 300 mM NaCl but had little effect at 150 mM NaCl, especially in leaves. These results indicate that under high salinity, SA has antagonistic effects on levels of ABA, JA, ethylene, and most CKs, as well as basic morphological and physiological parameters, but has a synergistic effect on IAA, which was well exhibited by principal component analysis (PCA).","output":"The Effects of Exogenous Salicylic Acid on Endogenous Phytohormone Status in Hordeum vulgare L. under Salt Stress."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Intracranial hemorrhage (including subarachnoid hemorrhage) has been reported in 0.3 to 1.2% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

HIV-positive and -negative adults (18 years) with clinically suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention- or control group, stratified by center and HIV status. The intervention consists of a management algorithm including extended focused assessment of sonography for HIV and tuberculosis (eFASH) in combination with chest X-ray and microbiological tests. Treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs is started, if eFASH is positive, chest X-ray suggests tuberculosis, or a microbiological result is positive for tuberculosis. Patients in the control group are managed according national guidelines. Treatment is started if microbiology is positive or empirically according to the treating physician. The primary outcome is the proportion of correctly managed patients at 6 months (i.e patients who were treated with anti-tuberculosis treatment and had definite or probable tuberculosis, and patients who were not treated with anti-tuberculosis treatment and did not have tuberculosis).

The definite diagnosis of a hazelnut allergy relies on an oral food challenge. The role of component resolved diagnostics in reducing the need for oral food challenges in the diagnosis of hazelnut allergies is still debated. Therefore, three electronic databases were systematically searched for studies on the diagnostic accuracy of specific-IgE (sIgE) on hazelnut proteins for identifying children with a hazelnut allergy. Studies regarding IgE testing on at least one hazelnut allergen component in children whose final diagnosis was determined by oral food challenges or a suggestive history of serious symptoms due to a hazelnut allergy were included. Study quality was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Eight studies enrolling 757 children, were identified. Overall, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve and diagnostic odd ratio of Cor a 1 sIgE were lower than those of Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 sIge. When the test results were positive, the post-test probability of a hazelnut allergy was 34% for Cor a 1 sIgE, 60% for Cor a9 sIgE and 73% for Cor a 14 sIgE. When the test results were negative, the post-test probability of a hazelnut allergy was 55% for Cor a 1 sIgE, 16% for Cor a9 sIgE and 14% for Cor a 14 sIgE. Measurement of IgE levels to Cor a 9 and Cor a 14 might have the potential to improve specificity in detecting clinically tolerant children among hazelnut-sensitized ones, reducing the need to perform oral food challenges.","output":"Component-Resolved Diagnosis of Hazelnut Allergy in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and are currently being investigated in trials as potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To continually assess, as more evidence becomes available, whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trial registries to identify completed and ongoing studies on 4 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of study design, disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for controlled non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs), and the assessment criteria for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer for non-controlled NRSIs. MAIN RESULTS: This is the first living update of our review. We included 20 studies (1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs, 16 non-controlled NRSIs) with 5443 participants, of whom 5211 received convalescent plasma, and identified a further 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are randomised. We did not identify any completed studies evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. Overall risk of bias of included studies was high, due to study design, type of participants, and other previous or concurrent treatments. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from four controlled studies (1 RCT (stopped early) with 103 participants, of whom 52 received convalescent plasma; and 3 controlled NRSIs with 236 participants, of whom 55 received convalescent plasma) to assess effectiveness of convalescent plasma. Control groups received standard care at time of treatment without convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge (1 controlled NRSI, 21 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on all-cause mortality at hospital discharge (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.31; very low-certainty evidence). Time to death (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma prolongs time to death (RCT: hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.82; controlled NRSI: HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms, assessed by need for respiratory support (1 RCT, 103 participants; 1 controlled NRSI, 195 participants) We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma has any effect on improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days (RCT: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.19), 14 days (RCT: RR 1.85, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.77; controlled NRSI: RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.29), and 28 days (RCT: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.81; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life No studies reported this outcome. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 We included results from 1 RCT, 3 controlled NRSIs and 10 non-controlled NRSIs assessing safety of convalescent plasma. Reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events was variable. The controlled studies reported on adverse events and serious adverse events only in participants receiving convalescent plasma. The duration of follow-up varied. Some, but not all, studies included death as a serious adverse event. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (13 studies, 201 participants) The studies did not report the grade of adverse events. Thirteen studies (201 participants) reported on adverse events of possible grade 3 or 4 severity. The majority of these adverse events were allergic or respiratory events. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events (14 studies, 5201 participants) Fourteen studies (5201 participants) reported on serious adverse events. The majority of participants were from one non-controlled NRSI (5000 participants), which reported only on serious adverse events limited to the first four hours after convalescent plasma transfusion. This study included death as a serious adverse event; they reported 15 deaths, four of which they classified as potentially, probably or definitely related to transfusion. Other serious adverse events reported in all studies were predominantly allergic or respiratory in nature, including anaphylaxis, transfusion-associated dyspnoea, and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma affects the number of serious adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is beneficial for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19. For safety outcomes we also included non-controlled NRSIs. There was limited information regarding adverse events. Of the controlled studies, none reported on this outcome in the control group. There is only very low-certainty evidence for safety of convalescent plasma for COVID-19. While major efforts to conduct research on COVID-19 are being made, problems with recruiting the anticipated number of participants into these studies are conceivable. The early termination of the first RCT investigating convalescent plasma, and the multitude of studies registered in the past months illustrate this. It is therefore necessary to critically assess the design of these registered studies, and well-designed studies should be prioritised. Other considerations for these studies are the need to report outcomes for all study arms in the same way, and the importance of maintaining comparability in terms of co-interventions administered in all study arms. There are 98 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin, of which 50 are RCTs. This is the first living update of the review, and we will continue to update this review periodically. These updates may show different results to those reported here.","output":"Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19: a living systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To investigate the COVID-19 pandemic related alteration of health promoting behaviour during lockdown among medical students compared to other students. In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 1940 Bavarian students. Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire 3 weeks after lockdown implementation, evaluating their lifestyle behaviour focusing on self-reported and objectively assessed physical activity. 1154 medical (59.5%) and 786 non-medical (40.5%) students were included (median age 22.0 [IQR, 20.0C25.0], 71.5% female). Physical activity decreased in both groups after lockdown implementation. During lockdown, medical students reported higher physical activity levels compared to non-medical students. This was corroborated by daily step count data assessed by wearables (median steps per day [IQR], 6979 [5218C9348] versus 6581 [4497C8491], p = 0.02). Smoking behaviour during lockdown did not differ between medical and non-medical students (increased in 11.8% vs 13.6%, decreased in 31.9% versus 36.9%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, alteration of lifestyle behaviour among medical students was significantly different compared to non-medical students.

Many schemes have been developed for the security preservation of data in e-health systems however the schemes are not adaptive and cannot resist chosen and known-plaintext attacks. In this contribution, we present an adaptive framework aimed at preserving the security and confidentiality of images transmitted through an e-healthcare system. Our scheme utilizes the 3D-chaotic system to generate a keystream which is used to perform 8-bit and 2-bit permutations of the image. We perform pixel diffusion by a key-image generated using the Piecewise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM). We calculate an image parameter using the pixels of the image and perform criss-cross diffusion to enhance security. We evaluate the schemes performance in terms of histogram analysis, information entropy analysis, statistical analysis, and differential analysis. Using the scheme, we obtain the average Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR) and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI) values for an image of size 256  256 equal to 99.5996 and 33.499 respectively. Furthermore, the average entropy is 7.9971 and the average Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is 7.4756. We further test the scheme on 50 chest X-Ray images of patients having COVID-19 and viral pneumonia and found the average values of variance, PSNR, entropy, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to be 257.6268, 7.7389, 7.9971, and 0.0089 respectively. Furthermore, the scheme generates completely uniform histograms for medical images which reveals that the scheme can resist statistical attacks and can be applied as a security framework in AI-based healthcare.","output":"An efficient image encryption scheme for healthcare applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To determine pig liver sectorization and segmentation through the representation of their correlation to portal and hepatic veins, and through the development of virtual reality (VR) animation.

Currently, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on information gleaned from the patients self-report, what the clinician observes directly, and what the clinician gathers from collateral informants, but these elements are prone to subjectivity. Utilizing computer vision to measure facial expressions is a promising approach to adding more objectivity in the evaluation and diagnosis of schizophrenia. METHOD: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed and Google Scholar. Relevant publications published before (including) December 2021 were identified and evaluated for inclusion. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of computer vision for facial behavior analysis in schizophrenia studies, the clinical findings, and the corresponding data processing and machine learning methods. RESULTS: Seventeen studies published between 2007 to 2021 were included, with an increasing trend in the number of publications over time. Only 14 articles used interviews to collect data, of which different combinations of passive to evoked, unstructured to structured interviews were used. Various types of hardware were adopted and different types of visual data were collected. Commercial, open-access, and in-house developed models were used to recognize facial behaviors, where frame-level and subject-level features were extracted. Statistical tests and evaluation metrics varied across studies. The number of subjects ranged from 2-120, with an average of 38. Overall, facial behaviors appear to have a role in estimating diagnosis of schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms. When studies were evaluated with a quality assessment checklist, most had a low reporting quality. CONCLUSION: Despite the rapid development of computer vision techniques, there are relatively few studies that have applied this technology to schizophrenia research. There was considerable variation in the clinical paradigm and analytic techniques used. Further research is needed to identify and develop standardized practices, which will help to promote further advances in the field.","output":"Utilizing computer vision for facial behavior analysis in schizophrenia studies: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The objective was to determine the prevalence, predictors and reasons for home delivery amongst women of childbearing age in Dodoma, Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst women living in Dodoma Municipality. Data were collected using adapted questionnaires and analysed using SPPS version 23. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the independent predictors of home delivery. Results: A total of 425 women of childbearing age were enrolled in this study. The mean ( SD) age of the participants was 28.7 (7.1) years. The prevalence of home delivery was 35.5% (n=150, 95% CI 30.9 - 40.2). Women with secondary school and above had 93% less odds of home delivery than women who had no education (AOR=0.0795% CI: 0.03-0.18). Women who lived in rural areas (AOR=3.49, 95% CI: 2.12-5.75), and women living more than 5km from health facilities (AOR=2.67, 95% CI: 1.65-4.37) had higher odds of home delivery. The main reasons for home delivery were transportation cost, and long distance to the nearest health facilities. Conclusion: In this population, the prevalence of home delivery remained to be high.

A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control. Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV). CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters. We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R(0) = 3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population. Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction/invasion threshold of the host contact network. Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R(e)) in the general dog population is close to 1.0. Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency. Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza.","output":"Contact Heterogeneity, Rather Than Transmission Efficiency, Limits the Emergence and Spread of Canine Influenza Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism and hospitality crises that are extensively discussed online are damaging to organizational image and reputation; therefore, choosing effective response strategies is of paramount importance for service providers.

METHODS: A total of 114 law enforcement officers from a mid-sized Midwestern US city completed daily logs of job stressors and associated perceived stress, as well as additional self-report measures of perceived stress, trait mindfulness and resilience, and demographics and work information. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to cluster job stressors into a smaller number of components in a data-driven manner. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the relationship between stressor exposure and perceived stress for each component, and the moderation of this relationship by trait mindfulness and resilience. RESULTS: The PCA categorized stressor exposure into three components: (1) acute or traumatic line-of-duty stressors, (2) routine daily stressors, and (3) interpersonal stressors. Results of mixed models showed robust positive relationships between self-reported stressor exposure and corresponding perceived stress across all 3 components. Dispositional mindfulness (but not resilience) moderated the association between stressor exposure and perceived stress for routine stressors, such that individuals with higher dispositional mindfulness showed a relatively attenuated relationship between exposure to routine daily stressors and resulting perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Police officers high in dispositional mindfulness may experience daily routine stressors as less stressful, which can reduce the accumulation of general stress in the long term and which could help buffer against negative health outcomes associated with perceived stress.

Since the putative receptor for the virus is identified in reproductive organs, it is important to examine if SARS-CoV-2 targets the human reproductive tract. And, if so, is COVID-19 a sexually transmitted disease (STD)? Evidence Review: A systematic review of English publications to December 11, 2020, was conducted in PubMed, NIH iCite COVID-19 portfolio, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases, searching for SARS-CoV-2 in testes, seminal, prostatic and vaginal fluids, and in cervical smears. 1,997 records were identified, duplicates were removed, and 1,490 records were reviewed for eligibility by examining titles and abstracts. 202 full-text relevant articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers. 47studies (literature reviews, editorials, and guidelines) were assessed qualitatively and 23 studies that tested the male and female reproductive tracts of COVID-19 patients for SARS-CoV-2 were quantitatively analyzed. Findings: No epidemiological investigations to date have described evidence suggesting that COVID-19 is an STD. While ACE2 receptor is found in reproductive organs, the lack of co-expression of the TMPRSS2 modulatory protein, required for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, in testicular cells, sperm, or oocytes, argues against the hypothesis that gametes transmit SARS-CoV-2. Molecular detection studies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the male and female reproductive tracts were summarized: 98.0% (293/299) of the seminal fluids, 16/17 testicular biopsies, all 89 prostatic fluids, 98.3% (57/58) of the vaginal fluids, all 35 cervical smears, and all 16 oocyte samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. None of the studies confirmed sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may have detrimental effects on male reproduction by inducing orchitis and/or decreasing testosterone levels, sperm counts, and motility. Conclusions: Based on the current worldwide published information, COVID-19 is not an STD. This information is important for clinicians, proposed guidelines for public health, FDA guidelines for gamete and tissue donor eligibility, and for fertility treatments. Universal precautions, currently practiced worldwide, are adequate and sufficient at this time to prevent the transmission of known or unknown viral infections. We suggest that recovered patients of COVID-19, especially those with infertility, should be evaluated for their ovarian and testicular function.","output":"COVID-19 May Affect Male Fertility but is Not Sexually Transmitted: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Herein, we present a case of heatstroke encephalopathy with abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals. A 19-year-old man lost consciousness while working outdoors when the temperature was 35C. His Glasgow Coma Scale score at presentation was E1V1M1, and his body temperature was 39C. Chest computed tomography revealed bilateral infiltrates, and tests for urinary pneumococcal antigens were positive. He was diagnosed with heatstroke preceded by pneumococcal pneumonia. He was subsequently treated with antibiotics, and body surface cooling was performed. A diffusion-weighted brain MRI performed on day eight revealed abnormal bilateral hyperintensities from the cortex at the frontal lobe apex of the subcortex. Moreover, he had reduced spontaneity, dysarthria, nystagmus, tremor, and ataxia of both the upper limbs. He was diagnosed with heatstroke encephalopathy. On day 28 since admission, the abnormal MRI signals disappeared. Subsequently, the patients spontaneity improved, but his other neurological dysfunctions persisted.

We conducted detailed investigations in six London care homes reporting suspected COVID-19 outbreaks during April 2020. METHODS: Residents and staff had nasal swabs for SARS CoV-2 testing using RT-PCR and were followed-up for 14 days. They were categorized as symptomatic, post-symptomatic or pre-symptomatic if they had symptoms at the time of testing, in the two weeks before or two weeks after testing, respectively, or asymptomatic throughout. Virus isolation and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was also performed. FINDINGS: Across the six care homes, 105/264 (39.8%) residents were SARS CoV-2 positive, including 28 (26.7%) symptomatic, 10 (9.5%) post-symptomatic, 21 (20.0%) pre-symptomatic and 46 (43.8%) who remained asymptomatic. Case-fatality at 14-day follow-up was highest among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive residents (10/28, 35.7%) compared to asymptomatic (2/4, 4.2%), post-symptomatic (2/10, 20.0%) or pre-symptomatic (3/21,14.3%) residents. Among staff, 53/254 (20.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 26/53 (49.1%) remained asymptomatic. RT-PCR cycle-thresholds and live-virus recovery were similar between symptomatic/asymptomatic residents/staff. Higher RT-PCR cycle threshold values (lower virus load) samples were associated with exponentially decreasing ability to recover infectious virus (P<0.001). WGS identified multiple (up to 9) separate introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 strains into individual care homes. INTERPRETATION: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was found in care homes residents and staff, half of whom were asymptomatic and potential reservoirs for on-going transmission. A third of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 residents died within 14 days. Symptom-based screening alone is not sufficient for outbreak control.

In this study, we investigated the role of children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in household transmission by identifying the index patient and contact tracing the household members. Methods A total of 103 children with COVID-19 who attended Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, between 25th March and 27th May 2020 were included in the study. A family cluster was defined as a group of >= two confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the same family, and a household contact (HHC) was defined as any person who had stayed in the same residence. Results In total, 78 family clusters and 307 HHCs belonging to these clusters were screened. In only four clusters was the index case determined to be in the pediatric age group (5.1%). Fathers, mothers, grandparents, and adult siblings were identified as the index cases in 37 (47.4%), 18 (23.0%), 8 (10.2%), and 6 (7.7%) clusters, respectively. Of the 307 HHCs, 88 were in the pediatric age group, and 39 were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive. Conclusion Our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 is uncommon in children without any history of contact to a RT-PCR test positive patient.

The clinical features and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection who develop a pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema has not been rigorously described or compared to those who do not develop these complications. So a systematic review of studies conducted on this subject was carried out to better manage these complications by investigating the underlying factors in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The search was conducted between early January and late December 2020 in databases including PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, using the following keywords and their combinations: COVID-19 Complication, Pneumothorax, Pneumomediastinum, Pneumopericardium, and Subcutaneous Emphysema. The extracted studies were screened separately by two researchers based on the PRISMA statement. After eliminating the duplicate studies, the title, abstract, and full text of the remaining studies were reviewed. Disagreements in the screening and selection of the studies were resolved by consensus or through a third-party opinion. RESULTS: A total of 793 articles were retrieved through the literature search, and 99 studies conducted on a total of 139 patients were finally included The patient mortality was found to have a significant relationship with positive pressure ventilation (P=0.0001). There was no significant relationship between the patients death and chest tube insertion (P=0.2) or between the interval of time from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of pneumothorax (P=0.7). The mean age was higher in the deceased cases, and the mean difference observed was statistically significant (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: With the expansion of our clinical understanding of COVID-19, recognition of the uncommon complications of COVID-19 especially pneumothorax is crucial. Although in our review we couldnt find a causal relationship between COVID-19 and pneumothorax or association between pneumothorax and death, as it is limited by many variables such as included studies design, or incomplete outcome data especially more information about the associated risk factors, we recommend performing more well-designed studies to describe the pneumothoraxes incidence, risk factors, and outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema in critically ill COVID-19 patients: A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Document: The current COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] pandemic is unprecedented in reach around the world and the extended nature of this invisible threat No one is left without impact whether it is direct such as exposure to infection or infection risks or changes in or loss of employment or indirect through impact on loved ones and communities [ ] Key to any mental health response to the current pandemic or other extended potentially highly distressing and/or traumatic events is a response that simultaneously considers both timing (referred to as phase) and associated distress and/or functional impairment (referred to as level) As defined below, the framework includes three phases (initial, post, and longer-term) and three levels (system level, self-directed level, and mental health supported brief intervention) COVID-19 (Disease);Mental health;Public health;Working in health care","output":"Phased Approach for Supporting the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers and Others Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic (PAC)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research investigates Instagram users sentiment narrated during the lockdown period in Italy, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The study is based on the analysis of all the posts published on Instagram under the hashtag #andrtuttobene on May 4, May 18 and June 3, 2020 Our research carried out a view on a national, regional and provincial scale We analyzed all the different languages and forms (i e captions, hashtags, emojis and images) that constitute the posts The aim of this research is to provide a set of procedures revealing the different polarity trends for each kind of expression and to propose a single comprehensive measure Copyright ? 2020 for this paper by its authors","output":"#AndrTuttobene: Images, texts, emojis and geodata in a sentiment analysis pipeline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of vertical confinement. In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (e.g. age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. Sensitivity analysis shows the 95% confidence interval brackets a order of magnitude in cases or three weeks in time. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound.

However, studies on this impact are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the age-related changes in QoL and ADLs in patients with spinal disorders, and also identify factors associated with decline in ADLs. This multicenter cross-sectional study included patients who visited four private spine clinics for any symptoms. The study participants either had a clinic reservation, were first-time clinic visitors, or had a return visit to the clinic. The participants completed several questionnaires at two points: pre-pandemic and post-second wave. Changes in patient symptoms, exercise habits, ADLs, and health-related QoL were assessed. A logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) of each variable for decline in ADLs. We included 606 patients; among them, 281 and 325 patients were aged <65 and 65 years, respectively.

METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken in April 2020. In four teams of three reviewers each, all abstracts were independently reviewed for inclusion by two reviewers. Using a pre-defined checklist of 93 criteria for each publication, data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers and subsequently compared and discussed. If necessary, a third reviewer resolved any discrepancies. The search was updated in February 2021 to retrieve new publications on HRQoL issues including issues related to the long-term consequences of COVID-19. RESULTS: The search in April 2020 identified 3342 potentially relevant publications, and 339 publications were selected for full-text review and data extraction. We identified 75 distinct symptoms and other HRQoL issues categorized into 12 thematic areas; from general symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and fatigue, to neurological and psychological issues. The updated search revealed three extra issues experienced during active disease and long-term problems with fatigue, psychological issues and impaired cognitive function. CONCLUSION: This first comprehensive systematic review provides a detailed overview of the wide range of HRQoL issues experienced by patients with COVID-19 throughout the course of the disease.

The relationship between paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups were selected for the study, the COVID-19 and the control groups. The control group consisted of 40 patients who applied to our clinic with headache and therefore underwent PNS CT. The other group consisted of 40 patients with COVID-19 who were diagnosed with sudden loss of smell with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) olfactory test. Clinical and demographic characteristics, tomography results, and olfactory test scores of patients with COVID-19 loss of smell and control group patients were recorded. The relationship between CT changes in the olfactory cleft and the degree of loss of smell was evaluated. The \\"Opacification in the olfactory cleft\\" was accepted as a positive CT finding. RESULTS: Comparison of patients with COVID-19 who had a loss of smell and the control group indicated that a significant difference was observed in terms of CT findings (P = .022). When we evaluated the paranasal CTs obtained from our patients with loss of smell, the CT of 13 patients showed pathological findings (P < .05). As the COVID-19 progressed (pneumonia and respiratory failure), the degree of loss of smell increased (P < .05). A statistically significant relationship was found between the CCCRC score and the presence of PNS CT findings (P = .0012). CONCLUSION: The PNS CT findings are significant in patients with COVID-19 with a loss of smell and were significantly associated with the degree of loss of smell. In patients with olfactory loss due to COVID-19, PNS CT can help in diagnosis.

As COVID-19-related infection and mortality rates in Devon and Cornwall were relatively low, however, urgent elective surgery continued in Plymouth, with the necessary precautions in place. This study aimed to assess outcomes following Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy (ILO) during the pandemic. METHODS: We prospectively analysed details of 20 consecutive patients who underwent ILO for cancer over a 3-month period between 17 March and 12 June 2020. All patients underwent COVID-19 swab testing 24-48 hours before surgery and during admission when clinically indicated. The primary outcome measure was COVID-19-related morbidity. Secondary outcome measures were non-COVID-19-related morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent ILO during the study period. All patients identified as white British. No patients tested positive for COVID-19 pre- or postoperatively. There was no COVID-19-related morbidity. There was no in-hospital mortality. Seven patients developed pneumonia, which settled with antibiotics. One patient developed an anastomotic leak, which was treated conservatively. One patient returned to theatre for a para-conduit hernia repair. The median length of hospital stay was nine days. One patient required admission to the high dependency unit for inotropic support for two days.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. RESULTS: Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary. Participants who refused telematic support had a significantly shorter time interval from the last ear, nose, and throat visit than patients who accepted (57.95 vs 96.14 days, P = .03). Video-called patients showed significantly decreased levels of anxiety and depression (mean Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score pre- vs post-video call: 13.97 vs. 10.23, P < .0001) and reported high levels of satisfaction about the service.

Methods: Using different search strategies, 18 relevant studies were identified and their strength, limitations and significance were assessed. Results: Analysis of 4 RCT datasets did not suggest increased NIRD risk in recipients of live-attenuated vaccines (LAIV) and results of a cohort study suggested short-term protection consistent with the hypothesis of trained immunity. One RCT, four cohort studies and one test-negative case-control suggested increased NIRD risk in recipients of inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV), whereas five test-negative case-control studies did not show an increased risk associated with a specific viral pathogen. Cross-protection against COVID-19 was suggested in one cross-sectional study on IIV but major biases could not be excluded. Results of four recent ecological studies on COVID-19 were challenging to interpret. Conclusions: Available data on LAIV are reassuring but not all those on IIV.

Several animal models have been used to 1) study coronary atherosclerosis natural history and 2) propose predictive tools for this disease, that is asymptomatic for a long time, aiming for a direct translation of their findings to human coronary arteries. Among them, swine models are largely used due to the observed anatomical and pathophysiological similarities to humans. However, a direct comparison between swine and human models in terms of coronary hemodynamics, known to influence atherosclerotic onset/development, is still lacking. In this context, we performed a detailed comparative analysis between swine- and human-specific computational hemodynamic models of coronary arteries. The analysis involved several near-wall and intravascular flow descriptors, previously emerged as markers of coronary atherosclerosis initiation/progression, as well as anatomical features. To do that, non-culprit coronary arteries (18 rightCRCA, 18 left anterior descendingCLAD, 13 left circumflexCLCX coronary artery) from patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome were imaged by intravascular ultrasound and coronary computed tomography angiography. Similarly, the three main coronary arteries of ten adult mini-pigs were also imaged (10 RCA, 10 LAD, 10 LCX). The geometries of the imaged coronary arteries were reconstructed (49 human, 30 swine), and computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed by imposing individualized boundary conditions. Overall, no relevant differences in 1) wall shear stress-based quantities, 2) intravascular hemodynamics (in terms of helical flow features), and 3) anatomical features emerged between human- and swine-specific models. The findings of this study strongly support the use of swine-specific computational models to study and characterize the hemodynamic features linked to coronary atherosclerosis, sustaining the reliability of their translation to human vascular disease.","output":"Comparison of Swine and Human Computational Hemodynamics Models for the Study of Coronary Atherosclerosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the blood, also known as RNAemia, has been reported, but its prognostic implications are not well understood. This study aimed to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma and its association with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed in a single-center tertiary care institution in northern California and included consecutive inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The prevalence of SARS CoV-2 RNAemia and the strength of its association with clinical severity variables were examined and included the need for transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and 30-day all-cause mortality. Results: Paired nasopharyngeal and plasma samples were included from 85 patients. The overall median age was 55 years, and individuals with RNAemia were older than those with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma (63 vs 50 years; p=0.001). Comorbidities were frequent including obesity (37.7%), hypertension (30.6%) and diabetes mellitus (22.4%). RNAemia was detected in a total of 28/85 (32.9%) individual patients, including 22/28 (78.6%) who required hospital admission. RNAemia was detected more frequently in individuals who developed severe disease including the need for ICU transfer (32.1% vs 14.0%; p=0.05), mechanical ventilation (21.4% vs 3.5%; p=0.01) and 30-day all-cause mortality (14.3% vs 0%; p=0.01).

The reproduction number R of the virus could be counted directly, and was roughly, but not precisely, exponentially distributed. The number of secondary infections was greater for an infection which was itself one of many secondary infections because of environmental heterogeneity, which created variance of R among sites and could drive the spread of infection, even when global R < 1. Different kinds of intervention were deployed to curtail the spread of infection. Measures applied to the general population, such as closing down sites and services or regulating individual behaviour, did not reduce the total number of individuals infected during the epidemic unless they were maintained until the virus became extinct. This was primarily because measures taken to reduce indirect transmission tended to increase direct transmission, and vice versa. Consequently, the overall effect of any combination of interventions was much less than the sum of their separate effects. On the other hand, the quarantine of infected or exposed individuals was effective in driving the virus to extinction and caused a permanent and substantial reduction in the number of cases.","output":"Modeling an epidemic in an imaginary small town"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A vaccine to protect against COVID-19 is urgently needed. We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain. METHODS: We did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5aa1010, 1aa1011, and 15aa1011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127. FINDINGS: Between March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 363 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination. INTERPRETATION: The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.

The seroprevalence to BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of BRD and to perform phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. RESULTS: BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view of BRSV as the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of BRSV positive samples showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II, along with other North European isolates. One isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the G protein. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that BRSV is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of BRD in Norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent.

Protein translocation into the ER can occur co- and posttranslationally. In yeast, posttranslational translocation involves the heptameric translocase complex including its Sec62p and Sec63p subunits. The mammalian ER membrane contains orthologs of yeast Sec62p and Sec63p, but their function is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the effects of excess and deficit Sec63 on various ER cargoes using human cell culture systems. The overexpression of Sec63 reduces the steady-state levels of viral and cellular multi-spanning membrane proteins in a cotranslational mode, while soluble and single-spanning ER reporters are not affected. Consistent with this, the knock-down of Sec63 increases the steady-state pools of polytopic ER proteins, suggesting a substrate-specific and regulatory function of Sec63 in ER import. Overexpressed Sec63 exerts its down-regulating activity on polytopic protein levels independent of its Sec62-interacting motif, indicating that it may not act in conjunction with Sec62 in human cells. The specific action of Sec63 is further sustained by our observations that the up-regulation of either Sec62 or two other ER proteins with lumenal J domains, like ERdj1 and ERdj4, does not compromise the steady-state level of a multi-spanning membrane reporter. A J domain-specific mutation of Sec63, proposed to weaken its interaction with the ER resident BiP chaperone, reduces the down-regulating capacity of excess Sec63, suggesting an involvement of BiP in this process. Together, these results suggest that Sec63 may perform a substrate-selective quantity control function during cotranslational ER import.","output":"Role of Human Sec63 in Modulating the Steady-State Levels of Multi-Spanning Membrane Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Proper strategies to minimise the risk of infection in individuals handling the bodies of deceased persons infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) are urgently needed. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION: While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies.

When compared with the Control group, decidual tissues from 3rd Tri COVID exhibited significantly increased macrophages, NK cells and T cells, whereas 2nd Tri COVID only had significantly increased T cells. In evaluating decidual cytokine expression, we noted that IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF- were significantly correlated with macrophage cell abundance. However, in 2nd Tri COVID tissues, there was significant downregulation of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-. Taken together, these results suggest innate and adaptive immune responses are present at the maternal-fetal interface in maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections late in pregnancy, and that infections earlier in pregnancy show evidence of a resolving immune response. Further studies are warranted to characterize the full scope of intrauterine immune responses in pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19.","output":"Decidual immune response following COVID-19 during pregnancy varies by timing of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Herbal medicine (HM) is attracting attention for treating atopic dermatitis (AD). This overview was conducted to summarize and critically evaluate the current systematic reviews (SRs) on HM for the treatment of AD. Methods: Through comprehensive searches, all relevant SRs on HM for AD published until May 2020 were included. The quality of included SRs was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Moreover, original randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the SRs were resynthesized to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral HM for AD. The quality of evidence for the main findings was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results: Nine SRs were included in this overview. HM showed significantly better efficacy in terms of total effective rate (TER), itching and sleep symptom scores, quality of life, and the dose of topical treatment used compared with placebo. HM as a monotherapy and/or an adjunctive therapy to conventional medication (CM) showed significantly better results on the efficacy, symptom relief, and some laboratory parameters related to the inflammatory response. The methodological quality was generally low. When 58 original RCTs were reanalyzed, HM showed significantly lower SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score and higher TER than the placebo or CM. In terms of the safety profile, HM was not significantly different from the placebo and was better than CM. The quality of evidence ranged from \\"moderate\\" to \\"very low.\\" Conclusion: The results suggested that HM as a monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy is promising for the treatment of AD.

Of these papers, 22 described the process of formulation, implementation, or evaluation of policies whose aim was to reduce gender inequalities in health; six focused on recommendations, and the remaining five dealt with both issues. Our review showed that the policies aimed at reducing gender inequalities in health, either implemented or formulated as proposals, are scarce. Moreover, despite some success, overall progress has been slow. The studies show failures in design and particularly in the implementation process. We found a lack of awareness and capacity in the policy-making progress, under-financing, bureaucratization, shortage of relevant data, and absence of womens participation in decision-making. Therefore, an emphasis on the design and implementation of gender-sensitive policies seems essential to advance gender equality in health.

Meanwhile, in the US, federal policies for student visas required international students to maintain physical presence, reflecting a more hostile stance towards immigration, characteristic of the Trump administration.

In this study, we built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system that detects aberrant physiological and activity signals (heart rates and steps) associated with the onset of early infection and implemented this system in a prospective study. In a cohort of 3,318 participants, of whom 84 were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this system generated alerts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 (80%) of the infected individuals. Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases.

We aimed to collect information on psychologically distressing experiences of Italians living in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From 6 to 20 April 2020 participants filled out an online questionnaire. Demographic and physical symptoms data from the prior 14 days of quarantine were collected. Psychological impact of quarantine was assessed by the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). RESULTS: In all, 20,158 participants completed the online survey. Of these, 11,910 (59.1%) were from Lombardy, the region with 37.7% of positive cases identified during the survey period. 30.1% of responders were male. About half (55.9%) of responders were 18-50 years old, 54.3% had a tertiary level of education, 69.5% were workers, 84.1% were living in houses with &#8805;3 rooms, and 13.7% were living alone. 9.7% had had contact with COVID-19 positive people. Of all responders, 9978 (48.6%) reported a psychological impact, 8897 (43.4%) of whom reported mild or moderate and 1081 (5.2%) severe psychological impact. The multivariate analysis, after adjustments, showed that an increasing CPDI score was associated with gender (female), first-second educational level, being unemployed, living in a &#8804;2 room house, having had new health problems during the previous 14 days, and not having been out of the house in the previous week. Concerning the type of psychological distress, 2003 responders (9.9%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 1131 (5.5%) moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and 802 (3.9%) moderate to severe physical symptoms. A positive correlation was found between responder rate (per 10.000 residents) and positive COVID-19 cases (per 10.000 residents) by region (rs = + 0.83, p = < 0.0001), and between responder rate and region latitude (rs = + 0.91, p = < 0.0001), with a greater response rate in the north. Considering Lombardy Region responders, a negative correlation between CPDI score and distance from place of residence to the red zone (Nembro-Alzano) was found. Higher prevalence of psychological distress was found up to 25 km away from the red zone and, in particular, severe distress up to 15 km. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and mental health professionals should be aware of quarantine's adverse mental health consequences. Factors influencing the success of quarantine and infection control practices for both disease containment and community recovery should be identified and additional support to vulnerable persons at increased risk of adverse psychological and social consequences of quarantine should be guaranteed.","output":"Psychological distress among Italians during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination continues to be the main approach to protect animals from infectious diseases. Until recently, all licensed vaccines were developed using conventional technologies. Subunit vaccines are, however, gaining attention from researchers in the field of veterinary vaccinology, and among these, virus-like particles (VLPs) represent one of the most appealing approaches. VLPs are robust protein cages in the nanometer range that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome. They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety. VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities. In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens. VLPs have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines.

The disease as well IBD treatment frequently require immunosuppressant medications, which could increase their risk of infection. The aim of this study was to determine patients experience of the health care service, including the restrictions of hospitals visits made in Norway from Mars 12th 2020. METHOD: From June 18 to September 18 2020, all patients at the IBD outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital in Norway on biological therapy or other immunosuppressants were included. A questionnaire including patients concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy and COVID-19, as well as their health care service needs in follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Altogether 506 IBD patients answered a paper-based questionnaire. The mean age was 40.78 (SD 14.71), 289/506 (57%) men, ulcerative colitis 199/506 (39%), Crohns disease 307/506 (61%). Sixty-three patients (12.5%) used biological therapy in combination with azathioprine or steroids. Ninety-one (18.2%) were in obligated quarantine with negative test. Five patients (4.9%) tested positive to SARS- CoV-2 of the 98 patients tested, (1.0% of the total sample). One third of the IBD patients perceived they had increased risk for being infected by SARS- CoV-2 because of the immunosuppressive drugs they used. Nonetheless, 496/506 (98.6%) of the patients adhered to continuing their medication. One-hundred and sixty-one (32.3%) voluntarily isolated, and 21/506 (4.2%) was in sick leave being afraid of being infected. Furthermore, 20/506 (4.0%) cancelled their consultation because they were afraid of being infected from SARS- CoV-2 at the hospital. The hospital changed physical consultation to telephone consultation for 75/506 (15.0%) of the patients. Thirty-eight patients (7.6%) reported that they were afraid of going to the hospital because of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 18/506 (3.6%) did not feel safe when at hospital. Approximately half of the IBD patients (219/506) were satisfied with the information provided by physician about medical treatment for IBD and Covid-19 while 398/506 (77.3%) were satisfied with the information from health-care providers about restrictions due to COVID-19. There were no statistical differences between Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSION: IBD patients on biological treatment and immunosuppressives took precautions because of fear of being infected with SARS- CoV-2. At the same time, they adhere to medical treatment regimens and follow-up at the hospital. Most patients were satisfied with the information they received from physicians and other health-care workers.

Poor mental health is the most common reason for NHS staff sickness absences, usually accounting for 25% of all reported sick leave. At a time when the NHS most needs an available and efficient workforce, government and NHS employers lack the necessary evidence to inform decisions about how best to support the mental health needs of its staff. In this report, we share our experience and the initial figures from a newly developed multidisciplinary assessment and treatment service for NHS staff. METHOD: The Staff Mental Health Service (SMHS) at the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) launched in September 2020. The SMHS is commissioned by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough sustainability and transformation partnership and is accessible to the 25,513 staff based at five NHS trusts within the region. The service received 235 referrals within 5 months of the launch. All patients had a first clinical contact within three working days and more than 80% had their initial assessment within two weeks. The SMHS clinical team is comprised of consultant psychiatrists, senior clinical psychologists, specialist mental health nurses, and an occupational health nurse set to provide rapid access, confidential, evidence-based treatments for the NHS staff. As part of service evaluation within CPFT, we collected routine screening data (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Posttraumatic Symptom Check List C 6 (PCL-6)) from patients completing the initial assessment (n = 130). RESULT: According to the initial figures (n = 130) from a diverse group of healthcare staff, on average the patients presented with moderate level of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: 16.22  5.94). Anxiety levels were in moderate to severe range (GAD-7: 13.45  4.70). Average score of PCL-6 checklist for traumatic stress symptoms was higher than the established cut-off (>14): 19.43  5.65. CONCLUSION: The Staff Mental Health Service offers an innovative, multi-disciplinary rapid assessment and treatment clinic for NHS staff. The demand for the service has been immense, reaching double the number of predicted referrals. Initial data suggested high rates of moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers. Our clinical observations was that many healthcare workers have had longstanding significant mental health conditions that saw deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

RECENT FINDINGS: Immunosuppressed patients are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. Patients with ESRD and KTR are immunosuppressed and mount a weaker antibody response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, and factors including immunosuppressant medications have been implicated for this weakened response. Third and fourth doses of vaccine doses have been shown to increase seropositivity and antibody production in kidney transplant recipients and patients on dialysis. Retrospective studies have demonstrated decreased mortality in vaccinated, immunosuppressed patients. SUMMARY: ESRD and KTR patients have decreased antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines, but third and fourth doses have been shown to increase antibody production. Though a correlate of protection between antibody production and efficacy has yet to be fully established in this subset of the population, all US professional bodies who treat ESRD and KTR patients advocate for full vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 based on the data available. Studies demonstrating decreased mortality in vaccinated patients are promising on efficacy.

Methods We prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa, Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed. Results Excluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)%. Thirty-eight(34.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Median PFT parameters were within normal limits. Eight(21.1%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9%) a mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6%) patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with %pVO2 (p>0.05).

The occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has been reported to be as high as 43%. This is comparable to AKI in other forms of pneumonia requiring hospitalization, as well as in non-infectious conditions like cardiac surgery. The impact of AKI on COVID-19 outcomes is difficult to assess at present but, similar to other forms of sepsis, AKI is strongly associated with hospital mortality. Indeed, mortality is reported to be very low in COVID-19 patients without AKI. Given that AKI contributes to fluid and acid-base imbalances, compromises immune response and may impair resolution of inflammation, it seems likely that AKI contributes to mortality in these patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 are thought to be multifactorial including systemic immune and inflammatory responses induced by viral infection, systemic tissue hypoxia, reduced renal perfusion, endothelial damage and direct epithelial infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. Mitochondria play a central role in the metabolic deregulation in the adaptive response to the systemic inflammation and are also found to be vital in response to both direct viral damage and tissue reperfusion. These stress conditions are associated with increased glycolysis and reduced fatty acid oxidation. Thus, there is a strong rationale to target AKI for therapy in COVID-19. Furthermore, many approaches that have been developed for other etiologies of AKI such as sepsis, inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion, have relevance in the treatment of COVID-19 AKI and could be rapidly pivoted to this new disease.","output":"Targeting acute kidney injury in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the beginning of 2020, an urgent need to understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), much of which is due to dysbalanced immune responses, resonates across the world. COVID-19-associated neutrophilia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, aberrant neutrophil activation, and infiltration of neutrophils into lungs suggest that neutrophils are important players in the disease immunopathology. The main objective of this study was to assess the phenotypic and functional characteristics of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients, with particular focus on the interaction between neutrophils and T cells. We hypothesize that the altered functional characteristics of COVID-19 patient-derived neutrophils result in skewed Th1/Th17 adaptive immune response, thus contributing to disease pathology. The expansion of G-MDSC and immature forms of neutrophils was shown in the COVID-19 patients. In the COVID-19 neutrophil/T cell cocultures, neutrophils caused a strong polarity shift toward Th17, and, conversely, a reduction of IFN?3-producing Th1 cells. The Th17 promotion was NOS dependent. Neutrophils, the known modulators of adaptive immunity, skew the polarization of T cells toward the Th17 promotion and Th1 suppression in COVID-19 patients, contributing to the discoordinated orchestration of immune response against SARS-CoV-2. As IL-17 and other Th17-related cytokines have previously been shown to correlate with the disease severity, we suggest that targeting neutrophils and/or Th17 represents a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients.","output":"Neutrophils mediate Th17 promotion in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictive measures can reduce physical activity.

METHODS: Among the COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital, 100 patients were selected. Data about predisease physical activity (by short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire), oxygen requirement and presence of pneumonia, and current functional capacity (by the 6-min walking test) were collected. Continuous and categorical variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney U and 2 test, respectively (P < .05). RESULTS: The predisease physical activity levels and current functional capacity of patients with pneumonia and oxygen requirement were significantly lower than patients without pneumonia and oxygen requirement (P < .05).

Many of these communities report lower vaccine confidence and lower receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine. Understanding factors that influence the multifaceted decision-making process for vaccine uptake is critical for narrowing COVID-19Crelated disparities. OBJECTIVE: To examine factors that members of multiethnic communities at high risk for COVID-19 infection and morbidity report as contributing to vaccine decision-making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used community-engaged methods to conduct virtual focus groups from November 16, 2020, to January 28, 2021, with Los Angeles County residents. Potential participants were recruited through email, video, and telephone outreach to community partner networks. Focus groups were stratified by self-identified race and ethnicity as well as age. Transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Themes were categorized by contextual, individual, and vaccine-specific influences using the World Health Organizations Vaccine Hesitancy Matrix categories. RESULTS: A total of 13 focus groups were conducted with 70 participants (50 [71.4%] female) who self-identified as American Indian (n = 17 [24.3%]), Black/African American (n = 17 [24.3%]), Filipino/Filipina (n = 11 [15.7%]), Latino/Latina (n = 15 [21.4%]), or Pacific Islander (n = 10 [14.3%]). A total of 39 participants (55.7%) were residents from high-poverty zip codes, and 34 (48.6%) were essential workers. The resulting themes included policy implications for equitable vaccine distribution: contextual influences (unclear and unreliable information, concern for inequitable access or differential treatment, references to mistrust from unethical research studies, accessibility and accommodation barriers, eligibility uncertainty, and fears of politicization or pharmaceutical industry influence); social and group influences (inadequate exposure to trusted messengers or information, altruistic motivations, medical mistrust, and desire for autonomy); and vaccination-specific influences (need for vaccine evidence by subpopulation, misconceptions on vaccine development, allocation ambiguity, vaccination safety preferences, the importance of perceiving vaccine equity, burden of vaccine scheduling, cost uncertainty, and desire for practitioner recommendation). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, participants reported a number of factors that affected their vaccine decision-making, including concern for inequitable vaccine access. Participants endorsed policy recommendations and strategies to promote vaccine confidence. These results suggest that support of informed deliberation and attainment of vaccine equity will require multifaceted, multilevel policy approaches that improve COVID-19 vaccine knowledge, enhance trust, and address the complex interplay of sociocultural and structural barriers to vaccination.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Decision-making Factors in Racial and Ethnic Minority Communities in Los Angeles, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The significance of asymptomatic or pre-asymptomatic individuals in driving the COVID-19 epidemic in China or other countries remains uncertain. Method We collected and analyzed all the epidemiologic and virological diagnostic details of the infected individuals released by public health authorities and reiterated every episode of outbreak on a timeline. All individuals associated with the five outbreaks had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results In this study, all five COVID-19 outbreaks reported in China since October 2020 were analyzed. The Kashgar outbreak in Xinjiang province came into light for the first time on October 22, 2020. However, it was initiated before October 11, 2020, by a local asymptomatic import and export worker, who was infected at the working place. Subsequently, his wife caught the infection, which led to 430 more infections reported in the outbreak. The Beijing outbreak with 41 cases was noticed for the first time on December 22, 2020. However, our analysis revealed that it was initiated by an asymptomatic individual from Indonesia on December 10, 2020. The Shenyang outbreak, with 38 cases, noticed for the first time on December 23, 2020, was initiated by a pre-symptomatic individual from South Korea on December 13, 2020. Conclusion The asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals during the asymptomatic period were unsuspectingly infected by SARS-CoV-2, and unintentionally transmitted the virus to a large number of people. These findings suggest that early detection of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals is of critical importance in preventing future outbreaks or epidemics.","output":"All five COVID-19 outbreaks during epidemic period of 2020/2021 in China were instigated by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Article theorizes security as a site of continuing struggle in the international system between competing approaches to identifying and responding to urgent threats.

Age of patients, clinical stage, operation time, intraoperative and postoperative complications, blood loss, histopathological evaluation, postoperative continence, serum level of PSA were evaluated. RESULTS Mean age of the 8 patients was 59.85 years. All operations were completed without conversion to standard robotic procedure or open surgery. No intra operative complications occurred. Mean operating time was 143 minutes; prostate excision 123 minutes and urethrovesical anastomosis 20 minutes. Mean blood loss was 45 ml. Preoperative Gleason scores were (3 + 4) in one patient and (3 + 3) in 7 patients. Postoperative Gleason scores were (3 + 4) in 2 patients, and (3 + 3) in 6 patients. All these 8 cases were in T1c clinical stage. Early postoperative complications were drain leakage (n = 1), atelectasis (n = 1), wound infection (n = 1) and fever (n = 1). There was no positive surgical margin. The serum level of PSA was less than 0.2 ng/ml and no other complications happened during the 4 to 12 months follow-up period.

Multiple pain generators have been hypothesized to be responsible in severe spinal degeneration and it is difficult to identify a single pain generator;consequently, resulting in inadequate therapeutic results. Objectives: The study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous bone marrow MSCs in the treatment of chronic low back pain due to severe lumbar spinal degeneration with involvement of multiple structures. Study Design: Prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, parallel-controlled, 2-arm exploratory study. Setting: A private, specialized, interventional pain management and regenerative medicine clinic. Methods: The treatment group patients received a one-time bone marrow concentrate injection into spinal structures (i.e., discs, facets, spinal nerves, and sacroiliac joints), along with conventional treatment, whereas, the control group received conventional treatment with nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs, over-the-counter drugs, structured exercise programs, physical therapy, spinal injections and opioids, etc., as indicated. Outcomes Assessment: Outcomes were assessed utilizing multiple instruments, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), EuroQOL 5-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), Global Mental Health (GMH), and Global Physical Health (GPH). Multiple outcomes were assessed with primary outcomes being minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in ODI scores between the groups and/or a 2-point reduction in pain scores. In the study group, total nucleated cells, colony forming units-fibroblast, CD34-positive cell numbers and platelets were also recorded, along with post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging changes.

However during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, public and private insurers rapidly expanded access to telehealth in order to reduce exposure and avoid transmission. It is unknown whether telehealth will become a more regular substitute for in-person care beyond the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to provide evidence on the value of telehealth by comparing the productivity of physicians and other specialized clinicians who provide telehealth with the productivity of those who do not. RESEARCH DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 17,705 unique providers in the areas of internal medicine, cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, psychology, and optometry practicing in the US veterans affairs health care system during the period 2015 to 2018. For each year, we measured individual providers productivity by the total number of relative value units (RVUs) per full-time equivalent (FTE). We estimated the impact of providing telehealth on RVUs/FTE using fixed effects regression models estimated on a panel dataset of 58,873 provider-year observations and controlling for provider and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Overall provider productivity increased in veterans affairs over the period, particularly in cardiology and dermatology. Providers of telehealth had above average productivity by 124 RVUs/FTE, or a4% of average total provider productivity. For the highest quartile of telehealth providers, average productivity was 188 RVUs/FTE higher than productivity of other providers.

In order to explore the long-term impact of the pandemic on economic growth and the effects of different policy responses, this paper combines economic theory with epidemiological model to construct an interdisciplinary model, in which labor supply is dynamically constrained by pandemic conditions. Analysis of model equilibrium suggests that outbreaks of infectious disease reduce labor supply and negatively affect economic output. The accumulation of health capital can suppress the spread of disease and improve the recovery rate of infected individuals, which will alleviate the labor supply constraint caused by the pandemic and lead to an increase in output and consumption. The model is then calibrated to Chinese economy. The simulation results imply that government's public health policy can enhance the role of health capital in promoting economic growth. But the marginal effect of certain policies is diminishing. Therefore, the government needs to balance pandemic prevention and control costs and marginal benefits when formulating public health policies.

However, in comparison to environmental data, global data on the social determinants of health is spatially coarse, infrequently updated, and costly to measure. From global mapping efforts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic it is clear that social data is not meeting the fine spatial quality needed for mapping vulnerable populations and transmission pathways. Most maps produced generalized to larger administrative units (such as counties, states), and have not identified distinct areas of vulnerable populations apart from the surrounding environment where no population resides. We present a framework that uses environmental determinants of health, instead of social ones. Other studies that link the environment to human health have done so by analyzing one ecosystem service (such as clean air) to the health of the population. Instead of relating one ecosystem service to the health of the population, this framework breaks the environmental features that produce the ecosystem service into parts (forest, temperature, precipitation). Each feature is then related to human health. With the amount of data available it is feasible to include change in monitored features over time, and create predictors for the impact of the change of monitored features on the health of populations. This framework generalizes ecosystem services and disservices into one value that an environmental feature provides. This helps to manage uncertainty of how an individual ecosystem service affects health.

To address this, this study investigated how perceived threat is linked to media use, and how media use is associated with perceived and actual knowledge about COVID-19. In a German online survey, N=952 participants provided information on their perceived threat and media use to inform themselves about COVID-19. They indicated how well they are informed about COVID-19 (perceived knowledge) and completed a COVID-19 knowledge test (actual knowledge). Results indicated that individuals who felt more threatened by COVID-19 used media more often to inform themselves but focused on fewer media channels. Frequent media use was associated with higher perceived knowledge, but not with higher actual knowledge about COVID-19 (i.e., illusion of knowledge).

However, pathogenicities of these BatIVs remain unknown since infectious virus strains have not been isolated yet. To gain insight into the biological properties of BatIVs, we generated vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) pseudotyped with the BatIV HA and NA. We found that VSVs pseudotyped with BatIV HAs and NAs efficiently infected particular bat cell lines but not those derived from primates, and that proteolytic cleavage with a trypsin-like protease was necessary for HA-mediated virus entry. Treatment of the susceptible bat cells with some enzymes and inhibitors revealed that BatIV HAs might recognize some cellular glycoproteins as receptors rather than the sialic acids used for the other known influenza viruses. These data provide fundamental information on the mechanisms underlying the cellular entry and host restriction of BatIVs.","output":"Characterization of the glycoproteins of bat-derived influenza viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: In this systematic scoping review, it was aimed to assess the epidemiology of methanol poisoning, clinical findings and patients' management, causes, and recommendations regarding prevention or reduction of methanol poisoning during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three Electronic databases [Medline (accessed from PubMed), Scopus, and Science Direct] were searched systematically from December 01, 2019 to September 10, 2020, using MESH terms and the related keywords in English language. Considering the titles and abstracts, unrelated studies were excluded. The full texts of the remained studies were evaluated by authors, independently. Then, the studies' findings were assessed and reported. RESULTS: Total of 86 articles were obtained within the first step of searching, and 64 ones remained after removing the duplications. Through the title and abstract screening, 35 were removed. Finally, after reading the full text of the remained articles, 15 ones included in data extraction. Most of the previous reported evidence (13/15) were letter to editor, commentary and short reports. None of them were interventional, and none of them followed the patients. Findings were summarized in four categories: 1) epidemiology; 2) clinical findings and patients' management; 3) causes; and 4) recommendation regarding prevention or reduction of methanol poisoning during COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The recent outbreak is the largest methanol mass poisoning outbreak throughout Iran and the world in recent decades. The causes of methanol poisoning during the COVID-19 pandemic are intertwined, and most of them are modifiable by health policy makers. Building trust, educating and warning, as well as controlling and monitoring are three main recommendation for prevention or reduction of methanol poisoning.","output":"Methanol poisoning during COVID-19 pandemic; A systematic scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil price forecasts are of crucial importance for many policy institutions, including the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Board, but projecting oil market evolutions remains a complicated task, further exacerbated by the financialization process that characterizes the crude oil markets. The efficiency (in Famas sense) of crude oil markets is revisited in this research through the investigation of the predictive ability of technical trading rules (TTRs). The predictive ability and trading performance of a plethora of TTRs are explored on the crude oil markets, as well as on the energy sector ETF XLE, while taking a special focus on the turbulent COVID-19 pandemic period. We are interested in whether technical trading strategies, by signaling the right timing of market entry and exits, can predict oil market movements. Research findings help to confidently conclude on the weak-form efficiency of the WTI crude oil and the XLE fund markets throughout the 1999C2021 period relative to the universe of TTRs. Moreover, results attest that TTRs do not add value to the Brent market beyond what may be expected by chance over the pre-pandemic 1999C2019 period, confirming the efficiency of the market before 2020. Nonetheless, research findings also suggest some temporal inefficiency of the Brent market during the 1 and ? years of pandemic period, with important consequences for energy markets practitioners and issuers of policy. Research findings further imply that there is evidence of a more intense financialization of the WTI crude oil market, which requires tighter measures from regulators during distressed markets. The Brent oil market is affected mainly by variations in oil demand and supply at the world level and to a lesser degree by financialization and the activity of market practitioners. As such, we conclude that different policies are needed for the two oil markets and also that policy issuers should employ distinct techniques for oil price forecasting.","output":"The Financialization of Crude Oil Markets and Its Impact on Market Efficiency: Evidence from the Predictive Ability and Performance of Technical Trading Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Silver and gold nanoparticles can be found in a range of household products related to almost every area of life, including patches, bandages, paints, sportswear, personal care products, food storage equipment, cosmetics, disinfectants, etc. Their confirmed ability to enter the organism through respiratory and digestive systems, skin, and crossing the bloodCbrain barrier raises questions of their potential effect on cell function.

Individuals with high optimism bias engaged less in behavioral changes, whereas individuals with high levels of anxiety and high perceived severity engaged more in behavioral changes. Individuals with high optimism bias and high levels of anxiety were less satisfied with the governments' response, albeit for different reasons. Individuals who reported low perceived severity and low government satisfaction engaged the least in behavioral changes, whereas participants who reported high perceived severity and low government satisfaction engaged the most in behavioral changes.

With climate communication, it can be tempting to think that the primary goal should be to get more people to accept climate change, but true climate literacy requires not just an understanding of the reality of climate change but also acting on that understanding. Here, I argue that there is an important role for communicating about climate change with people who already accept that it is occurring. Such communication can help people improve their understanding, increasing their certainty regarding climate change and its drivers, and spur them to take action. Social science research has important insights regarding how to communicate in a way that encourages people to change behaviors, including aiming to increase personal and collective efficacy and helping people figure out how to meet key needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change communicators should seek out audiences that already accept climate change, helping those individuals deepen their understanding and energizing and empowering these people to act.","output":"Why We Should Preach to the Climate Change Choir: The Importance of Science Communication That Engages People Who Already Accept Climate Change."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, strain 67N, was used to inoculate 1-, 2-, 4- and 8-week-old rats by the intracerebral (i.c.), intranasal (i.n.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.) and oral routes with graded doses.

We here show that endpoint-based assays are limited by arbitrary experimental choices (like used reporter concentration and assay duration) and work best for known target concentrations. More importantly, we show that SNP (versus WT) activation results in measurable shifts in the Cas12 trans-cleavage substrate affinity (KM) and apparent catalytic efficiency . To address endpoint-based assay limitations, we then develop an assay based on the quantification of Michalis-Menten parameters and apply this assay to a 20-base pair WT target of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. We find that the measured for WT is 130-fold greater than the lowest among all 60 measured SNPs (compared to a 4.8-fold for endpoint fluorescence of the same SNP). KM also offers strong ability to distinguish SNPs, varies 27-fold over all the cases, and is insensitive to target concentration.

Our analyses also included public data on the stringency of national restrictions. Across the six sites, parental responses indicated elevated levels of hyperactivity, conduct, and emotion problems in children from families characterized by heightened levels of parent distress, parentCchild conflict, and household chaos. In contrast, increased peer problems were more strongly related to COVID-19-related social disruption and stringency measures. Mediation models demonstrated that associations between COVID-19 social disruption and child difficulties could be explained by parental distress. Taken together, these results suggest that although the experience of the pandemic differed across countries, associations between COVID-19-related family experiences and child adjustment difficulties were similar in their nature and magnitude across six different contexts.

We analyse the effectiveness of classroom cohorting, i.e., the decomposition of classrooms into smaller isolated units, in inhibiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in European secondary schools and compare different cohorting strategies. METHODS: Using real-world network data on 12,291 adolescents collected in classrooms in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden in 2010/2011, we apply agent-based simulations to compare the effect of forming cohorts randomly to network-based cohorting. Network-based cohorting attempts to allocate out-of-school contacts to the same cohort to prevent cross-cohort infection more effectively. We consider explicitly minimizing out-of-school cross-cohort contacts, approximating this information-heavy optimization strategy by chained nominations of contacts, and dividing classrooms by gender. We also compare the effect of instructing cohorts in-person every second week to daily but separate in-person instruction of both cohorts. FINDINGS: We find that cohorting reduces the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in classrooms. Relative to random cohorting, network-based strategies further reduce infections and quarantines when transmission dynamics are strong. In particular, network-based cohorting inhibits superspreading in classrooms. Cohorting that explicitly minimizes cross-cohort contacts is most effective, but approximation based on chained nominations and classroom division by gender also outperform random cohorting. Every-second-week instruction in-person contains outbreaks more effectively than daily in-person instruction of both cohorts. INTERPRETATION: Cohorting of school classes can curb SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the school context. Factoring in out-of-school contacts can achieve a more effective separation of cohorts. Network-based cohorting reduces the risk of outbreaks in schools and can prevent superspreading events.

We selected relevant SRs reporting adequate search strategy, data synthesis, risk of bias assessment, and/or individual description of included studies describing COVID-19 and pregnancy outcomes. Pair of reviewers independently selected studies through COVIDENCE web-software, performed the data extraction, and assessed its quality through the AMSTAR-2 tool. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Each SR's results were synthesized and for the most recent, relevant, comprehensive, and with the highest quality, by predefined criteria, we presented GRADE evidence tables. Results We included 66 SRs of observational studies out of 608 references retrieved and most (61/66) had \\"critically low\\" overall quality. We found a relatively low degree of primary study overlap across SRs. The most frequent COVID-19 clinical findings during pregnancy were fever (28-100%), mild respiratory symptoms (20-79%), raised C-reactive protein (28-96%), lymphopenia (34-80%), and pneumonia signs in diagnostic imaging (7-99%). The most frequent maternal outcomes were C-section (23-96%) and preterm delivery (14-64%). Most of their babies were asymptomatic (16-93%) or presented fever (0-50%), low birth weight (5-43%) or preterm delivery (2-69%). The odds ratio (OR) of receiving invasive ventilation for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pregnant women was 1.88 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.36-2.60) and the OR that their babies were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit was 3.13 (95%CI 2.05-4.78).

DataTotal death counts by age and sex came from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations and Human Mortality databases. Registered COVID-19 deaths and vaccination counts by age and sex were sourced from the COVerAGE-DB database. Midyear population counts were extracted from the UN World Population Prospects database. MethodsLife expectancy for females, males, and the total population were calculated for 29 countries for 2020 and 2021. Additionally, we calculated life expectancy deficits for 2020 and 2021 based on pre-pandemic Lee-Carter forecasts of short-term life expectancy trends. Using demographic decomposition techniques, age- and COVID-19 specific contributions to changes and deficits in life expectancy were calculated. Deficits in life expectancy in 2021 across countries were compared to country vaccination rates. 95% uncertainty intervals were derived from Poisson replications of death counts. FindingsOut of 29 countries, 14 countries lost life expectancy in both 2020 and 2021, 12 recovered losses in 2020 but not all of them back to 2019 levels, 2 exceeded pre-pandemic life expectancy, and 1 dropped below 2019 levels only in 2021. All 29 countries had lower life expectancy in 2021 than expected had pre-pandemic trends continued. The female life expectancy advantage increased for most countries, consistent with hypotheses that females are more resilient to mortality crises than men. Life expectancy losses were moderately correlated with measures of vaccination uptake. One notable change from 2020 was that mortality at younger ages contributed more to life expectancy losses in 2021. Registered COVID-19 deaths accounted for most losses of life expectancy. InterpretationIn 2021 we saw divergence in the impact of the pandemic on population health. While some countries saw bounce-backs from stark life expectancy losses, others experienced sustained and substantial life expectancy deficits. While COVID-19 has been the most severe global mortality shock since the Second World War, this observed heterogeneity in 2021 indicates that pathways to long-term recovery of life expectancy trends remain unclear.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted mortality trends around the world. Most high-income countries experienced life expectancy declines in 2020, and emerging evidence from low-to-middle income shows substantial losses in life expectancy with large regional variation. These analyses emphasise the impact of COVID-19 deaths and also highlight the effect of excess mortality at older ages as the main contributor to life expectancy losses, although in some countries working-age mortality also contributed substantially to life expectancy reductions. Only a few countries including Denmark, Norway, Finland, Australia, South Korea, Iceland and New Zealand did not experience life expectancy losses. Added value of this studyWe estimate life expectancy for 29 countries in 2020/21 and assess bounce-backs versus mounting losses. We determine which age groups contributed most to life expectancy changes in 2021, and analyze how age patterns of excess mortality changed between 2020 and 2021. By projecting pre-pandemic mortality trends into 2020/21 we calculate the life expectancy deficit induced by the pandemic. We compare age-specific life expectancy deficits in 2021 against vaccination uptake by age group and further decompose the deficit into contributions from COVID-19 versus non-COVID mortality. To contextualize the magnitude of life expectancy loss, we compare the 2020/21 COVID-19 pandemic with historic mortality shocks over the 20th century. We report results for females, males and the total population. Implications of all the available evidenceLife expectancy is an important summary measure of population health. Over the past decade, improvements in life expectancy have slowed in several countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded these trends and disrupted life expectancy improvements across the globe. The pandemic increased life expectancy inequalities between countries, as life expectancy losses were higher among countries with lower pre-pandemic life expectancy. COVID-19 may be a short-term mortality shock, but it is unclear whether countries will bounce back to increasing life expectancy trends in the short- or medium-term. New variants continue the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally. Variation in preventive measures and vaccine uptake has led to disparate mortality burdens across countries. The long-term mortality impacts of social and economic stressors due to the pandemic are not known, neither are the mortality implications of regular re-infection or Long-COVID. Going forward, it is crucial to understand how and why death rates vary across and within countries.","output":"Bounce backs amid continued losses: Life expectancy changes since COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.

The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer C BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech's activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.","output":"The Rapid Development and Early Success of Covid 19 Vaccines Have Raised Hopes for Accelerating the Cancer Treatment Mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic considering the high volume of in-person visits for regular follow-up. Recent recommendations highlight the important role of remote monitoring to prevent exposure to the virus. This study compared remote monitoring of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in patients whose in-person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session with patients who were already scheduled for a remote monitoring session. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional observational study of 329 consecutive patients between 20 March and 24 April 2020. Group 1 included 131 patients whose in-person annual visit was substituted for a remote monitoring session. Group 2 included 198 patients who underwent a remote monitoring session as scheduled in their usual device follow-up. The time interval since the last in-person visit was 13.3  3.2 months in group 1 and 5.9  1.7 months in group 2 (P < .01). RESULTS: In group 1, 15 patients (11.5%) experienced a clinical event compared to 15 patients (7.6%) in group 2 (P = .25). Nineteen patients (14.5%) required a physician intervention in group 1 compared to 19 patients (9.6%) in group 2 (P = .22). Two patients (1.5%) in group 1 and four patients (2.0%) in group 2 required an early in-person follow-up visit during the pandemic (P > .99).

This has been found internationally, where better outcomes from such schemes have been found amongst those who have higher education and more household income. METHOD: This study looks at one of the worlds largest personalisation schemes, the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme. Using publicly available data we examine the allocation and utilisation of NDIS funds according to social gradient. RESULTS: We find that the rate at which people with disability spend or effectively use their disability care funds follows a social gradient. That is, those in areas of higher socioeconomic disadvantage are not spending as much of their allocated budgets on care services across the year compared to people in areas of higher socioeconomic advantage. This represents a clear issue of equity in the use of public money to people with disability in Australia. CONCLUSION: We argue that this points to the need to provide targeted supports for the use of disability care funds in areas of higher socioeconomic disadvantage. Without effective supports for fund use, the NDIS and other personalisation schemes may be positioned to worsen existing social inequalities.","output":"How personalisation programs can exacerbate socio-economic inequities: findings from budget utilisation in the Australian National Disability Insurance Scheme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media use has dramatically increased in the past two decades.

We investigated spinal entheseal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 and 9 activation and therapeutic modulation, including JAK inhibition. We also investigated if COVID-19 infection, a potent TLR-7 stimulator triggered PsA flares. Methods: Normal entheseal pDCs were characterized and stimulated with imiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) to evaluate TNF and IFN&#945; production. NanoString gene expression assay of total pDCs RNA was performed pre- and post- ODN stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of induced IFN&#945; protein was performed with Tofacitinib and PDE4 inhibition. The impact of SARS-CoV2 viral infection on PsA flares was evaluated. Results: CD45+HLA-DR+CD123+CD303+CD11c- entheseal pDCs were more numerous than blood pDCs (1.9  0.8% vs 0.2  0.07% of CD45+ cells, p=0.008) and showed inducible IFN&#945; and TNF protein following ODN/imiquimod stimulation and were the sole entheseal IFN&#945; producers. NanoString data identified 11 significantly upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including TNF in stimulated pDCs. Canonical pathway analysis revealed activation of dendritic cell maturation, NF-&#954;B signaling, toll-like receptor signaling and JAK/STAT signaling pathways following ODN stimulation. Both tofacitinib and PDE4i strongly attenuated ODN induced IFN&#945;. DAPSA scores elevations occurred in 18 PsA cases with SARS-CoV2 infection (9.7  4 pre-infection and 35.3  7.5 during infection).

Recent structural studies reveal a complex set of interactions between the ribosome and its ligands, mRNA and tRNA, that indicate ways in which the ribosome could avoid costly translational errors. Ribosomes must decode each successive codon accurately, and structural data provide a clear indication of how ribosomes limit recruitment of the wrong tRNA (sense errors). In a triplet-based genetic code there are three potential forward reading frames, only one of which encodes the correct protein. Errors in which the ribosome reads a codon out of the normal reading frame (frameshift errors) occur less frequently than sense errors, although it is not clear from structural data how these errors are avoided. Some mRNA sequences, termed programmed-frameshift sites, cause the ribosome to change reading frame. Based on recent work on these sites, this article proposes that the ribosome uses the structure of the codonCanticodon complex formed by the peptidyl-tRNA, especially its wobble interaction, to constrain the incoming aminoacyl-tRNA to the correct reading frame.","output":"Ribosome structure: revisiting the connection between translational accuracy and unconventional decoding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enveloped viruses exit their host cell by budding from a cellular membrane and thereby spread from one cell to another. Virus budding in general involves the distortion of a cellular membrane away from the cytoplasm, envelopment of the viral capsid by one or more lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins, and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the cellular membrane. While it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins, it is now clear that the driving force may be different depending on the virus. Research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins, thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular membrane systems that serve as viral budding sites and of the viral and cellular factors involved in budding. One of the best studied cellular machineries required for virus egress is the ESCRT complex, which will be described in more detail.","output":"More than one door C Budding of enveloped viruses through cellular membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Case series Patients: Male, 61-year-old ?

In severe COVID-19 infections, patients may experience shock and multiple organ failure. We described 4 cases of severe arterial thrombosis induced by COVID-19 with and without other stressors and their responses to treatment measures. CASE REPORTS: In Case 1, a 61-year-old man was hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia 2 weeks prior to the presentation of acute upper-limb ischemia after intravenous forearm line insertion. He was classified as IIB and thus underwent emergency thrombectomy followed by 3 months of enoxaparin. Case 2 was a 41-year-old female patient with granulomatosis who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit due to COVID-19 pneumonia and developed acute upper-limb ischemia. A medical approach using therapeutic heparin was used. Case 3 was a 65-year-old man who was admitted due to COVID-19-related pneumonia and was otherwise medically and surgically free. We assessed and managed a new onset of the lower-limb IIB acute limb ischemia (ALI). Case 4 was a patient with the first COVID-19 presentation of ALI, which was managed accordingly. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a thrombotic event in patients with COVID-19 was previously reported. Moreover, different management options and outcomes have been reported in the literature. Therefore, careful planning is needed for procedures such as cannulation or central line insertion to prevent such events. In addition, short-term anticoagulation therapy might be of clinical benefit when planning a procedure or if the patient exhibits minor arterial complications.","output":"A Patient-Tailored Approach to Management of Acute Limb Ischemia in Patients with COVID-19: A Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To examine the association of colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and general population mortality, we followed 10,598 adults for 8.5 years on average.

From March to April 2020, the Laboratory of Advanced Cellular Therapies (Vicenza, Italy) received requests to treat a patient with severe COVID-19 and a patient with acute graft-versus-host disease with umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). Access to clinics was restricted due to the risk of contagion. Transport of UC-MSCs in liquid nitrogen was unmanageable, leaving shipment in dry ice as the only option. METHODS: We assessed effects of the transition from liquid nitrogen to dry ice on cell viability; apoptosis; phenotype; proliferation; immunomodulation; and clonogenesis; and validated dry ice-based transport of UC-MSCs to clinics. RESULTS: Our results showed no differences in cell functionality related to the two storage conditions, and demonstrated the preservation of immunomodulatory and clonogenic potentials in dry ice. UC-MSCs were successfully delivered to points-of-care, enabling favourable clinical outcomes.

Despite this, patients with respiratory tract infections often receive antibiotics, fuelling the rise of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is a need to encourage patients to try alternative non-antibiotic therapies, which ideally treat the symptoms and the cause. Lozenges containing amylmetacresol and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA lozenges) as well as lozenges containing hexylresorcinol have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief for sore throat. In this study, we investigated whether these lozenges also have virucidal effects in vitro against two viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Both viruses were incubated with AMC/DCBA lozenge, placebo lozenge or the active ingredients (AMC/DCBA) as free substances, and parainfluenza virus type 3 was incubated with hexylresorcinol lozenge, placebo lozenge or hexylresorcinol as a free substance. Virucidal effects were observed with the active lozenges and the active ingredients as free substances against both parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Mean reductions in viral titre were significantly greater compared with placebo lozenge and peak effects were observed for the shortest incubation time, 1 min. These findings suggest that AMC/DCBA lozenge and hexylresorcinol lozenge have the potential to have local antiviral effects in patients with sore throat due to viral respiratory tract infections. Use of such over-the-counter treatments for self-limiting respiratory tract infections may satisfy patients desire for an anti-infective medication and reduce the demand for antibiotics.","output":"Virucidal action of sore throat lozenges against respiratory viruses parainfluenza type 3 and cytomegalovirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the common occurrence of brain injury in patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD), optimal neuromonitoring methods are unknown.

Of 5,190 records screened, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The neuromonitoring methods include Transcranial Doppler ultrasound for emboli monitoring (TCD-e) (n = 13) and cerebral autoregulation (n = 3), computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 9), serum biomarkers (n = 7), carotid ultrasound (n = 3), and near-infrared spectroscopy (n = 2). Of 421 patients with TCD-e, thromboembolic events (TEs) were reported in 79 patients (20%) and microembolic signals (MES) were detected in 105 patients (27%). Ischemic stroke was more prevalent in patients with MES compared to patients without MES (43% vs.13%, p < 0.001). Carotid ultrasound for assessing carotid stenosis was unreliable after LVAD implantation. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were associated with TEs.

We compared T2- or FLAIR-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, T2*-weighted images, and contrast enhancement features, as well as lesion distribution, especially gray matter involvement. RESULTS: The three PML entities affect U-fibers associated with low signal intensities on T2*-weighted sequences. Natalizumab-associated PML showed a punctuate microcystic appearance in or in the vicinity of the main PML lesions, a potential involvement of the cortex, and contrast enhancement. HIV and rituximab-associated PML showed only mild contrast enhancement, punctuate appearance, and cortical involvement. The CD4/CD8 ratio showed a trend to be higher in the natalizumab group, possibly mirroring a more efficient immune response.
