Importantly, we have identified a relaxation of peripheral tolerance within early antibody secreting cells that emerge in patients with COVID-19 as important drivers of those responses. While often viral-specific, these extrafollicular-derived cells also display cross reactivity to autoantigens present in the inflammatory lung environment, and despite resolution of most autoreactivity within 6 months, they persisted in some patients. These results raise questions regarding autoreactive antibodies that arise during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and their persistence in patients with symptoms in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Through clinical autoreactive antibody screening of 95 patients with PASC and no history of autoimmune disease, we identify significant autoreactive profiles in patients with ongoing symptoms post-recovery, with 80% of patients returning positive tests for at least one autoantigen, and 40% showing breaks in tolerance to 2 or more. Anti-nuclear antigen positivity was most common, displaying positivity in 63% of patients, however, positive tests were broad and included reactivities against carbamylated protein responses, RNA polymerase III, and phospholipids. We also identify patients with reactivity against dsDNA in the PASC cohort -- a reactivity not observed in acute infection even in the critically ill. These results demonstrate evidence of serum autoantibodies in patients who present to PASC clinics with persistent symptoms up 14 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and further confirm the growing linkage between COVID-19 and observed clinical autoreactivity -- even into the recovery phase of disease.","output":"Evidence of Persisting Autoreactivity in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on children's lifestyles and anxiety levels.

Methods and Results: The CLOT-COVID study was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across 16 centers in Japan from April 2021 to September 2021. Among 2,894 enrolled patients, 2,771 (96%) had D-dimer levels measured at admission. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on tertiles of D-dimer levels at admission (1st tertile, D-dimer 0.5 g/mL, n=949; 2nd tertile, D-dimer 0.51C1.09 g/mL, n=894; 3rd tertile, D-dimer 1.1 g/mL, n=928). The higher the tertile group, the more severe the COVID-19 status at admission. The incidence of VTE during hospitalization was highest in the 3rd tertile group (1st tertile, 0.3%; 2nd tertile, 0.3%; 3rd tertile, 3.6%; P<0.001). Even after adjusting for confounders in the multivariable logistic regression model, the higher D-dimer levels in the 3rd tertile (1.1 g/mL) were independently associated with a higher risk of VTE during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio 4.83 [95% confidence interval 1.93C12.11; P<0.001]; reference=1st tertile).

Moreover, the antibodies that were produced in response to the vaccine effectively cross-neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 variant (B.1.351).

In the present paper it is argued that COVID-19 increases the susceptibility of the patients to mucormycosis by augmenting the virulence factors of the mucor species, where deficient synthesis of melatonin plays a key role. Melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan via the serotonin pathway and melatonin deficiency in COVID-19 arises from the faulty absorption of tryptophan from the food because SARS-CoV-2 downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the chaperone of the transporter of tryptophan. The enhanced fungal virulence in COVID-19 can be mitigated by correcting the melatonin deficiency as melatonin can prevent iron acquisition of the mucor species and inhibit their morphological transition from the yeast to the virulent hyphal form, given the fact that melatonin is an iron chelator, calmodulin blocker and inhibitor of myeloperoxidase as well as inhibitor of ferroptosis and pyroptosis. Also, by lowering the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 and by inhibiting the suppression of T-cell immunity, melatonin can further increase the resistance of the patients to mucormycosis. Accordingly, clinical trials should be carried out on tryptophan supplementation, administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (to increase serotonin, the precursor of melatonin), and exogenous melatonin to find out how they perform in eliminating or reducing the propensity of the coronavirus patients to CAM.","output":"Deficient synthesis of melatonin in COVID-19 can impair the resistance of coronavirus patients to mucormycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly risky for people with disabilities and severe medical conditions, not only because the virus may be a direct threat to their physical health but also because of social exclusion and negating their needs and rights.

While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities. Variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events. Methods: Confirmed cases reported by SSA countries were line-listed to capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries. Data were retrieved from publicly available sources, including institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts, with supplementary details obtained from news articles. A data availability score was calculated for each imported case in terms of how many indicators (sex, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected) could be identified. We assessed the relationship between time to first importation and overall Global Health Security Index (GHSI) using Cox regression. K-means clustering grouped countries according to healthcare capacity and health and demographic risk factors. Results: A total of 2417 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 30 days after the first known introduction to the region. Out of the 876 cases for which information was publicly available, 677 (77.3%) were considered importation events. At the regional level, imported cases tended to be male (67.3%), were a median 43.0 years old (Range: 6 weeks - 88 years), and most frequently had recent travel history from Europe (43.3%). The median time to reporting an introduction was 19 days; a country's time to report its first importation was not related to GHSI. Mean data availability scores were lowest for countries that had, on average, the highest case fatality rates, lowest healthcare capacity, and highest probability of premature death due to non-communicable diseases. Conclusion: Countries with systemic, demographic, and pre-existing health vulnerabilities to severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality are less likely to report any cases or are reporting with limited public availability of information. Reporting of information on COVID detection and response efforts, as well as on trends in non-COVID illness and care-seeking behavior, is critical to assessing direct and indirect consequences and capacity needs in resource-constrained settings.

Such global transformations could not but cause a massive change in both consciousness at the socio-anthropological level and traditional forms of management at the civilizational level. Speaking about the civil society in the era of digitalization, it should be understood that this is, first of all, a network society, and without understanding this type of society it is pointless to talk about new forms of civil society. The network society was considered a well-studied object of research by the early 2000s, however today the radical acceleration of ICT and other processes are connected with digital information-network revolution involving artificial intelligence, the possibility of which was not even thought about 20 years ago. Therefore, the main purpose of our paper is an attempt to conceptualize potential risks for civil society connected with the development, testing and implementation of digital services and technologies in the global economy. To achieve this, we used system and synergistic philosophical and methodological approaches developed by the modern post-non-classical science and applied for self-developing systems. To reveal the global trends in the economy and related social problems, we undertook comparative and interdisciplinary analyses based on sources available. Sociological,philosophicalandmethodologicalreflectionsaboutradicalchangesintheanthropotechnosphere during the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed a number of serious problems that threaten the well-being of civil society, such as the aggravation of economic inequality, the collapse of many small businesses due to the quarantine and the introduction of remote forms of work, mass layoffs of qualified specialists, job cuts including the area of intellectual work, transport and service, as well as a significant decrease in the income of the population, decline in the quality of education, a sharp reduction in tourist flows, the ban on mass demonstrations and gatherings, which is an integral basis of the life of civil society. Thus, during the period of pandemic lockdowns, there is a significant change in the economic and socio-cultural environment of modern civilization. At the same time, the crisis situation provides means not only for the development of civil society, but also for the maintenance of enforcing and regulating functions of the state, which can upset the harmonious balance of interaction between society and any state (capitalist, socialist) or the global state of TNCs. An analysis of the world economic development in the 21st century has revealed some signs of a systemic crisis of civilization, along with the processes of digitalization as a catalyst for the shift of the paradigm of civilizational development and a catalyst for civil movements.

METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on face-to-face and telemedicine interactions was conducted at a multisite health care system from January to August 2020 in vascular surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end point is direct patient satisfaction comparison between face-to-face and telemedicine encounters/interactions prior and during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 6262 patient encounters from January 1, 2020, to August 6, 2020. Of the total encounters, 790 (12.6%) were via telemedicine, which were initiated on March 11, 2020, after the World Health Organization's declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. These telemedicine encounters were readily adopted and embraced by both the providers and patients and remain popular as an option to patients for all types of visits. Of these patients, 78.7% rated their overall health care experience during face-to-face encounters as very good and 80.6% of patients rated their health care experience during telemedicine encounters as very good (P = .78).

Since there are country-specific factors that could affect both economic growth and deaths due to COVID-19, we first start with a cross-country analysis on identifying risk and protective factors on the COVID-19 deaths using large across-country variation. Using data on 100 countries from 3 January to 27 November 2020 and taking into account the possibility of underreporting, we find that for deaths per million population, GDP per capita, population density, and income inequality are the three most important risk factors; government effectiveness, temperature and hospital beds are the three most important protective factors. Second, inspired by the stochastic frontier literature, we construct a measure of pandemic containment effectiveness (PCE) after controlling for country-specific factors and rank countries by their PCE scores for deaths. Finally, by linking the PCE score with GDP growth data in Quarters 2 and 3 of 2020, we find that PCE is positively associated with economic growth in major economies. Countries with average PCE scores, such as Malaysia, would gain more GDP growth by 3.47 percentage points if they could improve their PCE scores for deaths to South Koreas level in Q2 of 2020.

Methods: We prospectively included consecutive cancer patients with recent onset of COVID-19 pneumonia assessed by chest CT between March 15, 2020, and April 20, 2020, and followed until May 1, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory test data and imaging findings were recorded. Quantitative chest CT assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the density distribution of lung lesions using a freely available software recently released (Myrian XP-Lung). The association between extent of lung damage and overall survival was studied by univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. The Uno C-index was used to assess the discriminatory value of the quantitative CT extent of lung damage. Results: Seventy cancer patients with chest CT evidence of COVID-19 were included. After a median follow-up of 25 days, 17 patients (24%) had died. The median quantitative chest CT extent of COVID-19 was 20% (IQR = 14C35, range = 3C59) for non-survivors vs. 10% (IQR = 6C15, range = 2C55) for survivors (p = 0.002). The extent of COVID-19 pneumonia was correlated with inpatient management (p = 0.003) and oxygen therapy requirements (p &lt; 0.001).

BACKGROUND The abrupt spread of COVID-19 urged healthcare facilities to adopt new infection-control measures. Drive-through testing facilities were implemented as one of the measures to minimize physical contact between healthcare workers and test-takers. Many studies describe drive-through models' merits, but people's opinions about them as a permanent attachment to healthcare facilities are unclear. METHODS An online survey was distributed through snowball sampling. The survey solicited feedback from adults who lived in the United States. The survey consisted of Likert-type and multiple-choice questions and was completed by176 eligible participants. RESULTS The use of drive-through pharmacies increased after the spread of COVID-19. Most people agreed drive-through healthcare services could be more convenient and safer to use. People prefer to have their vitals checked, and vaccinations received in a drive-through because of the improved infection-control matters and increased comfort; however, they are neutral about the level of privacy they have and the hygiene of drive-through healthcare settings. CONCLUSIONS This study shows permanent drive-throughs offering medical services benefit people in times of crisis for the perceived infection control purposes and the improved convenience.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the impact of a rapid, multipathogen respiratory panel (RP) test vs usual care (control). Patients were eligible if they were 12 months old, had symptoms of upper respiratory infection or influenza-like illness, and were not on antibiotics. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription; secondary outcomes included antiviral prescription, disposition, and length of stay (ClinicalTrials.gov# NCT02957136). RESULTS: Of 191 patients enrolled, 93 (49%) received RP testing; 98 (51%) received usual care. Fifty-three (57%) RP and 7 (7%) control patients had a virus detected and reported during the ED visit (P = .0001). Twenty (22%) RP patients and 33 (34%) usual care patients received antibiotics during the ED visit (C12%; 95% confidence interval, C25% to 0.4%; P = .06/0.08); 9 RP patients received antibiotics despite having a virus detected. The magnitude of antibiotic reduction was greater in children (C19%) vs adults (C9%, post hoc analysis). There was no difference in antiviral use, length of stay, or disposition. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid RP testing was associated with a trend toward decreased antibiotic use, suggesting a potential benefit from more rapid viral tests in the ED.

On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.? On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV. Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a \\"Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,\\" which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3).

These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

Recent clinical and experimental studies have brought increasing evidence for activation of the innate immune system in contributing to the pathogenesis of trauma-induced sequelae and adverse outcome. As the \\"first line of defense\\", the complement system represents a potent effector arm of innate immunity, and has been implicated in mediating the early posttraumatic inflammatory response. Despite its generic beneficial functions, including pathogen elimination and immediate response to danger signals, complement activation may exert detrimental effects after trauma, in terms of mounting an \\"innocent bystander\\" attack on host tissue.

We report pre-registered analyses of the potential impact on daily smoking and on daily snus use among women and men. METHODS: Interrupted time series (segmented regression) on repeated cross-sectional surveys (2012C2019) from two sources: probability samples (Registry Sample, N = 46,957) and market research samples (Market Research Sample, N = 64,465) of Norwegian adults aged 16C79. Self-reported daily smoking and snus use were regressed on a step change impact variable, controlled for trend and demographics (sex, age, region, and education based on national registers in the Registry Sample, and self-reported in the Market Research Sample). RESULTS: There were tendencies of a decline in smoking (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87, 1.02; lower-tail p-value [P(lower)] = 0.07), and womens snus use (OR = 0.89; CI = 0.77, 1.03; P(lower) = 0.06), but not mens snus use (OR = 1.01; CI = 0.92, 1.11; P(lower) = 0.59). Analyses using only the Registry Sample did not detect declines in smoking (OR = 0.99; CI = 0.88, 1.11; P(lower) = 0.43) or womens snus use (OR = 0.99; CI = 0.80, 1.24]; P(lower) = 0.48), and indicated no decline in mens snus use (OR = 1.18; CI = 1.03, 1.35; P(lower) = 0.99). Exploratory analyses suggested potential acceleration of the declining trend in smoking (change in trends, OR = 0.97) and of the increasing trend in mens snus use (OR = 1.03). CONCLUSIONS: The analyses indicate that standardised packaging in Norway did not produce a decline in mens snus use. Results are inconclusive regarding smoking and womens snus use. Exploratory analyses indicated a decrease in smoking and an increase in mens snus use. IMPLICATIONS: We could not confirm or disconfirm whether standardised packaging is an effective tobacco control measure in a Norwegian context. According to our analyses, standardized packaging may have effects on smoking prevalence and womens snus use, but is unlikely to reduce mens snus use. The present results may reflect higher effectiveness of standardised packaging for products with stronger health warnings. As the results varied according to samples and outcomes, the study underlines the importance of pre-registering future analyses on this topic. Future confirmatory research should test models of gradual impact of standardised packaging.","output":"The Short-term Impact of Standardised Packaging on Smoking and Snus Use in Norway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As part of its responsibilities to protect the safety of the American public, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates blood donations. One FDA policy concerns the prohibition of blood donation by men who have sex with men (MSM) and their sexual partners. The policy risks reinforcing stigma against people in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) community. The coronavirus pandemic created an urgent need for blood products;hence, the FDA shortened the deferral period for MSM and their sexual partners. Yet, the publics awareness and support of the deferral policy remained unclear. US community adults (N=829, Mage =46.83, 50.3% women, 9.5% LGB) rated their awareness and approval of FDA blood deferral policies, and their attitudes toward blood donations from people across sexual orientations and gender identities. Half of participants were uninformed about blood donation deferral policies affecting MSM. Participants generally reported positive attitudes toward receiving blood from heterosexual donors and neutral attitudes toward receiving blood from LGBTQ donors. Participants were inclined to believe that the 2020 policy revision was motivated by an increased demand for blood donations amid the coronavirus pandemic rather than an intent to reduce discrimination. Relative to LGB participants, heterosexual participants were less willing to receive blood from LGBTQ donors, more likely to endorse FDA blood donation deferral policies, and less likely to consider FDA policies to be discriminatory. Grounded in a minority stress framework, understanding public opinion can inform the utility of FDAs policy and contextualize the possible negative impact on LGBTQ health.","output":"Attitudes toward Blood Donation and Deferral Policies Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With COVID-19 N95 shortages, frontline medical personnel are forced to reuse this disposable-but sophisticated-multilayer respirator.

In a measurement infeasible with radiometers, we observe a striking ~20 dose variation over N95s within one decontamination system. Furthermore, we adapt consumer electronics for accessible quantitative readout and use optical attenuators to extend indicator dynamic range >10 to quantify doses relevant for N95 decontamination.

Telehealth programs for people with Parkinson's (PWP) disease may ensure continuity of care. The goal of this observational survey study was to determine the practicability, satisfaction, and barriers to online programs, their relationship to perceived symptoms, mood, and quality of life, and program sustainability beyond the immediate pandemic. Methods In-person Parkinson's programs at New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine transitioned online at the start of the pandemic to include Rock Steady Boxing, Support Groups, and Rock Steady Buddies. A custom online survey sent to 150 participants investigated PD history, symptomatology, level of exercise before and during the pandemic, depression (PHQ-9), quality of life (PDQ-39), and practicability and perceived satisfaction related to these online programs. Descriptive statistics were reported. Results Of 69 respondents [mean age of 70.2y (SD 8.4 yrs)], >75% were satisfied with the transition to online programs. Consistent attendance and minimal barriers to programs indicated practicability, with increased adherence to exercise. Of 66 completed PHQ-9s, 22.7% had scores 9 (moderate to severe depression);of 61 completed PDQ-39s, scores averaged 21.4;better quality of life than national averages for PWP. Self-perceived physical and mental wellbeing were positively affected. Conclusions Results suggest the transition to online programs met the needs of the Parkinson's community in a practicable and sustainable manner during the pandemic. With COVID-19 still prevalent, the current model of blending synchronous online and in-person classes provides a more flexible, sustainable format compared to in-person alone.

We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys. METHODS: The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with -propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control. Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy. Additionally, three groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized with different doses of the purified inactivated SARS vaccine (0.5, 1 and 2 g/time/monkey) on days 0 and 7, and the monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain. We assessed the safety of the SARS vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred under low levels of neutralizing antibody in rhesus. FINDINGS: The purity of SARS vaccine was 97.6% by HPLC identification and reacted with convalescent sera of SARS patients. The purified SARS vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the replication of SARS-CoV in monkeys. Under low levels of neutralizing antibody, no exacerbation of clinical symptoms was observed when the immunized monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV. In this preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified SARS vaccine either at normal or large doses. INTERPRETATION: The purified inactivated SARS vaccine could induce high levels of neutralizing antibody, and protect the monkeys from the challenge of SARS-CoV.

However, those of the amphibious sea snakes have not been examined in detail. RESULTS: Here, we investigated opsin genes and visual pigments of sea snakes. We determined the sequences of SWS1, LWS, and RH1 genes from one terrestrial, three amphibious and four fully-aquatic elapids. Amino acid replacements at four and one spectra-tuning positions were found in LWS and RH1, respectively. We measured or predicted absorption of LWS and RH1 pigments with A1-derived retinal. During their evolution, blue shifts of LWS pigments have occurred stepwise in amphibious sea snakes and convergently in both amphibious and fully-aquatic species. CONCLUSIONS: Blue shifted LWS pigments may have adapted to deep water or open water environments dominated by blue light. The evolution of opsins differs between marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and sea snakes in two fundamental ways: (1) pseudogenization of opsins in marine mammals; and (2) large blue shifts of LWS pigments in sea snakes. It may be possible to explain these two differences at the level of photoreceptor cell composition given that cone and rod cells both exist in mammals whereas only cone cells exist in fully-aquatic sea snakes.

However, the expression of these common macrophage polarization markers is greatly affected by the stimulation time used. Unfortunately, there is no consensus yet regarding the optimal stimulation times for particular macrophage polarization markers in in vitro experiments. This situation is problematic, (i) as analysing a particular marker at a suboptimal time point can lead to false-negative results, and (ii) as it clearly impedes the comparison of different studies.

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors C Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein C host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 C June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate.

To assess the impact of school reopening and the effect of contact tracing strategies in rates of Covid-19 cases and deaths, we model the epidemiological dynamics of disease transmission in 3 large urban centers in Brazil under different epidemiological contexts. We implement an extended SEIR model stratified by age and considering contact networks in different settings - school, home, work, and elsewhere, in which the infection transmission rate is affected by various intervention measures. After fitting epidemiological and demographic data, we simulate scenarios with increasing school transmission due to school reopening. Our model shows that reopening schools results in a non-linear increase of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, which is highly dependent on infection and disease incidence at the time of reopening. While low rates of within[&ndash]school transmission resulted in small effects on disease incidence (cases/100,000 pop), intermediate or high rates can severely impact disease trends resulting in escalating rates of new cases even if other interventions remain unchanged. When contact tracing and quarantining are restricted to school and home settings, a large number of daily tests is required to produce significant effects of reducing the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Our results suggest that policymakers should carefully consider the epidemiological context and timing regarding the implementation of school closure and return of in-person school activities. Also, although contact tracing strategies are essential to prevent new infections and outbreaks within school environments, our data suggest that they are alone not sufficient to avoid significant impacts on community transmission in the context of school reopening in settings with high and sustained transmission rates.","output":"Modeling the impact of school reopening and contact tracing strategies on Covid-19 dynamics in different epidemiologic settings in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionAccumulating evidence recommends that infectious diseases including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.

METHODS The medical records and thorax tomographies of patients admitted to the \\"pandemic central\\" state hospital with symptoms of COVID-19 were observed between April 2020 and May 2020 in this case-control study. The first group consisted of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and the second group consisted of patients without the disease. The diameter of the ascending aorta is measured via tomography and compared to each other. The most causative risk factors for aortic enlargements underwent a multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS Charts of 156 patients (104 COVID-19 positives, 52 COVID-19 negatives) were reviewed. There was a statistical difference (p: .01) between the mean aortic diameter of COVID-19 patients (39 mm) and COVID-free patients (32.5 mm) even though comorbid factors and patient characteristics were similar in the two groups at the time of hospital admission.

STUDY DESIGN: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively analyze the protective efficacy of various rPPE. METHODS: This network meta-analysis protocol was registered in an international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020179489). Electronic databases were searched for cluster randomized control trials (RCTs) of comparing the effectiveness of rPPE and wearing manner in preventing HCWs from VRID. The primary outcome was the incidence of laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection reported as an odds ratio (OR) with the associated 95% credibility interval (CrI). The secondary outcome was the incidence of clinical respiratory illness (CRI) reported as an OR with the associated 95% CrI. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve analysis (SUCRA) provided a ranking of each rPPE according to the primary outcome and the secondary outcome as data supplement.

Financial risk allocation can be used in contracts as a mechanism to influence provider behavior and stimulate providers to provide efficient and high-quality care. In this paper, we provide new insights into financial risk allocation between insurers and hospitals in a changing contracting environment. We used unique nationwide data from 901 hospitalCinsurer contracts in The Netherlands over the years 2013, 2016, and 2018. Based on descriptive and regression analyses, we find that hospitals were exposed to more financial risk over time, although this increase was somewhat counteracted by an increasing use of risk-mitigating measures between 2016 and 2018. It is likely that this trend was heavily influenced by national cost control agreements. In addition, alternative payment models to incentivize value-based health care were rarely used and thus seemingly of lower priority, despite national policies being explicitly directed at this goal. Finally, our analysis shows that hospital and insurer market power were both negatively associated with financial risk for hospitals. This effect becomes stronger if both hospital and insurer have strong market power, which in this case may indicate a greater need to reduce (financial) uncertainties and to create more cooperative relationships.

In 2019, JAG conducted a further national census of endoscopy services to understand trends in activity, workforce and waiting time targets. METHODS: In April 2019, the census was sent to all eligible JAG-registered services. Collated data were analysed through various statistical methods. A further comparative dataset was created using available submissions from the 2017 census matched to services in the current census. RESULTS: There was a 68% response rate (322/471). There has been a 12%C15% increase in activity across all GI procedures with largest increases in bowel cancer screening. Fewer services are meeting waiting time targets compared with 2017, with endoscopist, nursing and physical capacity cited as the main reasons. Services are striving to improve capacity: 80% of services have an agreed business plan to meet capacity and the number using insourcing has increased from 13% to 20%.

Despite the potential of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce severe disease, vaccine uptake remained relatively low among pregnant women. Just as coordinated messaging from the CDC and leading obstetrics organizations began to increase vaccine confidence in this vulnerable group, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOC) including the Omicron VOC raised new concerns about vaccine efficacy, given their ability to escape vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. Early data point to a milder disease course following omicron VOC infection in vaccinated individuals. Thus, these data suggest that alternate vaccine induced immunity, beyond neutralization, may continue to attenuate omicron disease, such as antibody-Fc-mediated activity. Objectives To test whether vaccine induced antibodies raised in pregnancy continue to bind and leverage Fc-receptors against VOCs including the Omicron variant.

In particular, the differential effect of MPs of different polymers on the vermitoxicity of PAHs remains unclear. Therefore, a series of microcosm experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential vermitoxicity of fluoranthene (Fla) in the presence of polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS) MPs at an environmentally relevant concentration (125a?mga?kg-1). The results indicated that Fla exerted vermitoxicity and MPs enhanced the adverse effects. Specifically, after the introduction of MPs, the 14-d LC50s of Fla on earthworms decreased from 130.9 to 98.0-123.6a?mga?kg-1; in addition, the growth inhibition rates improved from 5.37%-15.34% to 15.63%-33.38%, and the avoidance rate increased by 10%-100% at the same exposure doses in most cases. In most cases, the neutral red retention time was shortened by 14.3%-47.9%, indicating that the integrity of the coelomocytes' lysosomal membrane had worsened. The affected antioxidant enzyme activity and improved malondialdehyde content indicated enhanced oxidative damage in the treatments containing MPs. However, the aggravation of the vermitoxicity varied by MPs type and toxicological endpoints. Overall, Fla + PS MPs exerted the greatest effect on the mortality of earthworms. On the contrary, PVC and PE MPs exhibited higher subacute effects on the vermitoxicity of Fla.

We discuss here how the vitamin D supplementation may influence macrophage and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inflammatory response, subdue the hyperinflammatory response, and lessen the ARDS in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Effects of vitamin D on macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) hyperinflammatory response in the lungs of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, which started at Wuhan, has shut down world economies, prompting governments to impose drastic lockdown measures of the economy and the society. As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed.","output":"Modeling the lockdown relaxation protocols of the Philippine government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: An intuitionistic fuzzy DEMATEL analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in volume of electrophysiology (EP) procedures. There has been concern that trainees may not achieve the procedural numbers required to graduate as independent electrophysiologists within the usual timeline. We sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the percentage of clinical cardiac EP (CCEP) fellows in jeopardy of not meeting procedural volume requirements and overall sentiments regarding preparedness of fellows for independent practice. METHODS: We surveyed CCEP fellows and program directors about baseline procedural volumes, curriculum changes due to the pandemic, and attitudes about preparedness for board examinations and independent practice. RESULTS: Ninety-nine fellows and 27 program directors responded to the survey. Ninety-eight percent of responding fellows reported a decrease in procedural volume as a result of the pandemic. Program directors reported an overall decrease in annual number of ablations and device procedures performed by each fellow during the 2019-2020 academic year compared to the preceding year. Despite this, a minority of fellows and program directors reported concerns about meeting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education procedural requirements for devices (9% and 4%, respectively) and ablation (19% and 9%) or preparedness for independent practice after a 2-year fellowship. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in procedural volume for CCEP trainees, but the majority of fellows and program directors do not anticipate major barriers to timely graduation.

However, the task is challenged by ambiguous boundary, irregular shape, various position and size of the lesions, as well as the difficulty in acquiring a large set of annotated volumetric images for training. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called PF-Net and incorporate it into a semi-supervised learning framework based on Iterative Confidence-based Refinement And Weighting of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL). Our PF-Net combines 2D and 3D convolutions to deal with CT volumes with large inter-slice spacing, and uses multi-scale guided dense attention to segment complex PF lesions. For semi-supervised learning, our I-CRAWL employs pixel-level uncertainty-based confidence-aware refinement to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels of unannotated images, and uses image-level uncertainty for confidence-based image weighting to suppress low-quality pseudo labels in an iterative training process. Extensive experiments with CT scans of Rhesus Macaques with radiation-induced PF showed that: 1) PF-Net achieved higher segmentation accuracy than existing 2D, 3D and 2.5D neural networks, and 2) I-CRAWL outperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for the PF lesion segmentation task.

After the first epidemic wave, we conducted population-based serological surveys to determine extent of infection, risk factors for infection, and neutralization antibody levels to assess the real infections in the random sampled population. METHODS: We used a multistage, stratified cluster random sampling strategy to conduct serological surveys in three areas - Wuhan, Hubei Province outside Wuhan, and six provinces selected on COVID-19 incidence and containment strategy. Participants were consenting individuals >1 year old who resided in the survey area >14 days during the epidemic. Provinces screened sera for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG, and total antibody by two lateral flow immunoassays and one magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay; positive samples were verified by micro-neutralization assay. FINDINGS: We enrolled 34,857 participants (overall response rate, 92%); 427 were positive by micro-neutralization assay. Wuhan had the highest weighted seroprevalence (4?43%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]=3?48%-5?62%), followed by Hubei-ex-Wuhan (0?44%, 95%CI=0?26%-0?76%), and the other provinces (<0?1%). Living in Wuhan (adjusted odds ratio aOR=13?70, 95%CI= 7?91C23?75), contact with COVID-19 patients (aOR=7?35, 95%CI=5?05C10?69), and age over 40 (aOR=1?36, 95%CI=1?07C1?72) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among seropositives, 101 (24%) reported symptoms and had higher geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers than among the 326 (76%) without symptoms (302?4 vs 152?1, p<0?001). INTERPRETATION: The low overall extent of infection and steep gradient of seropositivity from Wuhan to the outer provinces provide evidence supporting the success of containment of the first wave of COVID-19 in China. SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely asymptomatic, emphasizing the importance of active case finding and physical distancing. Virtually the entire population of China remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; vaccination will be needed for long-term protection.

In spite of its prevalence, FD is associated with major uncertainties in terms of its definition, underlying pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. METHODS A Delphi consensus was initiated with 41 experts from 22 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 87 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Consensus (defined as >80% agreement) was reached for 36 statements. RESULTS The panel agreed with the definition in terms of its cardinal symptoms (early satiation, postprandial fullness, epigastric pain, and epigastric burning), its subdivision into epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome, and the presence of accessory symptoms (upper abdominal bloating, nausea, belching), and overlapping conditions. Also, well accepted are the female predominance of FD, its impact on quality of life and health costs, and acute gastrointestinal infections, and anxiety as risk factors. In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, the consensus supports a role for impaired gastric accommodation, delayed gastric emptying, hypersensitivity to gastric distention, Helicobacter pylori infection, and altered central processing of signals from the gastroduodenal region. There is consensus that endoscopy is mandatory for establishing a firm diagnosis of FD, but that in primary care, patients without alarm symptoms or risk factors can be managed without endoscopy. There is consensus that H. pylori status should be determined in every patient with dyspeptic symptoms and H. pylori positive patients should receive eradication therapy. Also, proton pump inhibitor therapy is considered an effective therapy for FD, but no other treatment approach reached a consensus. The long-term prognosis and life expectancy are favorable.

This holds in particular for social robots, which are supposed to act autonomously in the vicinity of human users and are known to raise peculiar, often unrealistic attributions and expectations. However, explainable models that, on the one hand, allow a robot to generate lively and autonomous behavior and, on the other, enable it to provide human-compatible explanations for this behavior are missing. In order to develop such a self-explaining autonomous social robot, we have equipped a robot with own needs that autonomously trigger intentions and proactive behavior, and form the basis for understandable self-explanations. Previous research has shown that undesirable robot behavior is rated more positively after receiving an explanation. We thus aim to equip a social robot with the capability to automatically generate verbal explanations of its own behavior, by tracing its internal decision-making routes. The goal is to generate social robot behavior in a way that is generally interpretable, and therefore explainable on a socio-behavioral level increasing users' understanding of the robot's behavior. In this article, we present a social robot interaction architecture, designed to autonomously generate social behavior and self-explanations. We set out requirements for explainable behavior generation architectures and propose a socio-interactive framework for behavior explanations in social human-robot interactions that enables explaining and elaborating according to users' needs for explanation that emerge within an interaction. Consequently, we introduce an interactive explanation dialog flow concept that incorporates empirically validated explanation types. These concepts are realized within the interaction architecture of a social robot, and integrated with its dialog processing modules. We present the components of this interaction architecture and explain their integration to autonomously generate social behaviors as well as verbal self-explanations. Lastly, we report results from a qualitative evaluation of a working prototype in a laboratory setting, showing that (1) the robot is able to autonomously generate naturalistic social behavior, and (2) the robot is able to verbally self-explain its behavior to the user in line with users' requests.","output":"Self-Explaining Social Robots: An Explainable Behavior Generation Architecture for Human-Robot Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper adopts a socio-historical perspective to explore when, how and why the eradication of poliomyelitis has become politicised to the extent that health workers and security personnel are targeted in drive-by shootings. Discussions of the polio crisis in Afghanistan and Pakistan have tended to focus on Taliban suspicions of a US-led public health intervention and the denunciation of 'modernity' by Islamic 'extremists'. In contrast, this paper considers a broader history of indigenous hostility and resistance to colonial immunisation on the subcontinent, suggesting how interconnected public health and political crises today have reactivated the past and created a continuity between events. The paper explores how the biomedical threat posed by polio has become intertwined with military and governmental discourses premised on the 'preemptive strike'. Here, the paper tracks the connections between biological immunity and a postcolonial politics that posits an immunological rationale for politico-military interventions. The paper concludes by reflecting on the consequences for global public health of this entanglement of infectious disease with terror.","output":"Polio, terror and the immunological worldview."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment in patients having acute ischemic stroke with over-time window under DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Methods From January 2018 to January 2020, 80 patients who met the research criteria in the First Central Hospital of Baoding, China were selected. According to the time of onset, they were divided into test group and control group, with 40 cases in each group. Forty patients in the test group were beyond time window (6~24h) and the MRI showed a DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Forty patients in the control group were within the time window (< 6h). All patients received endovascular treatment (EVT). The mRS, NIHSS and infarct volume of patients in the test group were compared and analyzed before and 30 and 90 days after treatment, as well as the indicators of both groups of patients before and after treatment, to determine therapeutic effect in patients receiving EVT beyond time window. Meanwhile, the recanalization of the blood vessel and the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage of patients in both groups were compared to determine the safety in patients receiving EVT beyond time window under DWI-FLAIR mismatch. Results The mRS, NIHSS and infarct size in the test group were significantly improved before and 30 and 90 days after treatment (p<0.05). The test group showed no significant difference in mRS, NIHSS and other indicators when compared with the control group (p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of recanalization of the blood vessel and intracranial hemorrhage after treatment between both groups (p>0.05). Conclusion DWI-FLAIR mismatch can be used as an objective imaging basis for intravascular interventional therapy in patients with stroke with over-time window and large vessel occlusion. It has the advantages of short examination time, non-invasiveness, no need for contrast agents, simple implementation, clear guidance.","output":"Predictive value of DWI-FLAIR Mismatch in patients with Ischemic Stroke and receiving Endovascular treatment beyond Time Window."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Compared to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, non-invasive saliva samples have enormous potential for scalability and routine population screening of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we are investigating the efficacy of saliva samples relative to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for use as a direct source for the RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 detection. Methods: Paired nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva samples were collected from suspected positive SARS-CoV-2 patients and tested using RT-PCR. Generalised linear models were used to investigate factors that explain result agreement. Further, we used simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of saliva-based screening in restricting the spread of infection in a large campus such as an educational institution. Results: We observed 75.4% overall result agreement. Prospective positive samples stored for three or more days showed a drastic reduction in the probability of result agreement. We observed 83% result agreement and 74.5% test sensitivity in samples processed and tested within two days of collection. Our simulations suggest that a test with 75% sensitivity, but high daily capacity can be very effective in limiting the size of infection clusters in a workspace. Guided by these results, we successfully implemented a saliva-based screening in the Bangalore Life Sciences Cluster (BLiSC) campus. Conclusion: These results suggest that saliva may be a viable sample source for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance if samples are processed immediately. We strongly recommend the implementation of saliva-based screening strategies for large workplaces and in schools, as well as for population-level screening and routine surveillance as we learn to live with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Validating saliva as a biological sample for cost-effective, rapid and routine screening for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lpidmie de Covid-19 qui a dferl sur le monde en mars 2020 a paralys les socits et plac les professionnels de sant au premier plan, en ville comme  lh?pital.

Furthermore, the measures taken by governments to control the pandemic have led to increased anxiety, stress, and depression, which affect physical and mental health, all of which are influenced by nutritional status, diet, and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet (MD), Atlantic diet (AD), and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans all provide the essential vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds needed to activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant responses. However, viral pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis entail high oxidative damage caused by both the infection and the resultant social stresses within populations, which increases the probability and severity of infection. Balanced dietary patterns such as the MD and the AD are characterized by the consumption of fruit, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, and whole grains with low intakes of processed foods and red meat. For a healthy lifestyle in young adults, the MD in particular provides the required amount of antioxidants per day for vitamins D (0.3C3.8 g), E (17.0 mg), C (137.2C269.8 mg), A (1273.3 g), B-12 (1.5C2.0 g), and folate (455.1C561.3 g), the minerals Se (120.0 g), Zn (11.0 mg), Fe (15.0C18.8 mg), and Mn (5.2C12.5 mg), and polyphenols (1171.00 mg) needed to maintain an active immune response. However, all of these diets are deficient in the recommended amount of vitamin D (20 g/d). Therefore, vulnerable populations such as elders and obese individuals could benefit from antioxidant supplementation to improve their antioxidant response.

However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere. METHODS: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. RESULTS: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe, and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions.","output":"Estimating COVID-19 outbreak risk through air travel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: To identify laboratory biomarkers that predict disease severity and outcome among COVID-19 patients admitted to the Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 429 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from July to October 2020 and with complete clinical and laboratory data. Data was described using frequency tables. Robust Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 disease severity where adjusted relative risk (RR), P-value and 95% CI for RR were used to test significance and interpretation of results. Binary Logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of statistically significant association between the explanatory variables and COVID-19 disease outcome where adjusted odds ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results Results: Among the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission and the rest 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease (15.6% mild and 42.0% moderate). Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive.

Indian traditional medicines, especially poly herbal formulations like Nilavembu Kudineer (NVK) and Kaba Sura Kudineer (KSK) of the Siddha system of medicine have been used as public health interventions for controlling viral epidemics like dengue and Chikungunya. These traditional therapies have been found safe, effective, and widely accepted. The current study evaluates the comparative efficacy of NVK and KSK as opposed to the placebo, in the management of mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. Methods: : The study was a double blind, placebo controlled comparative clinical trial, with the primary objective of determining the efficacy of KSK and NVK. Patients (n=125) diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms were enrolled in the study over a period of 4 months (Aug 2020 C Dec 2020). Participants were randomised into 3 arms;placebo-decaffeinated tea in Arm 1;NVK in Arm II and KSK in Arm III. Each arm received 60 ml of the respective treatment twice a day, post morning and evening meals, along with standard Allopathy treatment for a maximum of 10 days. The main outcome measures of the study were the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, hospital stay, and time taken by the patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic. Efficacy assessments included clinical symptoms (fever, cough and breathlessness) each day and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT) and electrolytes and electrocardiogram (ECG) at baseline (Day 0), Day 3, 6 and 10. Post treatment, participants were followed up for 30 days via phone for adverse effects if any. Effects of drugs on inflammatory markers (IL6,) at the end of treatment were also recorded. Adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study. Results: : The results revealed that when compared to patients in placebo arm, those in NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2, and the time taken to become symptomatic from asymptomatic. Out of 125 COVID-19 patients recruited, 120 completed the study;two from the placebo group developed severe symptoms and were shifted to intensive care unit (ICU) and three patients from arms II and III withdrew from the study. The mean age of females (n=60) and males (n=60) enrolled was between 40.2 and 44.3 years respectively. Results were more promising for all the patients in NVK and KSK arms as all enrolled participants (100%) under this group got discharged by day 6 as compared to only 42.5% (n=17) from placebo groupon that day. The hospital stay time for patients in Arm I, was significantly longer (Mean [SD]=8.4 [2.0] days) as compared to the Arm II and III (Mean [SD]=4.7 [1.5] and 4.2 [1.5] days respectively (Kruskal Wallis test, p=0.0001).Patients in the three groups took a significantly different number of days to become asymptomatic. While Arm II and III patients took mean 2.5 and 1.7 days respectively, Arm I, patients took a mean of 4.2 days (Kruskal Wallis test, p=0.0001). In all, two adverse events were recorded, one for vomiting and one for diarrhoea lasting a day in Arm I & Arm II respectively. Mean value of interleukin-6 (IL6) was significantly different in comparison to the placebo-decaffeinated tea arm (NVK=2.6 and KSK=2.2, Placebo=4.0, p=0.02).The other blood biochemical parameters like C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Ferritin and D-Dimer that were analysed at the baseline and at the time of discharge from hospital, were not significantly different in the three arms. Conclusion: NVK and KSK arms showed a statistically significant reduction in hospital stay time, reduction in viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and time taken for patients to become asymptomatic from symptomatic, when compared to the placebo (decaffeinated ea).The primary outcome measures of KSK arm were significantly better than that in the NVK arm.","output":"Efficacy of Two Siddha Poly herbal Decoctions, Nilavembu Kudineer and Kaba Sura Kudineer, along with Standard Allopathy Treatment in the Management of Mild to Moderate Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients -a Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ensuring steady stream of safe blood is the ultimate goal of blood transfusion practice.

Methods: Participants were 953 health care workers aged 21C75 years who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG antibodies and underwent a health checkup two months after their second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. IFG was defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 100C125 mg/dL, and diabetes was defined as an FPG level  126 mg/dL or being under medical care for diabetes. Multivariable linear regression was used to calculate the ratio of the mean. Result: Spike IgG antibody titers were lower in the presence of hyperglycemia; the ratios of the means (95% CI) were 1.00, 0.79 (0.60C1.04), and 0.60 (0.42C0.87) for individuals with normoglycemia, IFG, and diabetes, respectively (p trend < 0.001).

The purpose of this study is to collect new data to monitor the symptomatic status of patients with OCD during the period of emergency due to COVID-19 and to make a comparison between two psychodiagnostic evaluations. Methods: Eleven OCD patients and their psychotherapists were recruited. All patients had a specific psychodiagnostic assessment for OCD (SCL-90; OCI-R; Y-BOCS self-report) performed between December 2019 and January 2020 (t0), and undertook cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and exposure and prevention of response protocol (ERP) before the lockdown. The psychodiagnostic assessment carried out at t0 was re-administered (t1) to all patients, together with a set of qualitative questions collected through an online survey. The respective therapists were asked to document the status of the therapy and the monitoring of symptoms through use of a semi-structured interview (Y-BOCS) and a qualitative interview. Non-parametric analyses were conducted. Results: Patients reported a significant decrease in OCD symptoms. Data analysis showed a decrease in the scores across t0 and at t1 on the Y-BOCS (SR) total self-report, and on OCD symptoms' severity assessed by means of the OCI-r and SCL-90 r OC subscale, for 11 participants. Relating to the measures detected by psychotherapists, marginally significant improvements and lower scores were found in the Y-BOCS (I). An improvement in symptoms was noticed by 90.9% of the clinical sample; this was confirmed by 45.4% of the therapists, who claimed moderate progress in their patients. Conclusions: The data collected through standardized measurements at two different times, albeit relative to a small sample, assume relevance from a clinical point of view.

METHOD: The databases CINAHL, Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched for articles published between January 2008 and May 2018. Eligible articles were empirical studies that used Arnold's or DSM-5 criteria to diagnose skin picking disorder, published in English, with participants aged 18 years or older. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed according to the National Health and Medical Research Council's guidelines and suggested nosological classification of skin picking disorder were summarised. Eligible studies were assessed against the five criteria proposed by Blashfield and colleagues to determine the validity of the inclusion of skin picking disorder in the DSM-5. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies were considered eligible out of 1554. Most of the papers were case-control studies with small clinical samples. Only one out of Blashfield's five criteria was met; there were commonly accepted diagnostic criteria and assessment scales present in the literature. However, at the time of review, the criterion of 50 published articles (25 of which are required to be empirical) was not met; there had been no publication specifically assessing the clinical utility or validity of skin picking disorder and no studies addressing the differentiation of skin picking disorder from other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.

METHODS: From January 2018 to January 2021, the general disease-related data survey form and medication compliance questionnaire made by our hospital were used to evaluate the scores of 198 patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after PKP in the Department of Orthopedics of our hospital. Single-factor and multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore the influencing factors of medication compliance in patients with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP. From 198 patients, 80 eligible patients were selected for further research. According to a random number table method, they were divided into the control group (n = 40) given only antiosteoporosis drug treatment and care and the experimental group (n = 40) combined with family-centered education intervention. After 12 months of intervention, the two groups were evaluated for their knowledge of osteoporosis, medication compliance, and physical health. RESULTS: Of the 198 patients, only 65 had good medication compliance, 90 had poor medication compliance, and 43 were acceptable. Univariate analysis showed that the influencing factors of medication compliance in patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after PKP include the patient's education, living style, per capita monthly income, combined other diseases, number of hospitalizations, and time since the last hospitalization (P < 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that patients with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP with high education, living with spouse or children, combined with other diseases, frequent hospitalizations, and short time from the last hospitalization had higher medication compliance (P < 0.05). After the intervention, the disease knowledge mastery of the experimental group was significantly better than before and after the intervention in the control group (P < 0.0001). After the intervention, the medication compliance and health status of the experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The medication compliance of patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after PKP is generally poor, and medical staff need to take targeted interventions based on the main factors that affect the patients' medication compliance. Family-centered education intervention is an effective way to improve disease awareness, medication compliance, and health status of patients with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP.","output":"Analysis of Influencing Factors of Medication Compliance in Patients with Recurrent Vertebral Fractures after Percutaneous Kyphoplasty and the Role of Family-Centered Education Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the infrastructure of the healthcare systems.

DESIGN: A qualitative study design was used in addition to administration of standardized depression and mental status screens. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Veterans (n = 18) and caregivers (n = 14) were purposively sampled and recruited from 2 rural CLCs in Upstate New York. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were completed with Veterans in the CLC prior to discharge (to explore experiences during the CLC stay and expectations regarding discharge and returning home) and in the home 2-4 weeks postdischarge (to explore daily routines and perceptions of overall health, mental health, and social functioning). Caregivers participated in 1 interview, completed postdischarge. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Brief Interview for Mental Status were administered postdischarge. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of verbatim transcriptions revealed 3 inter-related themes: (1) Veterans may experience improved social connectedness in CLCs by nature of the unique care environment (predominantly male, shared military experience); (2) Experiences of social engagement and connectedness varied after discharge and could be discordant with Veterans' expectations for recovery prior to discharge; and (3) Veterans may or may not describe themselves as \\"lonely\\" after discharge, when physically isolated.

Further study also demonstrated that siNrf2 could attenuate the inhibitory effect of Andro on TXNIP, validating our mechanistic studies. Thus, our data suggest that Andro may be a potential candidate adjuvant drug for anti-TB therapy as it inhibits pyroptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages, potentially improving clinical outcomes.","output":"Andrographolide Suppresses Pyroptosis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Infected Macrophages via the microRNA-155/Nrf2 Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: There is an urgent need to address how to best provide ophthalmic care for patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides guidance for ophthalmologists on how to deliver the best possible care for patients while minimizing the risk of infection. METHODS: The Vision Academy's Steering Committee of international retinal disease experts convened to discuss key considerations for managing patients with retinal disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing the existing literature on the issue, members put forward recommendations that were systematically refined and voted on to develop this guidance. RESULTS: The considerations focus on the implementation of steps to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19. These include the use of personal protective equipment, adherence to scrupulous hygiene and disinfection protocols, pre-screening to identify symptomatic patients, and reducing the number of people in waiting rooms. Other important measures include triaging of patients to identify those at the greatest risk of irreversible vision loss and prioritization of treatment visits over monitoring visits where possible. In order to limit patient exposure, ophthalmologists should refrain from using treatment regimens that require frequent monitoring. CONCLUSION: Management of patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic will require adjustment to regular clinical practice to minimize the risk of exposure of patients and healthcare staff, and to prioritize those with the greatest medical need. The safety of patients and healthcare staff should be of paramount importance in all decision-making.","output":"Guidance for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This essay aims to propose suggestions on what we can learn from previous investigations to conduct further studies on the potential mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes mellitus on COVID-19.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 due to direct or indirect exposure to COVID-19 patients, and require special attention. Limited information is available about its effect in HCWs. Secondary transmission from HCWs is a possibility among patients, family members, and the community. Therefore, it is important to investigate the infection risk of HCWs and the clinical characteristics of affected cases and possible source of infection with exposure details. Methods: The aim of this study is to analyze the medical records of HCWs with COVID-19 retrospectively and carry out the analysis of the data of HCWs with COVID-19 at TNMC and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH, COVID-19 Hospital) in Mumbai. Results: Interim analysis was carried out for the data collected from 6th April to 20th August 2020. Total 3711 HCWs (frontline, 74.32%, non-frontline, 25.68%) are working at NH Mumbai. We observed 11% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs, 4% co-infection and 1% mortality. Majority (85%) of the HCWs with COVID-19 were symptomatic and 15% were asymptomatic. Comorbidities were reported in 19% of HCWs with COVID-19. Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus were the most common co-morbidities reported. More than 4% percent of HCWs with COVID-19 were also positive for plasmodium vivax Malaria. Conclusion: The results of the study will be useful for determining the impact of COVID-19 and adverse outcomes in HCWs, identifying probable mode of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs.

The purpose of this follow-up, cross-sectional study was to investigate attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare among dental and nursing students and to compare them both between baseline and the completion of the education programme and between dental and nursing students to identify problems with oral healthcare programmes in dental education. METHOD: The subjects included 88 dental and 119 nursing students. The dental students participated in geriatric and preventive dentistry courses for oral healthcare education. The nursing students participated in independent oral healthcare courses comprising 45 h of training with case-based learning and were taught and instructed by multiple health professionals, including dentists. Questionnaires were distributed to the participants to compare attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare between baseline and the completion of the education programme and between dental and nursing students. A chi-square test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and MannCWhitney U test were used to compare the data. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The data of 48 (28 male and 20 female) dental students and 103 (9 male and 94 female) nursing students who completed the questionnaires both at baseline and after the education programme were used for the comparisons. After the education programme, more than 90% of the students were interested in oral healthcare practice; hoped to practise oral healthcare post-qualification; and perceived oral healthcare to be effective for preventing dental caries, periodontal diseases, and aspiration pneumonia. These attitudes and perceptions were statistically significantly improved after the education. However, the level of awareness of oral healthcare and the level of perception of the importance of collaboration with healthcare workers in oral healthcare practice after education were lower in the dental students than in the nursing students. Multi-professional oral healthcare education with case-based learning has the potential to improve awareness of oral healthcare and perceptions of the importance of collaborative oral healthcare practice.

This cellular homeostasis involves two key proteostasis mechanisms, the ubiquitin proteasome system and the autophagyClysosome pathway. These catabolic pathways have been known to be involved in respiratory exacerbations and the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Briefly, proteostasis and autophagy processes are known to decline over time with age, cigarette or biomass smoke exposure, and/or influenced by underlying genetic factors, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and cellular debris, elevating apoptosis and cellular senescence, and initiating the pathogenesis of acute or chronic lung disease. Moreover, autophagic dysfunction results in an impaired microbial clearance, post-bacterial and/or viral infection(s) which contribute to the initiation of acute and recurrent respiratory exacerbations as well as the progression of chronic obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. In addition, the autophagic dysfunction-mediated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) immune response impairment further exacerbates the lung disease. Recent studies demonstrate the therapeutic potential of novel autophagy augmentation strategies, in alleviating the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive or restrictive lung diseases and exacerbations such as those commonly seen in COPD, CF, ALI/ARDS and COVID-19.","output":"Autophagy Augmentation to Alleviate Immune Response Dysfunction, and Resolve Respiratory and COVID-19 Exacerbations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine meat provides healthy nutrients but has also been negatively linked to greenhouse gases and non-communicable diseases.

Since new methods of pathogens eradication must be invented and implemented, nanotechnology seems to have become the response to that acute need. A remarkable achievement in this field of science was the creation of self-disinfecting surfaces that base on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Thus, the phenomenon of photocatalysis was practically applied. Among the AOPs that have been most studied in respect of their ability to eradicate viruses, prions, bacteria, yeasts, and molds, there are the processes of TiO(2)/UV and ZnO/UV. Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) and zinc oxide (ZnO) act as photocatalysts, after they have been powdered to nanoparticles. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an agent that determines their excitation. Methods using photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO(2) and ZnO prove to be highly efficient in inactivation of infectious agents. Therefore, they are being applied on a growing scale. AOP-based disinfection is regarded as a very promising tool that might help overcome problems in food hygiene and public health protection.

RAGE belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules and serves as a multiligand receptor and is expressed in high abundance by alveolar type I (AT-I) cells in adult pulmonary tissue. This study aimed to provide an insight into the association between the severity of COVID-19 disease and serum S100b levels during admission to the emergency department (ED). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 64 patients (34 mild cases; 30 severe cases) were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and 30 healthy volunteers were admitted to study. Serum S100b levels were measured by using enzymle linked immunoassay method from blood serum samples. RESULTS: Serum S100b levels showed a significantly higher mean value in mild and severe disease cohorts than in healthy controls (p=0.036 and p=0.028 respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated greater area under the curve (AUC) for serum S100b levels of the COVID-19 patients (AUC=0.663, 95% CI=0.541-0.785; p=0.014). In addition, serum S100b concentration was measured as 151.7 ng/ml at 79.3% sensitivity and 51.7% specificity (p=0.014). Serum S100b protein levels can serve as a valuable clinical marker in establishing diagnosis of patients.

Although typically described with characteristic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, greater understanding of COVID-19 has revealed myriad clinical manifestations. Olfactory dysfunction (OD)-hyposmia and anosmia-has recently been recognized as an important symptom of COVID-19 and increasingly gained traction as a public health tool for identifying COVID-19 patients, in particular otherwise asymptomatic carriers who, unawares, may be major drivers of disease spread. The objective of this study is to review the scientific evidence about anosmia in COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Comprehensive literature search of primary studies pertinent to the objectives of this review using the chosen data sources. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence shows that OD is highly prevalent in COVID-19, with up to 80% of patients reporting subjective OD and objective olfactory testing potentially showing even higher prevalence. OD is frequently accompanied by taste dysfunction. Up to 25% of COVID-19 patients may experience sudden-onset OD as the first symptom. A large proportion of COVID-19 OD cases may resolve over the period of a few weeks. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Sudden anosmia should be considered a symptom of COVID-19. Assessing for sudden-onset anosmia may increase sensitivity of COVID-19 screening strategies, in particular for identifying patients at the earliest stages of disease. Since many cases of OD due to COVID-19 may resolve in the short term, conservative management, including observation, is reasonable, while advanced imaging is unnecessary.","output":"Olfactory Dysfunction: A Highly Prevalent Symptom of COVID-19 With Public Health Significance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glucose is an essential nutrient for every cell but its metabolic fate depends on cellular phenotype. Normally, the product of cytosolic glycolysis, pyruvate, is transported into mitochondria and irreversibly converted to acetyl coenzyme A by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). In some pathological cells, however, pyruvate transport into the mitochondria is blocked due to the inhibition of PDC by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. This altered metabolism is referred to as aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and is common in solid tumors and in other pathological cells. Switching from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis provides diseased cells with advantages because of the rapid production of ATP and the activation of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) which provides nucleotides required for elevated cellular metabolism. Molecules, called glycolytics, inhibit aerobic glycolysis and convert cells to a healthier phenotype. Glycolytics often function by inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-1 leading to PDC disinhibition allowing for intramitochondrial conversion of pyruvate into acetyl coenzyme A. Melatonin is a glycolytic which converts diseased cells to the healthier phenotype. Herein we propose that melatonins function as a glycolytic explains its actions in inhibiting a variety of diseases. Thus, the common denominator is melatonins action in switching the metabolic phenotype of cells.","output":"Anti-Warburg Effect of Melatonin: A Proposed Mechanism to Explain its Inhibition of Multiple Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed a new mathematical model for yellow fever under three types of intervention strategies: vaccination, hospitalization, and fumigation.

In the present study, intestinal content from a guinea fowl involved in a new case of the disease in 2017 was analyzed by deep sequencing, revealing the presence of a guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV) and a picornavirus (GfPic). Serial passage assays into the intra-amniotic cavity of 13-day-old specific pathogen free chicken eggs and 20-day-old conventional guinea fowl eggs were attempted. On chicken eggs, isolation assays failed, but on guinea fowl eggs, both viruses were successfully obtained. Furthermore, two GfCoV and two GfPic isolates were obtained from the same bird but from different sections of its intestines. This shows that using eggs of the same species in which the virus has been detected can be key for successful isolation.The consensus sequence of the full-length genomes of both GfCoV isolates were highly similar, and correlated to those previously described in terms of genome organization, ORF length and phylogenetic clustering. According to full-length genome analysis and the structure of the Internal Ribosome Entry Site, both GfPic isolates belong to the Anativirus genus and specifically the species Anativirus B.

Our objective was to determine biologic mesh practice patterns of reconstructive surgeons with regard to indications, most appropriate technique, choice of prosthetic, and experience with complications. METHODS A survey was mailed to 2,000 practicing surgeons. Main outcome measures included surgeon experience with biologic mesh and associated complications. RESULTS Two hundred and forty (12 %) surgeons responded to the survey. Ten were excluded, as surgeons completing the survey indicated they did not perform ventral hernia repairs or left multiple questions unanswered. Of the 230 included, 93.5 % (n = 215) of responders had experience using biologic mesh. Frequency of biologic graft use in the last year was as follows: low-volume users (<5 times in the last year) 50.7 %; medium-volume users (5-20 times in the last year) 37.3 %; high-volume users (>20 times in the last year) 11.9 %. Indications for biologic mesh use based on wound classifications (clean, clean contaminated, contaminated or dirty) were quite varied and lacked consensus among surgeons (p value < 0.05). The most commonly reported influences for use included personal experience (45 %), literature (28.3 %), and availability (17.2 %). CONCLUSIONS Despite a lack of level 1 evidence, biologic meshes are being used under various wound classifications.

Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases from January to August 2020. A meta-analysis of studies comparing the profile, STEMI severity at presentation, reperfusion delay, and in-hospital mortality for patients presenting before and during the early COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. Fifteen cross-sectional observational studies including 20,528 STEMI patients from the pre-COVID period and 2190 patients diagnosed and treated during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic met the inclusion criteria. Results: Patients presenting with STEMI during the pandemic were younger and had a higher comorbidity burden. The time interval between symptoms and first medical contact increased from 93.22  137.37 min to 142  281.60 min (p < 0.001).

The data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Due to the pandemic, the interviews were conducted using video conferencing applications. The data was analyzed through content analysis. According to the findings, the teachers report that while they are effective in achieving cognitive objectives, they have difficulties in achieving affective and psychomotor objectives. In addition, the teachers do not prefer to design their own materials, rather they mainly benefit from ready-to-use materials during emergency distance education. The teachers also reveal that direct instruction and questioning were the teaching methods and techniques they preferred in online courses and that they were unable to adapt other methods and techniques to distance education, which resulted in students experiencing teacher-centered activities. Moreover, the teachers complain about students not attending the online courses on time or even at all, their disinterest, a lack of instant feedback, limited communication with students, and insufficient course lengths.

The coronavirus main protease (M(pro)) is an attractive target for anti-coronavirus drug design. Further, -ketoamide is proved to be very effective as a reversible covalent-inhibitor against cysteine proteases. Herein, we report on the non-covalent to the covalent adduct formation mechanism of -ketoamide-based inhibitor with the enzyme active site amino acids by QM/SQM model (QM = quantum mechanical, SQM = semi-empirical QM). To uncover the mechanism, we focused on two approaches: a concerted and a stepwise fashion. The concerted pathway proceeds via deprotonation of the thiol of cysteine (here, Cys(145) SH) and simultaneous reversible nucleophilic attack of sulfur onto the -ketoamide warhead. In this work, we propose three plausible concerted pathways. On the contrary, in a traditional two-stage pathway, the first step is proton transfer from Cys(145) SH to His(41) N forming an ion pair, and consecutively, in the second step, the thiolate ion attacks the -keto group to form a thiohemiketal. In this reaction, we find that the stability of the tetrahedral intermediate oxyanion/hydroxyl group plays an important role. Moreover, as the -keto group has two faces Si or Re for the nucleophilic attack, we considered both possibilities of attack leading to S- and R-thiohemiketal.

This paper investigates the effects of entry by non-incumbent broadband internet service providers (ISPs) making use of innovative, new non-legacy technologies (i.e., fiber and wireless) on residential broadband service quality offered by incumbent legacy (i.e., cable and DSL) ISPs.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission released major corrections to its previously released Form 477 data on U.S. broadband deployment over the 2014-18 period that greatly reduces estimates of entry by new broadband ISPs into urban census blocks. Overall, entry into U.S. urban broadband markets falls by about half, compared to previously released, uncorrected data.Using data from this and multiple other sources, we build a rich panel data set covering all residential broadband services available, by ISP, technology and maximum advertised download speed for each of approximately six million populated U.S. census blocks between December 2014 and December 2018. In contrast with the previous literature, we utilize highly disaggregated data, control for evolving government subsidies to underserved census blocks, and relax strong statistical and economic assumptions maintained in prior work. This paper explores causal effects by estimating variants of a difference-in-differences model with a rich set of control variables. Our model controls for time-invariant unobservable heterogeneity using census block fixed effects. These allow us to identify the effects of entry of new ISPs on service quality in legacy networks serving urban residential customers in spatially disaggregated local markets. We also study reduced form models explaining ISP entry and assess the strength of candidate instruments to mitigate potential endogeneity caused by measurement error in counts of fixed wireless competitors, as well as possible unobserved time-varying census block heterogeneity relevant to ISP entry and exit.Our results suggest that entry into a 2014 legacy duopoly census block (about 40 percent of US census blocks were legacycable and DSLterrestrial broadband duopolies in 2014) by other legacy ISPs had a large and statistically significant impact on improvements to maximum broadband quality offered to consumers by legacy ISPs serving a given block. Increased competition in local broadband markets from such overbuilding by established broadband providers seemed to result in significant quality improvements within a block.These results are consistent with a previous empirical literature that shows mixed, but generally positive effects of increased competition on product quality. More striking is the relatively small impact of increased competition on legacy ISP service quality in comparison to the apparent impacts of underlying time trends on legacy broadband speeds, trends that we believe primarily reflect dramatic technological changes over the 2014-18 period.","output":"Technological Innovation and Quality Improvement in U.S. Broadband"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Waddlia chondrophila is an emerging pathogen that has been implicated in numerous unpropitious pregnancy events in humans and ruminants.

Conclusion: This study found that the most retweeted Covid-19 preventative measures with visuals mostly came from individuals, showing that health and government organisations were not alone in promoting preventative measures on Twitter. This stresses the important role individuals play in the dissemination of information using social media during a health crisis. The finding that more tweets used health loss framing, often combined with the emotive medium of photographs, raises concerns about persuasive tactics feeding on fear. Future research is needed to better understand this approach's consequences and its impact on public perceptions and behaviours.","output":"Covid-19 on Twitter: an analysis of risk communication with visuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recreational use of piperazine designer drugs is a serious threat to human health. These compounds act on the body in a similar fashion to illegal drugs. They induce psychostimulatory effects as well as visual and auditory hallucinations to varying degrees. In many cases of poisoning and deaths, the presence of two or even several psychoactive substances have been demonstrated. Piperazine derivatives are often found in such mixtures and pose a great analytical problem during their identification. Additionally, some piperazine derivatives can be detected in biological material as a result of metabolic changes to related drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly identify these compounds and ensure repeatability of determinations. This article presents a comparison of the methods used to detect abused piperazine designer drugs using liquid chromatography in combination with a diode-array detector (LC-DAD) or mass spectrometer (LC-MS). Each of methods can be used independently for determinations, obtaining reliable results in a short time of analysis. These methods can also complement each other, providing qualitative and quantitative confirmation of results. The proposed methods provide analytical confirmation of poisoning and may be helpful in toxicological diagnostics.","output":"Comparison of LC-MS and LC-DAD Methods of Detecting Abused Piperazine Designer Drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way societies operate.

The capabilities and characteristics of water utilities vary throughout the US, which may impact their resilience. Here, we aim to understand which pre-existing characteristics of water utilities may have led to resilience during the pandemic using results from a qualitative analysis of interviews with 27 US utilities conducted during 2020. We searched for statistical associations between utility characteristics (e.g., population dynamics, geographic location) and the challenges or changes experienced during the pandemic.

The mutants included proline substitutions at HA2 55, 71, and 80, as well as a double proline substitution at residues 55 and 71. Mutants were expressed in COS or 293T cells and assayed for cell surface expression and structural features as well as for their ability to change conformation and induce fusion at low pH. We found the following: Specific mutations affected the precise carbohydrate structure and folding of the HA trimer. All of the mutants, however, formed trimers that could be expressed at the cell surface in a form that could be proteolytically cleaved from the precursor, HA0, to the fusion-permissive form, HA1-S-S-HA2. All mutants reacted with an antibody against the major antigenic site and bound red blood cells. Seven out of ten mutants displayed a wild-type (wt) or moderately elevated pH dependence for the conformational change. V55P displayed a substantial reduction (60C 80%) in the initial rate of lipid mixing. The other single mutants displayed efficient fusion with the same pH dependence as wt-HA. The double proline mutant V55P/ S71P displayed no fusion activity despite being well expressed at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved trimer that could bind red blood cells and change conformation at low pH. The impairment in fusion for both V55P and V55P/S71P was at the level of outer leaflet lipid mixing. We interpret our results in support of the hypothesis that the spring-loaded conformational change is required for fusion.

The thrifty phenotype hypothesis holds that intrauterine malnutrition leads to an adaptive response that alters the fetal metabolic and hormonal milieu designed for intrauterine survival. This fetal programming predisposes to an increased susceptibility for chronic diseases. Although the mechanisms controlling intrauterine growth are poorly understood, adipose tissue may play an important role in linking poor fetal growth to the subsequent development of adult diseases. Adipose tissue secretes a number of hormones, called adipocytokines, important in modulating metabolism and recently involved in intrauterine growth.

Nine prospective studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, seven evaluated the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), one evaluated the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010, and one evaluated a posteriori derived DPs. No intervention studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. There was some evidence of an association between healthy DPs and neuroimaging markers including changes within these markers over time. Consequently, it is plausible that better adherence to such DPs may positively influence brain ageing and neurodegeneration. Future studies may benefit from the use of multi-modal neuroimaging techniques, to further investigate how adherence to a DP influences brain health.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA has been detected in stool samples of approximately 50% of COVID-19 individuals. Fecal calprotectin is a marker of gastrointestinal inflammation in the general population. AIM: To investigate if fecal calprotectin correlates with SARS-CoV-2 intestinal shedding in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia. METHODS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the Infectious Disease Unit (University Hospital of Trieste, Italy) from September to November 2020 were consecutively enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed for quantification of fecal calprotectin (normal value < 50 mg/kg) and SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inter-group differences were determined between patients with and without diarrhea and patients with and without detection of fecal SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We enrolled 51 adults (40 males) with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Ten patients (20%) presented with diarrhea. Real-time-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in stools was positive in 39 patients (76%), in all patients with diarrhea (100%) and in more than two thirds (29/41, 71%) of patients without diarrhea. Obesity was one of the most common comorbidities (13 patients, 25%); all obese patients (100%) (P = 0.021) tested positive for fecal SARS-CoV-2.

From September 2017 to November 2018, we screened humans for acute diarrheal, febrile and respiratory infectious syndromes and canines, swine, equines and bovines for syndromic events or deaths. We estimated the relative sensitivity as the incidence rate ratio of detecting an event in health facility surveillance compared to household surveillance from Poisson models. We used interaction terms between the surveillance method and sociodemographic factors or time trends to assess effect modification as a measure of relative representativeness. We used generalized additive models with smoothing splines to model incidence over time by surveillance method. We randomized 216 households to health facility surveillance and 198 to health facility surveillance plus monthly household visits. Health facility surveillance alone was less sensitive than when combined with household surveillance by 0.42 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.53), 0.56 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.79), 0.02 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.10), 0.28 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.50) and 0.22 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.92) times for human acute infections, human severe acute infections, and deaths in canines, swine and equines, respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS There was a significant decrease in lung transplant volumes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic due to a combination of reduced availability of donors and an imbalance between waitlist additions and inactivations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently associated with an exuberant immune response that can lead to the development of postinfectious fibrotic lung disease. Few lung transplants have been performed in previously infected recipients and long-term outcomes remain unknown. Although the lung transplant volume rebounded during the second wave, it is unclear what the long-term effects of healthcare resource limitation and public health measures will have on transplant volumes in the future. Outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in previous lung transplant recipients appear to be worse than the general public, and, although an immunosuppressed state likely contributes to these outcomes, whether immunosuppression should be altered in those exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unanswered in the absence of unequivocal data.

The clinical manifestations range from mild pneumonia to severe illness, and even death. The prevalence of infection in children is similar to that of adults, though the symptoms are mild or even asymptomatic, among them, fever and cough are the most common symptoms. However, there are also reports of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or even death in children. Among them, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication, with high mortality rates. Currently there are no specific drugs for the novel coronavirus pneumonia, and a large number of clinical trials are underway to search out the most suitable treatment.

We report the generation and development of SC31, a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, isolated from a convalescent patient. Antibody-mediated neutralization occurs via an epitope within the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. SC31 exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in multiple animal models. In SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice, treatment with SC31 greatly reduced viral loads and attenuated pro-inflammatory responses linked to the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, a comparison of the efficacies of SC31 and its Fc-null LALA variant revealed that the optimal therapeutic efficacy of SC31 requires Fc-mediated effector functions that promote IFN?3-driven anti-viral immune responses, in addition to its neutralization ability. A dose-dependent efficacy of SC31 was observed down to 5mg/kg when administered before viral-induced lung inflammatory responses. In addition, antibody-dependent enhancement was not observed even when infected mice were treated with SC31 at sub-therapeutic doses. In SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, SC31 treatment significantly prevented weight loss, reduced viral loads, and attenuated the histopathology of the lungs. In rhesus macaques, the therapeutic potential of SC31 was evidenced through the reduction of viral loads in both upper and lower respiratory tracts to undetectable levels. Together, the results of our preclinical studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of SC31 in three different models and its potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic candidate.","output":"The Fc-mediated effector functions of a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, SC31, isolated from an early convalescent COVID-19 patient, are essential for the optimal therapeutic efficacy of the antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Se rese?a y discute una seleccin de fuentes de datos cuantitativos sobre el impacto sanitario de la pandemia de Covid-19 Se presentan y exponen fuentes de datos abiertos sobre la situacin del Covid-19 en cuanto a su impacto sanitario (casos, fallecimientos, etc ), tanto de mbito global como de mbito espa?ol, y ms brevemente se apuntan fuentes correspondientes al mbito de pases de Europa Occidental ms cercanos a Espa?a, y de pases ms poblados de Iberoamrica Se trata de fuentes en su mayora de organismos oficiales Tambin se presentan modelizaciones de datos y pronsticos sobre el Covid-19 por parte de grupos de investigadores de universidades espa?olas Como conclusiones, se constata el dficit de informacin de detalle a nivel local (por municipios y provincias) en buena parte del territorio espa?ol, y las limitaciones de los datos cuantitativos en Espa?a y otros pases (en particular, respecto a las cifras de fallecimientos suministradas por fuentes oficiales) Asimismo, se reconoce el potencial que representan para estudios actuales y futuros sobre esta pandemia las mltiples fuentes de datos publicadas en abierto Alternate abstract: A selection of quantitative data sources on the health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are reviewed and discussed Open data sources on the situation of Covid-19 in terms of its health impact (cases, deaths, etc ) are presented and explained, both globally and in Spain, and more briefly sources corresponding to the scope of countries are pointed out from Western Europe closest to Spain, and from the most populated countries in Latin America These are mostly sources from official bodies We also present data modeling and forecast about Covid-19 by groups of researchers from Spanish universities As conclusions, the deficit of detailed information at the local level (by municipalities and provinces) in a large part of the Spanish territory, and the limitations of the quantitative data in Spain and other countries (in particular, with respect to the figures of deaths provided by official sources) Likewise, the potential represented by present huge number of data sources for this pandemics present and future studies is recognized","output":"Covid-19: fuentes de informacin cuantitativa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"TRIM25 is a novel RNA-binding protein and a member of the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune response.

METHOD: Seventeen English and Chinese databases were searched in April/May 2020 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and from April/May 2020 to August 2020 for SARS-CoV-2 RCTs. Cochrane rapid review methods were applied. Quality appraisals used the Risk of Bias 2.0 and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Twenty-eight RCTs with 5446 participants were identified. None were specific to SARS-CoV-2. Compared with placebo, oral or intranasal zinc prevented 5 RTIs per 100 person-months (95% CI 1 to 8, numbers needed to treat (NNT)=20, moderate-certainty/quality). Sublingual zinc did not prevent clinical colds following human rhinovirus inoculations (relative risk, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21, moderate-certainty/quality). On average, symptoms resolved 2 days earlier with sublingual or intranasal zinc compared with placebo (95% CI 0.61 to 3.50, very low-certainty/quality) and 19 more adults per 100 were likely to remain symptomatic on day 7 without zinc (95% CI 2 to 38, NNT=5, low-certainty/quality). There were clinically significant reductions in day 3 symptom severity scores (mean difference, MD ?1.20 points, 95% CI ?0.66 to ?1.74, low-certainty/quality), but not average daily symptom severity scores (standardised MD ?0.15, 95% CI ?0.43 to 0.13, low-certainty/quality). Non-serious adverse events (AEs) (eg, nausea, mouth/nasal irritation) were higher (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.69, NNHarm=7, moderate-certainty/quality). Compared with active controls, there were no differences in illness duration or AEs (low-certainty/quality). No serious AEs were reported in the 25 RCTs that monitored them (low-certainty/quality). CONCLUSIONS: In adult populations unlikely to be zinc deficient, there was some evidence suggesting zinc might prevent RTIs symptoms and shorten duration. Non-serious AEs may limit tolerability for some. The comparative efficacy/effectiveness of different zinc formulations and doses were unclear. The GRADE-certainty/quality of the evidence was limited by a high risk of bias, small sample sizes and/or heterogeneity. Further research, including SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials is warranted.

Methods: We systematically reviewed all the studies about thrombotic events on COVID-19 patients in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, MedRxiv, bioRxiv, from Dec 1st, 2019 to July 5, 2020. The weighted mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for clinical data in COVID-19 patients with or without thrombotic events was calculated. Results: 12 articles contained 1083 patients were included for meta-analysis. The prevalence of thrombosis was 22% (95% CI 0.08-0.40) in COVID-19 patients and increased to 43% (95% CI 0.29-0.65) after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with non-thrombotic patients, thrombotic patients had higher levels of D-dimer (MD=2.79, 95% CI 2.27C3.31), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (MD=112.71, 95% CI 62.40C163.02), and white blood cells (WBC) (MD=1.14, 95% CI 0.47C1.81) while decreased lymphocytes (MD= -0.20, 95% CI -0.38 C -0.02).

Finally, patients with thrombosis were at a higher risk of death (OR=2.39, 95% CI 1.36C4.20). Conclusions: Prevalence of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients was high, especially in ICU, though pharmacologic thromboembolism prophylaxis was applied.

Whether mould active antifungal prophylaxis (MAFP) can prevent CAPA remains elusive so far. METHODS: In this observational study, we included all consecutive patients admitted to intensive care units with COVID-19-associated ARF between September 1, 2020, and May 1, 2021. We compared patients with versus without antifungal prophylaxis with respect to CAPA incidence (primary outcome) and mortality (secondary outcome). Propensity score adjustment was performed to account for any imbalances in baseline characteristics. CAPA cases were classified according to European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM)/International Society of Human and Animal Mycoses (ISHAM) consensus criteria. RESULTS: We included 132 patients, of whom 75 (57%) received antifungal prophylaxis (98% posaconazole). Ten CAPA cases were diagnosed, after a median of 6 days following ICU admission. Of those, 9 CAPA cases were recorded in the non-prophylaxis group and one in the prophylaxis group, respectively. However, no difference in 30-day ICU mortality could be observed. Thirty-day CAPA incidence estimates were 1.4% (95% CI 0.2C9.7) in the MAFP group and 17.5% (95% CI 9.6C31.4) in the group without MAFP (p = 0.002). The respective subdistributional hazard ratio (sHR) for CAPA incidence comparing the MAFP versus no MAFP group was of 0.08 (95% CI 0.01C0.63; p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: In ICU patients with COVID-19 ARF, antifungal prophylaxis was associated with significantly reduced CAPA incidence, but this did not translate into improved survival. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MAFP with respect to CAPA incidence and clinical outcomes.

STUDY DESIGN In a cohort of infants born 30 weeks EGA, weekly C-rSO2 data were prospectively collected from the second week of life through 36 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA). Clinically obtained hemoglobin values were noted at the time of recording. Recordings were excluded if they were of insufficient duration (<1 h) or if the hemoglobin was not measured within 7 days. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed effects-model and ROC analysis. ROC analysis was used to determine the threshold of anemia, where C-rSO2 critically decreased >2SD below the mean normative value (<55%) in preterm infants. RESULTS In total 253 recordings from 68 infants (mean EGA 26.9  2.1 weeks, BW 1025  287 g, 49% male) were included. Approximately 29 out of 68 infants (43%) were transfused during hospitalization. Mixed-model statistical analysis adjusting for EGA, BW, and PMA revealed a significant association between decreasing hemoglobin and C-rSO2 (p < 0.01) in transfusion-naive infants but not in transfused infants. In the transfusion naive group, using ROC analysis demonstrated a threshold hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (AUC 0.81, p < 0.01) for critical cerebral desaturation in preterm infants.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether low relative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal intensity can be used as a predictor of good clinical outcome after endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours of the last-known-well time and achieved successful recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score &#8805;2b). Relative DWI signal intensity was calculated as DWI signal intensity in the infarcted area divided by DWI signal intensity in the contralateral hemisphere. Good prognosis was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days after stroke onset (good prognosis group). RESULTS: 49 patients were included in the analysis. Relative DWI signal intensity was significantly lower in the group with good prognosis than in the those with poor prognosis (median (IQR) 1.32 (1.27-1.44) vs 1.56 (1.43-1.66); p<0.01), and the critical cut-off value for predicting good prognosis was 1.449 (area under the curve 0.78).

COVID19 vaccine excipient skin testing has been used in evaluation of these reactions, but its utility in predicting subsequent COVID-19 vaccine tolerance is also unknown. Objective To evaluate the utility of COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine excipient skin testing in both patients with an allergic reaction to their first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose and patients with a history of polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy who have not yet received a COVID-19 vaccine dose. Methods In this multi-center, retrospective review, COVID-19 vaccine and/or vaccine excipient skin testing was performed in patients referred to one of three large tertiary academic institutions. Patient medical records were reviewed after skin testing to determine subsequent COVID-19 vaccine tolerance. Results 129 patients underwent skin testing, which was positive in 12 patients (9.3%). 101 patients received a COVID-19 vaccine after skin testing, which was tolerated in 90 patients (89.1%) with no allergic symptoms, including 5 of the 6 patients with positive skin testing who received a COVID-19 vaccine after skin testing. The remaining 11 patients experienced minor allergic symptoms following COVID-19 vaccination, none of which required treatment beyond antihistamines. Conclusion The low positivity rate of COVID-19 vaccine excipient skin testing and high rate of subsequent COVID-19 vaccine tolerance suggests a low utility of this method in evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine hypersensitivity reactions. Focus should shift to the use of existing vaccine allergy practice parameters, with consideration of graded dosing if necessary.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 315 participants filled out a questionnaire that contains four main parts: 1) Demographics, 2) New-onset symptoms with PPE use, 3) PPE usage hours, 4) Personal opinion about the effect of sensed symptoms on working performance. RESULTS: The mean age was 31.58  4.6 years, and 50.5% (n=159) were female. New-onset symptom rate was 66% (n=208).

It can be deduced from recent literature that the primary route of transmission is via aerosols, produced mainly in poorly ventilated interior areas where infected people spend a lot of time with other people. Concerning contagion rates, accumulated incidence or number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, Spain, and Italy have reached very high levels.

Mitochondrial fission, fusion, and membrane potential play a central role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and the overall shape of mitochondria. Viruses change the dynamics of the mitochondria by altering the mitochondrial processes/functions, such as autophagy, mitophagy, and enzymes involved in metabolism. In addition, viruses decrease the supply of energy to the mitochondria in the form of ATP, causing viruses to create cellular stress by generating ROS in mitochondria to instigate viral proliferation, a process which causes both intra- and extra-mitochondrial damage. SARS-COV2 propagates through altering or changing various pathways, such as autophagy, UPR stress, MPTP and NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, these pathways act as potential targets for viruses to facilitate their proliferation. Autophagy plays an essential role in SARS-COV2-mediated COVID-19 and modulates autophagy by using various drugs that act on potential targets of the virus to inhibit and treat viral infection. Modulated autophagy inhibits coronavirus replication; thus, it becomes a promising target for anti-coronaviral therapy.

We aim to develop and validate a reliable aging-related gene pair signature (ARGPs) to predict the prognosis of gastric cancer (GC) patients. METHODS: The mRNA expression data and clinical information were obtained from two public databases, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset, respectively. The best prognostic signature was established using Cox regression analysis (univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). The optimal cut-off value to distinguish between high- and low-risk patients was found by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The prognostic ability of the ARGPS was evaluated by a log\\\\rank test and a Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: The 24 ARGPs were constructed for GC prognosis. Using the optimal cut-off value ? 0.270, all patients were stratified into high risk and low risk. In both TCGA and GEO cohorts, the results of KaplanCMeier analysis showed that the high-risk group has a poor prognosis (P < 0.001, P = 0.002, respectively). Then, we conducted a subgroup analysis of age, gender, grade and stage, and reached the same conclusion. After adjusting for a variety of clinical and pathological factors, the results of multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the ARGPs is still an independent prognostic factor of OS (HR, 4.919; 95% CI 3.345C7.235; P < 0.001). In comparing with previous signature, the novel signature was superior, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.845 vs. 0.684 vs. 0.695. The results of immune infiltration analysis showed that the abundance of T cells follicular helper was significantly higher in the low-risk group, while the abundance of monocytes was the opposite. Finally, we identified and incorporated independent prognostic factors and developed a superior nomogram to predict the prognosis of GC patients.

REVIEW METHODS Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19. Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening. Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed. Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated. RESULTS Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19. Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence.

This also implies that no blueprints for governing critical sustainability issues both at the local and global levels exist. As a result, rather than imposing decisions, policymakers should engage in a learning process. In this paper, we contend that appropriate policies should be developed and fine-tuned over time through a collective, social endeavour. To support this hypothesis, the study focuses on a shared methodology based on backcasting, a specific type of foresight, to facilitate policy learning (and thus policymaking) within a wide range of territories, regardless of their wealth, geographic characteristics and internal political organisation. This methodology was developed over a three-year period as part of the Territorial Strategies for Innovation (TSI) programme. The overall objective of our assignment was to build capacity and raise awareness within the EU's Overseas Countries and Territories about policymaking and implementation of innovative approaches to development. This innovative approach, which incorporates a systemic innovation perspective, highlights new options and opportunities for adopting and implementing adequate policies to positively impact sustainable development and long-term transformative change. Using empirical examples from Anguilla, Cura?ao, and New Caledonia, the paper focuses on the learning processes required to deal with complexity and uncertainty in these remote territories. We conclude by discussing the potential implications of this foresight approach for the sustainable development and transformation of other less-favoured regions and territories.","output":"Implementing Systemic Innovation Strategies for a More Sustainable Future: The Case of Three Overseas Countries and Territories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented global sequencing effort of its viral agent SARS-CoV-2.

However, RAR patterns in the general population and specifically the role of demographic characteristics in RAR pattern have not been comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we aimed to describe RAR patterns among non-institutionalized US adults and age, sex, and race/ethnicity variation using accelerometry data from a nationally representative population. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Participants aged 20 years who were enrolled in the physical activity monitoring examination and had at least four 24-h periods of valid wrist accelerometer data were included in the present analysis. 24-h RAR metrics were generated using both extended cosinor model (amplitude, mesor, acrophase and pseudo-F statistic) and nonparametric methods (interdaily stability [IS] and intradaily variability [IV]). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between RAR and age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS Eight thousand two hundred participants (mean [SE] age, 49.1 [0.5] years) were included, of whom 52.2% were women and 67.3% Whites. Women had higher RAR amplitude and mesor, and also more robust (pseudo-F statistic), more stable (higher IS) and less fragmented (lower IV) RAR (all P trend < 0.001) than men. Compared with younger adults (20-39 years), older adults ( 60 years) exhibited reduced RAR amplitude and mesor, but more stable and less fragmented RAR, and also reached their peak activity earlier (advanced acrophase) (all P trend < 0.001). Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest amplitude and mesor level, and most stable (highest IS) and least fragmented (lowest IV) RAR pattern (P trend < 0.001). Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest peak activity level (lowest amplitude) and least stable (lowest IS) RAR pattern (all P trend < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In the general adult population, RAR patterns vary significantly according to sex, age and race/ethnicity. These results may reflect demographic-dependent differences in intrinsic circadian rhythms and may have important implications for understanding racial, ethnic, sex and other disparities in morbidity and mortality risk.","output":"Demographic characteristics associated with circadian rest-activity rhythm patterns: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study assessed selected factors that contribute to the recollection of emotional memories over time.

The aim of this study was to show its impact on the activity of a tertiary care Endoscopy Unit with more than 18,000 procedures/year. Materials and methods: This is a single-center study performed at Fondazione Poliambulanza Istituto Ospedaliero, Brescia, Italy. Our Institution was converted to COVID-19 Hospital from January to April 2020 and only emergency and oncologic procedures were maintained to preserve both patients and operators health. Data about outpatients visits and endoscopic examinations performed from January to April 2020 were compared to those of the same period of the previous year. Results: A dramatic drop of all activities was shown. All outpatient visits decreased of 45,89% (1100 vs 2033), including -39.5% (227 vs 375) of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and -28.6% (30 vs 42) of biliopancreatic visits. All endoscopic examinations diminished of 74.1% (562 vs 2173). In detail, colonoscopies were reduced of 78.8% (266 vs 1256), including -85.5% (29 vs 200) of screening procedures, EGDS of 70.4% (241 vs 814), EUS of 44.8% (32 vs 58) and ERCP of 48.9% (23 vs 45). Overall, -64.6% of Gastro-Intestinal (GI) cancers were detected (17 vs 48). A reduction of 77.8% and 80% were obtained in terms of advanced adenomas (i.e., high grade dysplasia and villous histology) and adenocarcinomas detected during colonoscopy (22 vs 100 and 6 vs 30, respectively). These absolute reductions were not compensated by significative increase of relative diagnostic yields which were 3.3% vs 2.3% (17/507 vs 48/2070;Odd Ratio [OR] 0.94), 8.3% vs 7.9% (22/266 vs 100/1256;OR 1.05) and 2.3% vs 2.4% (6/266 vs 30/1256;OR 0.94) for all GI cancers, advanced adenomas, and colorectal cancer in 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The ability to model human trophectoderm disease states from human pluripotent stem cells, the nature of human pluripotent stem cell potency and the mechanisms regulating human trophectoderm specification remains poorly understood. Recent work suggests that only the naive state can give rise to trophectoderm and that primed iPSC generate mixed amnionic and mesoderm lineages. Here we identify conditions that efficiently drive the specification of primed iPSC to trophectoderm, named Trophoblast Stem Cell (TSC). iPS-derived-TSC share transcriptional, morphological and functional characteristics with human in vivo cytotrophoblasts including activation of human endogenous retroviruses, expression of COVID-19 associated host factors and generation of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts with a large fusion index. At high densities in 5% O2, iPS-derived-TSC form villi-like structures and express extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast proteins HCG- and HLA-G. Using temporal single cell RNAseq, we define the molecular changes associated with specification under three separate conditions: 1) BMP4, 2) BMP4 and inhibition of WNT, 3) activation of EGF and WNT, inhibition of TGFbeta, HDAC and ROCK signaling (named TSC). With 9,821 high-quality single cell transcriptomes, we find that BMP4 gives rise to mesenchymal cells while TS conditions lacking exogenous BMP4 generate a stable proliferating cell type that is highly similar to six week placenta cytotrophoblasts. TFAP2A programs the specification of primed iPS cells to TSC without transitioning through a naive state. TSC specification independent of exogenous BMP4 will allow for robust and reproducible studies of the cytotrophoblast component of human placenta.","output":"Single-cell analysis of human trophoblast stem cell specification reveals activation of fetal cytotrophoblast expression programs including coronavirus associated host factors and human endogenous retroviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The regulatory framework set by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for practice of liver transplantation in US is periodically updated and risk adjusted.

There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19, in Chest X-ray and CT scan, however their availability in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has yet to be explored. OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of this study is to describe the POCUS findings of the disease in COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department (ED). Determining the correlation of these parameters with vital signs, laboratory results and chest X-ray, as well as, therapeutic decisions and prognosis. METHODS: Prospective study carried out in the emergency department (ED) of two academic hospitals. High suspicion or confirmed COVID-19 patients were subjected to the ultrasonographic measurement of the inferior vena cava (IVC), focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS), and Lung Ultrasonography (Lung POCUS). RESULTS: Between March and April 2020, ninety-six patients were enrolled. The mean age was 68.2 years (SD 17.5). The most common finding in Lung POCUS was an irregular pleural line (63.2%) followed by bilateral confluent (55.2%) and isolated B-lines (53.1%), which was associated with a positive RT-PCR (OR 4.729, 95% CI: 1.989-11.246; p<0.001), and correlated with IL-6 levels (rho = 0.622; p = 0.002). The IVC moderately correlated with levels of pO2, expiratory (rho = -0.539; p =0.014) and inspiratory (rho = -0.527; p =0.017), with troponin I (rho = 0.509; p=0.03). After POCUS exam, almost 20% of the patients had an associated condition that required a change in the treatment or management.

Some have suggested that assessment of pneumococcal carriage could be used to identify those children with bacterial pneumonia. The objective of this study was to determine if nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization patterns differed between children with definite viral disease, definite bacterial disease, and respiratory disease of indeterminate etiology. METHODS: Three groups of subjects were recruited: children with critical respiratory illness, previously healthy children with respiratory illness admitted to the ward, and previously healthy children diagnosed in the emergency department with non-severe pneumonia. Subjects were categorized as follows: a) viral infection syndrome (eg. bronchiolitis), b) bacterial infection syndrome (ie. pneumonia complicated by effusion/empyema), or c) indeterminate pneumonia. Subjects nasopharyngeal swabs underwent quantitative PCR testing for S. pneumoniae. Associations between categorical variables were determined with Fishers exact, chi-square, or logistic regression, as appropriate. Associations between quantitative genomic load and categorical variables was determined by linear regression. RESULTS: There were 206 children in Group 1, 122 children in Group 2, and 179 children in Group 3. Only a minority (227/507, 45%) had detectable pneumococcal carriage; in those subjects, there was no association of quantitative genomic load with age, recruitment group, or disease category. In multivariate logistic regression, pneumococcal colonization > 3 log copies/mL was associated with younger age and recruitment group, but not with disease category. CONCLUSIONS: The nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae colonization patterns of subjects with definite viral infection were very similar to colonization patterns of those with definite bacterial infection or indeterminate pneumonia. Assessment and quantification of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization does not therefore appear useful to discriminate between acute viral and bacterial respiratory disease; consequently, this diagnostic testing is unlikely to reliably determine which children with indeterminate pneumonia have a bacterial etiology and/or require antibiotic treatment.","output":"Assessment of nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization does not permit discrimination between Canadian children with viral and bacterial respiratory infection: a matched-cohort cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular mechanisms permitting the establishment and dissemination of a virus within a newly adopted host species are poorly understood.

From MHV-A59/MHV-JHM mixed infection, variant viruses (MHV-H1 and MHV-H2) which replicated efficiently in BHK cells were isolated. Under identical treatment conditions, the parental MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM strains failed to produce infectious virus or transcribe detectable levels of viral RNA or protein. The MHV-H isolates were polytrophic, replicating efficiently in normally nonpermissive Syrian hamster smooth muscle (DDT-1), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human adenocarcinoma (HRT), primate kidney (Vero), and murine 17Cl-1 cell lines. Little if any virus replication was detected in feline kidney (CRFK) and porcine testicular (ST) cell lines.

This study examines the viewpoints of experts in healthcare and the public regarding support for a lifestyle\\\\related decision criterion, relative to support for the currently applied criteria, in the healthcare priority setting in the Netherlands. METHODS: We conducted a Q methodology study in samples of experts in healthcare (n = 37) and the public (n = 44). Participants (total sample N = 81) ranked 34 statements that reflected currently applied decision criteria as well as a lifestyle criterion for setting priorities in healthcare. The ranking data were subjected to principal component analysis, followed by oblimin rotation, to identify clusters of participants with similar viewpoints. FINDINGS: We identified four viewpoints. Participants with Viewpoint 1 believe that treatments that have been proven to be effective should be reimbursed. Those with Viewpoint 2 believe that life is precious and every effort should be made to save a life, even when treatment still results in a very poor state of health. Those with Viewpoint 3 accept government intervention in unhealthy lifestyles and believe that individual responsibility should be taken into account in reimbursement decisions. Participants with Viewpoint 4 attribute importance to the cost\\\\effectiveness of treatments; however, when priorities have to be set, treatment effects are considered most important. All viewpoints were supported by a mix of public and experts, but Viewpoint 1 was mostly supported by experts and the other viewpoints were mostly supported by members of the public. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified four distinct viewpoints on the healthcare priority setting in the Netherlands, each supported by a mix of experts and members of the public. There seems to be some, but limited, support for a lifestyle criterionin particular, among members of the public. Experts seem to favour the decision criteria that are currently applied.

The primary focus has been on reducing the viral spread and treating respiratory symptoms; as time goes on, the impact of COVID-19 on neurological and haemostatic systems becomes more evident. The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID\\\\19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the cytokine storm induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow?, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy. Fruitflow? contains antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory compounds that target the mechanisms of platelet activation specific to COVID-19 and can be considered a safe and natural antiplatelet regime.","output":"Platelet hyperactivity in COVID-19: Can the tomato extract fruitflow? be used as an antiplatelet regime?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the unprecedented development and integration of infectious disease dynamic transmission models into policy making and public health practice.

Organizational life cycle (OLC) theory indicates that organizational aging is related, but not determined, by the firm chronological age or its size. Therefore, a firms aging should be analyzed by other factors such as flexibility. The literature considers flexibility as an essential capability, a source of competitive advantage, and an enabler of long-term growth for MSMEs. However, little attention in emerging economies has been paid to examine the nuances of this concept in relation to the OLC in this type of companies. Additionally, studies tend to analyze flexibility as a general term, ignoring that it is a polymorphic concept. That is why there is a need to research the different categories of flexibility. Drawing on a quantitative approach conducting a factor analysis, a two-step cluster, and decision tree analysis to interrogate data from 257 MSMEs in Mexico, this study provides evidence of different dimensions of strategic and structural flexibility that help to characterize and predict the growth, maturity, and declining stages of MSMEs. Our results show that mature firms present more strategic and structural flexible characteristics than those involved in growth or decline stages. The flexible factors that help classify and predict an MSME in the maturity stage include open communication, decentralized decision making, and formalization.

A total sample of 126 Argentine adults, both genders, participated and filled in the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) scale, a sociodemographic questionnaire, and COVID-19 estimates regarding risk perception and preventive behaviors. Results show that people with undercontrolled personality profile and high interpersonal sensitivity overestimated their probability of getting infected, hospitalization, and dying from COVID-19. In addition, the resilient profile group with high anxiety overestimated the probability of hospitalization and dying;the undercontrolled profile group with high anxiety, phobic anxiety, or psychoticism, also overestimated their probability of dying;the undercontrolled profile people with high interpersonal sensitivity, or high anxiety reported higher probabilities of maintaining social distance. Anxiety and depression symptoms explain a low percentage of the perceived risk variance;while conscientiousness, together with mental health were able to explain the estimated probability of engaging in protective behaviors.

While SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been the predominant fungal disease seen in critically ill patients, we present an interesting case of pulmonary blastomycosis reactivation in COVID ARDS in a young post partum female, who recovered with extensive post infection lung damage CASE PRESENTATION: 24 years old gravida (G3P3) presented to ED with complaints of fever, cough and dyspnea for 1 week prior to presentation. Was initially discharged on CAP directed antibiotics. However, patient returned 10 days later with worsening dyspnea and found to have CTA chest imaging of extensive diffuse parenchymal consolidation. COVID PCR resulted positive and patient was admitted and treated with course of dexamethasone, remdesivir, and broad spectrum antibiotics. Unfortunately, developed rapidly progressive ARDS with clinical and radiographic worsening. Ultimately requiring critical care admission, intubation and emergent C-section at 31 weeks of gestation. Management strategies for severe ARDS were implemented including lung protective ventilation, proning, paralysing and inhaled nitric oxide. Eventually, patient was transferred to a tertiary care academic center for evaluation for VV ECMO. Worsening hypoxemic and hypercapnic ventilatory failure mandated VV ECMO support and extensive infectious workup for superadded infection. This resulted in positive markers of pulmonary blastomycosis reactivation and patient was started on prolonged anti-fungal therapy with amphotericin and steroid taper. Patient had prolonged critical care admission of over 60 days with slow clinical improvement. Despite of extensive post infection lung destruction from COVID and blastomycosis patient had slow recovery and was eventually weaned from ECMO support. Tracheostomy and extensive physical therapy for critical care myopathy resulted in successful transfer out of critical care unit to LTACH for further rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: Superadded fungal infections in COVID ARDS has been reported worldwide, particularly in patients requiring prolonged critical care admission and steroid therapy for organizing pneumonia. (1) While SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) has been the predominantfungal disease, other cases of disseminated candidiasis and a case report each of coccidiodomycosis and disseminated histoplasmosis have been reported. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pulmonary blastomycosis reactivation in COVID ARDS. (2) (3). While our patient had a extensive course in the critical care unit, her recovery was remarkable despite needing prolonged VV ECMO support for her COVID ARDS.

Data collection was performed through questionnaire and a researcher-made checklist. The researcher observed and evaluated 7 areas of healthcare. The study was first performed in person, but after the COVID-19 pandemic, the researcher evaluated these cares in absentia. The results of the study showed that the mean score of in-person conduction was 56.7 and in-absentia conduction was 52.5 and the mean score of in-person education was 63.6 and in-absentia conduction was 65.6. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the in-person and in-absentia methods. Moreover, while 53.2% of caregivers performed well, 33.5% of them performed poorly.

Chronic metabolic diseases are known risk factors for increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In turn, COVID pandemics imposed sudden changes in lifestyle and social isolation with consequent potential cardiometabolic sequelae. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of changes in lifestyle and social life on metabolic profile in hyperprolactinemic or osteoporotic patients without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases at the time of COVID-19. METHODS: The primary study outcome measurement was the prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome after COVID-19 outbreak. Seventy-four patients (21 men and 53 women, aged 51.8  17.8 years) were admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Neuroendocrine Disease Unit at University Federico II of Naples, Italy, as per their routine clinical practice because of tumoral and non-tumoral hyperprolactinemia in 52 patients (70.3%), and osteoporosis/osteopenia in 22 (29.7%). Among female patients, 25 (47.2%) were at menopausal age. RESULTS: At the end of lockdown, prevalence of obesity (from 37.8% to 51.3%, p < 0.0001), dyslipidemia (from 28.4 to 48.6%, p = 0.003) and metabolic syndrome (from 14.9 to 27%, p < 0.0001) significantly increased compared to pre-COVID evaluation.

PURPOSE To estimate rates of angiographic occlusion and good clinical outcome in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting devices. DATA SOURCES Systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane databases, and EMBASE from inception to December 2015 for articles that included ruptured aneurysms treated with flow diversion. STUDY SELECTION One hundred seventy-two records were screened, of which 20 articles contained sufficient patient and outcome data for inclusion. DATA ANALYSIS Clinical and radiologic characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes were extracted from these reports. Aggregated occlusion rates and clinical outcomes were analyzed by using the Fisher exact test (statistical significance,  = .05). DATA SYNTHESIS Complete occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved in 90% of patients, and favorable clinical outcome was attained in 81%. Aneurysm size greater than 7 mm was associated with less favorable clinical outcomes (P = .027). Aneurysm size greater than 2 cm was associated with a greater risk of rerupture after treatment (P < .001). LIMITATIONS Observational studies and case reports may be affected by reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS Although not recommended as a first-line treatment, the use of flow diverters to treat ruptured intracranial aneurysms may allow high rates of angiographic occlusion and good clinical outcome in carefully selected patients.

The present study was performed to characterize whether the effects of SpO2 and PBT on the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID are mediated by immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Both PBT and SpO2 strongly predict OSTOX/ATIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the physio-affective symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation.

Persian cats exhibit severe forms of the disease more commonly than other breeds of cat, including other long-haired breeds. Certain types of severe dermatophytosis in humans are reportedly caused by monogenic inborn errors of immunity. The goal of this study was to identify genetic variants in Persian cats contributing to the phenotype of severe dermatophytosis. Whole-genome sequencing of case and control Persian cats followed by a genome-wide association study identified a highly divergent, disease-associated haplotype on chromosome F1 containing the S100 family of genes. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), which encodes a subunit of the antimicrobial heterodimer known as calprotectin, contained 13 nonsynonymous variants between cases and controls. Evolutionary analysis of S100A9 haplotypes comparing cases, controls, and wild felids suggested the divergent disease-associated haplotype was likely introgressed into the domestic cat lineage and maintained via balancing selection. We demonstrated marked upregulation of calprotectin expression in the feline epidermis during dermatophytosis, suggesting involvement in disease pathogenesis. Given this divergent allele has been maintained in domestic cat and wildcat populations, this haplotype may have beneficial effects against other pathogens. The pathogen specificity of this altered protein should be investigated before attempting to reduce the allele frequency in the Persian cat breed.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Routine comprehensive echocardiography and STE of both ventricles were performed during hospitalization for acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection as part of a prospective pre-designed protocol and compared with echocardiography performed 3 months after recovery in 80 patients, using a similar protocol. Significantly improved right ventricle (RV) fractional area change, longer pulmonary acceleration time, lower right atrial pressure, and smaller RV end-diastolic and end-systolic area were observed at the recovery assessment (P < 0.05 for all). RV global longitudinal strain improved at the follow-up evaluation (23.2  5 vs. 21.7  4, P = 0.03), mostly due to improvement in septal segments. Only eight (10%) patients recovering from COVID-19 infection had abnormal ejection fraction (EF) at follow-up. However, LV related routine (E, E/e, stroke volume, LV size), or STE parameters did not change significantly from the assessment during hospitalization. A significant proportion [36 (45%)] of patients had some deterioration of longitudinal strain at follow-up, and 20 patients (25%) still had abnormal LV STE 3 months after COVID-19 acute infection. CONCLUSION: In patients previously discharged from hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection, RV routine echocardiographic and RV STE parameters improve significantly concurrently with improved RV haemodynamics. In contrast, a quarter of patients still have LV systolic dysfunction based on STE cut-offs. Moreover, LV STE does not improve significantly, implying subclinical LV dysfunction may be part and parcel of recovering from COVID-19 infection.","output":"Evolution of right and left ventricle routine and speckle-tracking echocardiography in patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019: a longitudinal study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral-immune-system research has illuminated how people detect and avoid signs of infectious disease. But how do we regulate exposure to pathogens that produce no symptoms in their hosts? This research tested the proposition that estimates of interpersonal value are used for this task. The results of three studies (N = 1,694), each conducted using U.S. samples, are consistent with this proposition: People are less averse to engaging in infection-risky acts not only with friends relative to foes but also with honest and agreeable strangers relative to dishonest and disagreeable ones. Further, a continuous measure of how much a person values a target covaries with comfort with infection-risky acts with that target, even within relationship categories. Findings indicate that social prophylactic motivations arise not only from cues to infectiousness but also from interpersonal value. Consequently, pathogen transmission within social networks might be exacerbated by relaxed contamination aversions with highly valued social partners.","output":"Behavioral Immune Trade-Offs: Interpersonal Value Relaxes Social Pathogen Avoidance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak and related restrictions meant a higher incidence of screen-related risk behaviors in both children and adolescents.

The online survey was responded to by the school-based prevention specialists (N = 1698). For the analysis, within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) and binominal logistic regression were used. At-risk internet use and cyber-bullying were perceived as pressing, but other risks, for example, excessive internet use or the use of cyberpornography, received substantially less priority. The differences in all grades were significant and moderate to large ((2)G between 0.156 and 0.288). The proportion of schools which conducted prevention interventions of screen-related risks was low (between 0.7% and 27.8%, depending on the grade and the type of the risk). The probability of delivering prevention intervention was in all grades significantly predicted by the presence of screen-related problems in pupils (OR 3.76C4.88) and the perceived importance of the screen-related risks (OR 1.55C1.97).

While the blood-testis barrier is known to protect testes from antigens, current evidence suggests COVID-19 can affect the testis. Reports of bilateral orchitis are growing. Current hypotheses consider causes of (1) cellular induced cytokine storm or (2) IgG deposits in the vascular endothelium to be at blame but causal genes or underlying genetic susceptibility have not yet been identified. Objective This project sought to uncover genetic explanations as to why certain men face increased susceptibility to developing COVID orchitis. Methods We identified and examined six COVID-19 patients who all were confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), including three COVID-19 (+) men without orchitis (controls) and three COVID (+) men with orchitis (bilateral testicular pain for at least 5 days around the time of testing PCR positive). Of note, among the three men with COVID-19 who had orchitis, two of them were siblings. DNA extraction and whole exome sequencing were performed on blood using the QIAmp blood maxi kit on five of the six patients. Variants were prioritized by being shared between the three patients affected with orchitis, absent in controls, and introducing nonsense, frameshift, splicing or non\\\\synonymous amino acid changes and less than 10% in population prevalence. Based on WES findings, DuoSet? Human ACE2 reagent kit 2 (catalog number: DY933-05) was purchased from R&D Systems, USA, and used to measure the level of soluble ACE2 in the plasma samples. Results The average age of the men in the study was 25 years old. The average duration of COVID symptoms (fever, sore throat, cough, body aches) were 7 days. Among the men who developed bilateral testis pain, the symptoms lasted for an average of 22 days. A list of 16 variants was generated that found to be shared between the two siblings with COVID orchitis along with the unrelated subject with COVID orchitis, and not present in the two controls. Among the 16 variants, a nonsynonymous non-frameshit deletion in NACAD variant on chromosome 7 with a frequency of 3.9% prevalence in ExAC was prioritized based on known involvement in the ACE2 pathway, read depth, and genotype quality. Phenotypically, we found that circulating levels of soluble ACE2 was 3.72 ng/ml among men who had COVID orchitis and was lower than men who developed COVID without orchitis. Conclusions We observed a stop mutation in NACAD in 2 brothers and 1 unrelated man who developed COVID orchitis. Interestingly, we found lower circulating ACE2 serum levels in both brothers with orchitis and the one nonrelated orchitis subject but normal serum levels in all controls. NACAD when involved with cellular ability to shuttle out ACE2 becomes critical for COVID symptomatology. With decreased transcellular and extracellular transport of ACE2 being possible in subjects with the gene mutation, it can be postulated more ACE2 will be found intracellularly leading to increased cellular entry of SARS CoV-2 and possibility of orchitis sequelae.

We examined differences in COVID-stress and depression as a function of gender, race, ethnicity, and subjective social status. We tested these factors as moderators of the association between COVID-stress and depression. DESIGN We used a cross-sectional design to test associations between sociodemographic factors, COVID-stress, and depression. Analyses were based on confirmatory factor analytic and structural equations models. METHODS A convenience sample of 1,058 U.S. MTurk workers and college students (54.5% cisgender women; 55.1% racial/ethnic minoritized individuals) was recruited. Participants completed self-report measures of COVID-stress and depression. RESULTS COVID-stress was positively associated with depression. Overall, neither gender nor racial minoritized status moderated COVID-stress effects on depression. However, intersectional analyses revealed COVID-stress was a significant risk factor for depression among Black women compared to other participants. COVID-stress was more strongly linked to depression for Hispanic individuals and participants with higher social status.

Physical activity is a cornerstone in reducing type 2 diabetes risk but can be a challenging behaviour to adopt for those living with prediabetes. Individuals with prediabetes experience difficult emotions associated with being at risk for a chronic disease, which can undermine self-regulation. Self-compassion enhances self-regulation because it mitigates difficult emotions and promotes adaptive coping. We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a self-compassion informed intervention to increase physical activity for persons with prediabetes. METHODS: This explanatory mixed methods study tested the feasibility and acceptability of a two-arm, randomized, single-blind, actively controlled, 6-week online intervention. Using a 1:1 allocation ratio, participants (identified as people with prediabetes, low physical activity, and low self-compassion) were randomized to a self-compassion (M(age) = 60.22 years) or control condition (M(age) = 56.13 years). All participants received behaviour change education (e.g. SMART goals, action-coping planning) and either other health knowledge (control condition: e.g. sleep, benefits of water) or self-compassion training (intervention condition: practising mindfulness, writing a letter to themselves offering the same support that they would offer to a friend). The primary outcome was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the trial. To be considered feasible, our outcomes needed to meet or surpass our pre-determined criteria (e.g. time for group formation: 14C20 participants per month). Feasibility was assessed by examining the recruitment rates, retention, adherence, fidelity, and capacity. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants to determine trial acceptability. As a secondary purpose, we examined the means on key study variables (secondary and exploratory variables; see Table 1) at all planned time points (baseline, intervention-end, 6- and 12-week follow-up) to identify if they are suitable to include in the efficacy trial (see Additional Table 3). RESULTS: Eighteen participants were screened and randomized to one of two conditions. Retention, instructor fidelity, safety, capacity, adherence to most of the study aspects, and acceptability by participants and facilitators all met the criteria for feasibility. Recruitment rate, process time, and adherence to home practice were below our criteria, and we offer ways to address these shortcomings for the efficacy trial. CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that it should be feasible to deliver our intervention while highlighting the alterations to components that may be altered when delivering the efficacy trial. We outline our changes which should improve and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of our planned intervention.

In order to identify these factors, we conducted a study of rubella-specific humoral immunity before (Baseline) and after (Day 28) a third dose of MMR-II vaccine in a cohort of 109 women of childbearing age. We performed mRNA-Seq profiling of PBMCs after rubella virus in vitro stimulation to delineate genes associated with post-vaccination rubella humoral immunity and to define genes mediating the association between prior immune response status (high or low antibody) and subsequent immune response outcome. Our study identified novel genes that mediated the association between prior immune response and neutralizing antibody titer after a third MMR vaccine dose. These genes included: CDC34; CSNK1D; APOBEC3F; RAD18; AAAS; SLC37A1; FAS and JAK2. The encoded proteins are involved in innate antiviral response, interferon/cytokine signaling, B cell repertoire generation, the clonal selection of B lymphocytes in germinal centers, and somatic hypermutation/antibody affinity maturation to promote optimal antigen-specific B cell immune function.

Quarantine is associated with stress and depression, which lead to unhealthy nutrition and reduced physical activity, particularly in women. Unhealthy diet is usually poor in fruit and vegetables, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a weapon in the fight against the Covid-19. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. In addition, women are less likely to engage in regular physical activity and have increased sitting time and sedentary behaviors during quarantine, which have led to weight gain. During quarantine strategies to increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet have been implemented. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy Diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage women to return to a good lifestyle routine.

A two-stage research questionnaire was applied on a sample of 375 teachers. As a result of the influence of pandemic restrictions, the occurrence of burnout was investigated using Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results. We found significant relationships between some demographic variables and the burnout. It has also been shown that women are more susceptible to burnout than men. Occupational stress and poor working conditions, as well as the absence of physical contact with students, are strong predictors of burnout, work experience being the only protective factor.

The present study used a comprehensive untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approach to capture the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that several circulating lipids acted as potential biomarkers, such as phosphatidylcholine 14:0_22:6 (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.96), phosphatidylcholine 16:1_22:6 (AUC = 0.97), and phosphatidylethanolamine 18:1_20:4 (AUC = 0.94). Furthermore, triglycerides and free fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid (AUC = 0.99) and oleic acid (AUC = 0.98), were well correlated to the severity of the disease. An untargeted analysis of non-critical COVID-19 patients identified a strong alteration of lipids and a perturbation of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA degradation, arachidonic acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The severity of the disease was characterized by the activation of gluconeogenesis and the metabolism of porphyrins, which play a crucial role in the progress of the infection. In addition, our study provided further evidence for considering phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity as a potential key factor in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and a possible therapeutic target.

We aimed to compare clinical features of 165 Italian patients with laboratory confirmed or unconfirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: On March 31, 2020, hospitalized patients who presented with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, exposures, and presence of lung imaging features consistent with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were included. Before admission to a hospital ward, patients underwent RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in their nasopharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: Of 165 patients studied, 119 had positive RT-PCR results and 46 were RT-PCR negative for 2 days or longer (i.e., when the last swab sample was obtained). The median age was 70 years (IQR, 58-78), and 123 (74.6%) of 165 patients had at least one comorbidity. The majority of patients (101/165, 61.2%) had a mild pneumonia, and the remaining patients (64/165, 38.8%) a severe/critical pneumonia. We did not find any substantial difference in symptoms, incubation periods, and radiographic/CT abnormalities as well as in many of the biological abnormalities recorded. However, at multivariable analysis, higher concentrations of hemoglobin (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.65; P = 0.003) and lower counts of leukocytes (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.90; P < 0.001) were statistically associated with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. While mortality rates were similar, patients with confirmed diagnosis were more likely to receive antivirals (95% vs 19.6%, P < 0.001) and to develop ARDS (63% vs 37%, P = 0.003) than those with unconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

The number one pathogen causing CAP is pneumococcus, which is commonly resistant to multiple antibiotics, thus complicating management. Other common pathogens include atypical organisms (Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), Hemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram-negatives (especially in those with chronic illness and aspiration risk factors), and Staphylococcus aureus. Successful management requires careful assessment of disease severity so that a site-of-care decision can be made (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care unit), appropriate samples for diagnostic testing collected, and antibiotic therapy initiated in a timely and accurate fashion. Initial antibiotic therapy is empiric, but even with extensive diagnostic testing, less than half of all patients have an etiologic pathogen identified. All patients with CAP require therapy for pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, and other organisms, as dictated by the presence of specific risk factors.

Our objective was to compare treatments, acute care utilization, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) across pandemic waves. METHODS: This observational study enrolled consecutive eligible COVID-19 patients presenting to 46 EDs participating in the Canadian COVID-19 ED Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) between March 1 and December 31, 2020. We collected data by retrospective chart review. Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included treatments, hospital and ICU admissions, ED revisits and readmissions. Logistic regression modeling assessed the impact of pandemic wave on outcomes. RESULTS: We enrolled 9,967 patients in 8 provinces, 3,336 from the first and 6,631 from the second wave. Patients in the second wave were younger, fewer met criteria for severe COVID-19, and more were discharged from the ED. Adjusted for patient characteristics and disease severity, steroid use increased (odds ratio [OR] 7.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.2C8.9), and invasive mechanical ventilation decreased (OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.4C0.7) in the second wave compared to the first. After adjusting for differences in patient characteristics and disease severity, the odds of hospitalization (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6C0.8) and critical care admission (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.6C0.9) decreased, while mortality remained unchanged (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.5C1.1). INTERPRETATION: In patients presenting to cute care facilities, we observed rapid uptake of evidence-based therapies and less use of experimental therapies in the second wave. We observed increased rates of ED discharges and lower hospital and critical care resource use over time.

SARS-CoV-2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are interconnected by risk factors association with an increased incidence of the disease and by determining de novo cardiac complications. At the same time, COVID-19 disease can lead to acute kidney injury directly, or due to sepsis, multi-organ failure and shock. Therefore, the pre-existence of both CVD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked with a higher risk of severe disease and worse prognosis. METHODS: The main aim of this study is to assess the CV risk in a CKD (stage 3 to 5), dialysis and kidney transplanted population, following SARS-CoV-2 infection, with focus on the endothelial dysfunction as compared to a control group of matched patients. By using clinical evaluation, flow-mediated dilatation, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, intima-media thickness, echocardiographic parameters, lung ultrasound, bioimpedance spectroscopy and a series of novel biomarkers, the investigators will determine the long-term impact of this disease on CV and renal outcomes.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that upholding of the ILKPs holds strong potential for the local implementation of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly, SDG-1(No poverty), SDG-2 (Zero hunger), and SDG-15 (Life on land). However, eight of the identified ILKPs showed a statistically significant difference between older and middle-aged farmers, underlining a declining trend. Finally, we suggest suitable policy measures to mainstream ILKPs to balance the trade-offs in food production and biodiversity conservation, and to ensure the future sustainability of Jhum cultivation in the region and beyond.","output":"Exploring Indigenous and Local Knowledge and Practices (ILKPs) in Traditional Jhum Cultivation for Localizing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): A Case Study from Zunheboto District of Nagaland, India."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Foot posture which forms the distal supporting structure influences on postural stability. Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) who are more likely to be overweight or obese may present with flat foot with symptoms that affect daily activities. The aim of this study was to compare the foot posture and body composition measures between children with and without DCD. In addition, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between foot posture and fat percentage. METHODS: Fifty-nine children with DCD (mean age = 8.071.10) and sixty-two typically developing children (mean age = 7.971.05) were recruited to the DCD and control group respectively. All children received a foot posture assessment and a whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Foot Posture Index 6 (FPI-6) total scores, sub-scores and lower limb body composition measures including fat mass, lean mass, total mass, fat percentage and fat mass index were measured. RESULTS: Children with DCD revealed a significantly higher FPI-6 left (1.12; 95% CI: 0.172, 2.061) and right (1.15; 95% CI: 0.218, 2.079) total score. FPI-6 sub-scores (talar head palpation and abduction/adduction forefoot on rearfoot) illustrated significant differences between children with and without DCD. Children with DCD had a significantly higher total fat mass (1247.48g; 95% CI: 121.654, 2373.304), total fat percentage (1.82%; 95% CI: 0.115, 3.525) and fat mass index (0.56kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.036, 1.069). There was a significant relationship between FPI-6 right total score and total fat percentage. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study showed that children with DCD exhibited significantly more pronated foot posture and higher body composition measures compared to typically developing children. Moreover, with FPI-6 right total score significantly related to the total fat percentage, it may require more than just detecting abnormal foot structures in children with DCD but also promoting a healthy lifestyle to prevent obesity.","output":"Foot posture index and body composition measures in children with and without developmental coordination disorder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Anastomotic stenosis, leak, and hemorrhage are common stapler-related complications of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. In May 2007, we transitioned from a 25-mm diameter, 4.8-mm-height circular stapler to a 25-mm, 3.5-mm-height circular stapler. We hypothesized that the staple height would be associated with a decreased incidence of perioperative complications. METHODS The records of 360 consecutive patients who had undergone laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from May 1, 2006 to March 31, 2008 were retrospectively abstracted. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project and Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative databases were used to collect the patient demographics and track complications of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Data were collected on the rates of anastomotic stenosis requiring dilation of the gastrojejunostomy, anastomotic leak, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, and wound infection. Patients with a 4.8-mm staple height gastrojejunostomy were compared with those with a 3.5-mm staple height gastrojejunostomy for differences in complications. RESULTS The groups were similar with respect to age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, sleep apnea, and surgery duration. In the 4.8- and 3.5-mm staple height groups, 15% and 6.1% required gastrojejunal dilation, respectively (P = .01). A trend was seen toward a decrease in postoperative hemorrhage (5% versus 2.8%) with the shorter staple height. No anastomotic leaks occurred, and the incidence of wound infection (1.7% versus 2.2%) was similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION In the present study, the use of a 25-mm, 3.5-mm staple height circular stapler was associated with a decreased rate of anastomotic stenosis.","output":"Shorter circular staple is height associated with lower anastomotic stricture rate in laparoscopic gastric bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ssr4 is a yeast protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and is an essential part of the chromatin-remodelling [SWI/SNF and RSC (remodelling the structure of chromatin)] complexes found in S. pombe.

Despite available effective treatments, the majority of heavy cannabis users does not seek professional help. Web-based interventions can provide an alternative for cannabis users who are reluctant to seek professional help. Several web-based cannabis interventions are effective in reducing cannabis use; however, the effect sizes are typically small and attrition rates are typically high. This suggests that web-based programs can be an effective cannabis use intervention for some, while others may need additional substance use treatment after completing a web-based intervention. Therefore, it is important that web-based interventions do not solely focus on reducing cannabis use, but also on improving attitudes towards substance use treatment. The Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) approach appears to be well suited for the purpose of reducing cannabis use and improving substance use treatment utilization. Based on the SBIRT approachand based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI)we developed the Internet-based cannabis reduction intervention ICan. METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol paper presents the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which we evaluate the effectiveness of the ICan intervention compared to four online modules of educational information on cannabis in a sample of Dutch frequent cannabis users. The primary outcome measure is frequency of cannabis use. Secondary outcome measures include the quantity of cannabis used (grams), the attitudes towards seeking help and the number of participants who enter specialized treatment services for cannabis use-related problems.

Concerns raised regarding privacy and data security will be critical if the App is to achieve the large-scale adoption and ongoing use required for its effective operation.","output":"A National Survey of attitudes to COVID-19 Digital Contact Tracing in the Republic of Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent evidence suggested that neurological manifestations occur in patients with a severe form of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). On the basis of this issue, neurologists are very concerned about patients with neurological disorders, especially multiple sclerosis (MS), as consumers of immunosuppressive or immune-modulating drugs. Therefore, the administration of proper disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS patients is critical during the pandemic status. On the one hand, both the autoimmune diseases and immunosuppressive drugs increase the risk of infection due to impairment in the immune system, and on the other hand, postponing of MS treatment has serious consequences on the central nervous system. In the present study, we discussed recent literature about the effect of DMTs administration on the severity of COVID-19 in the MS patients. Overall, it seems that DMTs do not provoke the COVID-19 infection in the MS patients by declining immune responses and cytokine storm. However, as a precaution, the supervision of a neurologist is highly recommended.","output":"Impact of disease-modifying drugs on the severity of COVID-19 infection in multiple sclerosis patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which has infected millions of people worldwide in only a few months.

This paper applies a mixed-method approach to map the post-COVID-19 SDGs targets on a fuzzy action priority surface at the country level in Iran, as a developing country, by taking the following four main steps: (1) using a modified Delphi method to make a list of the SDGs targets influenced by COVID-19; (2) using the bestCworst method, as a multi-criteria decision-making tool, to weight the COVID-19 effects on the SDGs targets achievement; also (3) to weight the impact of the SDGs targets on the sustainable development implementation; and finally (4) designing a fuzzy inference system to calculate the action priority scores of the SDGs targets. As a result, reduction of poor people proportion by half (SDG 1.2), development-oriented policies for supporting creativity and job creation (SDG 8.3), end the pandemics and other epidemics (SDG 3.3), reduction of deaths and economic loss caused by disasters (SDG 11.5), and financial support for small-scale enterprises (SDG 9.3) were identified as the highest priorities for action, respectively, in the recovery agenda for sustainable development post COVID-19.

COVID-19 poses a serious threat to human life. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse and severe and 20% of infected patients are reported to be in a critical condition. A loss in lung function and pulmonary fibrosis are the main manifestations of patients with the severe form of the disease. The lung function is affected, even after recovery, thereby greatly affecting the psychology and well-being of patients, and significantly reducing their quality of life. METHODS: Participants must meet the following simultaneous inclusion criteria: over 18 years of age, should have recovered from severe or critical COVID-19 cases, should exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after recovery, and should exhibit Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome as indicated in the system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The eligible candidates will be randomized into treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive modern medicine (pirfenidone) plus TCM whereas the control group will be administered modern medicine plus TCM placebo. The lung function index will be continuously surveyed and recorded. By comparing the treatment effect between the two groups, the study intend to explore whether TCM can improve the effectiveness of modern medicine in patients with pulmonary fibrosis arising as a sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary fibrosis is one of fatal sequelae for some severe or critical COVID-19 cases, some studies reveal that pirfenidone lead to a delay in the decline of forced expiratory vital capacity, thereby reducing the mortality partly. Additionally, although TCM has been proven to be efficacious in treating pulmonary fibrosis, its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis related COVID-19 has not been explored. Hence, a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective clinical trial has been designed and will be conducted to determine if a new comprehensive treatment for pulmonary fibrosis related to COVID-19 is feasible and if it can improve the quality of life of patients.

These parameters, characterizing the disease cycle, are tuned by the biological characteristics of the pathogen, capturing its natural time-scales, often considered independent of the state of the spread itself. If, however, the disease gains a population-wide impact, its prevalence may exceed the health-care system capacity, resulting in sub-optimal treatment, and hence a potential feedback mechanism, in which the disease cycle is no longer decoupled from the state of the spread. Such dependence was demonstrated during the spread of COVID-19, for instance, where hard-hit places showed elevated mortality rates, likely due to an over-stressed health-care system. We therefore introduce an infection-reduced recovery mechanism, linking an individual's rate of recovery to the prevalence of the disease. The outcome, we show, may have dramatic consequences on the observed patterns of spread. For instance, under rather broad conditions, the pandemic transition becomes discontinuous, exhibiting an abrupt shift from a healthy to a pandemic state. In some cases the disease reaches population-wide coverage even below the classically predicted critical transition point. We also observe a potential multi-stability and hysteresis, capturing an irreversible pandemic transition, in which overcoming the disease requires us to quench infection rates significantly below the critical threshold. These findings not only provide hints on the current difficulties to contain COVID-19, but more broadly, they set the bar for sustaining a stably functioning treatment capacity in the face of population-wide demand.","output":"Epidemic spreading under infection-reduced-recovery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) are at high risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). OBJECTIVES: The aims were to provide time trends in the 2020 nation-wide prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis in France, and to describe in-hospital and up to 30-day postdischarge death. METHODS: All patients hospitalized in France with a COVID-19 diagnosis in 2020 were selected. Crude and age-adjusted prevalence of VTE and PE was computed by 4-week intervals and for the overall study period using Poisson regression. Time trends in in-hospital and 30-day postdischarge case-fatality rates were evaluated by comparing each 4-week intervals to weeks 10 to 14 corresponding to the first part of the first lockdown using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among the 287,638 patients hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis in 2020 in France, 14,985 (5.2%) had a concomitant VTE, with 10,453 (3.6%) having PE and 4,532 (1.6%) having DVT. In patients admitted to intensive care units, the crude prevalence of VTE and PE reached 16.1 and 11.0% respectively during the first lockdown. After adjustment, the prevalence of VTE and PE decreased during the year 2020 but a rebound was observed during the second lockdown.

After its first detection in January 2020, COVID-19 has become the major health issue in Sri Lanka. The impact of public health measures, notably restrictions on movement of people to curb COVID-19 transmission, on the incidence of dengue during the period March 2020 to April 2021 was investigated. METHODS: The incidence of dengue and COVID-19, rainfall and the public movement restrictions implemented to contain COVID-19 transmission were obtained from Sri Lanka government sources. A Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was used to predict the monthly dengue incidence from March 2020 to April 2021 for each of the countrys 25 districts based on five years of pre-pandemic data, and compared with the actual recorded incidence of dengue during this period. Ovitrap collections of Aedes larvae were performed in Jaffna city in the Jaffna district from August 2020 to April 2021 and the findings compared with similar collections made in the pre-pandemic period from March 2019 to December 2019. RESULTS: The recorded numbers of dengue cases for every month from March 2020 to April 2021 in the whole country and for all 25 districts over the same period were lower than the numbers of dengue cases predicted from data for the five years (2015C2019) immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of dengue cases recorded nationwide represented a 74% reduction from the predicted number of dengue cases for the March 2020 to April 2021 period. The numbers of Aedes larvae collected from ovitraps per month were reduced by 88.6% with a lower proportion of Ae. aegypti than Ae. albopictus in Jaffna city from August 2020 until April 2021 compared with March 2019 to December 2019. CONCLUSION: Public health measures that restricted movement of people, closed schools, universities and offices to contain COVID-19 transmission unexpectedly led to a significant reduction in the reported numbers of dengue cases in Sri Lanka. This contrasts with findings reported from Singapore. The differences between the two tropical islands have significant implications for the epidemiology of dengue. Reduced access to blood meals and lower vector densities, particularly of Ae. aegypti, resulting from the restrictions on movement of people, are suggested to have contributed to the lower dengue incidence in Sri Lanka.

This may also occur inside host cells. Viral proteinases are produced during propagation inside host cells to supply amino acids for rapid synthesis of viral proteins, and/or to split poly-protein molecules into single protein molecules, e.g., capside, and matrix and/or envelope proteins. In host cells the most profound, microbial proteinase-mediated effect is thought to be damage of the mitochondria, the site of oxidative energy generation. Two major effects can be imagined: (i) damage of proteinase-susceptible extra-mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins (razor blade effect), e.g., of mitochondrial transport proteins and of ATP:ADP translocase, and (ii) damage of intra-mitochondrial proteinase-susceptible proteins that are involved in the energy-generating processes. Although proteinases are not thought to invade and destroy mitochondria and essential intra-mitochondrial structures involved in energy generation, they can destroy non-mitochondrial encoded mitochondrial proteins during transport to the mitochondria, i.e., before incorporation inside the mitochondria in intra-mitochondrial structures. A secondary effect may be damage of liver cells that effect hepatic gluconeogenesis, the process that is involved in the synthesis of glucose from lactic acid. The proteinase may bring about inactivation of specific gluconeogenesis enzymes. This means that accumulated amounts of lactic acid cannot rapidly be reduced and consequently, such inactivation will increase intracellular and later even systemic acidification that may finally result in death. We postulate that both direct and indirect proteinase-mediated damage of mitochondria and gluconeogenesis enzymes, and consequently of human cellular energy generation, is an essential element in acute (e.g., influenza) and chronic (e.g., hepatitis B) intracellular infections.","output":"Microbial proteinase inside human cells as anti-mitochondrial activity: A new virulence factor in infectious diseases?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Despite being an issue of global impact, the public policy strategies in fighting this pandemic depend on each country. This scenario demands studies to describe and explore these policies' institutionality. In this context, a question raises on how the biggest economies of the Portuguese language, Brazil and Portugal, have conducted the public policy agenda against the pandemic. METHODS: A comparative, qualitative, and descriptive study of the public policy agenda setting in Brazil and Portugal to fight against the pandemic was conducted through bibliographic and document research. The theoretical axis adopted was the Institutional Economy and the elaborations and management of public policy, mainly Douglas North, Geoffrey M. Hodgson, and Amatya Sens studies. RESULTS: The combat against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was translated in a search for urgency analytical theories, elaboration, implementation, and evaluation of public policies in Brazil and Portugal. In both countries, social restriction strategies were adopted such as closing public places, stores, and schools. Also, some economic actions were established to mitigate these restrictions impacts, more limited in Brazil as a neoliberal picture of the current government.

Given the sharply increased infection rate, the number of pregnant women and children with COVID-19 is correspondingly on the rise. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through droplets; though hypothesized, other transmission routes have not been confirmed. As of now, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be transmitted from the mother to the fetus. METHOD: This study examines the medical records of 30 neonates born to women with COVID-19, the objective being to provide documented information on maternal-child transmission and infant outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the 30 newborns, 28 had negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2; among their mothers, fifteen had fever, nine had cough and twenty had delivered by cesarean section. The median birth term was 37wk2dy, and twenty of the neonates were male. Most of them were asymptomatic, except for the three who presented with shortness of breath. Two of them were intubated and both died, the first because of severe sepsis and the second due to severe hyaline membrane disease. As regards the two infected neonates, the first represents a probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears unlikely in the second case. The outcome for both of them was good, without any complications. CONCLUSION: Maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 virus was not detected in the majority of the reported cases, although two of 30 neonates had positive qRT-PCR test results.

Because timely diagnosis and treatment are essential, especially for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) with fast-growing tumours in a functionally and aesthetically important area, we wished to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HNC care in the Netherlands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This population-based study covered all, in total 8468, newly diagnosed primary HNC cases in the Netherlands in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We compared incidence, patient and tumour characteristics, primary treatment characteristics, and time-to-treatment in the first COVID-19 year 2020 with corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019 (i.e. pre-COVID). RESULTS: The incidence of HNC was nearly 25% less during the first wave (n=433) than in 2019 (n=595) and 2018 (n=598). In April and May 2020, the incidence of oral cavity and laryngeal carcinomas was significantly lower than in pre-COVID years. There were no shifts in tumour stage or alterations in initial treatment modalities. Regardless of the first treatment modality and specific period, the median number of days between first visit to a HNC centre and start of treatment was significantly shorter during the COVID-19 year (26 C 28 days) than pre-COVID (31 C 32 days, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of HNC during the Netherlands first COVID-19 wave was significantly lower than expected. The expected increase in incidence during the remainder of 2020 was not observed.

A significant problem with this virus is its high transmission power. Asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. The aim of this review is to examine orthodontic emergencies and the necessary strategies and measures for emergency and nonemergency treatment during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: The following databases were comprehensively searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Up-to-date data released by major health organizations such as the World Health Organization and major orthodontic associations involved in the pandemic were also evaluated. RESULTS: Few studies were conducted on managing orthodontic offices or clinics during the pandemic, and most are not of high quality. Appropriate communication is the most important issue in managing orthodontic patients, particularly virtual counseling. Many orthodontic emergencies can be managed in this way by patients themselves. Most studies recommend using the filtering facepiece 2 masks, equivalent to N95 masks for non-COVID-19 patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures and all suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in orthodontic visits. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, there are no definitive clinical protocols supported by robust evidence for orthodontic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Orthodontists should not rush to return to routine orthodontic work and should follow state guidelines.

In this work, a facile and sustainable strategy was employed to synthesise nitrogen doped carbon dots from Terminalia chebula via hydrothermal treatment with a quantum yield of 19.9%. The structural and optical properties of nitrogen doped carbon dots (N-CDs) were studied by UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The surface functional groups, average particle size and elemental analysis were assessed with the help of Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis respectively. The N-CDs exhibited excitation dependent emission upon irradiation with UV light, pH stability over neutral range and excellent photostability. The average particle size of the synthesised N-CDs was found to be 3.56 nm. The fluorescence intensity of the N-CDs quenched linearly with increase in concentration of Fe3+ ions. The limit of detection (LOD) of N-CDs with Fe3+ ions was calculated to be 4.5 nM using Stern-Volmer plot. The fluorescence was restored by addition of EDTA to Fe3+ coordinated N-CD system. Further, the synthesised N-CDs interacted with ct-DNA through intercalative mode and the binding constant calculated using the Benesi Hildebrand plot was 1.78  108 mg/mL. The cytotoxicity of N-CDs was evaluated using MTT assay. The excellent biocompatible and less toxic nature of N-CDs was extrapolated to serve as fluorescent probes for imaging E.coli and SKMEL cells.

RESULTS School loneliness increased 2012-2018 in 36 out of 37 countries. Worldwide, nearly twice as many adolescents in 2018 (vs. 2012) had elevated levels of school loneliness. Increases in loneliness were larger among girls than among boys and in countries with full measurement invariance. In multi-level modeling analyses, school loneliness was high when smartphone access and internet use were high. In contrast, higher unemployment rates predicted lower school loneliness. Income inequality, GDP, and total fertility rate (family size) were not significantly related to school loneliness when matched by year. School loneliness was positively correlated with negative affect and negatively correlated with positive affect and life satisfaction, suggesting the measure has broad implications for adolescent well-being.

Comorbidities have been reported to be risk factors for the complications of COVID-19. In this work, we develop and analyze a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 infection in order to assess the impacts of prior comorbidity on COVID-19 complications and COVID-19 re-infection. The model is simulated using data relevant to the dynamics of the diseases in Lagos, Nigeria, making predictions for the attainment of peak periods in the presence or absence of comorbidity. The model is shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation caused by the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles as well as the rate of re-infection by those who have recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Sensitivity analysis of the model when the population of individuals co-infected with COVID-19 and comorbidity is used as response function revealed that the top ranked parameters that drive the dynamics of the co-infection model are the effective contact rate for COVID-19 transmission, {beta}cv, the parameter accounting for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 by comorbid susceptibles, {chi}cm, the comorbidity development rate, {theta}cm, the detection rate for singly infected and co-infected individuals, {eta}1 and {eta}2, as well as the recovery rate from COVID-19 for co-infected individuals, {phi}i2. Simulations of the model reveal that the cumulative confirmed cases (without comorbidity) may get up to 180,000 after 200 days, if the hyper susceptibility rate of comorbid susceptibles is as high as 1.2 per day. Also, the cumulative confirmed cases (including those co-infected with comorbidity) may be as high as 1000,000 cases by the end of November, 2020 if the re-infection rates for COVID-19 is 0.1 per day. It may be worse than this if the re-infection rates increase higher. Moreover, if policies are strictly put in place to step down the probability of COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles to as low as 0.4 per day and step up the detection rate for singly infected individuals to 0.7 per day, then the reproduction number can be brought very low below one, and COVID-19 infection eliminated from the population. In addition, optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model reveal that the the strategy that prevents COVID-19 infection by comorbid susceptibles has the least ICER and is the most cost-effective of all the control strategies for the prevention of COVID-19.","output":"Analysis of COVID-19 and comorbidity co-infection Model with Optimal Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on individual differences in facing the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be crucial in order to design diverse and highly effective intervention strategies This study uses a sample of 302 North American participants who were recruited through the crowdsourcing platform ProA;different profiles were established, profiling variables of interest in facing the COVID-19 outbreak Socio-demographic and psychological (personality traits, gratitude, life purpose, and religiosity) variables were explored These results are of interest if we want to deepen the study of individual differences at both a theoretical and applied level","output":"Individual Differences Facing the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Age, Gender, Personality, and Positive Psychology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Code-mixing on social media is a trend in many countries where people speak multiple languages, such as India, where Hindi and English are major communication languages.

The primary outcome was death from any cause at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included functional outcome at 6 months as assessed with the modified Rankin scale. Prespecified subgroups were defined according to sex, age, initial cardiac rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, and presence or absence of shock on admission. Prespecified adverse events were pneumonia, sepsis, bleeding, arrhythmia resulting in hemodynamic compromise, and skin complications related to the temperature management device. RESULTS: A total of 1850 patients were evaluated for the primary outcome. At 6 months, 465 of 925 patients (50%) in the hypothermia group had died, as compared with 446 of 925 (48%) in the normothermia group (relative risk with hypothermia, 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.14; P = 0.37).

Our aim was to prospectively assess effects of chest irradiation, bleomycin administration, and other factors on lung function in the treatment of patients with HL. Methods: Pulmonary function of newly diagnosed HL patients was assessed via a St. George Respiratory Questionnaire, dynamic inhalation lung scintigraphy, spirometry, and an assessment of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) before, during, and after treatment. Results: This prospective study was conducted at the University of Debrecen. The study included 84 patients with classical HL. Most patients received standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy. Both intramuscular and intravenous administrations of bleomycin were used. Brentuximab vedotin combination chemotherapy was administered to 12 patients. Mediastinal involved-field irradiation therapy (IFRT) was used to treat 16 patients. Lung scintigraphy revealed pulmonary toxicity more sensitively than DLCO. Intravenous bleomycin administration decreased diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid clearance. Intramuscular bleomycin had the lowest level of pulmonary toxicity among considered treatments. Currently used, mediastinal IFRT had a lower level of pulmonary toxicity than bleomycin. The current prospective evaluation confirmed previous results that determined that cumulative bleomycin dose and administration are major risk factors for pulmonary toxicity, while the currently used treatment method, mediastinal irradiation, was determined to be relatively safe for treating for HL patients.

Recently, we have shown that the mouse model of predator odor trauma (POT) displayed contextual conditioning and core features of PTSD including sleep disturbances (hyperarousal) and retrieval of traumatic memories following exposure to objective reminders (re-experiencing). PTSD is a disorder of memory function. Since memory consolidation requires the expression of BDNF along with an activation of MAPK/pERK signaling pathway in limbic brain structures (hippocampus and amygdala) and sleep favors memory consolidation, we hypothesized that short-term sleep deprivation (SD, 3 hours), immediately after contextual conditioning will attenuate molecular correlates of memory consolidation, sleep disturbances, and memory consolidation. We performed two experiments in adult male C57BL/6J mice to test our hypothesis. Experiment 1 determined the effects of SD on contextual conditioning and changes in sleep wakefulness. Experiment 2 determined the effects of SD on contextual conditioning-induced changes in the expression of BDNF and pERK in hippocampus and amygdala.

During the COVID19 pandemic in Mexico, many doctors were attacked indicating their lack of vocation and professionalism, even though the patient had not dealt with the doctor at any time. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the perception of the professionalism of doctors by the population of the Veracruz-Boca del Ro MATERIAL AND METHODS: A quantitative study was carried out with a non-experimental, observational, analytical and cross-sectional research design We include men and women between the ages of 20 and 70, residents of Veracruz, Mexico. A virtual survey was carried out to identify the attitudes that patients consider to be unprofessional in doctors, however, all the attitudes evaluated were actions that the doctor performs outside of his working hours or that he registers in his personal social networks. RESULTS: 1339 subjects were included, with an average age of 33.6 ( 12.7). The use of vulgar language (30.9%), publication in social networks against feminism (36.2%) or sexual content (73.3%) is perceived as unprofessional for both sexes. Regarding female doctors, 34.5% of patients indicate as unprofessional the publication of alcohol on social networks (34.5%), being at an informal party (29.6%) or smoking tobacco (34.2%), while for a male doctor the publication in social networks of drinking alcohol (40%) or being in an informal party (36.1%) consider it unprofessional. Less than 20% of those surveyed consider their position on cannabis use, feminism or abortion, type of clothing, sedentary lifestyle, religion, age, tobacco or alcohol consumption unprofessional in their daily life.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinicians views of the ReSPECT process was unknown. We examined whether there were changes in clinicians knowledge, skills, and attitudes regarding ReSPECT during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of clinicians at one acute hospital in the UK. We developed a questionnaire with a defined 5-point Likert scale and asked clinicians to recall their pre-pandemic views on ReSPECT and report their current views at the time of survey distribution (May 2020, end of the first COVID-19 wave in the UK). We compared their self-reported views before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: We analysed 171 questionnaire responses. Clinicians reported ReSPECT telephone discussions with relatives were more challenging (pre-pandemic median 4, IQR 3-4; during pandemic median 4, IQR 4-5; p <0.001) and negative emotions whilst conducting these discussions with relatives increased during the pandemic (pre-pandemic median 3, IQR 2-3.5; during pandemic median 3, IQR 2-4; p < 0.001).

METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal procedures from 1991 to 2005 were analyzed from a longitudinal prospectively collected database. All patients referred to the four surgeons involved in this study were offered a minimally invasive approach. Patient characteristics, perioperative variables, and surgeon experience data were analyzed and compared. RESULTS A total of 991 consecutive laparoscopic colorectal procedures were studied. The majority of operations were performed for malignant disease (n=526, 53%), and most frequently consisted of segmental colonic resections (n=718, 72%). A total of 85 patients (8.6%) had an IOC. Patients experiencing an IOC had a significantly higher median body weight (75 versus 68 kg, p=0.0047) and had a higher proportion of previous abdominal surgery (31% versus 20%, p=0.029). Only 39% of patients suffering an IOC required conversion to open surgery. A total of 126 (13%) cases were converted to open surgery. On multivariable analysis, previous abdominal surgery [odds ratio (OR) 3.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-8.35, p=0.0076] was independently associated with having an IOC and a conversion to open within the same procedure. With increasing experience, individual surgeons were found to operate on heavier patients (p=0.025), and on patients who had a higher rate of previous intra-abdominal surgery (p<0.0001). Despite these risk factors, the early and late experience demonstrated no significant difference in terms of IOCs (p=0.54) and conversion to open surgery (p=0.40). CONCLUSIONS The majority of IOCs can be managed laparoscopically. With increasing experience surgeons can perform laparoscopic colorectal surgery on a patient population with a greater proportion of previous abdominal surgery and a higher mean body weight without adversely affecting their rates of intraoperative complications or conversion.","output":"Does experience with laparoscopic colorectal surgery influence intraoperative outcomes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To support the deployment of serology assays for population screening during the COVID-19 pandemic, we compared the performance of three fully automated SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays: Mindray CL-900i&reg;(target: spike [S] and nucleocapsid [N]), BioM&eacute;rieux VIDAS&reg;3 (target: receptor-binding domain [RBD]) and Diasorin LIAISON&reg;XL (target: S1 and S2 subunits) A total of 111 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR- positive samples collected at &ge;21 days post symptom onset, and 127 pre-pandemic control samples were included Diagnostic performance was assessed in correlation to RT-PCR and a surrogate virus-neutralizing test (sVNT) Moreover, cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies was investigated Compared to RT-PCR, LIAISON&reg;XL showed the highest overall specificity (100%), followed by VIDAS&reg;3 (98 4%) and CL-900i&reg;(95 3%) The highest sensitivity was demonstrated by CL-900i&reg;(90 1%), followed by VIDAS&reg;3 (88 3%) and LIAISON&reg;XL (85 6%) The sensitivity of all assays was higher in symptomatic patients (91 1&ndash;98 2%) compared to asymptomatic patients (78 4&ndash;80 4%) In correlation to sVNT, all assays showed excellent sensitivities (92 2&ndash;96 1%) In addition, VIDAS&reg;3 demonstrated the best correlation (r = 0 75) with the sVNT The present study provides insights on the performance of three fully automated assays, which could help diagnostic laboratories in the choice of a particular assay according to the intended use","output":"Diagnostic Efficiency of Three Fully Automated Serology Assays and Their Correlation with a Novel Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 Individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between two rapid detection tests (RDT) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.","output":"Prospects for detecting early warning signals in discrete event sequence data: Application to epidemiological incidence data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is necessary to assess the cellular, molecular, and pathogenetic characteristics of COVID-19 and attention is required to understand highly effective gene targets and mechanisms.

The data set consists of MCF7 which is a human breast cancer cell line with estrogen, progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. The cell lines treated with different quantities of Cissampelos pareira (Cipa). Cipa is a traditional medicinal plant which would possess an antiviral potency in preventing viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Utilizing Biobase, GEOquery, gplots packages in R studio, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The gene ontology (GO) of pathway enrichments employed by utilizing DAVID and KEGG enrichment analyses were studied. We further constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed, based upon that, a subnetwork module analysis for significant signaling pathways. RESULTS: The study identified 418 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics tools. The gene ontology of pathway enrichments employed by GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs were studied. Gene expression analysis utilizing gene ontology and KEGG results uncovered biological and signaling pathways such as cell adhesion molecules, plasma membrane adhesion molecules, synapse assembly, and Interleukin-3-mediated signaling which are mostly linked to COVID-19.

Dynapenia was identified according to six recognized criteria sets. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.2  4.7 kg/m(2), with a prevalence of overweight (BMI > 25 and < 30 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI  30 kg/m(2)) of 35% and 37%, respectively. FFM and SM were greater in males, whereas percentage body fat was higher in women. HGS was higher and declined with age slightly more rapidly in men, showing a stronger correlation with FFM and SM. Dynapenia prevalence ranged from 20.6 to 56.9%, depending on the criteria used, and was more frequent in older patients and advanced disease. Dynapenia is highly prevalent in IPF. HGS is a promising proxy marker of muscle function to be used in clinical evaluation and follow-up programs.","output":"Dynapenia is highly prevalent in older patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previously we observed that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was able to instantly convert recombinant murine prion protein (moPrP) from an alpha-helical to a beta-sheet enriched state.

Results showed that moPrP alone affected the expression of genes related to both toll-like receptor (TLR)- and nod-like receptor (NLR)-signaling as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. moPrP induced a strong antibacterial response with Slpi mRNA over expression (> 9-fold). Combination of moPrP with D-LPS on the mucosal side of the colon induced genes associated with TLR-signaling, apoptosis, and a very strong antibacterial response (> 35-fold Slpi expression). Administration of moPrP on the mucosal side and D-LPS on the serosal side triggered expression of 12 genes related to TLR signaling, apoptosis, and antibacterial responses, as illustrated by overexpression of Slpi by >30-fold. The over expression of Slpi mRNA was further reaffirmed by ELISA and when moPrP was added to the mucosal side and D-LPS on the serosal side, an increased Slpi protein was observed. Application of combined moPrP and D-LPS on the mucosal side significantly increased the Slpi protein.

METHODS: We propose practical methods for a combined design within the platform trial paradigm where some interventions are not expected to interact and could be given together. RESULTS: We describe the combined design and suggest diagrams that can be used to represent it. Many properties are common both to standard factorial designs, including the need to consider interactions between interventions and the impact of intervention efficacy on power of other comparisons, and to standard multi-arm multi-stage designs, including the need to pre-specify procedures for starting and stopping intervention comparisons. We also identify some specific features of the factorial-MAMS design: timing of interim and final analyses should be determined by calendar time or total observed events; some non-factorial modifications may be useful; eligibility criteria should be broad enough to include any patient eligible for any part of the randomisation; stratified randomisation may conveniently be performed sequentially; and analysis requires special care to use only concurrent controls. CONCLUSION: A combined factorial-MAMS design can combine the efficiencies of factorial trials and multi-arm multi-stage platform trials.

METHODS: Apixaban and rivaroxaban anti-Xa assays ordered within our hospital system from May 2016 to September 2019 were evaluated. The primary outcome was major bleeding events defined by International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. Median anti-Xa levels for each FXaI were calculated for those with and without major bleeding, as well as those who did and did not receive reversal agents. RESULTS: A total of 606 anti-Xa levels were analyzed. There were 146 major bleeding events documented, with the most common site being intracranial (63%). Median anti-Xa levels in patients with and without major bleeding were similar, whereas those on apixaban therapy who received reversal agents typically had higher anti-Xa levels (73 ng/mL vs. 153 ng/mL, p = 0.0019). Factors significantly associated with increased odds of bleeding were an age > 80 years, inappropriately high dosing regimens, and modest anti-Xa levels (100C300 ng/mL) for rivaroxaban specifically.

To stem the tide of this pandemic, there was acceleration of the development, testing and prelicensure approval for emergency use of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a sceptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs become critical to the success of vaccination endeavours. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey study. An online questionnaire will be distributed to all current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. No sampling strategy will be employed. The survey questionnaire will consist of demographic questions (consisting of six items) and vaccine confidence questions (comprising six items in Likert scale format). Log binomial models will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CI. Statistical significance will be defined at a p value <0.05.

Untreated depression has negative impacts on patients with neurological disorders, including intensification of pain, increase in symptomatology, impaired quality of life, and nonadherence to treatment. Nonadherence can lead to disease progression, resulting in poor outcomes. Early detection of depression and prompt intervention can substantially impact the mortality, morbidity, and disease burden of this at-risk population. The American Academy of Neurology recommends screening for neurological disease-specific depression comorbidities, while the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine depression screening for the general adult population. However, fewer than 5% of adults are screened in primary care, and as many as 50% of patients remain undiagnosed without a standardized program. Specialty neurology clinic visits could be a point of screening for high-risk neurology patients to positively affect outcomes. A review of the literature supports using a validated tool such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to screen for depression in outpatient settings. This quality improvement project was implemented at a private neurology practice that currently has no formalized protocol to identify depressive symptomatology. The PHQ-9 was integrated into the review of systems for patients meeting inclusion criteria with the aim of screening 90% of patients and referring 90% of those who screen positive to mental health services. Descriptive data were used to evaluate current practice status and indications for change. A total of 476 patients were seen during the time frame for this quality improvement inquiry. There were 100 patients excluded related to cognitive impairment for a sample total of n = 376. Over a period of 30 days, the goal was to screen 90% of patients. Despite challenges related to the impact of COVID-19 on the practice's delivery of care, 83.2% of patients received screening, which was 92% of our goal. Of those screened and diagnosed with depression, 100% were referred to a mental health provider, thereby exceeding the goal. An unanticipated outcome was that 46.3% of patients diagnosed with depression declined a referral to mental health.

Transcranial direct current stimulations of the dlPFC (tDCS) and heart-rate variability biofeedback (BFB) are known to regulate emotional processes. However, the effect of these interventions applied either alone or concomitantly during an anticipatory stress remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE The study investigated the effect of anodal tDCS and BFB, alone or combined, on psychophysiological stress responses and cognitive functioning. METHODS Following a stress anticipation induction, 80 participants were randomized into four groups and subjected to a 15-min intervention: neutral video viewing (ctrl), left dlPFC anodal tDCS (tdcs), heart-rate variability biofeedback (bfb), or a combined treatment (bfb + tdcs). Participants were then immediately confronted with the stressor, which was followed by an assessment of executive functions. Psychophysiological stress responses were assessed throughout the experiment (heart rate, heart-rate variability, salivary cortisol). RESULTS The tdcs did not modulate stress responses. Compared with both ctrl and tdcs interventions, bfb reduced physiological stress and improved executive functions after the stressor. The main finding revealed that bfb + tdcs was the most effective intervention, yielding greater reduction in psychological (P = 0.038) and physiological stress responses than bfb (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Combining preventive tDCS with BFB is a relevant interventional approach to reduce psychophysiological stress responses, hence offering a new and non-invasive treatment of stress-related disorders.

This study aimed to determine the genetic variations in cytokines and their receptors in relation to COVID-19 pathogenesis using bioinformatic tools. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes encoding the cytokines and cytokine receptors elevated in patients with COVID-19 were determined from the National Biotechnology Information Center website (using the dbSNP database). Missense variants were found in 3 cytokine genes and 10 cytokine receptor genes. Computational analyses were conducted to detect the effects of these missense SNPs via cloud-based software tools. Also, the miRSNP database was used to explore whether SNPs in the 3'-UTR altered the miRNA binding efficiency for genes of cytokines and their receptors. Our in silico studies revealed that one SNP in the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) gene was predicted as deleterious using sorting intolerant from tolerant. Also, the stability of VEGFR2 decreased in the I-Mutant2.0 (biotool for predicting stability changes upon mutation from the protein sequence or structure) prediction. It was suggested that the decrease in VEGFR2 function (due to the rs1870377 polymorphism) may be correlated with the progression of COVID-19 or contribute to the pathogenesis. Moreover, 27 SNPs were determined to affect miRNA binding for the genes of cytokine receptors. CXCR2 rs1126579, TNFRSF1B rs1061624 and IL10RB rs8178562 SNPs were predicted to break the miRNA-mRNA binding sites for miR-516a-3, miR-720 and miR-328, respectively.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance research database. A total of 1141 ACO patients aged 65 years during 2005C2011 were observed and followed for 2 years. The Bice and Boxerman COC index (COCI) was used to evaluate COC by considering ambulatory care visits duo to COPD or asthma in the first year; ED visits and hospitalization for COPD or asthma were identified in the subsequent year, respectively. The COCI was divided into three levels (COCI < 0.3= low, 0.3  COCI<1=medium, COCI = 1=high). The Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for ED visits and hospital admissions due to COPD or asthma. RESULTS: The average COCI was 0.55. 21.3% patients received outpatient care from a single physician. Compared to patients with high COC, those with low and medium COC had a higher risk of ED visits (aHR = 2.80 and 2.69, P < .01) and admissions (aHR = 1.80 and 1.72, P < .05).

Throughout the world, four systems capabilities are emerging that are important for societies to get ahead of the virus and become COVID-19 ready. First: understand the pattern of infection locally and act on it effectively: assess the status of the outbreak; act rapidly and robustly to interrupt transmission. Second: enable people to be active participants in their own responses. Third: focus on the places where people are most at risk of infection. Fourth: assess the performance of responses to COVID-19 infection: detecting cases, interrupting chains of transmission, minimizing adverse consequences, protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and well-being for all, leaving no-one behind. These four capabilities are being woven together within societies: successful weaving can be helped through focusing on three interlinked elements: making information available; assessing and reducing risk; and being able to suppress outbreaks rapidly. This means involving everyone in the response and having strong public health defences.

Aggressive source control measures during the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to re-purposed use of noncontact infrared thermometry (NCIT) for temperature screening. This study was commissioned to establish the efficacy of this technology for temperature screening by healthcare facilities. We conducted a prospective, observational, single-center study in a level II trauma center at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to assess (i) method agreement between NCIT and temporal artery reference temperature, (ii) diagnostic accuracy of NCIT in detecting referent temperature [Formula: see text] and ensuing test sensitivity and specificity and (iii) technical limitations of this technology. Of 51 healthy, non-febrile, healthcare workers surveyed, the mean temporal artery temperature was [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text] confidence interval (CI) = [Formula: see text] ).

METHODS: 227 pneumonia patients who visited the fever clinics in Shanghai General Hospital and 97 hospitalized COVID-19 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center were involved in a retrospective research study. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. The trend of EOS level in COVID-19 patients and comparison among patients with different severity were summarized. RESULTS: The majority of COVID-19 patients (71.7%) had a decrease in circulating EOS counts, which was significantly more frequent than other types of pneumonia patients. EOS counts had good value for COVID-19 prediction, even higher when combined with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Patients with low EOS counts at admission were more likely to have fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath, with more lesions in chest CT and radiographic aggravation, and longer length of hospital stay and course of disease than those with normal EOS counts. Circulating EOS level gradually increased over the time, and was synchronous with the improvement in chest CT (12 days vs 13 days, P = .07), later than that of body temperature (12 days vs 10 days, P = .014), but earlier than that of the negative conversion of nucleic acid assays (12 days vs 17 days, P = .001).

Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) slowing has been associated previously with postoperative delirium, but the relationship between intraoperative EEG suppression and postoperative delirium has not been investigated. METHODS In this observational cohort study, 727 adult patients who received general anesthesia with planned intensive care unit admission were included. Duration of intraoperative EEG suppression was recorded from a frontal EEG channel (FP1 to F7). Delirium was assessed twice daily on postoperative days 1 through 5 with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit. Thirty days after surgery, quality of life, functional independence, and cognitive ability were measured using the Veterans RAND 12-item survey, the Barthel index, and the PROMIS Applied Cognition-Abilities-Short Form 4a survey. RESULTS Postoperative delirium was observed in 162 (26%) of 619 patients assessed. When we compared patients with no EEG suppression with those divided into quartiles based on duration of EEG suppression, patients with more suppression were more likely to experience delirium ((4) = 25, P < 0.0001). This effect remained significant after we adjusted for potential confounders (odds ratio for log(EEG suppression) 1.22 [99% confidence interval, 1.06-1.40, P = 0.0002] per 1-minute increase in suppression). EEG suppression may have been associated with reduced functional independence (Spearman partial correlation coefficient -0.15, P = 0.02) but not with changes in quality of life or cognitive ability. Predictors of EEG suppression included greater end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration and lower intraoperative opioid dose. CONCLUSIONS EEG suppression is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium.

In recent years, the Full Matrix Capture (FMC) technique has been implemented to extract the signals for post-processing to form an image. The inherent anisotropy and the layering of the structure pose challenges for the interpretation of this FMC data. To overcome this challenge, modeling techniques are required that take into account the diffraction caused by finite-size transducers and the response of the structure to these bounded beams. Existing models either homogenize the entire structure, use computationally expensive finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods, or do not consider the shape of the bounded beam, which is used to test such structures. This paper proposes a modeling technique based on combining the Multi-Gaussian beam model with the recursive stiffness matrix method to simulate the FMC signals for layered anisotropic media. The paper provides the steps required for the modeling technique, the extraction of the system efficiency factor, and validation of the model with experimentally determined signals for aluminum as an isotropic material such as aluminum and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) laminate as a layered material.

Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing/sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing. Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here, we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We develop and deploy improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater. We detect emerging variants of concern up to 14 days earlier in wastewater samples, and identify multiple instances of virus spread not captured by clinical genomic surveillance.

The MOF was synthesized via a new synthesis method previously developed by our group and immobilized on paper membrane to be used in solid-phase extraction (SPE) device. Different metal ions were anchored by MOF to screen out the adsorbent with the best affinity.

To deeply understand the adsorption mechanisms, quantum calculation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation were both applied. The experimental and in-silico results together demonstrated that the as-prepared MOF adsorbent possessed high affinity and fast dynamics. The established SPE-based liquid chromatography (LC) method worked well in the range of 10-1000 ng/mL, with only 3 mg of adsorbent per device and 5 mL sample needed, and no mass spectrometer (MS) included, which was very efficient compared to commercial adsorbents.

The result is that SME managers must manage their firms through a crisis under very challenging conditions. The purpose of the present paper is to address how SME managers respond in the second wave of COVID-19 based on their perceived uncertainty as well as eventual learning from the first wave in early 2020. Design/methodology/approach: Four hypotheses are presented, resulting in a theoretical model relating crisis impact, uncertainty, learning from crisis experience and effectuation behaviour. The theoretical model is tested through an empirical questionnaire-based quantitative study of Norwegian SMEs in the bar and restaurant sector, applying structural equation modelling as the analytical technique. Findings: The results show that impact from COVID-19 leads to both uncertainty and learning and further that uncertainty primarily leads to a focus on affordable loss while learning leads to experimentation behaviour. Originality/value: The present paper is novel in several ways. First, it empirically studies a unique situation where a crisis encompasses two waves of significant impact on the firms in focus. This provides the opportunity to address managers' learning through a crisis for application in a very similar situation later. Second, the present paper provides an empirically supported model of how uncertainty or learning leads to different dimensions of effectuation behaviour in a crisis situation. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"SME managers' learning from crisis and effectual behaviour"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The greatest challenge the world is facing today is to win the battle against COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible. Until a vaccine is available, personal protection, social distancing, and disinfection are the main tools against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is quite infectious, the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is an enveloped virus that is relatively fragile because its protective fatty layer is sensitive to heat, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals. However, heat and liquid treatments can damage some materials, and ultraviolet light is not efficient in shaded areas, so other disinfection alternatives are required to allow safe re-utilization of materials and spaces. As of this writing, evidences are still accumulating for the use of ozone gas as a disinfectant for sanitary materials and ambient disinfection in indoor areas. This paper reviews the most relevant results of virus disinfection by the application of gaseous ozone. The review covers disinfection treatments of both air and surfaces carried out in different volumes, which varies from small boxes and controlled chambers to larger rooms, as a base to develop future ozone protocols against COVID-19. Published papers have been critically analyzed to evaluate trends in the required ozone dosages, as a function of relative humidity (RH), contact time, and viral strains. The data have been classified depending on the disinfection objective and the volume and type of the experimental set-up. Based on these data, conservative dosages and times to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 are estimated. In small chambers, 10C20 mg ozone/m(3) over 10 to 50 min can be sufficient to significantly reduce the virus load of personal protection equipment. In large rooms, 30 to 50 mg ozone/m(3) would be required for treatments of 20C30 min. Maximum antiviral activity of ozone is achieved at high humidity, while the same ozone concentrations under low RH could result inefficient. At these ozone levels, safety protocols must be strictly followed. These data can be used for reducing significantly the viral load although for assuring a safe disinfection, the effective dosages under different conditions need to be confirmed with experimental data.","output":"Ozone potential to fight against SAR-COV-2 pandemic: facts and research needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Psychological Science Accelerator's Rapid-Response COVID-19 Project (PSACR) aimed to rapidly select and conduct rigorous, multi-site, and multinational research to understand the psychological and behavioral aspects of the COVID-19 crisis.

For diagnostic and for didactic purposes, standardized and reliable tests suitable to assess the competencies involved in working hygienically are required. However, existing tests usually use self-report questionnaires, which are suboptimal for this purpose. In the present study, we introduce the newly developed, competence-oriented HygiKo test instrument focusing health-care professionals hygiene competence and report empirical evidence regarding its psychometric properties. METHODS: HygiKo is a Situational Judgement Test (SJT) to assess hygiene competence. The HygiKo-test consists of twenty pictures (items), each item presents only one unambiguous hygiene lapse. For each item, test respondents are asked (1) whether they recognize a problem in the picture with respect to hygiene guidelines and, (2) if yes, to describe the problem in a short verbal response. Our sample comprised n = 149 health care professionals (79.1 % female; age: M = 26.7 years, SD = 7.3 years) working as clinicians or nurses. The written responses were rated by two independent raters with high agreement ( > 0.80), indicating high reliability of the measurement. We used Item Response Theory (IRT) for further data analysis. RESULTS: We report IRT analyses that show that the HygiKo-test is suitable to assess hygiene competence and that it allows to distinguish between persons demonstrating different levels of ability for seventeen of the twenty items), especially for the range of low to medium person abilities. Hence, the HygiKo-SJT is suitable to get a reliable and competence-oriented measure for hygiene-competence. CONCLUSIONS: In its present form, the HygiKo-test can be used to assess the hygiene competence of medical students, medical doctors, nurses and trainee nurses in cross-sectional measurements. In order to broaden the difficulty spectrum of the current test, additional test items with higher difficulty should be developed. The Situational Judgement Test designed to assess hygiene competence can be helpful in testing and teaching the ability of working hygienically.

METHODS: Data were analysed on kidney transplant, dialysis and waitlisted patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (naso-pharyngeal swab PCR) between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 together with meta-analysis of 16 studies. RESULTS: 23/1494 kidney transplant patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 123/1278 haemodialysis patients (1.5% vs 9.6%, p<0.001), 12/253 waitlisted patients (1.5% vs 4.7%, p=0.002). 19 required hospital admission, 6 died and 13 developed AKI. Overall case fatality ratio was 26.1% compared to patients on haemodialysis (27.6%, p=0.99) and waitlisted patients (8.3%, p=0.38). Within our entire cohort, 0.4% of transplant patients died compared to 0.4% of waitlisted patients and 2.7% of haemodialysis patients. Patients who died were older [Alive (median 71years) vs. Dead (median 59years), p=0.01].

The quality of heat-fused thermoplastic interfaces is of great concern for adhesion, coating, and welding applications, especially those between dissimilar materials. Kinetic evolution of the microstructures defines the mechanical performance of heat-fusion thermoplastic interfaces, which is studied here using polyethylene and polypropylene as an example. Key factors such as the viscosity and compatibility of polymers and the time and temperature of fusion are discussed by combining molecular-level simulations and structural-level hot-compression experiments. Inter-diffusion and entanglement of polymer chains are identified as the two elementary kinetic steps of the fusion, which dominate the control on the stiffness and strength of the interfaces, respectively. Experimental data shows that the quality of fused interfaces can be improved by reducing the viscosity and the interaction parameter. Following the same set of time-scaling relations as identified in the simulations, the two-step characteristics and their effects on the stiffness and strength are experimentally validated. Both simulation and the experiment results show that Youngs modulus of fused interfaces recovers faster than the strength that is controlled by polymer entanglement to a large extent, rather than diffusion. These findings add insights into the design of fusion processes, laying the ground for the applications of thermoplastic polymers and composites.","output":"Two-step heat fusion kinetics and mechanical performance of thermoplastic interfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective, there has been a rise in vaccine hesitancy and refusal leading to increases in the incidence of communicable diseases.

Patterns of contact and proximity within groups were highly predictable based on gorillas age and sex. Disease transmission within groups was rapid with a median estimated basic reproductive number (R0) of 4.18 (min = 1.74, max = 9.42), and transmission was not predicted by the social network.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) and double difference () models were used to estimate pre-COVID-19 to initial COVID-19 pandemic period change (2019-2020) in cannabis use (monthly, weekly, daily) compared to 2018 to 2019 change to adjust for age-related effects. Models were adjusted for age of entry into the cohort and sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: In the SEM and  models, monthly, weekly, and daily cannabis use increased across all waves; however, the expected increases from the pre-COVID-19 wave (2019) to the initial COVID-19 period wave (2020) were lesser relative to the changes seen across the 2018 to 2019 waves. The cross-sectional data from May to July 2020 identified that the majority of youth who use cannabis did not report increased cannabis use due to COVID-19 or using cannabis to cope with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic period, there does not appear to be a detrimental effect on youth cannabis use, when adjusted for age-related changes. Further prospective research is needed to explore the impact of the ongoing pandemic response on youth cannabis use onset and progression.","output":"Examining the impact of the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic period on youth cannabis use: adjusted annual changes between the pre-COVID and initial COVID-lockdown waves of the COMPASS study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aqueous degradation of iopromide, an iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) compound, by the combination of UV(254) irradiation and potassium peroxydisulfate (K(2)S(2)O(8)) has been studied in laboratory scale experiments. The influence of various parameters on the performance of the treatment process has been considered, namely the UV irradiation light intensity, the initial concentrations of iopromide and peroxydisulfate, and the initial solution pH. Iopromide degradation increased with UV light intensity and peroxydisulfate concentration, but decreased with initial pH. Under specific conditions complete removal of iopromide was achieved within 30 min, and near-complete mineralisation (loss of solution TOC) within 80 min. Degradation was believed to be caused by a combination of direct photolysis, sulphate radical attack, and, to a minor degree, direct oxidation by peroxydisulfate. Approximate values for the reaction rate constants have been determined and found to be equal to 1C2  10(4) M(?1) s(?1) for sulfate radicals, and 1C2 M(?2) s(?1) for S(2)O(8)(2?). Overall compound degradation was observed to follow first-order kinetics where the rate constant decreased with initial solution pH.

Moreover, pulmonary surfactant lipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol, and pulmonary surfactant proteins, such as surfactant protein A and D, participate in the pulmonary host defense and modify immune responses. Emerging data have shown that pulmonary surfactant lipids modulate the inflammatory response and antiviral effects in some respiratory viral infections, and pulmonary surfactant lipids have shown promise for therapeutic applications in some respiratory viral infections.

The study was performed to evaluate occupational burnout, resilience, and parenting stress in nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Material and methods: This cross-sectional study was based on Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. A total of 630 nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in 5 hospitals were selected via convenience sampling. Participants completed the scales online. Data were analyzed in SPSS v. 22. Results: A total of 420 nurses completed and returned the questionnaires. The resilience mean score of the nurses who participated in the present study was 32.33 +/- 2.57 and the occupational burnout mean score was 32.33 +/- 2.57. Also, the parenting stress mean score of the 310 nurses who were married and had children was found to be 17.53 +/- 1.58 during the COVID-19 crisis. Occupational burnout has a negative correlation with resilience and a positive correlation with parenting stress and can predict 61.32% of changes in the occupational burnout variance of nurses Conclusions: Resilience, parenting stress, marital status, number of children, employment status, and gender predicted a high percentage of the nurses' occupational burnout variance.

Human milk bacterial profiles were assessed using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 19 HMOs were quantitated using high-performance liquid chromatography. Relative abundance of human milk bacterial taxa were significantly associated with concentrations of several fucosylated and sialylated HMOs. Individual human milk bacteria and HMO intakes and concentrations were also significantly associated with infant anthropometry, fat-free mass, and adiposity. Furthermore, when data were stratified based on maternal secretor status, some of these relationships differed significantly among infants born to secretor vs non-secretor mothers. In conclusion, in this pilot study the human milk bacterial profile and HMO intakes and concentrations were significantly associated with infant body composition, with associations modified by secretor status.

We study the implementation of a 20% capacity limit in retail facilities in the California Bay Area. Through a difference-in-differences analysis, we show that the intervention caused no material reduction in visits, using the same large-scale mobile device data on human movements (mobility data) originally used in the academic literature to support such limits. We show that the lack of effectiveness stems from a mismatch between the academic metric of capacity relative to peak visits and the policy metric of capacity relative to building code. The disconnect in metrics is amplified by mobility data losing predictive power after the early months of the pandemic, weakening the policy relevance of mobility-based interventions. Nonetheless, the data suggest that a better-grounded rationale for capacity limits is to reduce risk specifically during peak hours. To enhance the connection between science, policy, and public health in future times of crisis, we spell out 3 strategies: living models, coproduction, and shared metrics.

They have been advocated for use by the World Health Organisation to help control outbreaks and break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 infections. There are now several studies assessing their accuracy but as yet no systematic review. Our aims were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of LFDs in a systematic review and summarise the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. METHODS: A targeted search of Pubmed and Medxriv, using PRISMA principles, was conducted identifying clinical studies assessing the sensitivity and specificity of LFDs as their primary outcome compared to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Based on extracted data sensitivity and specificity was calculated for each study. Data was pooled based on manufacturer of LFD and split based on operator (self-swab or by trained professional) and sensitivity and specificity data were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers were identified involving over 26,000 test results. Sensitivity from individual studies ranged from 37.7% (95% CI 30.6C45.5) to 99.2% (95% CI 95.5C99.9) and specificity from 92.4% (95% CI 87.5C95.5) to 100.0% (95% CI 99.7C100.0). Operation of the test by a trained professional or by the test subject with self-swabbing produced comparable results. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified that the performance of lateral flow devices is heterogeneous and dependent on the manufacturer. Some perform with high specificity but a great range of sensitivities were shown (38.32C99.19%). Test performance does not appear dependent on the operator. Potentially, LFDs could support the scaling up of mass testing to aid track and trace methodology and break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 with the additional benefit of providing individuals with the results in a much shorter time frame.

It answers this affirmatively by first proposing, in Part I, what love should mean in policy formulation. However, as rationality remains highly prized in policy formulation, it considers emotion as prejudicial to its cool and level\\\\headed processes and assumes that human behaviour is exclusively negative. To overcome this drawback, love is proposed for inclusion in policy formulation on the rationale that it is a real and positive emotion. Part II takes an eclectic approach and provides six examples of loves relevance drawn from hate studies, medicine, business, psychology, religion, and womens preferences. Together, they constitute a significant pattern and demonstrate loves versatility, making it relevant for those who formulate policy. Suggestions for policy applications are also made. While acknowledging that including love in policy formulation is not a panacea, this positive, universal, and resilient emotion should be incorporated in policy formulation to increase its effectiveness and relevance given the exceptional negativity of our times following COVID\\\\19.","output":"The Logical Case for Love as an Ingredient in Policy Formulation After COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we consider an SI epidemic reactionCdiffusion model with logistic source and saturation infection mechanism.

Here, we examine the opportunities and challenges afforded by the societal shift toward web-based testing, highlight an urgent need to establish a standard data quality assurance framework for online studies, and develop and validate a new supervised online testing methodology, remote guided testing (RGT). Methods. A total of 85 healthy young adults were tested on 10 cognitive tasks assessing executive functioning (flexibility, memory and inhibition) and learning. Tasks were administered either face-to-face in the laboratory (N=41) or online using remote guided testing (N=44), delivered using identical web-based platforms (CANTAB, Inquisit and i-ABC). Data quality was assessed using detailed trial-level measures (missed trials, outlying and excluded responses, response times), as well as overall task performance measures. Results. The results indicated that, across all measures of data quality and performance, RGT data was statistically-equivalent to data collected in person in the lab. Moreover, RGT participants out-performed the lab group on measured verbal intelligence, which could reflect test environment differences, including possible effects of mask-wearing on communication.

This research involved a survey data with 100 respondents, some interviews and observations, which indicated that in the COVID-19 pandemic Indonesian journalists have been severely affected and are not sufficiently equipped or prepared to face any accelerated and sudden changes caused by the coronavirus. However, in some instances, journalists have been able to deploy advanced digital technology and work collaboratively to provide quality information during the pandemic. The article argues that mastering journalism data and collaborative work should be embraced to enhance the resilience of the journalist community.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic Resilience of Indonesian journalists"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate agreements between COVID-19 reporting systems and radiologists. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (49 males, 51 females;age range 19-88 years) were retrospectively collected. Firstly, computed tomography (CT) images were evaluated by two radiologists independently and blinded to clinical notes and laboratory and radiological reports and they gave their impressions independently according to four COVID-19 reporting systems, then all CTs were interpreted again by the two radiologists for extracting CT features at the same session by consensus. Results: Bilateral, lower lobe, peripheral, dorsal and multifocal lung involvements were predominantly seen, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) were the most common CT imaging finding in the current study. Reporting systems showed fair to moderate agreements between senior and junior raters (0.246-0.490, p&lt;0.001). According to the assigned three-category coding system as similar to that of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Expert Consensus Statement on Reporting and other reporting systems and guidance, strength of inter-rater agreement values was increased (0.365-0.576, p&lt;0.001) and inter-system agreements were substantial to almost perfect in both raters. Conclusion: Radiology reporting including frequently seen CT features and lung parenchyma distributions with systems based on fewer categories may provide good agreement between observers in patients with suspected COVID-19.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in fixation stability induced by peripheral viewing contribute to crowding in peripheral vision by increasing positional uncertainty. We first assessed whether fixation was less stable during peripheral versus central (foveal) viewing for both crowded and uncrowded stimuli. We then tested whether fixation stability during peripheral viewing was associated with the extent of crowding. Fourteen participants performed a tumbling E orientation discrimination task at three different eccentricities (0, 5, 10). The target was presented with or without flankers. Fixational eye movements were measured using an infrared video-based eyetracker. A central fixation cross was provided for the two peripheral viewing conditions, and optotype size was scaled for each eccentricity. Discrimination of appropriately scaled uncrowded stimuli was unaffected by eccentricity, whereas discrimination of crowded stimuli deteriorated dramatically with eccentricity, despite scaling. Both crowded and uncrowded peripheral stimuli were associated with reduced fixation stability, increased microsaccadic amplitude, and a greater proportion of horizontal microsaccades relative to centrally presented stimuli. However, these effects were not associated with the magnitude of crowding. This suggests that reduced fixation stability due to peripheral viewing does not contribute to crowding in peripheral vision.","output":"Reduced fixation stability induced by peripheral viewing does not contribute to crowding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading some scholars to scrutinise the consequences of lockdown and school closure on learners' learning habits and teachers' teaching practices. In this regard, this paper aims to explore the teachers' challenges while implementing a reading strategy-based instruction for beginners during the Covid-19 pandemic, taking the Algerian middle schools as a case in point. It highlights the difficulties to achieving quality in developing learners' procedural knowledge and strategic awareness in EFL reading classes. The leading approach to the issue is the interactive approach. To attain the objective of the research, the qualitative method was adopted. Classroom observation and structured interviews were used to collect data. The population targeted was composed of 20 teachers from 16 middle schools in Tizi-Ouzou. The collected data were subjected to qualitative content analysis. The results of the study reveal that most teachers are aware of the importance of reading strategy-based instruction. However, they do not teach them systematically or consistently. Indeed, lack of targeted teacher training, time constraints, and disregard of metacognitive instruction are likely to be obstacles to the efficient implementation of reading strategy-instruction. Furthermore, the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown up several psychological and cognitive learners' difficulties, including decreased motivation and lack of cognitive focus, making the teaching process more challenging. The results imply a need for a revision of teachers' professional development programs and a re-consideration of the elementary EFL courses.","output":"Developing Elementary EFL Learners' Procedural Knowledge and Strategic Awareness in Reading Classes during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Algerian Teachers' Challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses its spike (S) protein to mediate viral entry into host cells. Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2 site is known to activate the S protein for viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane or the endosomal membrane. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which expands viral tropism to lung cells. Here, we analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related CoVs and offer thoughts on the implications of SARS-CoV-2s unique insert on its origin. We also utilized viral pseudoparticles to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 pre-cleavage is essential for plasma membrane entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for endosomal entry Vero E6 cells, a model cell culture line, and that other proteases in addition to furin are responsible for processing SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2.","output":"Proteolytic activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1/S2 site: a re-evaluation of furin cleavage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The still escalating COVID-19 pandemic also has a substantial impact on energy structure, requirements and related emissions. The consumption is unavoidable and receives a lower priority in the critical situation. However, as the pandemic continues, the impacts on energy and environment should be assessed and possibly reduced. This study aims to provide an overview of invested energy sources and environmental footprints in fighting the COVID-19. The required energy and resources consumption of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and testing kits have been discussed. The protecting efficiency returned on environmental footprint invested for masks has been further explored. The main observation pinpointed is that with a proper design standard, material selection and user guideline, reusable PPE could be an effective option with lower energy consumption/environmental footprint. Additional escalated energy consumption for aseptic and disinfection has been assessed. This includes the energy stemming from emergency and later managed supply chains. The outcomes emphasised that diversifying solutions to achieve the needed objective is a vital strategy to improve the susceptibility and provide higher flexibility in minimising the environmental footprints.

Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey of 309 people with diabetes aged 34-85 was carried out in 10 communities during July and August 2020. Face-to-face surveys were conducted by trained community physicians. Economic hardship was assessed by income loss and financial toxicity during the COVID-19 pandemic, where financial toxicity was defined as experiencing economic difficulties in accessing diabetes management resources. Indicators of diabetes management was assessed by blood glucose and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) monitoring frequency. Results Among all respondents, 38.5% reported having income loss, and 15.5% experiencing financial toxicity during the pandemic. Younger and self-employed people living suburban areas were more likely to experience income loss. Similarly, suburban area residency and lower household income were associated with financial toxicity. Patients with financial toxicity were less likely to monitor HbA1c in the past three months (OR = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.48). Conclusion Diabetes management as indicated by less frequent HbA1c monitoring was associated with experiencing COVID-19 related financial toxicity.

Although Covid-19 quickly became a global pandemic, a focus on responses in Asia is both practical and intellectually defensible for three main reasons. First, China was the epicentre of the pandemic, which spread throughout January and February to other parts of the region.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co\\\\infection in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses. METHODS: A total of 341 clinical specimens were collected from patients with influenza or influenza\\\\like illness and analyzed by ResPlex II assay to detect 18 respiratory viruses. The patterns of co\\\\infection were statistically analyzed with Fisher's exact test. The samples with double or triple infections were passaged in suspension MDCK cells (MDCK\\\\S), adherent MDCK cells (MDCK\\\\A), and LLC\\\\MK2D cells. Cell\\\\passaged samples were analyzed by ResPlex II assay again to investigate whether each cell line could amplify influenza viruses and eliminate other respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Double infections were detected in 8.5% and triple infections in 0.9% of the collected clinical specimens. We identified four pairs of viruses with significant correlation. For all samples with double and triple infection, MDCK\\\\S and MDCK\\\\A could selectively propagate influenza viruses, while eliminating all contaminating viruses.

We report data from 29 whole-body autopsies of COVID-19 deaths occurring in hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia - the first large autopsy case series from Africa. METHODS: We performed a descriptive post-mortem examination study of inpatient COVID-19 related deaths at two hospitals in Lusaka, Zambia. Whole-body autopsies were conducted according to Standard Operating Procedures. Gross and histopathological examinations of all organs were performed. Patient demographics, history, co-morbidities, autopsy gross and microscopic findings, and cause(s) of death were recorded and analyzed using STATA version 14. Variables were grouped and presented as frequencies and percentages. FINDINGS: Autopsies were performed on 29 decedents (mean age = 44  15.8years; age range = 19-82; 17/29 [58.8%] males). 22/29 [75.9%] cases were <55 years of age. A spectrum of pathological manifestations of COVID-19 were seen in all organs. The commonest causes of death were pulmonary thromboembolism (13/29, 45%), Diffuse Alveolar Damage (9/29, 31%), and COVID-19 pneumonia (7/29, 25%). 22/29 (76%) had co-morbidities. Common co-morbidities included HIV (8/29, 28%), Hypertension (6/29, 20%) Tuberculosis (3/29, 10%), Diabetes (3/29, 10%).

As clinicians made the shift from in-person to virtual practice, they faced a paucity of established and reliable clinical examination standards for virtual care settings. In this systematic review, we summarize the accuracy and reliability of virtual assessments compared with traditional in-person examination tools. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception through September 2019 and included additional studies from handsearching of reference lists. We included studies that compared synchronous video (except allowing for audio-only modality for cardiopulmonary exams) with in-person clinical assessments of patients in various settings. We excluded behavioral health and dermatological assessments. Two investigators abstracted data using a predefined protocol. Results: A total of 64 studies were included and categorized into 5 clinical domains: neurological (N = 41), HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; N = 5), cardiopulmonary (N = 5), musculoskeletal (N = 8), and assessment of critically ill patients (N = 5). The cognitive assessment within the neurological exam was by far the most studied (N = 19) with the Mini-Mental Status Exam found to be highly reliable in multiple settings. Most studies showed relatively good reliability of the virtual assessment, although sample sizes were often small (<50 participants). Conclusions: Overall, virtual assessments performed similarly to in-person exam components for diagnostic accuracy but had a wide range of interrater reliability. The high heterogeneity in population, setting, and outcomes reported across studies render it difficult to draw broad conclusions on the most effective exam components to adopt into clinical practice. Further work is needed to identify virtual exam components that improve diagnostic accuracy.","output":"A Systematic Review of Physical Examination Components Adapted for Telemedicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To explore lung involvement in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) using quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Methods: A total of 52 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to three hospitals in China from January 23, 2020 to February 1, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed using QCT. The accuracy of QCT segmentation was assessed. The relationship between the time from symptom onset to initial CT and QCT parameters acquired on the initial CT were explored. Results: First, the ability of QCT to detect and segment lesions was investigated and it was unveiled that results of segmentation of the majority of cases (42/52) were satisfactory and for 8 out of 52 patients, the images depicted lesions with miss-segmentation; besides, 2 out of 52 cases had negative finding on chest CT achieved by both radiologists and QCT. QCT-related parameters showed to have a relationship with the time from symptom onset to initial CT. In the early-stage (0-3 days), the percentage of lung involvement was 4%, with a mean density of - 462  99 HU. The peak density of lesions appeared at the range of - 500 to - 700 HU on density histogram. In the intermediate-stage (4-6 days), the mean percentage of lung involvement noticeably increased compared with that in early stage (7%, p < 0.05). In late stage (7-14 days), the percentage of lung involvement decreased to 5%. The mean density of lesions was the highest (- 430  80), and heterogeneity density distribution showed a dual-peak on density histogram. Conclusion: COVID-19 can be promptly detected by QCT. In addition, the QCT-related parameters can highly facilitate assessment of pulmonary involvement.","output":"Lung involvement in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19): a retrospective study based on quantitative CT findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, it has spread rapidly and widely, bringing great psychological pressure to the public. In order to prevent the epidemic, lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. To explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by COVID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal (PD) patients during the lockdown period. Methods: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients' trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. Results: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00-19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms. HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs 8.00) (p<0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. There was no significant difference on further demand of psychological support between the two groups. In the multivariate regression analysis, we found that dialysis vintage, the impact of COVID-19 on the severity of illness and daily life, and confidence in overcoming the disease contributed to IES score (p<0.05). Conclusions: HD patients had more severe trauma-related stress symptoms than PD patients. When major public healthy events occurred, careful psychological estimate and sufficient psychological support should be provided to the dialysis patients, especially to the HD patients.","output":"Comparison of psychological distress and demand induced by COVID-19 during the lockdown period in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis: a cross-section study in a tertiary hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 pneumonia causes several complications that include pneumothorax, hydropneumothorax, empyema, and rarely leads to bronchopleural fistula (BPF).

Here, we link the activity of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and global mitochondrial acetylation status to host antiviral responses via regulation of both mitochondrial structural integrity and metabolism during HCMV infection. We establish that SIRT3 deacetylase activity is necessary for suppressing virus production, and that SIRT3 maintains mitochondrial pH and membrane potential during infection. By defining the temporal dynamics of SIRT3-substrate interactions during infection, and overlaying acetylome and proteome information, we find altered SIRT3 associations with the mitochondrial fusion factor OPA1 and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2), concomitant with changes in their acetylation levels. Using mutagenesis, microscopy, and virology assays, we determine OPA1 regulates mitochondrial morphology of infected cells and inhibits HCMV production. OPA1 acetylation status modulates these functions, and we establish K834 as a site regulated by SIRT3. Control of SIRT3 protein levels or enzymatic activity is sufficient for regulating mitochondrial filamentous structure. Lastly, we establish a virus restriction function for ACAA2, an enzyme involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Altogether, we highlight SIRT3 activity as a regulatory hub for mitochondrial acetylation and morphology during HCMV infection and point to global acetylation as a reflection of mitochondrial health.","output":"The antiviral sirtuin 3 bridges protein acetylation to mitochondrial integrity and metabolism during human cytomegalovirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cataphors precede their antecedents, so they cannot be fully interpreted until those antecedents are encountered. Some researchers propose that cataphors trigger an active search during incremental processing in which the parser predictively posits potential antecedents in upcoming syntactic positions (Kazanina et al., Journal of Memory and Language, 56[3], 384-409, 2007). One characteristic of active search is that it is persistent: If a prediction is disconfirmed in an earlier position, the parser should iteratively search later positions until the predicted element is found. Previous research has assumed, but not established, that antecedent search is persistent. In four experiments in English and Norwegian, we test this hypothesis. Two sentence completion experiments show a strong off-line preference for coreference between a fronted cataphor and the first available argument position (the main subject). When the main subject cannot be the antecedent, participants posit the antecedent in the next closest position: object position. Two self-paced reading studies demonstrate that comprehenders actively expect the antecedent of a fronted cataphor to appear in the main clause subject position, and then successively in object position if the subject does not match the cataphor in gender.

They serve as mediators of intercellular communication and have been implicated in the regulation of several physiological and pathological processes. Vitiligo is a depigmentation skin disease caused by progressive destruction of autologous epidermal melanocytes. Autoimmune intolerance is one of the leading theories proposed for melanocyte destruction in vitiligo via CD8+, regulatory T (Treg) and T helper 17 (Th17) cell imbalance in adaptive immunity. In this review, we investigate the association of exosomes with vitiligo and emphasize the role of exosomes in immune regulation, melanocyte-keratinocyte interactions, and melanogenesis. The exosomal pathway is necessary for the regulation of CD8+, Treg and Th17 cells in both pathological and physiological conditions. Exosomes derived under pathological conditions can influence CD8+, Treg and Th17 cell balance in the disease microenvironment, which may contribute to disruption of autoimmune tolerance in vitiligo. In addition, exosomes serve as mediators of communication between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the melanogenesis pathway and may also be involved in melanosome transport. They also regulate melanocyte survival and the protein expression of enzymes such as tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TYRP2) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in melanogenesis, which suggests that melanin production is associated with exosomes.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the experiences and coping strategies of Turkish nurses working in pandemic units. METHODS: A grounded theory design was applied. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 nurses. The data were analysed according to the constant comparative method. RESULTS: The study generated a core category ('It was difficult working in the unknown, but our struggle to touch lives gave us strength'), showing that all nurses felt heroic via the satisfaction of touching patients' lives and uncertain. Four main categories emerged: being caught in the pandemic, empowerment for coping with the struggle, challenges during the coping process and effects of the pandemic on life. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses felt that their profession was sacred and valued by society, and comprehensive support had facilitated the process. Nurses had difficulty in managing their fear of infecting others and adapting to many new elements, the learning process and a lack of understanding of their role as team members. The nurses attending to the pandemic have experienced the effects of COVID-19 on their lives, such as psychological growth, psychological symptoms and being labelled as high risk.

Enrollment in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans rather than Traditional Medicare (TM) has grown as well, from 13% of total Medicare enrollment in 2004 to 39% in 2020. Despite these shifts, little is known about outcomes and costs following home health in MA as compared with TM. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to measure the association of MA enrollment with outcomes and costs for patients using home health. DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS Patients enrolled in plans offered by 1 large, national MA organization and patients enrolled in TM, with at least 1 home health visit between January 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018. EXPOSURE MA enrollment. MAIN MEASURES We compared the intensity of home health services and types of care delivered. The main outcome measures were hospitalization, the proportion of days in the home, and total allowed costs during the 180-day period following the first qualifying home health visit during the study period. KEY RESULTS Among patients who used home health, our models demonstrated enrollment in MA was associated with 14%, and 6% decreased odds of 60- and 180-day hospitalization, respectively, a 12.8% and 14.7% decrease in medical costs exclusive and inclusive of home health costs, respectively, and a 0.27% increase in the proportion of days at home during the 180-day follow-up, equivalent to an additional half-day at home. There were few differences in home health care delivered for MA and TM [mean number of visits in the first episode of care (17.1 vs. 17.3) and mean visits per week (3.2 vs. 3.3)]. The mean number of visits by visit type and percent of patients with each type was similar between MA and TM as well. CONCLUSIONS Compared with enrollment in TM, enrollment in MA was associated with improved patient-centered outcomes and lower cost and utilization, despite few differences in the way home health was delivered. These findings might be explained by structural components of MA that encourage better care management, but further investigation is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which MA enrollment may lead to higher value home health care.","output":"A Comparison of Home Health Utilization, Outcomes, and Cost Between Medicare Advantage and Traditional Medicare."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Multiple studies have identified cross-sectional relationships between antibiotic use and bacterial resistance. The aim of this study was to analyse the susceptibility of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and non-MDR (nMDR) isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp to cephalosporins: ceftazidime (CTZ), ceftriaxone (CTX), cefepime (CEF) and fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin (CIP) and levofloxacin (LEV) in a tertiary healthcare centre from 2014 to 2018. In addition, we aimed to evaluate a correlation between the antibiotic utility and susceptibility of the selected enterobacteria. METHODS Antibiotics consumption and antimicrobial resistance were monitored in a tertiary care university hospital from 2014 to 2018. Utilisation of antibiotics in the observed period was expressed as defined daily dose (er 100 bed/days (DBD). Bacterial susceptibility was reported as the percentage of susceptible results among all tested isolates from all patient samples. In further analysis, bacterial strains were considered as MDR or nMDR species. An MDR bacterial strain was defined as one with acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. RESULTS Our results suggest that cephalosporins were the most used antibiotics, followed by fluoroquinolones, during the entire observed period 2014-2018. Our findings show that MDR isolates of E. coli had an increasing trend in susceptibility in relation to CTX (p=0.005), whereas a decreasing trend was observed for MDR isolates of E. coli susceptibility towards CIP and LEV (p<0.001). Klebsiella spp susceptibility for MDR isolates showed a decreasing trend in relation to CEF (p<0.001) and both fluoroquinolones (p<0.001). A significant negative association between CEF consumption and Klebsiella spp MDR isolates susceptibility was observed (p=0.045).

To date, however, no known study has examined changes in mental health during the pandemic in the U.S. military veteran population. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2019C2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative, prospective cohort survey of 3078 veterans. Pre-to-peri-pandemic changes in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated, as well as pre-pandemic risk and protective factors and pandemic-related correlates of increased psychiatric distress. RESULTS: The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) positive screens increased from pre- to peri-pandemic (7.1% to 9.4%; p < 0.001) and was driven by an increase among veterans aged 45C64 years (8.2% to 13.5%; p < 0.001), but the prevalence of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder positive screens remained stable. Using a continuous measure of psychiatric distress, an estimated 13.2% of veterans reported a clinically meaningful pre-to-peri-pandemic increase in distress (mean = 1.1 standard deviation). Veterans with a larger pre-pandemic social network size and secure attachment style were less likely to experience increased distress, whereas veterans reporting more pre-pandemic loneliness were more likely to experience increased distress. Concerns about pandemic-related social losses, mental health COVID-19 effects, and housing stability during the pandemic were associated with increased distress, over-and-above pre-pandemic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Although most U.S. veterans showed resilience to mental health problems nearly 1 year into the pandemic, the prevalence of GAD positive screens increased, particularly among middle-aged veterans, and one of seven veterans experienced increased distress. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","output":"Mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in U.S. military veterans: a population-based, prospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing nationwide lockdown due to the global pandemic COVID-19 started from March 24, 2020, in Nepal.

Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate sex-related changes in blood metabolites in a model of stress-induced depression in Wistar rats. Pregnant females were stressed using restriction of mobility in the final week of the pregnancy three times a day for 45 minutes each, three following days. After the birth, the progeny aged 60 days was stressed repeatedly. The perturbation in overall energy metabolism as well as in lipid metabolism was found. While in males, phosphatidylcholines (the most phosphatidylcholine with acyl-alkyl residue sum C40:4 - PC ae C40:4), sphingomyelins, and acylcarnitines were changed, in females, lipid metabolism perturbation was seen with the most critical alteration in hydroxysphingomyelin with acyl residue sum C16:1 (SM OH C16:1).

First, reducing virus transmission will require prevention of asymptomatic and mild infections in addition to severe symptomatic infections. Second, the emergence of variants of concern with mutations in the S proteins receptor binding domain increases the likelihood that vaccines will have to be updated because some of these mutations render variants less optimally targeted by current vaccines. This will require coordinated global SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to link genotypes to phenotypes, potentially using the WHOs global influenza surveillance program as a guide. Third, concerns about the longevity of vaccine-induced immunity highlight the potential need for re-vaccination, depending on the extent to which the virus has been controlled and whether re-vaccination can target those at greatest risk of severe illness.

Setting: Observational study with retrospective analysis in a French emergency department (ED). Participants and intervention: From March 3 to April 2, 2020, 385 adult patients presenting to the ED for suspected COVID-19 underwent an evaluation that included history, physical examination, blood tests, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and chest CT. When the time-interval between chest CT and RT-PCR assays was longer than 7 days, patients were excluded from the study. Only patients with hospitalization criteria were included. Diagnosis accuracy was assessed using the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR. Outcomes: Sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR, chest CT (also accompanied by lymphopenia) were measured and were also analyzed by subgroups of age and sex. Results: Among 377 included subjects, RT-PCR was positive in 36%, while chest CT was compatible with a COVID-19 diagnosis in 59%. In the population with positive RT-PCR, there were more men (55% vs 37%, p=0.015), a higher frequency of reticular and, or, interlobular septal thickening (53% vs 31%, p=0.02) as well as a higher frequency of bilateral lesion distribution (98% vs 86%, p=0.01) compared to the population with negative RT-PCR. The proportion of lymphopenia was higher in men vs women (47% vs 39%, p=0.03) and varies between patients >80 versus 50-80 and p<0.001). Using CT as reference, RT-PCR obtained a sensitivity of 61%, specificity of 93%. There was a significant difference between CT and RT-PCR diagnosis performance (p<0.001). When CT was accompanied by lymphopenia, sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were respectively 71% and 94%. CT abnormalities and lymphopenia provided diagnosis in 29% of patients with negative PCR.

Despite increasing popularity of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in bariatric surgery, its effect on GERD is still unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of LSG with or without hiatal hernia repair (HHR) on GERD in obese patients. METHODS Seventy-eight patients with HH underwent LSG with concomitant HHR (LSG+HHR group). Their data were compared with that of 102 patients without HH, who underwent only LSG (LSG-group). All patients underwent a standardized questionnaire, a double-contrast barium swallow, and an upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy before the surgical procedure and at least 6 months later. RESULTS At baseline, the prevalence of GERD symptoms and their frequency-intensity scores did not differ between groups. At follow up, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of typical GERD symptoms only in the LSG-group (P = .003). LSG+HHR patients showed a significantly higher heartburn frequency-intensity score compared with LSG patients (P = .009).

METHODS: Ninety cases of femoral fracture were divided at random into the oral instruction group, the recorded video group, and the animation video group, with 30 cases in each group. Sociodemographic data were collected the day before surgery. Health education was then offered in one of three ways: orally, using a recorded video, or using an animation video. On days 2, 4, and 7 after surgery, the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and the visual analog scale (VAS) were used to assess postoperative anxiety and pain levels, respectively, in the participants. RESULTS: At different time points during the evaluation, total anxiety scores in the animation and recorded video groups were significantly lower than in the oral instruction group (P < 0.01), and the pairwise comparisons indicated statistically significant differences (F = 11.04, 10.06, 10.37, P < 0.01).

In this unprecedented situation, the intimate relationship, sexual behavior, and family functions of partners have also undergone unique changes. There are few reports on whether sexual behavior and family function affect intimate relationships between partners, especially among people aged 18 to 44 years. AIM: To analyze the influence of sociodemographic characteristics, family function, and changes in sexual behavior on male-female intimacy, the independent contributions of the aforementioned factors in this population group are required to be further investigated. METHODS: In the present study, 284 Chinese citizens aged 18-44 years completed the online questionnaire. The univariate analysis and cluster multiple linear regression were used to analyze the associations between sociodemographic factors, sexual-behavior changes, family function, and male-female intimacy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Family adaptation, partnership, growth, affection, resolve (APGAR) Scale and Relationship Assessment Scale were used to evaluate participants' family function and their intimacy. Details of the participants (sociodemographic and sexual factors) were obtained. RESULTS: The summary scores, with Relationship Assessment Scale and APGAR scales, were 27.19  4.49 and 6.76  2.28, respectively. About 43.3% of participants reported a decrease in sexual frequency. There were considerable differences among age, education level, sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, quality of sexual life, family function with male-female intimacy (P < .05). The sexual satisfaction and intimacy demonstrated a significant positive correlation (P < .05) by cluster multiple linear regression analysis. Compared with those who had a sexual life of mediocre quality, respondents who experienced a good quality sexual life had relatively higher scores in intimacy. The independent contributions of sociodemographic factors, sexual behavior factors, and family function in male-female intimacy were 13.0%, 38.2%, and 48.8%, respectively.

Today, the question of good leadership has come under the spotlight again as a key factor shaping how successfully nations have dealt with the COVID-19 global health crisis. Amidst plummeting levels of public trust, the worst recession of the G7, and the highest death toll in Europe, the UK's pandemic leadership response has faced especially stern accusations of incompetence and culpability for what has been described as the most catastrophic science policy failure for a generation. Addressing these issues, this paper argues for the adoption of a more pluralised UK leadership approach for handling COVID-19. Particularly, it is contended that as COVID-19 is a multifaceted problem that presents many varied and distributed challenges, UK leadership should employ a differentiated range of strategic mechanisms and processes to help improve substantive understandings and decision-making, support collective resilience, and build adaptive capacities as the crisis continues. The paper accordingly identifies and elaborates thirteen strategies, drawing on lessons and insights from the risk and crisis management field, that are proposed to serve as a useful heuristic to help guide UK pandemic leadership in this endeavour. To illustrate the value and application of each strategy, examples are provided of noteworthy leadership responses to COVID-19 observed internationally thus far, as well as leadership problems that have hampered the UK's pandemic response.

However, the routine clinical features are not sufficient to accurately predict the prognosis of AML. The expression of hypoxia-related genes was associated with survival outcomes of a variety of hematologic and lymphoid neoplasms. We established an 18-gene signature-based hypoxia-related prognosis model (HPM) and a complex model that consisted of the HPM and clinical risk factors using machine learning methods. Both two models were able to effectively predict the survival of AML patients, which might contribute to improving risk classification. Differentially expressed genes analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) categories, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed to reveal the underlying functions and pathways implicated in AML development. To explore hypoxia-related changes in the bone marrow immune microenvironment, we used CIBERSORT to calculate and compare the proportion of 22 immune cells between the two groups with high and low hypoxia-risk scores. Enrichment analysis and immune cell composition analysis indicated that the biological processes and molecular functions of drug metabolism, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration of bone marrow play a role in the occurrence and development of AML, which might help us to evaluate several hypoxia-related metabolic and immune targets for AML therapy.","output":"Establishment of Prognosis Model in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Based on Hypoxia Microenvironment, and Exploration of Hypoxia-Related Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The care of critically ill patient within the intensive care unit requires a multidisciplinary approach.

The resultant increase in prescribing was accompanied by an increase in adverse events, including severe toxicity and death. The Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning (EXTRIP) workgroup sought to determine the effect of and indications for extracorporeal treatments in cases of poisoning with these drugs. METHODS: We conducted systematic reviews of the literature, screened studies, extracted data, and summarized findings following published EXTRIP methods. RESULTS: A total of 44 studies (three in vitro studies, two animal studies, 28 patient reports or patient series, and 11 pharmacokinetic studies) met inclusion criteria regarding the effect of extracorporeal treatments. Toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic analysis was available for 61 patients (13 chloroquine, three hydroxychloroquine, and 45 quinine). Clinical data were available for analysis from 38 patients, including 12 with chloroquine toxicity, one with hydroxychloroquine toxicity, and 25 with quinine toxicity. All three drugs were classified as non-dialyzable (not amenable to clinically significant removal by extracorporeal treatments). The available data do not support using extracorporeal treatments in addition to standard care for patients severely poisoned with either chloroquine or quinine (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Although hydroxychloroquine was assessed as being non-dialyzable, the clinical evidence was not sufficient to support a formal recommendation regarding the use of extracorporeal treatments for this drug. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our systematic review and analysis, the EXTRIP workgroup recommends against using extracorporeal methods to enhance elimination of these drugs in patients with severe chloroquine or quinine poisoning.","output":"Extracorporeal Treatment for Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and Quinine Poisoning: Systematic Review and Recommendations from the EXTRIP Workgroup"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe inpatient management strategies and considerations for pregnant patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.

Bilateral LTx has been recommended as many patients develop significant pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, native lung explants may include cavitary areas of pneumonia, which could serve as a nidus for infection. Single LTx (SLTx) can be considered in patients who have chronic pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 with a short window to receive a transplant, or who would otherwise be considered for a single lung. There have been no published cases of a single lung transplant for COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. We present a case of a patient with pulmonary fibrosis from COVID-19 who underwent SLTx. Case Report A 70yo male with O+ blood type was hospitalized 8/2020 to 10/2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia, treated with Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. He had hypoxia but never required intubation. His course was complicated by bilateral pneumothoraces requiring chest tubes. He developed pulmonary fibrosis requiring 6 L of oxygen at rest. CT scan of his chest showed multifocal, peripheral prominent ground glass opacities and interlobal septal thickening with traction bronchiectasis. Ventilation-perfusion scan demonstrated 22% perfusion to the left lung and 78% to the right lung. Right heart catheterization showed pulmonary artery pressures of 36/12 mmHg. His pulmonary function test was suggestive of restrictive disease (FEV 0.81 L [30%], FVC 0.96 L [27%], and FEV1/FVC 85%) that had worsened over time. He was presented at multidisciplinary review board with recommendation to list for left SLTx, which was activated August 2021. The patient was admitted in September 2021 and underwent left single lung transplant via left anterolateral thoracotomy, off cardiopulmonary bypass. Total ischemia time was 3:54. Explant pathology showed end stage pulmonary fibrosis. The patient was extubated on postoperative day 1 with an uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged to skilled nursing facility on postoperative day 26 for rehabilitation. Summary SLTxp is safe and feasible for COVID-19 related pulmonary fibrosis in well-selected patients who have a short window to receive a transplant.","output":"Single Lung Transplantation for Pulmonary Fibrosis Secondary to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for the infectious disease caused by coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).

Therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the literature available on the topic and provide information about COVID-19, in both healthy and diseased livers, and issue recommendations. The incidence of liver injury specifically associated with COVID-19 varies from 14.8-53%. The majority of case series have reported altered ALT and AST, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin and liver compromise has been associated with the most severe cases of COVID-19. Cirrhosis of the liver has a recognized immune dysfunction status that includes immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, making it reasonable for those patients to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The recommendations for those patients, in addition to the general measures of physical distancing and handwashing for all persons, include social, medical, and psychologic support during the period of home quarantine to prevent lapses in treatment. Patients should be made aware that they need to keep abreast of changes in recommendations and social policies.","output":"Manifestaciones hepticas y repercusin en el paciente cirrtico de COVID-19./ Manifestaciones hepticas y repercusin en el paciente cirrtico de COVID-19./ Hepatic manifestations and impact of COVID-19 on the cirrhotic patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the 1st community-acquired case of COVID-19 struck the Pacific Northwest, healthcare organizations prepared to respond by implementing emergency systems.

Children <18 years old admitted between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2019, and age eligible for vaccinations were included. We determined the proportion of hospitalizations with 1 dose of any vaccine type administered overall and by hospital, the type of vaccines administered, and the demographic characteristics of children who received vaccines. We calculated adjusted hospital-level rates for each vaccine type by hospital. We used logistic and linear regression models to examine characteristics associated with vaccine administration. RESULTS There were 1 185 667 children and 1 536 340 hospitalizations included. The mean age was 5.5 years; 18% were non-Hispanic Black, and 55% had public insurance. There were 1 vaccine doses administered in 12.9% (95% confidence interval: 12.8-12.9) of hospitalizations, ranging from 1% to 45% across hospitals. The most common vaccines administered were hepatitis B and influenza. Vaccine doses other than the hepatitis B birth dose and influenza were administered in 1.9% of hospitalizations. Children had higher odds of receiving a vaccine dose other than the hepatitis B birth dose or influenza if they were <2 months old, had public insurance, were non-Hispanic Black race, were medically complex, or had a length of stay 3 days.

To characterize the role of apoptotic cell contraction, ROCK1 was rendered caspase non-cleavable (ROCK1nc) by mutating aspartate 1113, which revealed that ROCK1 cleavage was necessary for forceful contraction and membrane blebbing. When homozygous ROCK1nc mice were treated with the liver-selective apoptotic stimulus of diethylnitrosamine, ROCK1nc mice had more profound liver damage with greater neutrophil infiltration than wild-type mice. Inhibition of the damage-associated molecular pattern protein HMGB1 or signalling by its cognate receptor TLR4 lowered neutrophil infiltration and reduced liver damage. ROCK1nc mice also developed fewer diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumours, while HMGB1 inhibition increased HCC tumour numbers. Thus, ROCK1 activation and consequent cell contraction are required to limit sterile inflammation and damage amplification following tissue-scale cell death.

We present two versions of the course that can be implemented with twice-weekly meetings over a 5-week period. In the remote-learning version, students performed homology searches, designed guide RNAs (gRNAs) and primers, and learned the principles of molecular cloning. This version is appropriate when access to laboratory equipment or in-person instruction is limited, such as during closures that have occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In person, students designed gRNAs, cloned CRISPR-Cas9 constructs, and performed genetic transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana. Students learned how to design effective gRNA pairs targeting their assigned gene with an 86% success rate. Final exams tested students ability to apply knowledge of an unfamiliar genome database to characterize gene structure and to properly design gRNAs. Average final exam scores of 73% and 84% for in-person and remote-learning CUREs, respectively, indicated that students met learning outcomes. The highly parallel nature of the CURE makes it possible to target dozens to hundreds of genes, depending on the number of sections.

The M gene encodes the most abundant viral structural protein, and is implicated in multiple viral functions, including initial attachment to the host cell via heparin sulphate proteoglycan, viral protein assembly in conjunction with the N and E genes, and enhanced glucose transport. We have identified a recent spike in the frequency of reported SARS-CoV-2 genomes carrying M gene mutations. This is associated with emergence of a new sub-B.1 clade, B.1.I82T, defined by the previously unreported M:I82T mutation within TM3, the third of three membrane spanning helices implicated in glucose transport. The frequency of this mutation increased in the USA from 0.014% in October 2020 to 1.62% in February 2021, a 116-fold change. While constituting 0.7% of the isolates overall, M:I82T sub-B.1 lineage accounted for 14.4% of B.1 lineage isolates in February 2021, similar to the rapid initial increase previously seen with the B.1.1.7 and B.1.429 lineages, which quickly became the dominant lineages in Europe and California over a period of several months. A similar increase in incidence was also noted in another related mutation, V70L, also within the TM2 transmembrane helix. These M mutations are associated with younger patient age (4.6 to 6.3 years). The rapid emergence of this B.1.I82T clade, recently named Pangolin B.1.575 lineage, suggests that this M gene mutation is more biologically fit, perhaps related to glucose uptake during viral replication, and should be included in ongoing genomic surveillance efforts and warrants further evaluation for potentially increased pathogenic and therapeutic implications.","output":"Emerging variants of concern in SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein: a highly conserved target with potential pathological and therapeutic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been affecting millions of individuals worldwide and, thus far, there is no accurate therapeutic strategy This critical situation necessitates novel formulations for already existing, FDA approved, but poorly absorbable drug candidates, such as niclosamide (NIC), which is of great relevance In this context, we have rationally designed NIC-loaded hydrotalcite composite nanohybrids, which were further coated with Tween 60 or hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and characterized them in vitro The optimized nanohybrids showed particle sizes &lt;300 nm and were orally administrated to rats to determine whether they could retain an optimum plasma therapeutic concentration of NIC that would be effective for treating COVID-19 The pharmacokinetic (PK) results clearly indicated that hydrotalcite-based NIC formulations could be highly potential options for treating the ongoing pandemic and we are on our way to understanding the in vivo anti-viral efficacy sooner It is worth mentioning that hydrotalciteCNIC nanohybrids maintained a therapeutic NIC level, even above the required IC50 value, after just a single administration in 8C12 h In conclusion, we were very successfully able to develop a NIC oral formulation by immobilizing with hydrotalcite nanoparticles, which were further coated with Tween 60 or HPMC, in order to enhance their emulsification in the gastrointestinal tract","output":"HydrotalciteCNiclosamide Nanohybrid as OralFormulation towards SARS-CoV-2 Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Restrictive intraoperative fluid management has been demonstrated to improve outcome of visceral and lung surgery in several studies. However, subsequent hypovolemia (HOV) may be accompanied by a decrease of anemia tolerance, resulting in increased transfusion needs. We therefore investigated the effect of volume status on anemia tolerance. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Eighteen domestic pigs of either sex (mean weight, 23.5  4.8 kg) were anesthetized, ventilated, and randomized into three experimental groups: normovolemia (no intervention), HOV (blood loss of 40% of blood volume), and hypervolemia (HEV; volume infusion of 40% of blood volume). The animals were then hemodiluted until their individual critical hemoglobin concentrations (Hbcrit ) were reached by the exchange of whole blood for hydroxyethyl starch (HES; 130:0.4). Subsequently, organ-specific hypoxia was assessed using pimonidazole tissue staining in relevant organs. Hemodynamic and metabolic variables were also investigated. RESULTS Despite significant differences in exchangeable blood volume, Hbcrit was the same in all groups (2.3 g/dL, NS). During HOV, tissue hypoxia was aggravated in the myocardium, brain, and kidneys, whereas tissue oxygenation of the liver and intestine was not influenced by volume status. HEV increased tissue hypoxia in the lungs, but did not impact tissue oxygenation of other organs. CONCLUSIONS The combination of hemorrhagic HOV with subsequent anemia leads to accentuated tissue hypoxia, revealed by a significant increase in pimonidazole binding at Hbcrit , in heart, lungs, brain, and kidney.

The findings of analyses and tests show that an early announcement of the hospital names and publicizing the necessary preventive measures could have reduced the rate of infection by approximately 85% and the number of contaminated healthcare facilities by 39% at maximum. This level of reduction is comparable to that of vaccination and of social distancing.","output":"Is Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication as Effective as Vaccination for Preventing Virus Diffusion?

Our main aim is to describe the clinical management and outcome of COVID-19 in this vulnerable group. Methods: This prospective study included 76 pediatric oncology patients with confirmed infection in the period between 1st of May and end of November, 2020 with at least two-month follow-up from recruitment. Remdesivir (RDV) was the antiviral therapy used. Findings: The median age of patients was 9 years. Sixty patients were on first line treatment. Haematological malignancies constituted 86.8% of patients. Severe to critical form of infection represent 35.4% of cases. The commonest presentation was fever (93.4%). Chemotherapy was delayed in 59.2% of cases and doses were modified in 30.2%. Most acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (88%) were in maintenance treatment phase while 55% of acute myeloid leukemia were in induction phase. Sixty days overall survival (OS) was 86.6% and mortalities occurred only in critically ill cases. Of the sixteen acute leukemia who were in first induction phase, 13 survived and 10 achieved induction remission. The commonest CT chest finding was ground glass opacities (74.2%). A negative PCR within 2 weeks and improvement of radiological findings were statistically related to disease severity (p=0.008and, 0.002 respectively).Better OS was associated with regression of radiological finding after 30 days from infection (p=0.002). Of the forty-five cases who received RDV, 70% were severe to critically ill cases, yet morality was comparable to NoRDV with no serious adverse events observed. Interpretation: COVID-19 in pediatric cancer patients has good clinical outcome except for critical form of infection at presentation. New oncologic cases tolerate induction therapy with good disease outcome. RDS was well tolerated with no OS difference compared to patients who did not receive the drug.Funding: The present work was funded by the Childrens Cancer Hospital Foundation and Association of Friends of the National Cancer-free Initiative (AFNCI)Declaration of Interest: All authors declare no competing financial interests.Ethical Approval: The approval of hospital ethical committee and family consents were obtained.","output":"COVID-19 Management and Outcome of 76 Pediatric Cancer Patients, a Single Centre Experience from Developing Country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) remains a leading cause of liver\\\\related pathologies and a global health problem, currently affecting more than 71 million people worldwide.

Curtailment of intensive care unit (ICU) access threatens complex surgery, particularly impacting on outcomes for time-sensitive cancer surgery. Oesophageal cancer surgery is a good example. This study explored the impact of the pandemic on process and short-term surgical outcomes, comparing the first wave of the pandemic from April to June in 2020 with the same period in 2019. METHODS: Data from all four Irish oesophageal cancer centres were reviewed. All patients undergoing resection for oesophageal malignancy from 1 April to 30 June inclusive in 2020 and 2019 were included. Patient, disease, and peri-operative outcomes (including COVID-19 infection) were compared. RESULTS: In 2020, 45 patients underwent oesophagectomy, and 53 in the equivalent period in 2019. There were no differences in patient demographics, co-morbidities, or use of neoadjuvant therapy. The median time to surgery from neoadjuvant therapy was 8 weeks in both 2020 and 2019. There were no significant differences in operative interventions between the two time periods. There was no difference in operative morbidity in 2020 and 2019 (28% vs 40%, p = 0.28). There was no in-hospital mortality in either period. No patient contracted COVID-19 in the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing surgical resection for oesophageal cancer was feasible and safe during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.

Methods: Discovery Studio 4.5 was used to compare and screen the ligands with the reference drug, solasodine, to identify ideal candidate compounds that could inhibit MMP9. The LibDock module was used to analyze compounds that could strongly bind to MMP9, and the top 20 compounds determined by the LibDock score were selected for further research. ADME and TOPKAT modules were used to choose the safe compounds from these 20 compounds. The selected compounds were analyzed using the CDOCKER module for molecular docking and feature mapping for pharmacophore prediction. The stability of these compoundCMMP9 complexes was analyzed by molecular dynamic simulation. Cell counting kit-8, colony-forming, and scratch assays were used to analyze the anti-CCRCC effects of these ligands. Results: Strong binding to MMP9 was exhibited by 6,762 ligands. Among the top 20 compounds, sappanol and sventenin exhibited nearly undefined bloodCbrain barrier level and lower aqueous solubility, carcinogenicity, and hepatotoxicity than the positive control drug, solasodine. Additionally, these compounds exhibited lower potential energies with MMP9, and the ligandCMMP9 complexes were stable in the natural environment. Furthermore, sappanol inhibited CCRCC cell migration and proliferation. Conclusion: Sappanol and sventenin are safe and reliable compounds to target and inhibit MMP9.

METHODS: IMIA Primary Care Informatics Working Group members from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States developed a standardised template for collection of information. The template guided a rapid literature review. We also included experiential learning from primary care and public health perspectives. RESULTS: All countries responded rapidly. Common themes included rapid reductions then transformation to virtual visits, pausing of non-COVID related informatics projects, all against a background of non-standardized digital development and disparate territory or state regulations and guidance. Common barriers in these four and in less-resourced countries included disparities in internet access and availability including bandwidth limitations when internet access was available, initial lack of coding standards, and fears of primary care clinicians that patients were delaying care despite the availability of televisits. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care clinicians were able to respond to the COVID crisis through telehealth and electronic record enabled change. However, the lack of coordinated national strategies and regulation, assurance of financial viability, and working in silos remained limitations.

We determined the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 treated with different pharmacological agents. Methods: In this systematic review, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published between 1 st January and 12 th August, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with COVID-19 treated with any pharmacological agent and compared with a different pharmacological agent, placebo or standard of care. Results: From 6346 citations, 19 studies were included, with an overall low risk of bias. Two RCTs evaluated the use of remdesivir in laboratory-confirmed moderate-to-severe COVID-19. One study found that 10 days of remdesivir was associated with shortened recovery time. Neither found reduction in mortality. One RCT found no association of lopinavir/ritonavir with time to clinical improvement, or mortality benefit. Two RCTs of hydrochloroquine in patients with mild, early disease demonstrated no reduction in disease severity, hospitalization rate, death or viral load. Two RCTs observed no association of hydrochloroquine in hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate disease with virological clearance, improvement in symptoms, need for respiratory support or death. One RCT showed that the use of steroids was associated with improved survival in patients with moderate-to-severe disease, especially those requiring respiratory support. Conclusions: There is evidence for the benefit of steroids in patients with moderate-to-severe disease.

Methods A total of 118 patients with advanced NSCLC who progressed after standard regimens were included in this retrospective study. Efficacy was evaluated and toxicity profile was recorded. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curve and multivariate analysis was adjusted using Cox regression analysis. Results All of the 118 patients with NSCLC were available for evaluation of efficacy. Complete response (CR, 0 case), partial response (PR, 10 cases), stable disease (SD, 79 cases) and progressive disease (PD, 29 cases) were evaluated according to RECIST version 1.1. In consequence, objective response rate (ORR) was 8.47% and disease control rate (DCR) was 75.42%. The median PFS of the 118 patients with NSCLC was 4.3 months and the median OS was 10.3 months. The results of Cox regression analysis suggested that ECOG score was an independent factor for PFS. The toxicity profile indicated that hypertension and hand-foot syndrome were the most common adverse reactions. Additionally, the preliminary analysis of an efficacy predictor suggested that the PFS of patients with hypertension was superior to those without hypertension.

The key words used in the search were: Bridge OR bridges OR fixed partial OR fixed dental AND resin bonded OR Maryland OR ceramic bonded. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Success was defined as the RBFPDs remaining in situ and not having experienced debonding, biological failures, or mechanical failures at the examination visit. RESULTS Meta analyses of the included studies showed an estimated 5-year success rate of 88.18% for the metal framework RBFPDs and 84.41% for the nonmetal framework RBFPDs. The estimated 5-year success rate for each nonmetal material category was 92.07% for zirconia, 94.26% for In-Ceram alumina, and 84.83% for fiber-reinforced composite. The failure rate was not statistically significant among the single, double, and multiple retainers RBFPDs (P > .05). Technical complications were the main reason for failures.

The C-terminal region of the Lys49-PLA2s is important for these effects; however, the amino acid residues that determine hyperalgesia and edema are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the structural determinants for the Lys49-PLA2-induced nociception and inflammation. METHODS Scanning alanine mutagenesis in the active-site and C-terminal regions of BthTx-I has been used to study the structural determinants of toxin activities. The R118A mutant was employed as this substitution decreases PLA2 myotoxicity. In addition, K115A and K116A mutants - which contribute to decrease cytotoxicity - and the K122A mutant - which decreases both myotoxicity and cytotoxicity - were also used. The H48Q mutant - which does not interfere with membrane damage or myotoxic activity - was used to evaluate if the PLA2 catalytic site is relevant for the non-catalytic PLA2-induced pain and inflammation. Wistar male rats received intraplantar injections with mutant PLA2. Subsequently, hyperalgesia and edema were evaluated by the paw pressure test and by a plethysmometer. Native and recombinant BthTx-I were used as controls. RESULTS Native and recombinant BthTx-I induced hyperalgesia and edema, which peaked at 2 h. The R118A mutant did not induce nociception or edema. The mutations K115A and K116A abolished hyperalgesia without interfering with edema. Finally, the K122A mutant did not induce hyperalgesia and presented a decreased inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS The results obtained with the BthTx-I mutants suggest, for the first time, that there are distinct residues responsible for the hyperalgesia and edema induced by BthTx-I. In addition, we also showed that cytolytic activity is essential for the hyperalgesic effect but not for edematogenic activity, corroborating previous data showing that edema and hyperalgesia can occur in a non-dependent manner.

The erythema and induration of Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) scar is one of the characteristic findings of KD, and is useful for the diagnosis in countries where BCG vaccination is mandated in infancy.

The patient received BCG vaccination at 16 months of age in Japan. Four weeks before the onset, he had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 following household outbreak, although he was asymptomatic. He presented with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by the appearance of all six principal findings of complete KD.

However, this has likely impacted access to care for patients experiencing other conditions. We aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on access to care for patients with urgent/emergent urological conditions throughout Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 33 urological units in the AGILE consortium, asking clinicians to report on the number of urgent/emergent urological patients seen and/or undergoing surgery over a 3-week period during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and a reference week prior to the outbreak. ANOVA and linear regression models were used to quantify these changes. RESULTS: Data from 27 urological centres in Italy showed a decrease from 956 patients/week seen just prior to the outbreak to 291 patients/week seen by the end of the study period. There was a difference in the number of patients with urgent/emergent urological disease seen within/during the different weeks (all p values < 0.05). A significant decrease in the number of patients presenting with haematuria, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, scrotal pain, renal colic, or trauma and urgent/emergent cases that required surgery was reported (all p values < 0.05).

Since its outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has had a major impact on clinical diagnostic laboratories. The scientific community has quickly risen to the occasion and reports of new developments have arrived at an unprecedented scale. At present, there is a growing list of over 400 SARC-CoV-2 diagnostic tests either in development or approved for clinical use. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID- 19 in microbiology laboratories and also provides an insight into the future diagnostics approaches. METHODS: Proper respiratory specimen collected at the appropriate time and from the right anatomical site is critical in the accurate and timely diagnosis of SARSCoV2. While oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for the detection of early infection, other lower respiratory tract specimens like the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage are used for late detection and monitoring of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Real-time RT-PCR based molecular assay remains the test of choice for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 while serological tests are being introduced as supplementary tools. Finally, there is an urgent need for scaling up the diagnostic capacity by the introduction of reliable and accurate point-of-care tests which will assist in effective control of this outbreak. These assays can be used in the local hospitals and clinics bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.","output":"Laboratory diagnosis of novel corona virus (2019-nCoV)-present and the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health and social care workers (HSCWs) have carried a heavy burden during the COVID-19 crisis and, in the challenge to control the virus, have directly faced its consequences. Supporting their psychological wellbeing continues, therefore, to be a priority. This rapid review was carried out to establish whether there are any identifiable risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes amongst HSCWs during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: We undertook a rapid review of the literature following guidelines by the WHO and the Cochrane Collaboration's recommendations. We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The 24 studies included in this review reported data predominantly from China (18 out of 24 included studies) and most sampled urban hospital staff. Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological well-being in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed. Further research including social care workers and analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.","output":"A rapid review of the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers: implications for supporting psychological well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has rapidly spread around the world. As new complications associated with the virus become more apparent, concerns in the medical community continue to grow. One of the more commonly encountered and more troubling complications in critically ill patients has been hypercoagulable state and subsequent thrombotic events. Within the spectrum of observed thrombotic events, pulmonary embolism seems to prevail. These trends are concerning and reinforce current recommendations on anticoagulation in critically ill with the virus. To illustrate the variety of possible presentations of pulmonary emboli in COVID-19 population, two cases of patients in their sixties are described, one without any predisposing risk factors and one with history of asthma and obesity. These patients developed pulmonary emboli at different points during their hospital course, were treated differently, and had different outcomes. Important observations are made that may shed some light on possible etiology of pulmonary emboli. One of the patients presented still developed pulmonary embolism despite being on full dose anticoagulation. Literature review suggests that pulmonary clot burden in COVID-19 patients could be due to pulmonary thrombus rather than pulmonary embolism and is triggered by profuse vascular damage and severe inflammatory response. Literature review also proposes changes to the diagnostic work up in COVID-19 patients, such as earlier screening for pulmonary embolism in critically ill.

The optimal antibiotic treatment duration for cIAIs is uncertain, especially in cases where source control is not achieved. We hypothesised that in patients with cIAIs, regardless of source control intervention, there would be a lower relapse rate with long-course antibiotics (28 days) compared with short course (&#8804; 10 days). We piloted a trial comparing &#8804; 10-day with 28-day antibiotic treatment for cIAI. METHODS: A randomised controlled unblinded feasibility trial was conducted. Eligible participants were adult patients with a cIAI that were diagnosed &#8804; 6 days prior to screening. Randomisation was to long-course (28 days) or short-course (&#8804;10 days) antibiotic therapy. Choice of antibiotics was determined by the clinical team. Participants were followed up for 90 days. Primary outcomes were willingness of participants to be randomised and feasibility of trial procedures. RESULTS: In total, 172 patients were screened, 84/172 (48.8%) were eligible, and 31/84 (36.9%) were randomised. Patients were assigned to either the short-course arm (18/31, 58.0%) or the long-course arm (13/31, 41.9%). One patient in the short-course arm withdrew after randomisation. In the short-course arm, 4/17 (23.5%) were treated for a cIAI relapse vs 0/13 (0.0%) relapses in the long-course arm.

METHODS: The univariable and multivariable analysis were computed to identify the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. The prediction model was established in a retrospective training set of 322 COVID-19 patients and was re-evaluated in a prospective validation set of 317 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: The multivariable analysis identified age (OR = 1.061, p = 0.028), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR = 1.006, p = 0.037), and CD4 count (OR = 0.993, p = 0.006) as the independent predictors of COVID-19 progression. Consequently, the age-LDH-CD4 algorithm was derived as (age  LDH)/CD4 count. In the training set, the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of age-LDH-CD4 model was significantly higher than that of single CD4 count, LDH, or age (0.92, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively).

HYPOTHESES: We hypothesized that telepsychology use among forensic practitioners would substantially increase during the pandemic. Additional exploratory research questions examined (a) changes in the frequency, type, nature, and motivation for use of telepsychology; (b) changes in impressions of advantages and disadvantages; and (c) barriers specific to the remote administration of assessment instruments in forensic evaluations. METHOD: We disseminated an online survey to one group of forensic practitioners (N = 128; 52% female, 89% White, Mage = 48 years) via various listservs approximately 4 months before COVID-19 shutdowns in the United States and to a second group of forensic practitioners (N = 156; 63% female, 90% White, Mage = 48 years) 1 year later (approximately 8 months after COVID-19 shutdowns began). RESULTS: Respondents used telepsychology at a significantly higher rate after the onset of COVID-19 (92%, n = 143) than before its onset (55%, n = 71). Nonusers of telepsychology before COVID-19 identified a number of perceived barriers to its use that were unsubstantiated by telepsychology users both before and during COVID-19 (e.g., rapport issues, confidentiality, and privacy issues). CONCLUSION: Self-reported use of telepsychology in forensic practice has nearly doubled since the pandemic began. Forensic practitioners will likely continue to use telepsychology, requiring research to address some of their remaining concerns.

The current COVID-19 pandemic is a scenario for which such models are of obvious importance. In Brger et al. (2019) it is demonstrated that some PGMs are better at fitting data of specific epidemic outbreaks than others even when the models have the same number of parameters. This situation motivates the need to measure differences in the dynamics that two different models are capable of generating. The present work contributes to a systematic study of differences between PGMs and how these may explain the ability of certain models to provide a better fit to data than others. To this end a so-called empirical directed distance (EDD) is defined to describe the differences in the dynamics between different dynamic models. The EDD of one PGM from another one quantifies how well the former fits data generated by the latter. The concept of EDD is, however, not symmetric in the usual sense of metric spaces.

The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modeled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The~following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is 2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to SARS in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The~healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare \`do-nothing' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vaccine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic.

We aim to determine in a large cohort of heart failure admissions whether patients are less likely to survive if admitted during weekend or Bank Holidays. Methods - A retrospective study of consecutive admissions with heart failure as 1st diagnostic position in Blackpool Victoria Hospital over an 18 month period from 1st August 2019 to 31st January 2021.

Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79C90%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3C0.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7C96.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.","output":"Assessing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & aims Covid-19 is a hypercatabolic disease with possible pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms, and consequent deterioration of the nutritional status and worse clinical prognosis.

This has impacted the UK education sector with many universities halting campus-based teaching and examinations. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 on final year medical students examinations and placements in the United Kingdom (UK) and how it might impact their confidence and preparedness going into their first year of foundation training. METHODS: A 10-item online survey was distributed to final year medical students across 33 UK medical schools. The survey was designed by combining dichotomous, multiple choice and likert response scale questions. Participants were asked about the effect that the COVID-19 global pandemic had on final year medical written exams, electives, assistantships and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The survey also explored the students confidence and preparedness going into their first year of training under these new unprecedented circumstances. RESULTS: Four hundred forty students from 32 UK medical schools responded. 38.4% (n = 169) of respondents had their final OSCEs cancelled while 43.0% (n = 189) had already completed their final OSCEs before restrictions. 43.0% (n = 189) of assistantship placements were postponed while 77.3% (n = 340) had electives cancelled. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations and student assistantships significantly affected students preparedness (respectively p = 0.025, 0.008, 0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p = 0.0005). The majority of students feel that measures taken during this pandemic to amend their curricula was necessary. Respondents also agree that assisting in hospitals during the outbreak would be a valuable learning opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: The impact on medical student education has been significant, particularly affecting the transition from student to doctor. This study showed the disruptions to student assistantships had the biggest effect on students confidence and preparedness. For those willing to assist in hospitals to join the front-line workforce, it is crucial to maintain their wellbeing with safeguards such as proper inductions, support and supervision.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on final year medical students in the United Kingdom: a national survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe administration of a third (booster) dose of COVID-19 vaccines in Peru initially employed the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) mRNA vaccine. The national vaccination program started with healthcare workers (HCW) who received BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm) vaccine as primary regimen and elderly people previously immunized with BNT162b2. This study evaluated the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the \\"booster\\" dose in these two groups in Lima, Peru. MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study, recruiting participants from November to December of 2021 in Lima, Peru. We evaluated immunogenicity and reactogenicity in HCW and elderly patients previously vaccinated with either two doses of BBIBP-CorV (heterologous regimen) or BTN162b2 (homologous regimen). Immunogenicity was measured by anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels immediately before boosting dose and 14 days later. IgG geometric means (GM) and medians were obtained, and modeled using ANCOVA and quantile regressions. ResultsThe GM of IgG levels increased significantly after boosting: from 28.5{+/-}5.0 AU/mL up to 486.6{+/-}1.2 AU/mL (p<0.001) which corresponds to a 17-fold increase. The heterologous vaccine regimen produced higher GM of post-booster anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, eliciting a 13% fold increase in the geometric mean ratio (95%CI: 1.02-1.27) and a median difference of 92.3 AU/ml (95%CI: 24.9-159.7). Both were safe and well tolerated. Previous COVID-19 infection was also associated with higher pre and post-booster IgG GM levels. ConclusionAlthough both boosting regimens were highly immunogenic, two doses of BBIBP-CorV boosted with BTN162b2 produced a stronger IgG antibody response than the homologous BNT162b2 regimen in the Peruvian population. Additionally, both regimens were mildly reactogenic and well-tolerated.","output":"Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of a third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine for COVID-19 after a primary regimen with BBIBP-CorV or BNT162b2 vaccines in Lima, Peru"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Persons with mental disorders (PwMDs) are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, but empirical data on PwMDs' vaccine uptake and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines are lacking. This study examined the uptake, acceptance, and hesitancy associated with COVID-19 vaccines among Chinese PwMDs during China's nationwide vaccine rollout. In total, 906 adult PwMDs were consecutively recruited from a large psychiatric hospital in Wuhan, China, and administered a self-report questionnaire, which comprised standardized questions regarding sociodemographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, and psychopathology. Vaccine-recipients were additionally asked to report adverse events that occurred following vaccination. PwMDs had a much lower rate of vaccination than Wuhan residents (10.8 vs. 40.0%). The rates of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy were 58.1 and 31.1%, respectively. Factors associated with vaccine uptake included having other mental disorders [odds ratio (OR) = 3.63], believing that 50% of vaccine-recipients would be immune to COVID-19 (OR = 3.27), being not worried about the side effects (OR = 2.59), and being an outpatient (OR = 2.24). Factors associated with vaccine acceptance included perceiving a good preventive effect of vaccines (OR = 12.92), believing that vaccines are safe (OR = 4.08), believing that 50% of vaccine-recipients would be immune to COVID-19 (OR = 2.20), and good insight into the mental illness (OR = 1.71). Adverse events occurred in 21.4% of vaccine-recipients and exacerbated pre-existing psychiatric symptoms in 2.0% of vaccine-recipients. Nevertheless, 95.2% of vaccine-recipients rated adverse events as acceptable. Compared to the 58.1% vaccine acceptance rate and the 40.0% vaccination rate in the general population, the 10.8% vaccine coverage rate suggested a large unmet need for COVID-19 vaccination in Chinese PwMDs. Strategies to increase vaccination coverage among PwMDs may include provision of reliable sources of information on vaccines, health education to foster positive attitudes toward vaccines, a practical guideline to facilitate clinical decision-making for vaccination, and the involvement of psychiatrists in vaccine consultation and post-vaccination follow-up services.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake, Acceptance, and Hesitancy Among Persons With Mental Disorders During the Second Stage of China's Nationwide Vaccine Rollout"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We developed a smartphone application, MyGeneRank, to conduct a prospective observational cohort study (NCT03277365) involving the automated generation, communication, and electronic capture of response to a polygenic risk score (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD).

This dispersal function contributes to the formation and maintenance of plant communities and may allow range shifts for plant species under global change. However, our current understanding of what seed or plant traits are important for this dispersal mechanism, and how they relate to variation in waterbird traits, is extremely limited. We addressed this question using a unique dataset identifying the plant species whose seeds are ingested by 31 different waterfowl species in Europe. We used RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to explore relationships between (1) bird morphological and foraging strategy traits, and (2) plant traits related to seed morphology, environmental preferences, and growth form. We then used Generalized Additive Models to identify relationships between plant/seed traits and the number of waterfowl species that disperse them. Although many waterfowl feed intentionally on seeds, available seed trait data provided little explanation for patterns compared to plant traits such as Ellenberg indicators of habitat preference and life form. Geese were associated with terrestrial plants, ingesting seeds as they graze on land. Diving ducks were associated with strictly aquatic plants, ingesting seeds as they feed at greater depths. Dabbling ducks ingest seeds from plants with high light and temperature requirements, especially shoreline and ruderal species growing in or around the dynamic and shallow microhabitats favored by these birds. Overall, the number of waterfowl vector species (up to 13 per plant species) increases for plants with greater soil moisture requirements and salinity tolerance, reflecting the inclination of most waterfowl species to feed in coastal wetlands. Our findings underline the importance of waterfowl dispersal for plants that are not strictly aquatic, as well as for plants associated with high salinities. Furthermore, our results reveal a soil moisture gradient that drives seed-bird interactions, in line with differences between waterfowl groups in their microhabitat preferences along the land-water continuum. This study provides an important advance in our understanding of the interactions that define plant dispersal in wetlands and their surroundings, and of what plants might be affected by ongoing changes in the distributions of waterfowl species.","output":"Functional Traits Drive Dispersal Interactions Between European Waterfowl and Seeds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An important aspect of the diagnosis procedure in daily clinical practice is the analysis of dental radiographs.

Material: & Methods: We performed a retrospective study in eight ICU within eight French hospitals. All consecutive adult patients (aged 18 years old) admitted in the ICU with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute respiratory failure were included in the analysis. Causes and timing of death were reported based on medical records. A binomial logistic regression statistical analysis was performed to identify the determinants associated with ICU-mortality. Results: : From March 1 st, 2020 to April 28 th , 287 patients were admitted to ICU for SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory failure. COVID-19 related multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS) was the leading cause of death (29%, n=27/93). End-of-life decisions occurred in 25% of patients (n=23/93). Secondary infections-related MODS accounted for 21% of ICU death, with a majority of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Fatal ischemic events (venous or arterial) occurred in 12% of patients. Refractory hypoxemia was a relatively uncommon cause of death and occurred only in 8 cases (9%). Regarding the timing of death, only one death occurred during the first three days of ICU admission. Determinants associated with ICU-mortality in logistic regression were age >65, requirement for vasopressors, renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Then, a 4-factor-three-level experimental scheme designed by the Box-Benhnken Design was applied on the basis of a single experiment to determine the extraction yield and the antioxidant property. Finally, the extraction process was optimized through response surface methodology (RSM) and the genetic neural network (GNN), respectively. RESULTS: The use of betaine-lactic acid as an extractant displayed significant advantages in the screening process. The optimum extraction parameters provided by GNN were as follows: water content 25% (v/v), liquid to material ratio 190 mg/ml, extraction time 37 min, and extraction temperature 63 C.

Many studies suggest the great effect of the existing vaccines to protect against symptomatic cases of death by the COVID-19 virus. This paper, proposes to compare the main antigenic proteins sequences of the existing vaccines with Spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our choice of S protein is justified by the major role that plays it in the receptor recognition and membrane fusion process based on an intelligent system. Herein, we focus on finding a correlation between S protein and compulsory vaccines in the countries that have a less death number by COVID-19 virus. In this work, we have used a combination of coding methods, signal processing, and bioinformatic techniques with the goal to localize the similar patterns between the S gene of the SARS-Cov-2 genome and 14 investigated vaccines. RESULTS: A total of 8 similar sequences which have a size more than 6 amino acids were identified.

VLPs can target both arms of the immune response, with some VLPs initiating production of specific antibodies and others activating cytotoxic T cells. VLPs are also exceptionally versatile, conferring protection against the host virus or acting as a scaffold for antigenic molecules. In addition, VLP can support intraparticulate encapsulation for immunomodulation and gene delivery. VLP vaccines have been developed for prophylactic protection against infectious organisms, and therapeutic treatment of conditions such as Alzheimers disease, hypertension, and cancer.

Whilst pharmacists are involved in the final step of the FMD requirements with the decommissioning of medicines at the point of supply to patients, limited research has been conducted to investigate the impact of fulfilling these requirements on the relevant stakeholders. OBJECTIVE: To examine community pharmacists' views on how the FMD has affected their practice. METHODS: An online survey was disseminated via email in June 2020 to pharmacists in Ireland (n = 4727), who were invited to participate if practising full time or part time in community pharmacies. Quantitative data were captured through multiple option and Likert-scale questions, and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were captured by use of a free-text box, with the open comments analysed thematically. RESULTS: In total, 618 valid responses were received (13.1% response rate). Most perceived that FMD requirements increased waiting times for patients (82%) and reduced time interacting with patients (65%). Only 28% agreed/strongly agreed that the introduction of the FMD legislation improves patient safety. In the open comments, the need for medicine authentication was acknowledged, but it was believed that this should be the wholesalers' responsibility, not pharmacists' responsibility. The additional step of medicines decommissioning was viewed as a time-consuming distraction to clinical checks that increased the risk for error. Pharmacists complained that they were not remunerated for the lost staff productivity or the additional software and equipment costs. Many pharmacists felt that the increased workload was disproportionate to the small risk of patients receiving falsified medicines.

The CDC recommends every adult receive the annual influenza vaccine and patients with certain comorbidities receive the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). However, vaccination rates among IBD patients remain unacceptably low. The aim of our study is to present influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations rates of IBD patients at our center. Methods We hypothesized that vaccination rates will be suboptimal at our outpatient center and that patients are not being vaccinated based on comorbid conditions in accordance with guidelines. We retrieved electronic medical records from the gastroenterology clinic between December 2018 and December 2019. Data regarding influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, immunosuppressive drugs, and comorbidities were obtained. Microsoft Excel and SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) were used for data analyses. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results In total, 109 IBD patients were identified, 46.8% female and 53.2% male. The majority were African American (77.06%). The mean age was 45 years. Around 26.61% of the patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. Around 28.7% received the annual influenza vaccine, 42.2% PPSV23 alone, 19.27% PCV13 alone, and 16.5% received both. Patients >50 years were more likely to receive the influenza vaccine (P = 0.0122). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy were not more likely to be vaccinated with both PCV13 and PPSV23 (P = 0.1848, P = 0.7382). Active smokers were not more likely to be vaccinated with PPSV23 (P = 0.695). Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and sickle-cell disease were more likely to be vaccinated with both PCV13 and PPSV23 (P = 0.02, P = 0.02). Patients with other chronic medical conditions were more likely to be vaccinated with PPSV23 (P = 0.0201). Conclusion Our study revealed suboptimal influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates among IBD patients at our facility.

This process is further affected by a willingness to vaccinate, embedded in the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. The World Health Organization has listed vaccine hesitancy among the greatest threats to global health, calling for research to identify the factors associated with this phenomenon. Methods: The present study seeks to investigate the psychological, contextual, and sociodemographic factors associated with vaccination hesitancy in a large sample of the adult population. 4571 Norwegian adults were recruited through an online survey between January 23 to February 2, 2021. Subgroup analyses and multiple logistic regression was utilized to identify the covariates of vaccine hesitancy. Results: Several subgroups hesitant toward vaccination were identified, including males, rural residents, and parents with children below 18 years of age. No differences were found between natives and non-natives, across education or age groups. Individuals preferring unmonitored media platforms (e.g., information from peers, social media, online forums, and blogs) more frequently reported hesitance towards vaccination than those relying on information obtainment from source-verified platforms. Perceived risk of vaccination, belief in the superiority of natural immunity, fear concerning significant others being infected by the virus, and trust in health officials dissemination of vaccine-related information were identified as key variables related to vaccine hesitancy. Conclusions: Given the heterogeneous range of variables associated with vaccine hesitancy, additional strategies to eradicate vaccination fears are called for aside from campaigns targeting the spread of false information.

Despite its associated significant morbidity and mortality, there are no definitive cures and no fully preventative measures to combat SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the urgency to identify the pathobiological mechanisms underlying increased risk for and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mounting. One contributing factor, the accumulation of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, is a leading trigger for the activation of nuclear factor-kB and the IRF (interferon regulatory factors), such as IRF7. Activation of these pathways, particularly in the lung and other organs, such as the heart, contributes to a burst of cytokine release, which predisposes to significant tissue damage, loss of function, and mortality. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds damage-associated molecular patterns is expressed in the lung and heart, and in priming organs, such as the blood vessels (in diabetes) and adipose tissue (in obesity), and transduces the pathological signals emitted by damage-associated molecular patterns. It is proposed that damage-associated molecular pattern-RAGE enrichment in these priming tissues, and in the lungs and heart during active infection, contributes to the widespread tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the RAGE axis might play seminal roles in and be a target for therapeutic intervention in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Journey to a Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products Connection in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: With Stops Along the Way in the Lung, Heart, Blood Vessels, and Adipose Tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the attitude of final-year dental students towards their paediatric dentistry training and their confidence in treating child patients. METHODS: A 55-item questionnaire was distributed online and physically to the final-year BDSc (Hons) students at The University of Queensland (Australia). The questionnaire consisted of four parts including theoretical knowledge, clinical observational experience, preclinical training and clinical training in paediatric dentistry. Self-reported confidence was recorded using five-point Likert scale questions ranging from not confident at all to completely confident, which were allocated the numbers 1C5, respectively. Jamovi and GraphPad Prism were used for data analysis and creation of graphs. RESULTS: A total of 47 students completed the questionnaire giving a response rate of 77%. Approximately two-thirds of participants had previous experience working with children and 70% had observed a practitioner providing paediatric dental treatment. The students reported the lowest level of clinical confidence for pulp therapy (M = 2.32; SD = 1.08). The clinical confidence in dental trauma management was also reported to be low (M = 2.50; SD = 1.15). The clinical administration of local anaesthetic (LA) had the highest level of confidence (M = 3.95; SD = 1.03). The students reported that they were highly confident in the theoretical knowledge of behaviour guidance techniques (M = 3.64; SD = 0.97) and preclinical training involving examination, treatment planning and preventative procedures (M = 4.33, SD = 0.67).

These are used as household, agricultural and industrial rodenticides and in production of ammunitions, firecrackers and fertilizers. In absence of a clinically available laboratory test for diagnosis or toxin measurement or an antidote, managing their poisoning is challenging even at a tertiary care center with a dedicated liver intensive care unit (LICU) and liver transplant facility. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with YPMP related ALF were monitored using standardized clinical, hemodynamic, biochemical, metabolic, neurological, electrocardiography (ECG) and SOFA score and managed using uniform intensive care, treatment and transplant protocols in LICU. Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical and biochemical parameters and scores were summarized and compared between 3 groups i.e. spontaneous survivors, transplanted patients and non-survivors. Predictors of spontaneous survival and the need for liver transplant are also evaluated. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with YPMP related ALF were about 32 years old (63.2% females) and presented to us at a median of 3 (0 C 10) days after poisoning. YPMP related cardiotoxicity was rapidly progressive and fatal whereas liver transplant was therapeutic for ALF. Spontaneous survivors had lower dose ingestion (<17.5 grams), absence of cardiotoxicity, < grade 3 HE, lactate < 5.8, SOFA score < 14.5, and increase in SOFA score by < 5.5. Patients with renal failure need for CVVHDF and KCC positivity on account of PT-INR > 6.5 had higher mortality risk.

DESIGN We sourced English articles published up to July 2020 across five databases using search terms involving CNCs, family caregivers and resilience. RESULTS A total of 50 studies were retained. Nearly half (44%) of the studies used trait-based resilience definitions, while about one third (36%) used process-based definitions. Twelve different resilience scales were used, revealing mostly moderate to high-resilience levels. Findings confirmed that resilience is related to multiple indicators of healthy functioning (e.g., quality of life, social support, positive coping), as it buffers against negative outcomes of burden and distress. Discordance relating to the interaction between resilience and demographic, sociocultural and environmental factors was apparent. CONCLUSIONS Incongruity remains with respect to how resilience is defined and assessed, despite consistent definitional concepts of healthy adaptation and equilibrium. The array of implications of resilience for well-being confirms the potential for resilience to be leveraged within caregiver health promotion initiatives via policy and practice.

METHODS We analysed the prevalence and titres of serum aPL in 122 patients with COVID-19 and 157 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and 91 with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases (oARD) for comparison. IgG/IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and IgG/IgM anti-beta2glycoprotein I (2GPI) were assayed using homemade ELISA, IgA aCL and anti-2GPI by commercial ELISA kits and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) by multiple coagulation tests following updated international guidelines. RESULTS Prevalence of IgG and IgM aCL and of IgG and IgM anti-2GPI across COVID-19 patients were 13.4%, 2.7%, 6.3% and 7.1%, being significantly lower than in PAPS (p<0.0001 for all). Frequency of IgG aCL and IgM anti-2GPI was comparable to oARD (13.4% vs. 13.2% and 7.1% vs. 11%, respectively), while IgG anti-2GPI and IgM aCL were lower (p<0.01).

Universities and colleges are potential settings for its spread. Methods: An interdisciplinary team from public health, virology, and biology used narrative methods to summarise and synthesise evidence on key control measures, taking account of mode of transmission. Results: Evidence from a wide range of primary studies supports six measures. Vaccinate (aim for > 90% coverage and make it easy to get a jab). Require masks indoors, especially in crowded settings. If everyone wears well-fitting cloth masks, source control will be high, but for maximum self-protection, respirator masks should be worn. Masks should not be removed for speaking or singing. Space people out by physical distancing (but there is no safe distance because transmission risk varies with factors such as ventilation, activity levels and crowding), reducing class size (including offering blended learning), and cohorting (students remain in small groups with no cross-mixing).

Nursing education for family caregivers is considered a workable and effective intervention, but the validity of this intervention in RA has not been reported. AIM: To explore whether family caregiver nursing education (FCNE) works on patients with RA and the factors that influence FCNE. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, a sample of 158 pairs was included in the study with 80 in the intervention group and 78 in the control group. Baseline data of patients and caregivers was collected. The FCNE intervention was administered to caregivers, and inflammation level indicators, disease activity indicators and mood disorder indicators of patients were followed up and analyzed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of the intervention and the control groups had no significant difference. Indicators were significantly reduced in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group showed significant differences in stratification of relationship, education duration and age. CONCLUSION: The effect of FCNE on RA is multifaceted, weakening inflammation level, alleviating disease activity and relieving mood disorder.

For both groups, compassion and empathy represent a major component of future professional roles. For medical students, this takes the form of the all-important doctor-patient relationship and adherence to the Hippocratic Oath. For biomedical students, future research and teaching are often driven by the opportunity to contribute to treatments to help pain and suffering for those in need. For both groups, such positive contributions further extend to families, who often suffer emotional distress watching the health struggles of a loved one. Given the key role that compassion and empathy play here, including them as part of student educational development is important. Such focus, however, is limited - especially during the initial academic classroom years - with most time here dedicated to the learning of facts and foundational material. Given its importance in the future professional roles of these students, we posit that more can be done to introduce and reinforce the concept of compassion and empathy during the initial didactic course years. Modest but viable options exist for the introduction of these concepts as a part of basic teaching that will provide additional reinforcement of this all-important sensitivity for others. Here we present a model providing suggestions and recommendations for the integration of compassion and empathy in otherwise basic scientific teaching, and in a way that also includes progressive equality positions on social issues. While the focus here is medical school education since it represents this authors expertise as well as a field where young trainees graduate to professional careers requiring compassion, it can potentially be applied to many other disciplines.","output":"Compassion and Empathy in Basic Medical Science Teaching: A Suggested Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study investigated how COVID-19-related media exposure during the COVID-19 crisis was related to same-day and next-day COVID-19-related worries. DESIGN A 21-day diary study was conducted between late March and late April 2020 in Germany. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12). Every evening, participants indicated their exposure to COVID-19-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their COVID-19-related worries. RESULTS Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more COVID-19-related worries on days with higher exposure to COVID-19-related media. Dynamical structural equation models provided evidence for a reciprocal cycle across days: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of worries. CONCLUSION These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle whereby consuming crisis-related media and worrying reciprocally influence each other across days, possibly amplifying adverse effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike on mental and physical health.","output":"Dynamic relations among COVID-19-related media exposure and worries during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant global public health burden, leading to an urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies.

Given the adaptive potential of viruses in general and the RNA viruses in particular, the selection of viral mutants that display some degree of resistance to inhibitors or vaccines is a tangible challenge. Mutant selection may jeopardize control of the viral disease. Strategies intended to minimize vaccination and treatment failures are proposed and justified based on fundamental features of viral dynamics explained in the preceding chapters. The recommended use of complex, multiepitopic vaccines, and combination therapies as early as possible after initiation of infection falls under the general concept that complexity cannot be combated with simplicity. It also follows that sociopolitical action to interrupt virus replication and spread as soon as possible is as important as scientifically sound treatment designs to control viral disease on a global scale.","output":"Chapter 8 Quasispecies dynamics in disease prevention and control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lamellar body (LB) of the alveolar type II (ATII) cell is a lysosome-related organelle (LRO) that contains surfactant, a complex mix of mainly lipids and specific surfactant proteins. The major function of surfactant in the lung is the reduction of surface tension and stabilization of alveoli during respiration. Its lack or deficiency may cause various forms of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Surfactant is also part of the innate immune system in the lung, defending the organism against air-borne pathogens. The limiting (organelle) membrane that encloses the LB contains various transporters that are in part responsible for translocating lipids and other organic material into the LB. On the other hand, this membrane contains ion transporters and channels that maintain a specific internal ion composition including the acidic pH of about 5. Furthermore, P2X(4) receptors, ligand gated ion channels of the danger signal ATP, are expressed in the limiting LB membrane. They play a role in boosting surfactant secretion and fluid clearance. In this review, we discuss the functions of these transporting pathways of the LB, including possible roles in disease and as therapeutic targets, including viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Channels and Transporters of the Pulmonary Lamellar Body in Health and Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To mitigate SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 transmission, vaccines have been urgently approved.

As the vaccination coverage reached 60% and 80%, the total infections could be reduced by 32.72% and 41.19%, compared to the number without vaccination. When the durations of immunity were 90 and 120 days, the infection rates were 2.67 and 2.38. As the asymptomatic infection rate rose from 30% to 50%, the infection rate increased 0.92 (SD, 0.16) times.

The government of Kenya is implementing a phased strategy to vaccinate the Kenyan population, initially targeting populations at high risk of severe disease and infection. We estimated the financial and economic unit costs of procuring and delivering the COVID-19 vaccine in Kenya across various vaccination strategies. MethodsWe used an activity-based costing approach to estimate the incremental costs of COVID-19 vaccine delivery, from a health systems perspective. Document reviews and key informant interviews (n=12) were done to inform the activities, assumptions and the resources required. Unit prices were derived from document reviews or from market prices. Both financial and economic vaccine procurement costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses, and the vaccine delivery costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses were estimated and reported in 2021USD. ResultsThe financial costs of vaccine procurement per person vaccinated with 2-doses ranged from $2.89-$13.09 in the 30% and 100% coverage levels respectively, however, the economic cost was $17.34 across all strategies. Financial vaccine delivery costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses, ranged from $4.28-$3.29 in the 30% and 100% coverage strategies: While the economic delivery costs were two to three times higher than the financial costs. The total procurement and delivery costs per person vaccinated with 2-doses ranged from $7.34-$16.47 for the financial costs and $29.7-$24.68 for the economic costs for the 30% and 100% coverage respectively. With the exception of procurement costs, the main cost driver of financial and economic delivery costs was supply chain costs (47-59%) and advocacy, communication and social mobilization (29-35%) respectively.

METHODS: A methodological study was conducted according to the guidelines provided by the development team. The study consisted of a forward-backward translation and a cross-cultural adaptation. After the original authors confirmation, a cognitive debriefing was conducted with 30 professionals who work with deaf young people and with 10 deaf adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. RESULTS: For the linguistic translation and cross-cultural adaptation, some variations to the original instrument were made to obtain equivalence, such as the expression deaf or hard of hearing translated only with the Italian word sordo. During the cognitive debriefing, the clarity and comprehensibility of the items were reported by professionals and deaf adolescents. Eventually, the authors approved the final version. CONCLUSION: The YQOL-DHH was translated and culturally adapted into Italian. The translated items were pertinent to the Italian culture and equivalent to the original ones. A validation study is suggested to make the instrument feasible for use in different clinical or educational contexts. In addition, to guarantee accessibility and autonomy for young deaf signers, Italian Sign Language translation of the questionnaire is suggested.","output":"Italian Version of the YQOL-DHH Questionnaire: Translation and Cross-cultural Adaptation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drawing on Moreno's cognitive-affective theory of learning with media, this research aims to investigate the effectiveness of different multimedia glosses on learners' vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension in a CALL environment. A total of 160 university students who learnt English as a foreign language (EFL) in four classes participated in the study and were exposed to one of the four conditions: (a) L2 definition only, (b) L2 definition coupled with audio, (c) L2 definition plus video, and (d) L2 definition with picture. Participants were asked to read eight hypermediated reading texts. Reading comprehension as well as vocabulary acquisition were measured using a pretestCposttest design. The results show first that all these four conditions led to students' vocabulary gains. More specifically, participants who had access to L2 definition plus picture and plus videos achieved significantly higher scores than the other two groups, L2 definition coupled with audio and L2 definition only. Concerning reading comprehension, all multimedia glossing presentation led to better reading comprehension, but no differences were found among all the glossing groups. The questionnaire and interview data indicate that students preferred L2 definition coupled with video and picture glosses, followed by audio and L2 definition only. The results reflect that multimedia glossing presentation creates a different effect on students' vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension, respectively.

We aimed to analyse the outcomes of patients with CLD who were hospitalized due to COVID-19. METHODS: Medical records of 4014 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in a regional referral hospital over a 12-month period were analysed. Patients with CLD were identified based on discharge diagnoses according to ICD-10 classification. Patients were followed for 30 days from admission, and their outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation (MV) or death) were analysed. RESULTS: Of the 4014 patients, 110 (2.7%) had CLD and 49 (1.2%) had cirrhosis. Median age of CLD patients was 67.5 years, 79 (71.8%) were males, 224 (23.5%) obese, 56 (50.9%) reported alcohol abuse, 24 (21.8%) had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 11 (10%) viral hepatitis and 98 (89.1%) had pneumonia. Median length of hospitalization was 12 days, 32 (29.1%) patients required ICU admission and 23 (20.9%) MV, while 43 (39.1%) died. In univariate analysis, patients with cirrhosis (45% vs 73%, HR=2.95; P<0.001), but not those with non-cirrhotic CLD (74% vs 73%, P>0.05), experienced worse 30-days survival when compared to age, sex and COVID-19 duration matched cohorts. In a logistic regression analysis conducted on the overall and matched cohorts, liver cirrhosis, but not CLD, predicted inferior survival independently of age, comorbidities and severity of COVID-19, with a fourfold higher adjusted risk of 30-day mortality.

METHODS: Analysis of deidentified data from an Australian cross-sectional national telephone-based survey (October 2015 to June 2018) of sport and physical recreation participation over the previous 12 months, and barriers and motivations to participation. Descriptive statistics (incorporating weighted proportions), (2) tests and regression analyses were conducted to describe aspects of participation and compare those with and without self-reported disability. RESULTS: Of the 54 343 adults surveyed, 15% reported a disability. Adults with a disability were half as likely to meet physical activity guidelines through sport and/or physical recreation than adults without a disability (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.57). A greater proportion of adults with a disability participated in physical recreation only (40% vs 31%; (2)=187; p<0.001), whereas a greater proportion of adults without a disability participated in sport only (20% vs 12%; (2)=188; p<0.001). Adults with a disability were more motivated than adults without a disability to try a new activity for physical health or fitness benefits (55% vs 46%; (2)=36; p<0.001). The most reported barrier to participation for adults with a disability not currently participating in sport and/or physical recreation was poor health or injury (62%), whereas for adults without a disability it was lack of time/too many other commitments (43%). CONCLUSION: Adults with a disability are less physically active and report different physical activity profiles and barriers to being active than adults without a disability.

This affects the most vulnerable urban areas, leading to unequal levels of impact from crises and disasters within cities. As a response, local collective actions, led by citizens, have emerged to manage risks. In Medellin, Colombia, in the context of the current COVID-19 crisis, our research identified a diverse repertoire of collective actions within informal, vulnerable communities, including collaboration towards improving food security, sanitation, pedagogy for self-care and prevention, and financial aid. Although these actions have had limited scope within the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they demonstrate the need to promote a more proactive interaction between society and the state, based on a series of agreed interventions, promoting the exchange of knowledge and articulation of actions in the production and improvement of informal urban areas. This research explores how these collective actions have developed through a set of semi-structured interviews with community leaders and key actors in Medellin, with a view to identifying lessons for state-community dynamics in relation to disaster risk management and achieving a more integrated approach to improving habitat conditions within vulnerable urban areas. This work demonstrates that vulnerable communities in informal urban settlements can actively address their exposure to risk through locally-oriented, bottom-up collective actions.

The confirmation of hit compounds as true inhibitors requires additional assays, cost, and time to progress from hit identification to lead drug-candidate optimization. To explore whether the use of fluorescence lifetime technology (FLT) can offer comparable benefits to label-free-based approaches such as RapidFire mass spectroscopy (RF-MS) and a superior readout compared to time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), three equivalent assays were developed against the clinically validated tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and screened against annotated compound sets. FLT provided a marked decrease in the number of false-positive hits when compared to TR-FRET. Further cellular screening confirmed that a number of potential inhibitors directly interacted with TYK2 and inhibited the downstream phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 protein (STAT4).","output":"Reducing False Positives through the Application of Fluorescence Lifetime Technology: A Comparative Study Using TYK2 Kinase as a Model System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper aims to reach insights into city branding in the Covid-19 context to discuss the projected brand propositions and their reliance oan sustainable brand attributes and values This study explores the immediate response of overtouristified cities to the post-pandemic crisis by focusing on four iconic cultural cities in Italy, which are Florence, Milan, Rome, and Venice, and the related Facebook communication in summer 2020, right after the end of the lockdown following the first wave of contagion in the country A content analysis of the official Facebook accounts of these cities provided an explorative insight into different destination brand approaches to dealing with the pandemic threat, revealed fading urban characters of the tourism experience and an expansion of the destinations from a spatial perspective, towards city-region destinations The findings suggest potential configurations of the sustainable destination brand whose formation, in the case of the overtouristified cities, deserves further attention throughout the evolution of the Covid-19 crisis","output":"Sustainability in Overtouristified Cities?

RNA-seq profiling identified distinct transcriptomes of ACE2-expressing relative cells to non-expressing cells, with enrichment in functionally related genes and transcription factor target sets.

Results: Of the 6189 papers that were identified, 72 articles were included in the systematic review (40 case series and 32 cohort studies) and 68 articles (38 case series and 30 cohort studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Of the 31,953 SARS-CoV-2 patients included in the meta-analysis, the overall pooled proportion who had a laboratory-confirmed bacterial infection was 15.9% (95% CI 13.6C18.2, n = 1940, 49 studies, I(2) = 99%, p < 0.00001), while 3.7% (95% CI 2.6C4.8, n = 177, 16 studies, I(2) = 93%, p < 0.00001) had fungal infections and 6.6% (95% CI 5.5C7.6, n = 737, 44 studies, I(2) = 96%, p < 0.00001) had other respiratory viruses.

Researchers throughout the globe are still struggling to understand this strain's aggressiveness in search of putative therapies for its control. Crosstalk between oxidative stress and systemic inflammation seems to support the progression of the infection. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that mainly participates in cell proliferation, development, stress, and inflammation in humans. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an important structural protein responsible for viral replication and interferes with the host defence mechanism by the help of Gsk-3 protein. The virally infected cells show activated Gsk-3 protein that degrades the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) protein, resulting in excessive oxidative stress. Activated Gsk-3 also modulates CREB-DNA activity, phosphorylates NF-?B, and degrades -catenin, thus provokes systemic inflammation. Interaction between these two pathophysiological events, oxidative stress, and inflammation enhance mucous secretion, coagulation cascade, and hypoxia, which ultimately leads to multiple organs failure, resulting in the death of the infected patient. The present review aims to highlight the pathogenic role of Gsk-3 in viral replication, initiation of oxidative stress, and inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The purpose of this review was to investigate the association between preoperative CPET variables and postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and quality of life in patients undergoing cancer surgery. METHODS: A search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and Web of science from inception to April 2020. Cohort studies investigating the association between preoperative CPET variables, including peak oxygen uptake (peak VO(2)), anaerobic threshold (AT), or ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (V(E)/V(CO2)), and postoperative outcomes (complications, length of stay, and quality of life) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. A random-effect model meta-analysis was performed whenever possible. RESULTS: Fifty-two unique studies, including 10,030 patients were included. Overall, most studies were rated as having low risk of bias. Higher preoperative peak VO(2) was associated with absence of postoperative complications (mean difference [MD]: 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26C3.29) and no pulmonary complication (MD: 1.47; 95% CI: 0.49C2.45).

Polymerase chain reaction of the aspiration fluid of the liver lesion and pericardial and pleural fluid stored from the previous hospitalization were all positive for E. histolytica. Together with the positive serum antibody for E. histolytica, a diagnosis of amebic pericarditis was made. Notably, the diagnosis was missed initially and was made retrospectively by performing PCR testing. The patient improved with metronidazole 750 mg thrice daily for 14 days, followed by paromomycin 500 mg thrice daily for 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that, although only 122 cases of amebic pericarditis have been reported, clinicians should be aware of E. histolytica as a potential causative pathogen. The polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect E. histolytica in the pericardial effusion and was found to be useful for the diagnosis of amebic pericarditis in addition to the positive results for the serum antibody testing for E. histolytica. Because of the high mortality associated with delayed treatment, prompt diagnosis should be made.","output":"Use of PCR in the diagnosis of pericardial amebiasis: a case report and systematic review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As increasing cases of COVID-19 around world, urgent need for effective COVID-19-specific therapeutic drugs is necessary; therefore, we conducted a pilot randomized-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of 99mTc-MDP for COVID-19 therapeutic treatment. Methods: A total of 21 mild patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this pilot RCT from February 2020 through March 2020, and then were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, into control (11 patients) and 99mTc-MDP group (10 patients). Patients in the control group received routine treatment and patients assigned to the 99mTc-MDP group received a combination of routine treatment and an administration of 99mTc-MDP injection of 5ml/day. Both of the patients in the control and 99mTc-MDP groups were treated for 7 days with the primary end point of CT-based radiological pulmonary changes during 7-day follow-up. Findings: From baseline to the day 7, 8 (80%) of 10 mild patients in the 99mTc-MDP group had a significant radiological improvement in lung and a decline in inflammatory infiltration, whereas only 1 (9.1%) of 11 patients in the control group had a radiological improvement in lung. None of the patients in the 99mTc-MDP group had disease progression from mild to severe, as well as an inflammatory cytokine storm, and 2 mild patients (18.2%) in the control group developed severe. During days 7 through 14, the number of patients with radiological improvement in the 99mTc-MDP group remained consistent, and only 1 additional case (22%) in the control group were reported. Conclusion: In this randomized pilot study, 99mTc-MDP had an effective inhibitory effect on the inflammatory disease progression for the therapy of COVID-19, and it can accelerate the absorption of pulmonary inflammation in a short period of time during the process of treatment.","output":"Pulmonary radiological change of COVID-19 patients with 99mTc-MDP treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: 29-year-old with common variable immunodeficiency, lymphangiomatosis, portal hypertension status post TIPS procedure was lost to follow up He was off gamma globulin and prophylactic antibiotics for fourteen months prior to presentation secondary to insurance issues Early February 2020 patient presented with abdominal distension and hemoptysis He denied fever, shortness of breath or additional respiratory symptoms Initial CT of chest showed basilar cavitary infiltrate Coronavirus PCR testing was positive, presumed SARS-CoV2 Immunoglobulin G level was 467 Case Description: He was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics, antifungals and immunoglobulin replacement He developed fever, worsening respiratory symptoms, and lower lobe infiltrates soon after admission Bronchoscopy was performed, and culture was positive for Aspergillus Blood culture was positive for Streptococcus Agalactiae Paracentesis, TIPS check with balloon dilation, and splenic artery aneurysm coiling were performed He developed thrombosis of greater saphenous vein and was started on anticoagulation He required oxygen supplementation, but not intubation Patient gradually improved and was discharged after seventeen days hospitalization He was continued on antibiotic, antifungal, and anticoagulation at discharge Outpatient follow up was arranged with Immunology, subcutaneous immunoglobulin was resumed, and he continues to clinically improve to baseline three months after discharge Discussion: The knowledge of SARS-CoV2 infections in patients with underlying Immunodeficiency is rapidly evolving Immunodeficiency has been speculated to protect against cytokine storm and hyper inflammation from COVID-19 Markers of cytokine storm were not measured during our patients admission However, despite coinfections and additional sequelae, our patient had no evidence of ARDS or requirement for prolonged respiratory support","output":"Complications of Coronavirus in a Patient with Cvid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an immune-mediated chronic cholestatic liver disease with a slowly progressive course. Without treatment, most patients eventually develop fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver and may need liver transplantation in the late stage of disease. PBC primarily affects women (female preponderance 9C10:1) with a prevalence of up to 1 in 1,000 women over 40 years of age. Common symptoms of the disease are fatigue and pruritus, but most patients are asymptomatic at first presentation. The diagnosis is based on sustained elevation of serum markers of cholestasis, i.e., alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and the presence of serum antimitochondrial antibodies directed against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Histologically, PBC is characterized by florid bile duct lesions with damage to biliary epithelial cells, an often dense portal inflammatory infiltrate and progressive loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts. Although the insight into pathogenetic aspects of PBC has grown enormously during the recent decade and numerous genetic, environmental, and infectious factors have been disclosed which may contribute to the development of PBC, the precise pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only FDA-approved medical treatment for PBC. When administered at adequate doses of 13C15 mg/kg/day, up to two out of three patients with PBC may have a normal life expectancy without additional therapeutic measures. The mode of action of UDCA is still under discussion, but stimulation of impaired hepatocellular and cholangiocellular secretion, detoxification of bile, and antiapoptotic effects may represent key mechanisms. One out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and may need additional medical therapy and/or liver transplantation.

It corresponds to puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats. In this model, susceptible 129 S1/SvImJ mice are administered a rapid intravenous injection that can be accomplished via either the lateral tail vein or the retrobulbar sinus. Because doxorubicin is a highly toxic substance, extravasation must be avoided during the administration of the intravenous injection to prevent the development of large necrotizing lesions and exacerbation of the animals stress. In the present study, we compared the safety and stress of these two injection routes by using histopathological analyses of the animals orbital cavities or tails, respectively. The injection of 14.5 g/g body weight doxorubicin into the mices lateral tail veins (n = 9) or retrobulbar sinuses (n = 19) caused no clinically detectable stress or impairment. Histopathologies of the specimens five days after doxorubicin injection revealed inflammatory lesions at the injection sites in both groups. In the orbital sinus specimens from the retrobulbar-injected group, fibrosis was evident 25 days after injection. Moreover, while all of the retrobulbar-injected mice (100%) developed nephrotic syndrome, tail vein-injected mice had a significantly lower response rate (66%, p = 0.047, Fishers exact test) and exhibited only attenuated features of nephrotic syndrome. It was therefore concluded that doxorubicin administration via either lateral tail vein or retrobulbar sinus injections led to a similar induction of histopathological changes with no effects on the clinical well-being of the mice.

A collection of 295 bacterial isolates was constituted from droppings of capybara, alpaca, muntjac, zebra, tapir, rhinoceros, binturong, armadillo, saki monkey and cockatoo. Of 295 isolates, 51 exhibited antagonism against a panel of pathogenic target bacteria like Escherichia coli MC4100, Clostridium perfringens DSM 756 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Newport ATCC6962. Remarkably, within this collection, only 2 Gram-negative bacilli exhibited activity against E. coli MC4100 strain used as target organism. Then, the 16S rDNA sequencing revealed these thereafter cited species, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Weissella cibaria, E. coli, Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus faecalis.

METHODS: Here, the molecular and virulent characteristics of 44 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected from January 2015 to December 2017 were studied. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were carried out to define the clonal relatedness among the isolates. PCR and capsular serotyping of the virulence-associated genes, as well as biofilm formation and serum complement-mediated killing assays, were employed to determine the virulent potential. The genomic features and associated mobile genetic elements of JmsCRE57 were detected by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: The only positive isolate was JmsCRE57, which belonged to the ST375 serotype K2 that expressed uge, mrkD, fimH, kpn, aerobactin and rmpA virulence-associated genes and showed strong biofilm formation and serum sensitivity. Sequencing results showed that the JmsCRE57 genome mainly consisted of a circular chromosome, three antimicrobial resistant plasmids and a virulent plasmid.

Some common forms include ischemic stroke, cardioembolic stroke, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and multicompartmental hemorrhage. Concurrent brain infarct and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) have not been described in the literature previously. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 35-year hypertensive and COVID-19-positive patient developed sudden-onset spontaneous IVH with concurrent infarct in the left internal capsule. In spite of undergoing an initial CSF drainage procedure, he had persistent worsening sensorium and increasing midline shift on CT imaging, so he underwent a left-sided decompressive craniectomy. One month after discharge, he developed spontaneous extradural hemorrhage at the operative site. In view of impending cerebral herniation, emergency hematoma evacuation was done, which restored his neurological status. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported detailed case of concurrent intracranial infarct and IVH in a patient affected with COVID-19 infection. We also report a rare phenomenon of nontraumatic noncoagulopathic extradural hemorrhage on the decompressive craniectomy site, in this patient 1 month after surgery.","output":"Concurrent intracranial infarct and intraventricular hemorrhage with spontaneous nontraumatic extradural hemorrhage in follow-up: An enigma of COVID-19-associated intracranial vasculopathy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) associated with SARS-CoV-2, causes a severe form of the respiratory illness known as Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).

Multiple drug trials are ongoing and several putative candidates for vaccination against the virus have been approved and are in the pipeline. Many studies have also characterized the immunological profile of patients infected with COVID-19. Some studies suggest that the severity of the COVID-19 infection is directly associated with the cytokine storm.

This study investigated the prevalence of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), bovine group A rotavirus (BoRVA), and bovine torovirus (BToV) in calves aged  60 days, regardless of diarrhea, across nine different regions in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and reported associations between these viruses and diarrhea. Fecal samples were collected rectally from 689 calves: normal (n = 360) and diarrheic (n = 329). BNoV (84/689, 12.2%) was the most prevalent regardless of diarrhea, followed by BCoV (37/689, 5.4%), BToV (15/689, 2.2%), and BoRVA (13/689, 1.9%). Although BCoV (P = 0.032) and BoRVA (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, BNoV and BToV showed no association. Infection by the four pathogens had no relationship with calf age; BoRVA was detected only in calves aged < 30 days, but this finding was not statistically significant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BCoV isolates obtained in this study were distinct from the other known BCoVs, and all BNoV isolates belonged to GIII.2 genotype; genetic variations in BNoVs are present in the ROK. BoRVA isolates distributed in the ROK were assigned to G6P[5]. Within the P[5] genotype, our isolates were divided into two lineages: P[5]-III and P[5]-VIII. P[5]- VIII lineage was dominant in pre-weaned Korean native calves. Our BToV isolates were more closely related to a European isolate, B145, than to Japanese isolates. Here, BNoV was frequently identified in calves, suggesting its non-significant contribution to calf diarrhea, whereas BCoV and BoRVA were responsible for calf diarrhea in the ROK.

The disease is characterized by a pre-symptomatic infectious stage that makes detection and control of cases more difficult. The effectiveness of local (ring-vaccination or culling) and global control strategies is analysed by comparing the net present values of the combined cost of preventive treatment and illness. The optimal strategy is then selected by minimizing the total cost of the epidemic. We show that three main strategies emerge, with treating a large number of individuals (global strategy, GS), treating a small number of individuals in a well-defined neighbourhood of a detected case (local strategy) and allowing the disease to spread unchecked (null strategy, NS). The choice of the optimal strategy is governed mainly by a relative cost of palliative and preventive treatments. If the disease spreads within the well-defined neighbourhood, the local strategy is optimal unless the cost of a single vaccine is much higher than the cost associated with hospitalization. In the latter case, it is most cost-effective to refrain from prevention. Destruction of local correlations, either by long-range (small-world) links or by inclusion of many initial foci, expands the range of costs for which the NS is most cost-effective. The GS emerges for the case when the cost of prevention is much lower than the cost of treatment and there is a substantial non-local component in the disease spread. We also show that local treatment is only desirable if the disease spreads on a small-world network with sufficiently few long-range links; otherwise it is optimal to treat globally. In the mean-field case, there are only two optimal solutions, to treat all if the cost of the vaccine is low and to treat nobody if it is high. The basic reproduction ratio, R(0), does not depend on the rate of responsive treatment in this case and the disease always invades (but might be stopped afterwards). The details of the local control strategy, and in particular the optimal size of the control neighbourhood, are determined by the epidemiology of the disease. The properties of the pathogen might not be known in advance for emerging diseases, but the broad choice of the strategy can be made based on economic analysis only.","output":"Searching for the most cost-effective strategy for controlling epidemics spreading on regular and small-world networks."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quinone-methide triterpenes, celastrol (1), pristimerin (2), tingenone (3), and iguesterin (4) were isolated from Triterygium regelii and dihydrocelastrol (5) was synthesized by hydrogenation under palladium catalyst.

METHODS Children aged 9 months to 3 years having daily epileptic spasms despite a trial of ACTH or oral prednisolone and 1 additional anticonvulsant medication were enrolled. Children were randomly assigned to receive the modified Atkins diet either immediately or after a delay of 4 weeks. The ongoing anticonvulsant medications were continued unchanged. The primary outcome variable was the proportion of children who achieved spasm freedom as per parental reports at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes included time to spasm cessation, proportion of children with electroclinical remission, the proportion of children with >50% reduction of spasms at 4 weeks, and adverse effects of the diet.

COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has quickly spread to a global pandemic since its first discovery in the winter of 2019. During this time, there has been an increasing number of case reports describing SARS-CoV-2 associated neuroinflammatory disease. Case Presentation : A 68-year-old man presented in June 2020 with a fall due to progressive lower extremity weakness and numbness, occurring shortly after the initial coronavirus surge in New York City. He developed ascending numbness to the level of the lower abdomen over the preceding month. He subsequently experienced low back pain, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary dysfunction. An extensive laboratory and radiologic evaluation ensued which was notable for elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies despite an absence of preceding COVID-19 symptoms. Initial electrodiagnostic testing was notable for absent late responses in the lower extremity nerve conductions with normal distal sensorimotor conductions, and incomplete muscle activation with otherwise normal motor unit morphology and recruitment on electromyography. Repeat testing two weeks later revealed similar nerve conductions, but also the interval development of active neurogenic changes and reduced motor unit recruitment in the L3-L4 myotomes. This was suggestive of a lower thoracic and lumbosacral myelopathy and lumbosacral polyradiculopathy without peripheral neuropathy. A diagnosis of Elsberg syndrome was made and treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone yielded mild clinical improvement and the electrodiagnostic re-emergence of the lower extremity late responses.

First, drug shape-based screening (among FDA approved drugs) with a known template of MTase inhibitor, sinefungin was done and best compounds with high similarity scores were selected. In addition to the selected compounds, 4 nucleoside analogs of anti-viral (Raltgravir, Maraviroc and Favipiravir) and anti-inflammatory (Prednisolone) drugs were selected for further investigations. Then, binding energies and interaction modes were found by molecular docking approaches and compouds with lower energy were selected for further investigation. After that, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried to test the potential selected compounds in a realistic environment. The results showed that Raltegravir and Maraviroc among other compounds can bind strongly to the active site of the protein compared to sinefungin, and can be potential candidates to inhibit NSP-16.

Alarm management functionality can be added to decision support systems (DSS) to send text alerts about vital signs outside specified thresholds, using data in anesthesia information management systems. We considered enhancing our DSS to send hypoxemia alerts to the text pagers of supervising anesthesiologists. As part of a voluntary application for an investigative device exemption from our IRB to implement such functionality, we evaluated the maximum potential utility of such an alert system. METHODS Pulse oximetry values (Spo(2)) were extracted from our anesthesia information management systems for all cases performed in our main operating rooms and ambulatory surgical center between September 1, 2011, and February 4, 2012 (n = 16,870). Hypoxemic episodes (Spo(2) < 90%) were characterized as either (a) lasting one or more minutes or (b) lasting 2 or more minutes. A single simulated \\"alert\\" was modeled as having been sent at the timestamp of the first (a) or the second (b) hypoxemic value. The hypoxemic episode was considered resolved at 1, 3, or 5 minutes after the time of the alert if the Spo(2) value was no longer below the 90% threshold. Two-sided 99% conservative confidence limits were calculated for the percentage of unresolved alerts at the 3 evaluation intervals and compared with 70%, the lower limit of an acceptable true alarm rate for clinical utility. RESULTS There was at least 1 hypoxemic episode lasting 1 minute or longer in 23% of cases, and at least 1 episode lasting 2 minutes or longer in 8% of cases. Only 7% (99% confidence interval [CI] 6% to 8%) of the 1-minute hypoxemic episodes were unresolved after 3 minutes, and only 8% (99% CI 6%to 9%) of 2-minute episodes after 5 minutes (both P < 10(-6) in comparison with 70% minimum reliability rate). CONCLUSIONS Low utility should be expected for a DSS sending hypoxemia alerts to supervising anesthesiologists, because nearly all hypoxemic episodes will have been resolved before arrival of the anesthesiologist in the operating room. These results suggest that the principal research focus should be on developing more sophisticated alerts and processes within rooms for the anesthesia care provider to initiate treatment promptly, to interpret or correct artifacts, and to make it easier to call for assistance via a rapid communication system.","output":"Implications of resolved hypoxemia on the utility of desaturation alerts sent from an anesthesia decision support system to supervising anesthesiologists."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines newspaper photographs related to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Finland.

An increasing demand, not only in quantity but also in diversity, drives the constant development and improvement of production platforms. The N-glycosylation pattern on biopharmaceuticals plays an important role in activity, serum half-life and immunogenicity. Therefore, production platforms with tailored protein N-glycosylation are of great interest. Plant-based systems have already demonstrated their potential to produce pharmaceutically relevant recombinant proteins, although their N-glycan patterns differ from those in humans. Plants have shown great plasticity towards the manipulation of their glycosylation machinery, and some have already been glyco-engineered in order to avoid the attachment of plant-typical, putatively immunogenic sugar residues. This resulted in complex-type N-glycans with a core structure identical to the human one. Compared to humans, plants lack the ability to elongate these N-glycans with 1,4-linked galactoses and terminal sialic acids. However, these modifications, which require the activity of several mammalian enzymes, have already been achieved for Nicotiana benthamiana and the moss Physcomitrella. Here, we present the first step towards sialylation of recombinant glycoproteins in Physcomitrella, human 1,4-linked terminal N-glycan galactosylation, which was achieved by the introduction of a chimeric 1,4-galactosyltransferase (FTGT). This chimeric enzyme consists of the moss 1,4-fucosyltransferase transmembrane domain, fused to the catalytic domain of the human 1,4-galactosyltransferase. Stable FTGT expression led to the desired 1,4-galactosylation. However, additional pentoses of unknown identity were also observed. The nature of these pentoses was subsequently determined by Western blot and enzymatic digestion followed by mass spectrometric analysis and resulted in their identification as -linked arabinoses. Since a pentosylation of 1,4-galactosylated N-glycans was reported earlier, e.g. on recombinant human erythropoietin produced in glyco-engineered Nicotiana tabacum, this phenomenon is of a more general importance for plant-based production platforms. Arabinoses, which are absent in humans, may prevent the full humanization of plant-derived products. Therefore, the identification of these pentoses as arabinoses is important as it creates the basis for their abolishment to ensure the production of safe biopharmaceuticals in plant-based systems.","output":"Unexpected arabinosylation after humanization of plant protein N-glycosylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: While the physical health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are regularly publicly available, the mental health toll on Canadians is unknown. This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. DATA: The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. METHODS: Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. RESULTS: Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health. DISCUSSION: These findings point to particular risks for lower perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Besides, the SARS-CoV-2 virus survives for several hours on different surfaces, where a new host can contract it with a delay. These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. A growing bipartite graph embodies this biosocial process, consisting of active carriers (host) nodes that produce viral nodes during their infectious period. With its directed edges passing through viral nodes between two successive hosts, this graph contains complete information about the routes leading to each infected individual. We determine temporal fluctuations of the number of exposed and the number of infected individuals, the number of active carriers and active viruses at hourly resolution. The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. More precisely, being brought by social dynamics and exposed to the currently existing infection, an individual passes through the infectious state until eventually spontaneously recovers or otherwise is moves to a controlled hospital environment. Our results reveal complex feedback mechanisms that shape the dependence of the infection curve on the intensity of social dynamics and other sociobiological factors. In particular, the results show how the lockdown effectively reduces the spread of infection and how it increases again after the lockdown is removed. Furthermore, a reduced level of social activity but prolonged exposure of susceptible individuals have adverse effects. On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies. Our stochastic processes, based on graphs at the interface of biology and social dynamics, provide a new mathematical framework for simulations of various epidemic control strategies with high temporal resolution and virus traceability.","output":"Modeling latent infection transmissions through biosocial stochastic dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health community worldwide encouraged by successes of former campaigns have always accepted vaccination as the most effective way to handle infectious diseases pandemics.

METHODS: The device is constructed keeping its usability and the importance of design ergonomics for nonspecialized field personnel in mind. The optical design is described, and the resolution and magnification are compared with traditional desktop-based slit lamps. A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)Ccompliant, patient management software is integrated to synchronize the captured images with a secure cloud server along with a sharpness algorithm to extract the best focused frames of the cornea, iris, and lens, from videos. We demonstrate its photodocumentation ability and teleophthalmology feasibility by capturing images in a pilot study from nine subjects. RESULTS: Images were obtained in various illumination, magnification, and filter settings. Synchronous and asynchronous teleophthalmology consults were conducted. The performance of the device was shown to be limited by the smartphone sensor resolution and not the optical design, because the Air Force target resolution was found to be the same on smartphone-mounted traditional slit lamps despite a lower magnification.

Method: The CNKI, Wanfang database, and VIP database were searched for clinical study articles on lung diseases treated by acupoint application published in the past 5 years. Data-eligible papers were extracted to establish a database of acupoint application for lung disease using Microsoft Excel 2019, with the goal of analyzing the frequency of acupoints, acupoint-meridian association, acupoint-location association, specific acupoint frequency, and cluster analysis. Association rules, consisting of acupoints with an application frequency of  10, were devised by the Apriori algorithm to explore the correlation between acupoint groups and to analyze the rules of the compatibility of acupoint prescriptions. Results: A total of 229 eligible papers met our inclusion criteria. Forty-seven acupoints were applied, for a total frequency of acupoints of 1,035 times.

Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of infection. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter frequently deaminates C into U residues which could generate notable viral sequence variations. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP impose selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus. Our investigation considered a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS infecting Homo sapiens, Bovine CoV infecting Bos taurus, MHV infecting Mus musculus, HEV infecting Sus scrofa, and CRCoV infecting Canis lupus familiaris). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas those that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. Among the coronaviruses surveyed herein, CpG is most deficient in SARS-CoV-2 and a temporal analysis showed a marked increase in C to U mutations over four months of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution. Furthermore, the preferred motifs in which these C to U mutations occur are the same as those subjected to APOBEC3 editing in HIV-1. These results suggest that both ZAP and APOBEC3 shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ZAP imposes a strong CpG avoidance, and APOBEC3 constantly edits C to U.

However, a comprehensive understanding of epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in young children under five years, the most at-risk age-group for respiratory infections, remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children under five years. METHOD: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses , we searched several electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) with no language restriction for published epidemiological studies and case-reports reporting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in children under five years until June 4, 2020. We assessed pooled prevalence for key demographics and clinical characteristics using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine random-effects model for studies except case-reports. We evaluated risk of bias separately for case-reports and other studies. RESULTS: We identified 1,964 articles, of which, 65 articles were eligible for systematic review that represented 1,214 children younger than five years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled estimates showed that 50% young COVID-19 cases were infants (95% CI: 36% - 63%, 27 studies); 53% were male (95% CI: 41% - 65%, 24 studies); 43% were asymptomatic (95% CI: 15% - 73%, 9 studies) and 7% (95% CI: 0% - 30%, 5 studies) had severe disease that required intensive-care-unit admission. Of 139 newborns from COVID-19 infected mothers, five (3.6%) were COVID-19 positive. There was only one death recorded. DISCUSSION: This systematic review reports the largest number of children younger than five years with COVID-19 infection till date.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Initial chest CT of 1064 patients with respiratory symptoms suspect of COVID-19 referred between March 18(th), and May 12(th) 2020, were read according to a standardized procedure. The results of chest CTs were compared to the results of the RT-PCR. RESULTS: 546 (51%) patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV2 at RT-PCR. The highest rate of positive RT-PCR was during the second week of confinement reaching 71.9%. After six weeks of confinement, the positive RT-PCR rate dropped significantly to 10.5% (p<0.001) and even 2.2% during the two last weeks. Overall, CT revealed patterns suggestive of COVID-19 in 603 patients (57%), whereas an alternative diagnosis was found in 246 patients (23%). CT was considered normal in 215 patients (20%) and inconclusive in 1 patient. The overall sensitivity of CT was 88%, specificity 76%, PPV 79%, and NPV 85%.

Venous drainage was performed with a bicaval cannula inserted via the left V. femoralis. To accomplish left ventricular unloading, an additional drainage cannula was placed in the left atrium via percutaneous atrioseptostomy (va-va-ECMO). Cardiac function recovered and the girl was weaned from the ECMO on day 6. Successful allogenic stem cell transplantation took place 2 months later. CONCLUSIONS In patients with vasoplegic septic shock and impaired cardiac contractility, double peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-va-ECMO) with transseptal left atrial venting can by a lifesaving option.","output":"Double Peripheral Venous and Arterial Cannulation for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Combined Septic and Cardiogenic Shock."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on wellbeing and health has so far been studied using mostly cross-sectional designs. To place recent findings into context, we compared symptoms and functional health status in two independent samples assessed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were recruited via an online panel using quota sampling. We assessed symptoms, functional health, and global quality of life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 in two general population samples in Spain (collected in July 2019 and April 2020). We also assessed several COVID-19 related variables, such as adherence to social distancing. RESULTS: Data from N = 1010 participants before the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.5% female) were compared with data from N = 504 participants during the pandemic (mean age 47.1 years, 50.8% female). Participants during the pandemic (vs. before the pandemic) reported lower role functioning and emotional functioning, as well as less symptom burden. A lower degree of social distancing was associated with better functional health and lower symptom burden.

To date, there are no effective treatments for progressive deficits or disease-modifying therapy for those patients. We report encouraging results for spastic paraparesis after spinal cord stimulation. METHODS A 51-year-old woman suffering from progressive weakness and spasticity in lower limbs related to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 4 underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and experienced also significant improvement in motor function. Maximum ballistic voluntary isometric contraction test, continuous passive motion test and gait analysis using a motion-capture system were performed in ON and OFF SCS conditions. Neurophysiologic assessment consisted of obtaining motor evoked potentials in both conditions. RESULTS Presurgical Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) score was 26. One month after effective SCS was initiated, SPRS went down to 15. At 12 months follow up, she experienced substantial improvement in motor function and in gait performance, with SPRS scores 23 (OFF) and down to 20 (ON). There was an increased isometric muscle strength (knee extension, OFF: 41 N m; ON: 71 N m), lower knee extension and flexion torque values in continuous passive motion test (decrease in spastic tone) and improvement in gait (for example, step length increase).

Travel bans and diminished economic activity due to COVID-19 have led to a dramatic reduction in waste from the business sector and in the total amount of municipal waste generated. However, the results of the survey showed that both food and plastic waste generated by households in Bangkok increased during COVID-19. The shift from eating out to online food delivery services led to an increase in plastic bags, hot-and-cold food bags, plastic food containers, and food waste. Reasons for the increase in household food waste during COVID-19 varied, with respondents citing excessive amounts of food and unappetising taste, followed by exceeding the expiration date and rotting/foul odours. These reasons may be the result of the inability to predict quantity and quality when ordering online, and inadequate food planning and management by consumers. To achieve more effective food and plastic waste management, home delivery services, consumer food planning and management, and the formation of a circular economy based on localised supply chains may be considered as important intervention points.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on Food and Plastic Waste Generated by Consumers in Bangkok"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemic disease affects the whole world.

Ketamine presents a potential treatment option; however, its effects are temporary. Administering ketamine alongside psychotherapy is one potential means of prolonging its effects; however, only a few studies have investigated this treatment method to date, and none have tested ketamine with internet-based or electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT). OBJECTIVE: This open-label randomized controlled trial aims to assess the efficacy of a combined treatment method of subanesthetic intravenous ketamine and e-CBT for treating patients with PTSD. METHODS: In total, 20 patients with refractory PTSD recruited from a community clinic will be randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n=10), receiving a combination of ketamine and therapist-administered e-CBT over 14 weeks, or a waitlist control group (n=10), receiving the experimental treatment after 14 weeks. Both groups will be assessed for the symptoms of PTSD and comorbid disorders before treatment, at two midway points, and at the end of the experiment. RESULTS: PTSD symptoms of participants in the experimental group are expected to improve significantly more than those of participants in the waitlist control group (P=.05) with a large effect size ((2)=0.14).

A thorough characterization of vaccine protection and its duration in time is needed to inform vaccination policies and enhance public trust. MethodsWe matched three national databases with exhaustive information on screening, vaccination and hospitalizations in France over the year 2021. We performed a two-step analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe forms of Covid-19 in people aged 50 years or over, combining: (i) a test-negative case-control design to assess vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections; and (ii) a survival analysis to assess the additional protection against severe outcomes (hospitalizations and inpatient deaths) in infected individuals. ResultsWe found a high vaccine effectiveness in people aged 50 years or more, reaching 82% against symptomatic infections and 94% against severe outcomes, after a full vaccination scheme. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections strongly decreased over time, dropping to 53% after six months, but remained high against severe forms (90% after six months). The booster dose allowed restoring high protection levels. Vaccine protection and its evolution in time, showed little difference against the variants that circulated prior to December 2021 in France, including the Delta variant.

Design: Online cross-sectional survey. Setting: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. Participants: 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or over. Participants were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. Main outcome measures: Having gone out in the last 24 hours in those who reported symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Having gone out shopping for items other than groceries, toiletries or medicines (non-essentials), and total number of outings, in the last week in those who reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in their household. Results: 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature / fever) in the last seven days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 hours (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence were being male, less worried about COVID-19, and perceiving a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of Government \\"lockdown\\" measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19, and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules.

Initially, ExtraTreesClassifier algorithm was used to select the important predictive features in forecasting the disease occurrence in unseen (test) data among meteorological, animal population density, dominant land cover, and elevation attributes. Some machine learning techniques revealed high accuracy in predicting the LSDV occurrence in test data (up to 97%). In terms of area under curve (AUC) and F1 performance metric scores, the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm outperformed other machine learning methods in predicting the occurrence of LSDV infection in unseen data with the corresponding values of 0.97 and 0.94, respectively. Using this algorithm, the model consisted of all predictive features and the one which only included meteorological attributes as important features showed similar predictive performance. According to the findings of this research, ANN can be used to forecast the occurrence of LSDV infection with high precision using geospatial and meteorological parameters. Applying the forecasting power of these methods could be a great help in conducting screening and awareness programs, as well as taking preventive measures like vaccination in areas where the occurrence of LSDV infection is a high risk.

To analyze the main components of the daily routine, the organization of the educational process and the well-being of medical students in the context of social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to study remotely. Material and methods. 326 students of the 1st-6th courses enrolled in medical universities (82.8% women, 17.2% men) aged 17 to 27 were surveyed. The data was collected using Google-forms during the academic year 20202021. Methods were used: the authors questionnaire aimed at studying the daily regimen and nutrition, the WAM (well-being, activity, mood) questionnaire, the Beck depression scale, the SpielbergerKhanin anxiety scale. Results. In the context of distance learning, the daily routine and nutrition of a significant proportion of students do not meet the recommended values: for example, more than 82.5% of respondents worked with electronic devices for 5 hours, and 14.9% of students noted less than 6 hours of sleep. Only every tenth (9.5%) of the respondents noted that he was engaged in physical exercis-es daily. Respondents living in self-isolation on their own more often noted a deterioration in their physical condition in the spec-ified period (p=0.011). It was found that only 32.5% of respondents have all food groups in their diet. At the same time, students living with their parents had a more varied diet (p=0.042), more regular food intake (p=0.035). Deterioration of the emotional state in conditions of social isolation was noted by 28.1% of students. The predictors of psychophysical well-being have been identi-fied: regular physical activity, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Conclusion. The results obtained indicate the existing difficulties in the rational organization of the daily routine and can be used to form recommendations for students on optimizing their lifestyle during distance learning. ? 2022, Media Sphera Publishing Group.

Here, we show that the CoV replicative machinery, unlike that of other RNA viruses, also uses an exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, which is associated with nonstructural protein (nsp) 14. Bacterially expressed forms of SARS-CoV nsp14 were shown to act on both ssRNAs and dsRNAs in a 3'-->5' direction. The activity depended on residues that are conserved in the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. The protein did not hydrolyze DNA or ribose-2'-O-methylated RNA substrates and required divalent metal ions for activity. A range of 5'-labeled ssRNA substrates were processed to final products of approximately 8-12 nucleotides. When part of dsRNA or in the presence of nonlabeled dsRNA, the 5'-labeled RNA substrates were processed to significantly smaller products, indicating that binding to dsRNA in cis or trans modulates the exonucleolytic activity of nsp14. Characterization of human CoV 229E ExoN active-site mutants revealed severe defects in viral RNA synthesis, and no viable virus could be recovered. Besides strongly reduced genome replication, specific defects in sg RNA synthesis, such as aberrant sizes of specific sg RNAs and changes in the molar ratios between individual sg RNA species, were observed. Taken together, the study identifies an RNA virus ExoN activity that is involved in the synthesis of multiple RNAs from the exceptionally large genomic RNA templates of CoVs.","output":"Discovery of an RNA virus 3'->5' exoribonuclease that is critically involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic diarrhoea was observed in approximately 2,000 of 6,700 sheep on 9 farms.

This study focused on midazolam (MDZ), a common benzodiazepine regularly used as a sedative on neonates in the NICU. Mounting evidence suggests a single exposure to MDZ during the neonatal period leads to learning disturbances. However, a knowledge gap that remains is how long-term exposure to MDZ during very early stages of life impacts synaptic alterations. Using a preclinical rodent model system, we mimicked a dose-escalation regimen on postnatal day 3 (P3) pups until day 21. Next, purified synaptosomes from P21 control and MDZ animals were subjected to quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, to identify potential proteomic signatures. Further analysis by ClueGO identified enrichment of proteins associated with actin-binding and protein depolymerization process. One potential hit identified was alpha adducin (ADD1), belonging to the family of cytoskeleton proteins, which was upregulated in the MDZ group and whose expression was further validated by Western blot. In summary, this study sheds new information on the long-term exposure of MDZ during the early stages of development impacts synaptic function, which could subsequently perturb neurobehavioral outcomes at later stages of life.","output":"Decoding the Synaptic Proteome with Long-Term Exposure to Midazolam during Early Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, the presence of Covid-19 in Indonesia is so terrible But in truth, this virus can be prevented by maintaining personal hygiene One of the simplest ways to maintain personal hygiene is to wash your hands and use hand sanitizers as a practical measure if there is no time to wash hands or limited water in certain places Moringa leaves contain natural antiseptic ingredients, such as polyphenols Antiseptic material can be processed into natural hand sanitizers The results of various tests such as organoleptic, viscosity, scattering, and antibacterial test, shown that the percolation extraction method could produce an extract of hand sanitizers It can be processed into hand sanitizers which comply with hand sanitizer quality standards Moringa leaf extract hand sanitizer has many antibacterial components, namely saponins, triterpenoids, and tannins The best result shows 24 minutes of the percolator, with heating temperature 40 C and stirring time 45 minutes The results obtained a viscosity of 2120 Cps, 4,79 cm of scattering test, and the average diameter of inhibition zones of 23,33 mm and fulfill the required standard ? 2021 IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science","output":"Utilization of moringa oleifera leaves for making hand sanitizers to prevent the spread of COVID-19 virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Smoking prevalence among female adolescents in South Korea has increased gradually, despite a decreasing trend seen for male adolescents.

The purpose of this study is to describe how intervention mapping protocol (IMP) was used to develop a media literacy-based smoking prevention program (MLSP) for female adolescents. The IMP was used in six steps: needs assessment (literature review and focus groups comprising 24 female adolescents and 12 teachers), program goal setting, selection of intervention methods, production of program components and materials, program implementation planning, and program evaluation by ten experts and three adolescents. Six performance objectives and 14 change objectives were generated. Each module consisted of theory-based methods such as raising consciousness. Half of the modules covered topics regarding smoking media literacy, while half covered topics related to gender-specific intervention. The major advantages of utilizing IMP are that MLSP has been developed to reflect multiple perspectives, including of adolescents, teachers, and professors through a systematic process, and identified to be acceptable and valid.","output":"Using Intervention Mapping to Develop a Media Literacy-Based Smoking Prevention Program for Female Adolescents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Karstified carbonate aquifers may receive significant recharge contributions from losing streams, hence, the knowledge about surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) interactions is crucial with regard to water management (e.g. source protection zone delineation). The dynamics of SW-GW interactions may depend on factors such as the relative water levels between streams and aquifers, resulting in a temporal variation of exchange, which imposes complexity to the understanding of such dynamics. This study highlights the use of high-resolution time series and multi-resolution analysis to help to gain insights into such complex dynamics. Wavelet coherence (WTC) is applied on hourly time series of rainfall, stream and spring discharges of a low lying karstified spring catchment to yield a correlation in the time-frequency domain. This analysis provides comprehensive information on the overall impact of the river on the spring, which is supported by the cross-correlation function, as well as by more detailed information, including time-variant influences such as a threshold level of influence. Field observations of turbidity sampling at the spring appear to support this interpretation. This innovative approach relies on basic hydrological parameters, water level or discharge, and is therefore applicable to many other systems with such existing time series.

While indicated for use only in adult populations, small studies have shown encouraging results in reducing pain in children with few, if any, adverse effects. This is reassuring from a clinical perspective, as we hope to highlight the available evidence and invite researchers to expand future studies. Through this review, we have identified significant gaps in the literature surrounding the safety and use of buprenorphine in the pediatric population.

PURPOSE: A common denial trend that occurs with outpatient medical benefit drugs is payers not requiring or permitting prior authorization (PA) proactively, yet denying the drug after administration for medical necessity. In this situation, a preemptive strategy of complying with payer-mandated requirements is critical for revenue protection. To address this need, our institution incorporated a medical necessity review into its existing closed-loop, pharmacy-managed precertification and denials management program. SUMMARY: Referrals for targeted payers and high-dollar medical benefit drugs not eligible for PA and deemed high risk for denial were incorporated into the review. Payer medical policies were evaluated and clinical documentation assessed to confirm alignment. This descriptive report outlines the medical necessity workflow as a component of the larger precertification process, details the decision-making process when performing the review, and delineates the roles and responsibilities for involved team members. A total of 526 drug orders were evaluated from September 2018 to August 2019, with 146 interventions completed. Of the 761 individual claims affected by proactive medical necessity review, 99.2% resulted in payment and less than 1% resulted in revenue loss, safeguarding more than $5.3 million in annual institutional drug reimbursement. At the time of analysis, there were only 3 cases of revenue loss. CONCLUSION: Our institutions pharmacy-managed medical necessity review program for high-dollar outpatient drugs safeguards reimbursement for therapies not eligible for payer PA. It is a revenue cycle best practice that can be replicated at other institutions.","output":"A proactive medical necessity review program reduces revenue loss associated with outpatient medical benefit drugs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION We have read with great interest the meta-analysis that examined the impact of increased red cell distribution width (RDW) and COVID-19 outcomes, conducted by Lee and colleagues, and recently published in the Journal of Medical Virology. The authors concluded that elevations in RDW were associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. However, the impact of elevation of RDW independent of anemia in COVID-19 remains to be clarified. METHODS Patients 18 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Mount Sinai Health System between March 1 and April 1, 2020 and had a complete blood count (CBC) at presentation (n=2562) were selected to assess the association between RDW and mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by presence of anemia, were performed to assess the independent association of RDW with mechanical ventilation and mortality. RESULTS At univariate analysis, elevated RDW was statistically significantly associated with mechanical ventilation (p = 0.0109) and mortality (p < 0.0001). We found that elevated RDW was statistically associated with higher risk of both being placed on a ventilator (HRadj: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.19-2.32) and mortality (HRadj: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.18-2.15) in non-anemic patients, but there was no association in anemic patients. These associations were independent of the effects of age, sex, race, and CCI. DISCUSSION In this study, we show that the elevated RDW association with mortality and mechanical ventilation is present exclusively in non-anemic patients. Therefore, we propose that RDW be considered by clinicians, especially in non-anemic patients, when risk-stratifying COVID-19 patients. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and use of preventive measures against COVID-19. The study also compared the association between preventive measures and anxiety symptoms during the week immediately preceding the study and those symptoms and measures at the beginning of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire commenced on 14 February 2020. The study participants were residents of Taiwan ages 20 to 70 years. The 6-item state version of the StateCTrait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The questions about preventive measures asked participants about their personal protection, cough etiquette, contact precautions, voluntary quarantine, and prompt reporting. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors influencing an increase in the preventive measures scores. RESULTS: Of a total of 3555 completed responses, a total of 52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.4C53.7) of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms in the past week, whereas 48.8% (95%CI 47.2C50.5) reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. With a higher score indicating greater anxiety, the median scores for anxiety symptoms in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 46.7 (IQR [interquartile range] 36.7C53.3) and 43.3 (IQR 36.7C53.3), respectively. The median scores for the preventive measures taken in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 26.0 (IQR 21.0C30.0) and 24.0 (IQR 19.0C28.0), respectively, out of a maximum score of 36. In the multivariable analysis, an increased anxiety symptom score from the beginning of the outbreak to the past week (adjusted OR = 7.38, 95%CI 6.28C8.66) was a strongly significant determinant of an increased preventive measures score in the past week compared with the score at the beginning of the outbreak.

The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for greater use of TeleNP and understanding of neuropsychologists' experience with this unique assessment medium.Methods: During the course of a no-cost global webinar related to practical/ethical considerations of TeleNP practice, attendees were invited to engage in a 26-question survey about their TeleNP use and related COVID-19 concerns. TeleNP practices before the COVID-19 pandemic and early on during the global outbreak were queried among survey participants, along with examination of TeleNP intentions following COVID-19.Results: Multiple countries were represented across five continents, with two-thirds of respondents being from the United States. Approximately one-fourth of respondents reported using TeleNP for clinical interview, feedback, and intervention prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and approximately one-tenth of individuals used TeleNP for testadministration. Increased use of TeleNP for clinical interview, feedback, and intervention was reported within the first few weeks of the global COVID-19 outbreak, though the use of TeleNP for testing remained relatively unchanged.

The objective of this review is to examine if these concerns find support in the literature by providing a comprehensive overview of physiological responses to the use of face masks. We have performed a systematic review, pairwise and network meta-analyses to investigate physiological responses to the use of face masks. The study has been registered with PROSPERO (C RD42020224791). Obtained results were screened using our exclusion and inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were performed using the GeMTC and meta R packages. We have identified 26 studies meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria, encompassing 751 participants. The use of face masks was not associated with significant changes in pulsoxymetrically measured oxygen saturation, even during maximal-effort exercises. The only significant physiological responses to the use of face masks during low-intensity activities were a slight increase in heart rate, mildly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (not meeting criteria for hypercarbia), increased temperature of facial skin covered by the mask, and subsequent increase of the score in the rating of heat perception, with N95 filtering facepiece respirators having a greater effect than surgical masks. In high-intensity conditions, the use of face masks was associated with decreased oxygen uptake, ventilation, and RR. Face masks are safe to use and do not cause significant alterations in human physiology. The increase in heart rate stems most likely from increased respiratory work required to overcome breathing resistance. The increase in carbon dioxide is too small to be clinically relevant. An increased rating of heat perception when using face masks results from higher temperature of facial skin covered by the mask.","output":"Bayesian network meta-analysis of face masks' impact on human physiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An exciting debate has emerged whether bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination is effective for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

METHODS: We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (total of 102,578 beds) with acute medical centers. RESULTS: A total of 4,938 hospitalized patients with COVID\\\\19 were confirmed. Of 1,100 severe COVID\\\\19 inpatients, 112 remained hospitalized and 138 died. There were 4,852 patients presumed to be severe COVID\\\\19 patients who were confirmed later to be not infected. Twenty\\\\seven hospitals (15% of 180 hospitals) converted their ICU to a unit for COVID\\\\19 patients only, and 107 (59%) had to manage both severe COVID\\\\19 patients and others in the same ICU. Restriction of ICU admission was occurred in one of the former 27 hospitals and 21 of later 107 hospitals. Shortage of N95 masks was the most serious concern regarding personal protective equipment (PPE). As for issues which raised ICU bed occupancy, difficulty performing or progressing rehabilitation for severe patients (42%), and the improved patients (28%), long lasting severely ill patients (36%) and unclear isolation criteria (34%) were mentioned. Many acute medicine physicians assisted regional governmental agencies functioning as advisors and volunteer coordinator. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of COVID\\\\19 in this study was 4.5% of all hospitalized patients and 14% (approximately one in 7) severe patients.

Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in circulating adaptive immune cells expressing the key gut homing marker &#945;4?7 suggesting that these cells are preferentially recruited to extra-intestinal tissues independently of &#945;4?7 or that the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is at least numerically dominated by extraintestinal, particularly pulmonary, immune cell priming.","output":"Circulating Adaptive Immune Cells Expressing the Gut Homing Marker 4?7 Integrin Are Decreased in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are scarce published data in differentiated thyroid cancer patients about new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease outcomes and mortality. Here, we evaluated COVID-19 infection outcomes and mortality in thyroid cancer patients with COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND METHODS: We included a cohort of patients with thyroid cancer with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 disease from 11 March to 30 May 2020 from the Turkish Ministry of Health database in our nationwide, retrospective study. We compared the mortality and morbidity of COVID patients with or without thyroid cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the independent factors for mortality, length of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. We also analysed the effect of radioiodine treatment on severity and death rate of COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: We evaluated 388 COVID-19 patients with thyroid cancer [median age: 54 years, interquartile range (IQR) 18 years, males: 23%] and age and gender-matched 388 COVID-19 patients without thyroid cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer had a similar mortality ratio compared with the non-cancer group. Among patients with thyroid cancer, age, presence of diabetes mellitus, asthma/COPD, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, prior coronary artery disease, RAS blocker usage and low lymphocyte count were associated with mortality. Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment and cumulative radioactive iodine dosage did not negatively affect the severity and mortality of COVID-19 disease in our patient group.

Although the main clinical manifestations are respiratory, an increase in neurological conditions, specifically acute cerebrovascular disease, has been detected. We present cerebrovascular disease case incidence in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients were confirmed by microbiological/serological testing, or on chest CT semiology. Available data on co-morbidity, laboratory parameters, treatment administered, neuroimaging, neuropathological studies and clinical evolution during hospitalization, measured by the modified Rankin scale, were analysed. A bivariate study was also designed to identify differences between ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes. A statistical model of binary logistic regression and sensitivity analysis was designed to study the influence of independent variables over prognosis. In our centre, there were 1683 admissions of patients with COVID-19 over 50 days, of which 23 (1.4%) developed cerebrovascular disease. Within this group of patients, cerebral and chest CT scans were performed in all cases, and MRI in six (26.1%). Histological samples were obtained in 6/23 cases (two brain biopsies, and four arterial thrombi). Seventeen patients were classified as cerebral ischaemia (73.9%, with two arterial dissections), five as intracerebral haemorrhage (21.7%), and one leukoencephalopathy of posterior reversible encephalopathy type. Haemorrhagic patients had higher ferritin levels at the time of stroke (1554.3 versus 519.2, P = 0.004). Ischaemic strokes were unexpectedly frequent in the vertebrobasilar territory (6/17, 35.3%). In the haemorrhagic group, a characteristic radiological pattern was identified showing subarachnoid haemorrhage, parieto-occipital leukoencephalopathy, microbleeds and single or multiple focal haematomas. Brain biopsies performed showed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy and endothelial injury, with no evidence of vasculitis or necrotizing encephalitis.

Physical environments that once fostered social interaction and community were rendered inactive. We conducted interviews and administered surveys to examine undergraduate STEM students feelings of belonging and engagement while in physical isolation, and identified online teaching modes associated with these feelings. Surveys from a racially diverse group of 43 undergraduate students at a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) revealed that interactive synchronous instruction was positively associated with feelings of interest and belonging, particularly for students of color, while noninteractive instruction reduced social belonging, but was related to more cognitive engagement. Small group and one-on-one interviews with 23 of these students suggest that students derived feelings of connectedness from their instructors, peers, and prior experiences and relied on their sense of competency to motivate themselves in the course and feel a sense of belonging. Two embedded cases of students in physics classrooms are compared to highlight the range of student feelings of connectedness and competency during the lockdown. Findings reaffirm that social interaction tends to support belonging and engagement, particularly for under-represented (Black or African American and Hispanic) racial groups in STEM. STEM instructors who aim to support feelings of belonging and engagement in virtual learning environments should consider increasing opportunities for studentCstudent and studentCteacher interactions, as well as taking a flexible approach that validates and integrates student voice into instruction.

Participants had to watch a video sequence in which their own face was gradually morphed into the face of an unfamiliar other (self-to-other) or vice versa (other-to-self), requiring them to indicate at which point they judged the morph to look more like the target face than the starting face. Consistent with predictions, results showed that participants in the high-BPD group judged the morph to look like themselves for longer in the self-to-other direction (suggestive of egocentric bias), but only with a relatively more attractive target face. In the other-to-self direction, the high-BPD group had more difficulty recognizing their own face (i.e., an altercentric bias), but this time only with the relatively less attractive face.

The proportion of responders, defined by an increase in Pao(2)/Fio(2) greater than or equal to 2.67 kPa (20 mm Hg), upon proning, was similar between acute respiratory distress syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome (79% vs 76%; p = 0.5). Responders had earlier prone position (1.4 d [interquartile range, 0.7C4.2 d] vs 2.5 d [interquartile range, 0.8C6.2 d]; p = 0.06)]. Prone position less than 24 hours from intubation achieved greater improvement in oxygenation (11 kPa [interquartile range, 4C21 kPa] vs 7 kPa [interquartile range, 2C13 kPa]; p = 0.002). The variables independently associated with the responder category were Pao(2)/Fio(2) preproning (odds ratio, 0.89 kPa(C1) [95% CI, 0.85C0.93 kPa(C1)]; p < 0.001) and interval between intubation and proning (odds ratio, 0.94 d(C1) [95% CI, 0.89C0.99 d(C1)]; p = 0.019). The overall mortality was 45%, with no significant difference observed between acute respiratory distress syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome. Variables independently associated with mortality included age (odds ratio, 1.03 yr(C1) [95% CI, 1.01C1.05 yr(C1)]; p < 0.001); interval between hospital admission and proning (odds ratio, 1.04 d(C1) [95% CI, 1.002C1.084 d(C1)]; p = 0.047); and change in Pao(2)/Fio(2) on proning (odds ratio, 0.97 kPa(C1) [95% CI, 0.95C0.99 kPa(C1)]; p = 0.002).

Methods: A total of 133,027 Chinese people from all cities and areas of China took part in this 25-day online investigation from January 27 to February 20, 2020. Hierarchical regression was carried out. Results: Chinese people reported mild positive and negative emotions during COVID-19, and the trend was that negative emotions declined and happy emotion increased in a curvilinear style. Females reported stronger on-spot negative emotions. Young and unmarried people, and individuals with lower risk perception reported lower negative emotions and higher happiness, while people with postgraduate or higher education, medical staff and patients, and individuals coming from areas with more confirmed cases, experienced stronger positive and negative emotions. In the regression model, risk predictors of negative emotions were being female, being older in age, having postgraduate or higher education, living in a city with more confirmed cases, being a patient or medical staff, and having higher risk perception, while protective predictors of negative emotions were being unmarried, having high-school or college education, and later investigating date. Notably, been married was negative predictor of happiness. Conclusions: This large sample, 25-day successive online investigation is among the first to reveal the time map of on-spot emotions in Chinese people under the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk and protective predictors of on-spot negative emotions help to recognize vulnerable people under pandemic conditions and further develop more targeted early interventions for future crises. ? 2021 The Authors","output":"Time map and predictors of on-spot emotional responses of Chinese people during COVID-19 outbreak: From January 27 to February 20, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction This study connects the aggregate strength of public health policies taken in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the U.S. states to the governors party affiliations and to state-level outcomes. Understanding the relationship between politics and public health measures can better prepare American communities for what to expect from their governments in a future crisis and encourage advocacy for delegating public health decisions to medical professionals. Methods The Public Health Protective Policy Index (PPI) captures the strength of policy response to COVID-19 at the state level. The authors estimated a Bayesian model that links the rate of disease spread to PPI. The model also accounted for the possible state-specific undercounting of cases and controls for state population density, poverty, number of physicians, cardiovascular disease, asthma, smoking, obesity, age, racial composition, and urbanization. A Bayesian linear model with natural splines of time was employed to link the dynamics of PPI to governors party affiliations. Results A 10Cpercentage point decrease in PPI was associated with an 8% increase in the expected number of new cases. Between late March and November 2020 and at the state-specific peaks of the pandemic, the PPI in the states with Democratic governors was about 10 percentage points higher than in the states with Republican governors. Conclusions Public health measures were stricter in the Democrat-led states, and stricter public health measures were associated with a slower growth of COVID-19 cases. The apparent politicization of public health measures suggests that public health decision making by health professionals rather than political incumbents could be beneficial.","output":"Governor's Party, Policies, and COVID-19 Outcomes: Further Evidence of an Effect"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] SARS-CoV-2 infection begins with the association of its spike 1 (S1) protein with host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Targeting the interaction between S1 and ACE2 is a practical strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we show encouraging results indicating that human cathelicidin LL37 can simultaneously block viral S1 and cloak ACE2. LL37 binds to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 with high affinity (11.2 nM) and decreases subsequent recruitment of ACE2. Owing to the RBD blockade, LL37 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirion infection, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 4.74 g/mL. Interestingly, LL37 also binds to ACE2 with an affinity of 25.5 nM and cloaks the ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby decreasing S1 adherence and protecting cells against pseudovirion infection in vitro. Intranasal administration of LL37 to C57 mice infected with adenovirus expressing human ACE2 either before or after pseudovirion invasion decreased lung infection. The study identified a versatile antimicrobial peptide in humans as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 attachment using dual mechanisms, thus providing a potential candidate for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention and treatment.","output":"Human Cathelicidin Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Killing Two Birds with One Stone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detailed knowledge about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important for unraveling the viral and host factors that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. Presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in the low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. METHODOLOGY: We compared conventional and pocket warmer loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods (using a heat block and a pocket warmer respectively as heat source for amplification reaction) for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. The effect of purified and crude DNA preparations on the detection rate of the LAMP assays were also investigated and compared with that of IS2404 PCR, a reference assay for the detection of M. ulcerans. Thirty clinical specimens from suspected BU cases were examined by LAMP and IS2404 PCR. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limit of both LAMP methods at 60C was 300 copies of IS2404 and 30 copies of IS2404 for the conventional LAMP at 65C. When purified DNA extracts were used, both the conventional LAMP and IS2404 PCR concordantly detected 21 positive cases, while the pocket warmer LAMP detected 19 cases. Nine of 30 samples were positive by both the LAMP assays as well as IS2404 PCR when crude extracts of clinical specimens were used. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The LAMP method can be used as a simple and rapid test for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens. However, obtaining purified DNA, as well as generating isothermal conditions, remains a major challenge for the use of the LAMP method under field conditions.

METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In the included studies, the described outcomes were extracted in accordance with the provisions of the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook and registered. RESULTS Among 884 abstracts identified, 90 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Only 30 manuscripts explicitly stated the primary and/or secondary outcomes. A total of 88 distinct outcomes were recorded across all 90 studies included. These were then assigned to seven different domains in line with the taxonomy for classification proposed by the COMET initiative. The most frequently reported outcome was survival with 74% (n = 67) of the studies reporting an outcome within this domain. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review constitutes one of the initial phases in the protocol for developing a COS in neonatal sepsis. The paucity of standardised outcome reporting in neonatal sepsis hinders comparison and synthesis of data. The final phase will involve a Delphi Survey to generate a COS in neonatal sepsis by consensus recommendation. IMPACT This systematic review identified a wide variation of outcomes reported among published RCTs on the management of neonatal sepsis. The paucity of standardised outcome reporting hinders comparison and synthesis of data and future meta-analyses with conclusive recommendations on the management of neonatal sepsis are unlikely.

Nonetheless, the prevalence of secondhand or direct cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) in the pediatric population has not significantly decreased over time. On the contrary, the rapid incline in use of e-cigarettes among adolescents has evoked public health concerns since increasing cases of vaping-induced acute lung injury have highlighted the potential harm of these new \\"smoking\\" devices. Two pediatric populations are especially vulnerable to the detrimental effects of cigarette smoke. The first group is former premature infants whose risk is elevated both due to their prematurity as well as other risk factors such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation to which they are disproportionately exposed. The second group is children and adolescents with chronic respiratory diseases, in particular asthma and other wheezing disorders. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a spectrum of diseases caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has spread worldwide over the last year. Here, respiratory symptoms ranging from mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are at the forefront of COVID-19 cases among adults, and cigarette smoking is associated with worse outcomes in this population, and cigarette smoking is associated with worse outcomes in this population. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects children differently in regard to infection susceptibility, disease manifestations, and complications. Although children carry and transmit the virus, the likelihood of symptomatic infection is low, and the rates of hospitalization and death are even lower when compared to the adult population. However, multisystem inflammatory syndrome is recognized as a serious consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. In addition, recent data demonstrate specific clinical patterns in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome vs. severe COVID-19.

Stabilization of these complexes remains challenging because of their chemical composition, the hydrophobicity and structural instability of membrane proteins, and the lability of interactions between protein, detergent, and lipids within micelles and lipid bilayers. In this work we demonstrate that metastable lipid, protein-detergent, and protein-lipid supramolecular complexes can be successfully generated and immobilized within zeolitic-imidazole framework (ZIF) to enhance their stability against chemical and physical stressors. Upon immobilization in ZIF bio-composites, blank liposomes, and model transmembrane metal transporters in detergent micelles or embedded in proteoliposomes resist elevated temperatures, exposure to chemical denaturants, aging, and mechanical stresses.

Therefore, a fast and reliable fault diagnosis method is essential for machine condition monitoring. In this study, noise eliminated ensemble empirical mode decomposition (NEEEMD) was used for fault feature extraction. A convolution neural network (CNN) classifier was applied for classification because of its feature learning ability. A generalized CNN architecture was proposed to reduce the model training time. A sample size of [Formula: see text] pixels RGB scalograms are used as the classifier input. However, CNN requires a large number of training data to achieve high accuracy and robustness. Deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) was applied for data augmentation during the training phase. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method, scalograms from related feature extraction methods such as ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), complementary EEMD (CEEMD), and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) are classified. The effectiveness of scalograms is also validated by comparing the classifier performance using grayscale samples from the raw vibration signals. All the outputs from bearing and blade fault classifiers showed that scalogram samples from the proposed NEEEMD method obtained the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness using CNN. DCGAN was applied with the proposed NEEEMD scalograms to further increase the CNN classifiers performance and identify the optimal number of training data. After training the classifier using augmented samples, the results showed that the classifier obtained even higher validation and test accuracy with greater robustness.

While the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa compared to other continents has so far been low, there are concerns about under-reporting, inadequate diagnostic tools, and insufficient treatment facilities. Moreover, proactiveness on the part of African governments has been under scrutiny. For instance, issues have emerged regarding the responsiveness of African countries in closing international borders to limit trans-continental transmission of the virus. Overdependence on imported products and outsourced services could have contributed to African governments' hesitation to shut down international air and seaports. In this era of emerging and re-emerging pathogens, we recommend that African nations should consider self-sufficiency in the health sector as an urgent priority, as this will not be the last outbreak to occur. In addition to the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement fund (US$600 million) provided by the World Bank for strengthening health systems and disease surveillance, each country should further establish an epidemic emergency fund for epidemic preparedness and response. We also recommend that epidemic surveillance units should create a secure database of previous and ongoing pandemics in terms of aetiology, spread, and treatment, as well as financial management records. Strategic collection and analysis of data should also be a central focus of these units to facilitate studies of disease trends and to estimate the scale of requirements in preparation and response to any future pandemic or epidemic.","output":"Beyond SARS-CoV-2: Lessons That African Governments Can Apply in Preparation for Possible Future Epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A better understanding of the effects of the lockdown on lifestyle behaviors may help to guide the public health response to COVID-19 at a national level and to update the global strategy to respond COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on device-measured physical activity (PA), sedentary time, sleep and self-regulation; and to determine whether PA and sleep are related to self-regulation problems during the lockdown. METHODS: PA, sedentary time and sleep were assessed using accelerometry in the week in which the Spanish national state of alarm was declared (n = 21). Parents reported preschooler's self-regulation difficulties (internalizing and externalizing) before (n = 268) and during the lockdown (n = 157) by a validated questionnaire. RESULTS: Preschoolers showed a decrease in total PA (mean difference [MD] = -43.3 min per day, 95% CI -68.1 to -18.5), sleep efficiency (MD = -2.09%, 95% CI -4.12 to -0.05), an increase in sedentary time (MD = 50.2 min per day, 95% CI 17.1 to 83.3) internalizing (MD = 0.17, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28) and externalizing (MD = 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.44) problems. Preschoolers who met the World Health Organization recommendations for PA had lower internalizing scores than non-active peers (MD = -1.28, 95% CI -2.53 to -0.03).

Following introduction of national antibiotic recommendations for suspected bacterial respiratory tract infection complicating COVID-19, a point prevalence survey of prescribing was conducted across acute hospitals in Scotland. METHODS: Patients in designated COVID-19 units were included and demographic, clinical and antimicrobial data were collected from 15 hospitals on a single day between 20th and 30th April 2020. Comparisons were made between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients and patients on non-critical care and critical care units. Factors associated with antibiotic prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were examined using Univariable and multivariable regression analyses. FINDINGS: There were 820 patients were included, 64.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 14.9% were managed in critical care, and 22.1% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were considered probable or definite nosocomial infections. On the survey day, antibiotic prevalence was 45.0% and 73.9% were prescribed for suspected respiratory tract infection. Amoxicillin, doxycycline and co-amoxiclav accounted for over half of all antibiotics in non-critical care wards and meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and co-amoxiclav accounted for approximately half prescribed in critical care. Of all SARS-CoV-2 patients, 38.3% were prescribed antibiotics. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, COPD/chronic lung disease and CRP &#8805; 100a?mg/l were associated with higher odds and probable or confirmed nosocomial COVID-19, diabetes and management on an elderly care ward had lower odds of an antibiotic prescription. Systemic antifungals were prescribed in 9.8% of critical care patients and commenced a median of 18 days after critical care admission. INTERPRETATION: A relatively low prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalised patients and low proportion of broad spectrum antibiotics in non-critical care settings was observed potentially reflecting national antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. Broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal prescribing in critical care units was observed indicating the importance of infection prevention and control and stewardship initiatives in this setting.

J. M. Spaan, P. J. M. Rottier, M. C. Horzinek, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, Virology 108:424-434, 1981). The individual RNAs, prepared by agarose gel electrophoresis of the polyadenylated RNA fraction from infected cells, were obtained pure, except for the preparations of RNAs 4, 5, and 6, which contained some contamination of RNA 7. The RNAs were microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and after incubation of these cells in the presence of [35S]methionine, the proteins synthesized were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Whereas no translation products of RNAs 1, 2, 4, and 5 were detected, the synthesis of virus-specific polypeptides coded by RNAs 3, 6, and 7 was observed. RNA 7 (0.6 X 10(6) daltons) directed the synthesis of a 54,000-molecular-weight polypeptide which comigrated with viral nucleocapsid protein and which was immunoprecipitated by antiserum from mice that had been infected with the virus. RNA 6 (0.9 X 10(6) daltons) directed the synthesis of three polypeptides with molecular weights of 24,000, 25,500, and 26,500, which migrated with the same electrophoretic mobilities as three low-molecular-weight virion polypeptides. After injection of RNA 3 (3.0 X 10(6) daltons), a polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 150,000 was immunoprecipitated. This polypeptide had no counterpart in the virion, but comigrated with a virus-specific glycoprotein present in infected cells which is immunoprecipitated by a rabbit antiserum against the mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 structural proteins. This antiserum could also immunoprecipitate the translation products of RNAs 3, 6, and 7. These results indicate that RNAs 3, 6, and 7 encode viral structural proteins.

MERS-CoV is prone to cause endemic disease in the Middle East, with several dozen spillover infections to other continents. It is hypothesized that MERS-CoV originated from bat coronaviruses and that dromedary camels are its natural reservoir. Although gene segments identical to MERS-CoV were sequenced from certain species of bats and one species experimentally shed the virus, it is still unknown whether other bats can transmit the virus. Here, at the molecular level, we found that all purified bat CD26s (bCD26s) from a diverse range of species interact with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV, with equilibrium dissociation constant values ranging from several to hundreds at the micromolar level. Moreover, all bCD26s expressed in this study mediated the entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV to receptor-expressing cells, indicating the broad potential engagement of bCD26s as MERS-CoV receptors. Further structural analysis indicated that in the bat receptor, compared to the human receptor, substitutions of key residues and their adjacent amino acids leads to decreased binding affinity to the MERS-RBD. These results add more evidence to the existing belief that bats are the original source of MERS-CoV and suggest that bCD26s in many species can mediate the entry of the virus, which has significant implications for the surveillance and control of MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE In this study, we found that bat CD26s (bCD26s) from different species exhibit large diversities, especially in the region responsible for binding to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, they maintain the interaction with MERS-RBD at varied affinities and support the entry of pseudotyped MERS-CoV. These bat receptors polymorphisms seem to confer evolutionary pressure for the adaptation of CD26-binding virus, such as the ancestor of MERS-CoV, and led to the generation of diversified CD26-engaging CoV strains. Thus, our data add more evidence to support that bats are the reservoir of MERS-CoV and similar viruses, as well as further emphasize the necessity to survey MERS-CoV and other CoVs among bats.","output":"Molecular Basis of Binding between Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and CD26 from Seven Bat Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak may impact on the incidence rate of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in severely affected areas. However, this phenomenon demands attention also in areas where media and patients were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the healthcare system was not overwhelmed by the huge number of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this observational study, we compared the incidence rate of all consecutive STEMI patients admitted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, during March and April 2020 with the same 2 months of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100a000ainhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, Pa=a0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (Pa=a0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class &#8805;2 in 68% vs. 29%, Pa=a0.003). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","output":"COVID-19 impact on ST-elevation myocardial infarction incidence rate in a Italian STEMI network: a U-shaped curve phenomenon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Local public health services in Germany usually include a local organizational unit that is in charge of the healthcare of children, youths, and families (KJGD). Major tasks are defined in the federal laws for the public health service emphasizing different types of activities in daycare units, schools, and community living environments. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the activities of the KJGD have clearly changed. This article will provide a review of these tasks during the pandemic on the basis of interviews with KJGD administrations in 11 communities of the federal state North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2020.Typically, the KJGD is deeply involved in infection prevention in daycare facilities and schools by providing contact tracing, swab collection, guidance, crisis committee participation, quarantine survey, and data capture. The classic tasks had to be entirely discontinued in some areas, or at least strongly limited. The affected areas include occupational medicine, medical reports, school entry examinations for children, assessment of special education needs, health reporting, cooperation with child protection and early intervention, outbreak management for other infectious diseases, and the closing of immunization gaps.The consequences of discontinuing the original tasks, e.g., missing school entry examinations, cannot be predicted; resumption of these activities is essential.

First, we used data from multiple sources to estimate COVID-19-disrupted BCG vaccination coverage. Second, using a static mathematical model, we estimated the number of additional paediatric TB deaths in the first 15 years of life due to delayed/missed vaccinations in 14 scenariosvarying in duration of disruption, and magnitude and timing of catch-up. We estimated a 25% reduction in global BCG coverage within the disruption period. The best-case scenario (3-month disruption, 100% catch-up within 3 months) resulted in an additional 886 (0.5%) paediatric TB deaths, and the worst-case scenario (6-month disruption with no catch-up) resulted in an additional 33,074 (17%) deaths. The magnitude of catch-up was found to be the most influential variable in minimising excess paediatric TB mortality. Our results show that ensuring catch-up vaccination of missed children is a critical priority, and delivery of BCG alongside other routine vaccines may be a feasible way to achieve catch-up.

The increasing incidence of infections caused by these viruses worldwide has necessitated focused attention to improve both diagnostic as well as treatment modalities. In this second part of a two-part review, we discuss the clinical features, diagnostic modalities, and treatment of zoonotic influenza, and provide an overview of prevention strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Illnesses caused by novel reassortant avian influenza viruses continue to be detected and described; most recently, a human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) has been described from China. We continue to witness increasing rates of A(H7N9) infections, with the latest (fifth) wave, from late 2016 to 2017, being the largest to date. The case fatality rate for A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) infections among humans is much higher than that of seasonal influenza infections. Since the emergence of the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic, and subsequently A(H7N9), testing and surveillance for novel influenzas have become more effective. Various newer treatment options, including peramivir, favipiravir (T-705), and DAS181, and human or murine monoclonal antibodies have been evaluated in vitro and in animal models. SUMMARY: Armed with robust diagnostic modalities, antiviral medications, vaccines, and advanced surveillance systems, we are today better prepared to face a new influenza pandemic and to limit the burden of zoonotic influenza than ever before. Sustained efforts and robust research are necessary to efficiently deal with the highly mutagenic zoonotic influenza viruses.","output":"Zoonotic Influenza and Human HealthPart 2: Clinical Features, Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.4103/ijo.IJO_3763_20].","output":"Erratum: COVID-19 and orbital mucormycosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cells infiltrating the nonsensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ of virus-antibody-free rats exhibited surface immunoreactivity for  (2)-microglobulin and immunoglobulin (Ig) E.

Localization of intracellular granules immunoreactive for lactoferrin and CD18, a leukocyte adhesion molecule, unequivocally identified these cells as neutrophils. The low number of IgA-and IgG-immunoreactive B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and accessory immunocytes in the vomeronasal organ as well as the rest of the nasal cavity confirmed the absence of infection. We hypothesize that the operation of the vomeronasal pump induces repeated episodes of transient focal ischemia followed by reperfusion, which results in release of neutrophil chemoattractants and modulation of adhesion factors that regulate the extravasation and migration of neutrophils into the nonsensory epithelium. The distribution of immunoreactivity for interleukin 8 suggests that it is not the primary neutrophil chemoattractant in this system while that of CD18 suggests its active involvement in neutrophil extravasation. In addition to their role in immune surveillance, neutrophils may stimulate ion/water secretion into the vomeronasal lumen, affecting the perireceptor processes regulating stimulus access and clearance from the sensory epithelium.","output":"Identification of neutrophils in the nonsensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ in virus-antibody-free rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a cloud-based multimodal dialog platform for the remote assessment and monitoring of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) at scale.

SARS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 as a receptor for cell entry and infection. While both ACE inhibitors and spironolactone can upregulate tissue ACE2, there are important points of discrimination between these approaches. The virus requires proteolytic processing of its spike protein by transmembrane protease receptor serine type 2 (TMPRSS2) to enable binding to cellular ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 contains an androgen promoter, it may be downregulated by the antiandrogenic actions of spironolactone. Furin and plasmin also process the spike protein. They are inhibited by protease nexin 1 or serine E2 (PN1) that is upregulated by angiotensin II but downregulated by aldosterone. Therefore, spironolactone should selectively downregulate furin and plasmin. Furin also promotes pulmonary edema while plasmin promotes hemovascular dysfunction. Thus, a downregulation of furin and plasmin by PN1 could be a further benefit of MRAs beyond their well established organ protection. We review the evidence that spironolactone may be the preferred RASSi to increase PN1 and decrease TMPRSS2, furin and plasmin activities and thereby to reduce viral cell binding, entry, infectivity and bad outcomes.

Interprofessional learning (IPL) has been suggested to achieve the triple aim of better services, better outcomes and reduced costs. The aims were to assess 1) to what extent students taking teacher education, health and social care programmes agreed that blended learning was a suitable approach in a mandatory IPL course, 2) to what extent they had learnt about the WHOs core IPL competencies (roles and responsibilities, values and ethics, interprofessional communication, and teams and teamwork), and 3) the students ranking of the learning outcomes from different components of the IPL course. METHODS: This was a quantitative cross-sectional study. Students completed an online course evaluation after a two-day combination of online and face-to-face IPL small-group training. FINDINGS: The response rate was 25.8% (n=363). Among the students, 60.6% strongly agreed that blended learning was suitable, while 8.9% strongly disagreed. Among the respondents, 46.8%, 50.2%, 56.8% and 62.3% gained increased insight into roles and responsibilities, values and ethics, interprofessional communication, and teams and teamwork, respectively.

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax. In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who developed a pneumothorax with those who did not develop a pneumothorax. METHODS: This study was a multicenter retrospective analysis of all adult critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to intensive care units in 4 tertiary care centers in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 842 critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection were analyzed, out of which 594 (71%) were mechanically ventilated. The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 85/842 (10%), and 80/594 (13%) in those who were mechanically ventilated. As compared to mechanically ventilated patients in the non-pneumothorax group, mechanically ventilated patients in the pneumothorax group had worse respiratory parameters at the time of intubation (mean PaO2:FiO2 ratio 105 vs 150, P<0.001 and static respiratory system compliance: 30ml/cmH2O vs 39ml/cmH2O, P = 0.01) and significantly higher in-hospital mortality (63% vs 49%, P = 0.04).

Studies on food fortification found increases by 10C42 nmol/L, thus largely in the range of increases previously demonstrated by supplementation. Fortification is estimated to be considerably less expensive than supplementation. It might be similarly effective as supplementation in reducing cancer mortality and might even achieve such reduction at substantially larger net savings.

However, the epidemiological literature from Pakistan is scanty. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from 412 patients who were residents of East Karachi and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between February 26 to April 24, 2020. Patients' demographics, symptoms, travel and contact history, and outcomes were recorded. All statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Results Most of the patients were male (64.6%), the majority (43.3%) belonging to the 21- to 40-year age group. Most of the patients (65.5%) were residents of Gulshan Iqbal. A total of 15.8% of the patients were admitted to the hospital, and 3.9% of patients expired. The three most common presenting symptoms were fever (74.8%), cough (60.4%), and flu (35.5%). The majority of patients (89.3%) gave a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients. Conclusion The number of SARS-CoV-2 cases is rapidly increasing in Karachi, Pakistan.

Methods A cross-sectional internet study was performed on a population of 4,499 Toxoplasma-free and 786 Toxoplasma-infected subjects and looked for factors which positively or negatively affect the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and likelihood of a severe course of Covid-19. Findings Logistic regression and partial Kendall correlation controlled for sex, age, and size of the place of residence showed that latent toxoplasmosis had the strongest effect on the risk of infection (OR = 1.50) before sport (OR = 1.30), and borreliosis (1.27). It also had the strongest effect on the risk of severe course of infection (Tau = 0.146), before autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, male sex, keeping a cat, being overweight, borreliosis, higher age, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Toxoplasmosis augmented the adverse effects of other risk factors but was not the proximal cause of the effect of cat keeping (in the form of higher likelihood of Covid infection and higher severity of the course of infection), which was observed especially in a subset of Toxoplasma-infected subjects (Tau = 0.153). Effects of keeping a cat were detected only in subjects from multi-member families, suggesting that a cat could a vector for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a family. Interpretations Toxoplasmosis is currently not considered a risk factor for Covid-19 and Toxoplasma-infected subjects are neither informed about their higher risks nor prioritised in vaccination programs.

Totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAP) are the standard access for administration of these regimens. The regimens usually involve periods of neutropenia for which infection can increase morbidity and require removal of the port. Although deemed safe for use in cancer populations, many studies have only looked at patients with TIVAP in solid tumor malignancies. Herein, we report our single institution experience identifying modulators for infection related to TIVAP in this high-risk population. OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for port infection in HM patients. METHODS: We performed an IRB-approved single institution retrospective review of HM patients who had a TIVAP removed for port infection versus completion of therapy. Medical records were evaluated for patient demographics and tumor type, details of previous therapy regimens such as chemotherapy and HSCT status, laboratory values including albumin, white blood cell, neutrophil and platelet counts, as well as characteristics of the TIVAP. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed between the two cohorts to identify clinical predictors of port infection necessitating TIVAP removal. RESULTS: Between March 2015 and July 2018, 104 TIVAPs were removed from HM patients, 34 (33%) for infection and 70 (67%) for completion of treatment. Median patient age was 60 years (range 22-86) and there was an even number of men and women (n=52). Most TIVAPs were double lumen (n=98, 94%) and placed in the right IJV (n=100, 96%). The median number of port days was 49 in the infection group and 414 in the completion group, with removal of 12 (35%) of the infected ports within 30 days. Multiple factors were significant predictors of port infection on univariate analysis, including diagnosis of AML or ALL (p=0.0019), no prior HSCT (p=0.0148), neutropenia within 30 days of removal (p<0.0001), ANC <1500 (p <0.0001), leukopenia the day prior to removal (p<0.0001), thrombocytopenia (p <0.0001), and hypoalbuminemia (p<0.0001). Steroid use, leukopenia or leukocytosis the day of placement, and leukocytosis the day prior to removal were not significantly different between the two groups. On multivariate analysis, no prior HSCT (OR=48.08, 95% CI 2.64-875.63, p=0.009), neutropenia within 30 days of removal (OR=67.60, 95% CI 1.68-2726.66, p=0.026), and hypoalbuminemia (OR=405.52, 95% CI 15.64-10517.89, p<0.0001) remained significant. CONCLUSION: In patients with HM, significant predictors of port infection requiring TIVAP removal included neutropenia within 30 days of removal and hypoalbuminemia.

Due to inherent sparsity in high-dimensional data, distances between objects tend to become meaningless since the distances between any two objects measured in the full dimensional space tend to become the same for all pairs of objects. In this work, we present a novel oriented subspace clustering algorithm that is able to deal with such issues and detects arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters in high-dimensional data streams. Data streams generally implicate the challenge that the data cannot be stored entirely and hence there is a general demand for suitable data handling strategies for clustering algorithms such that the data can be processed within a single scan. We therefore propose the CashStream algorithm that unites state-of-the-art stream processing techniques and additionally relies on the Hough transform to detect arbitrarily oriented subspace clusters.

Aims: The study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on lifestyles and mental health of elderly at increased risk of dementia. Methods: One hundred and twenty six community-dwelling seniors with MCI or SCD were phone-interviewed and assessed with questions regarding variables related to COVID-19 pandemic, lifestyle changes and scales validated for the assessment of depression, anxiety, and apathy. Results: The sample included 55.6% patients with MCI and 56 people with SCD. Over 1/3 of the sample reduced their physical activity and nearly 70% reported an increase in idle time.

In this paper we further substantiate the success story of GAMs, demonstrating their flexibility by focusing on three relevant pandemic-related issues. First, we examine the interdepency among infections in different age groups, concentrating on school children. In this context, we derive the setting under which parameter estimates are independent of the (unknown) case-detection ratio, which plays an important role in COVID-19 surveillance data. Second, we model the incidence of hospitalisations, for which data is only available with a temporal delay. We illustrate how correcting for this reporting delay through a nowcasting procedure can be naturally incorporated into the GAM framework as an offset term. Third, we propose a multinomial model for the weekly occupancy of intensive care units (ICU), where we distinguish between the number of COVID-19 patients, other patients and vacant beds.

Oxygen saturation is one of the most important bioindicators for measuring human health. For example, when a person contracts COVID-19, which is currently prevalent, oxygen uptake does not work properly and oxygen saturation drops without the person being aware of it, which may lead to severe symptoms. Monitoring oxygen saturation is very important so that the person receives treatment before such a situation occurs. The commonly used contact sensor is uncomfortable because of its pressure and it is difficult to wear on a daily basis, so non-contact estimation of oxygen saturation is desirable. To estimate oxygen saturation using a contact sensor, the difference in the absorption coefficients of oxidized hemoglobin and deoxidized hemoglobin is used. Using the same principle, it is possible to estimate oxygen saturation without contact using the signals from two channels obtained by an RGB camera. Currently, many smartphones are equipped with infrared cameras for face recognition, and increasingly more models are equipped with multi-camera systems consisting of RGB and infrared cameras. In such cases, it is difficult to take advantage of the multiple bands because the optimal combination of bands for oxygen saturation estimation varies depending on the imaging environment and the subject. In this study, to select the optimal combination of bands from multi-band video images, we used a Monte Carlo simulation of light scattering on the skin to simulate pulse waves during oxygen saturation changes while measuring the signals with a multi-band camera. We further propose a method to select the most accurate combination for estimating the oxygen saturation based on the features obtained from the pulse wave.","output":"Oxygen Saturation Estimation Based on Optimal Band Selection from Multi-band Video"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By Alexandra Witze In the summer of 1948, a small group of men in Juneau, Alaska, packed boots, axes, ropes and camping gear, and set off into the ice and snow that sprawls just north of the city.

Endothelial dysfunction is emerging as one of the main contributors to the pathogenesis of thromboembolic events in COVID-19. Endothelial dysfunction is usually referred to as reduced nitric oxide bioavailability. However, failures of the endothelium to control coagulation, inflammation, or permeability are also instances of endothelial dysfunction.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between acute deterioration risk, care complexity factors and unfavourable outcomes in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A multicentre cohort study was conducted from 1 to 31 March 2020 at seven hospitals in Catalonia. All adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals and with a complete minimum data set were recruited retrospectively. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of a composite unfavourable outcome (in-hospital mortality and adverse events). The main measures included risk of acute deterioration (as measured using the VIDA early warning system) and care complexity factors. All data were obtained blinded from electronic health records. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify the VIDA score and complexity factors associated with unfavourable outcomes. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1176 patients with COVID-19, 506 (43%) experienced an unfavourable outcome during hospitalisation. The frequency of unfavourable outcomes rose with increasing risk of acute deterioration as measured by the VIDA score. Risk factors independently associated with unfavourable outcomes were chronic underlying disease (OR: 1.90, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.72; p<0.001), mental status impairment (OR: 2.31, 95% CI 1.45 to 23.66; p<0.001), length of hospital stay (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.21; p<0.001) and high risk of acute deterioration (OR: 4.32, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.60; p<0.001). High-tech hospital admission was a protective factor against unfavourable outcomes (OR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89; p=0.01).

Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P<0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Methods: Infection disease outcomes were investigated using a Bayesian approach applied to an age-structured mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression in the population. The model was fitted to infection and disease time-series and age-stratified data. Two separate criteria for classifying morbidity were used: one based on actual recorded hospital admission (acute-care or intensive-care-unit hospitalization) and one based on clinical presentation as per World Health Organization classification of disease severity or criticality. Results: All outcomes showed very strong age dependence, with low values for those <50 years of age, but rapidly growing rates for those []50 years of age. The strong age dependence was particularly pronounced for infection criticality rate and infection fatality rate. Infection acute-care and intensive-care-unit bed hospitalization rates were estimated at 13.10 (95% CI: 12.82-13.24) and 1.60 (95% CI: 1.58-1.61) per 1,000 infections, respectively.

PATHWEIGH is a pragmatic approach to weight management that uses tools built into the electronic medical record to overcome barriers and guide care. Implementation strategies are employed to facilitate adoption and use of the PATHWEIGH tools and processes. The current study will compare the effectiveness of PATHWEIGH versus standard of care (SOC) on patient weight loss in primary care and explore factors for its successful implementation. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design will be used within an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study. Adult patient weight loss and weight loss maintenance will be compared in PATHWEIGH versus SOC in 57 family and internal medicine clinics in a large health system in Colorado, USA. Effectiveness will be evaluated using generalized linear mixed models to determine statistical differences in weight loss and weight loss maintenance at 6, 12, and 18 months. Patient-, provider-, and clinic-level predictors will be identified using mediator and moderator analyses. Conceptually guided by the Practical, Robust, Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), a mixed methods approach including quantitative (practice surveys, use tracking) and qualitative (interviews, observations) data collection will be used to determine factors impeding and facilitating adoption, implementation, and maintenance of PATHWEIGH and evaluate specified implementation strategies. A cost analysis of the practice and system costs and resources required by PATHWEIGH relative to the reimbursement collected will be performed.

We investigated a novel system that employs palladium (Pd0) nanoparticles (PdNPs) for catalytic reductive dechlorination of TCAA. H2 was delivered directly to PdNPs in situ coated on the surface of bubble-free hollow-fiber gas-transfer membranes. The H2-based membrane Pd film reactor (H2-MPfR) achieved a high catalyst-specific TCAA reduction rate, 32 L/g-Pd/min, a value similar to the rate of using homogeneously suspended PdNP, but orders of magnitude higher than with other immobilized PdNP systems. In batch tests, over 99% removal of 1 mM TCAA was achieved in 180 min with strong product selectivity (&#8805; 93%) to acetic acid. During 50 days of continuous operation, over 99% of 1 mg/L influent TCAA was removed, again with acetic acid as the major product (&#8805; 94%). We identified the reaction pathways and their kinetics for TCAA reductive dechlorination with PdNPs using direct delivery of H2. Sustained continuous TCAA removal, high selectivity to acetic acid, and minimal loss of PdNPs support that the H2-MPfR is a promising catalytic reactor to remove chlorinated DBPs in practice.","output":"Stable dechlorination of Trichloroacetic Acid (TCAA) to acetic acid catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles deposited on H2-transfer membranes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global effort to fight the Covid-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of unusual legal measures that restrict individual freedoms and raise acute legal questions.

Because the pandemic diffuses in a complex system, using complexity theory can help align the law with its dynamics and produce a more effective legal response. We demonstrate how insights from complexity concerning temporal and spatial diffusion patterns, or the structure of the social network, can provide counter-intuitive answers to a series of pandemic-related legal questions pertaining to limitations of movement, privacy, business and religious freedoms, or prioritizing access to vaccines.

Methods A total of 63 patients (49 males, 14 females, mean age: 44.914.4 years; range, 14 to 64 years) who underwent lung transplantation in our institution between December 2016 and December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics and perioperative clinical data of patients were recorded. After induction and pulmonary artery catheterization, cardiac output, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, pulmonary vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance, and right atrial pressure were measured using the thermodilution technique. Results Thirty-three of the patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support during surgery. The right atrial pressure (p<0.001), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p<0.002), mean pulmonary artery pressure (p<0.001), and pulmonary vascular resistance (p<0.001) were statistically significantly higher in the patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support intraoperatively. The systemic vascular resistance (p<0.032) was statistically significantly lower in the patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support intraoperatively. A mean pulmonary artery pressure of >39 mmHg (p<0.02) and a right atrial pressure of >12 mmHg (p<0.047) were independent risk factors for ECMO support intraoperatively during lung transplantation. Conclusion Predicting the need of intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support is of utmost importance in timing the need for mechanical support, protecting the new graft from high mechanical ventilator pressures, and adequately maintaining hemodynamic stability.","output":"The role of intraoperative pulmonary arterial catheterization data in determining the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in lung transplantation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Preliminary reports have described significant procoagulant events in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), including life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). MAIN TEXT We review the current data on the epidemiology, the possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the therapeutic implications of PE in relation to COVID-19. The incidence of PE is reported to be around 2.6-8.9% of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and up to one-third of those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation. This may be explained by direct and indirect pathologic consequences of COVID-19, complement activation, cytokine release, endothelial dysfunction, and interactions between different types of blood cells. CONCLUSION Thromboprophylaxis should be started in all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the hospital. The use of an intermediate therapeutic dose of low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin can be considered on an individual basis in patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism, including critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Decisions about extending prophylaxis with LMWH after hospital discharge should be made after balancing the reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with the risk of increased bleeding events and should be continued for 7-14 days after hospital discharge or in the pre-hospital phase in case of pre-existing or persisting VTE risk factors. Therapeutic anticoagulation is the cornerstone in the management of patients with PE.

Coping with emerging infectious diseases such as Covid-19, different mitigation policies are developed by countries. However, the benefit of each mitigation policy is still not well-explored due to the considerable difference between implementations of policies in each country. The question is which policies play a significant role in controlling Covid-19 transmission. Developing two models used in Artificial Neural Network, this study investigates the impact of mitigation policies or strategies (a combination of policies) by considering different vaccination and mutation scenarios. The former model requires the prediction of reproduction number based on the number of cases reported in previous days;whereas, the latter model is constructed based on the number of people impacted by a mitigation policy or strategy. Although the first model yields more accurate results, it requires the use of historical data;hence, the passage of time during a critical period of fighting against Covid-19. The benefit of the second model is that it can be implemented more quickly by determining a coefficient for each policy or strategy based on the restricted population and/or limited mobility. Testing different scenarios through a real-world example from Turkey, we find mitigation policies or strategies play a significant role in controlling Covid-19;as well as vaccination and mutation scenarios. Our results suggest continuous and predetermined mitigation policies or strategies should be implemented to control the spread of infectious diseases in addition to a successful vaccination program.","output":"To restrict or not to restrict?

The purpose of this paper was to find out the impact of migrant population on the epidemic, aiming to provide data support and suggestions for control measures in various epidemic areas. Generalized additive model was utilized to model the relationship between migrant population and the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. The difference of spatial distribution was analyzed through spatial autocorrelation and hot spot analysis. Generalized additive model demonstrated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases was positively correlated with migration index and population density. The predictive results showed that, if no travel restrictions are imposed on the migrant population as usual, this number of COVID-19 would have reached 27,483 (95% CI 16,074, 48,097; the actual number was 23,177). The increase in one city (Jian) would be 577.23% (95% CI 322.73%, 972.73%) compared with the real confirmed cases of COVID-19. The average increase in 73 cities was 85.53% (95% CI 19.53%, 189.81%). Among the migration destinations, the number of cases in cities of Hubei province, Chongqing, and Beijing was relatively high, and there were large-scale high-prevalence clusters in eastern Hubei province. Without restrictions on migration, the high prevalence areas in Hubei province and its surrounding areas will be further expanded. The reduced population mobility and population density can greatly slow down the spread of the epidemic. All epidemic areas should suspend the transportation between cities, strictly control the population travel, and decrease the population density, so as to reduce the spread of COVID-19.","output":"Reductions of migrant population reduces the number of COVID-19 epidemic: a case study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing respiratory COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the social and private lives of the majority of the global population. This infection is primarily transmitted via virus-laden fluid particles (i.e., droplets and aerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of infected individuals and expelled from the mouth in the course of breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the world, the public has been asked or even obliged to use face covers. It is plausible that in the years ahead we will see the use of face masks, face shields and respirators become a normal practice in our life. However, wearing face covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer heat, while staying on beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in gyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become contaminated with time and need to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are caused by the fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward and outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen. Applying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material based protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air across the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging virus-laden particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a consequence, displacing them away from their primary trajectories. The study, shows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can effectively provide both inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal protective equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus infection like COVID-19.","output":"Study of Air Curtain in Context of Individual Protection from Exposure to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Contained in Cough-Generated Fluid Particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reproductive number R_0 (and its value after initial disease emergence R) has long been used to predict the likelihood of pathogen invasion, to gauge the potential severity of an epidemic, and to set policy around interventions.

We evaluated a cost-effective strategy for SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine point prevalence in a rural community with a generally low prevalence of infection. METHODS: We voluntarily tested asymptomatic clinic employees and conducted 2 community SARS-CoV-2 testing events in Cashton, Wisconsin, that included testing for asymptomatic persons. We also partnered with local clinics and public health departments to conduct weekly drive-up clinics for asymptomatic, high-risk persons identified through enhanced contact tracing. This was possible as testing capacity in Wisconsin never reached its maximum, and we continued symptomatic testing through our clinic. RESULTS: We tested 61 employees, 268 individuals at 2 community events, 36 high-risk asymptomatic people at drive-up clinic events, and 128 symptomatic people within our clinic. We observed 1 positive result in asymptomatic people and 5 positive results in symptomatic patients, confirming the low prevalence in our area. CONCLUSIONS: Our testing events confirmed a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing prevalence information to local businesses and schools. We reinforced our partnership with local public health departments to facilitate enhanced contact tracing and test asymptomatic persons, and we provided a service to asymptomatic persons requiring testing for travel, school, or work.

One such therapy involves the consumption of chlorine dioxide, which is commonly used in the cleaning industry and is available commercially as a mineral solution. This substance has been promoted as a preventive or treatment agent for several diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. As interest in chlorine dioxide has grown since the start of the pandemic, health agencies, institutions, and organizations worldwide have tried to discourage and restrict the consumption of this substance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze search engine trends in Mexico to evaluate changes in public interest in chlorine dioxide since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrieved public query data for the Spanish equivalent of the term chlorine dioxide from the Google Trends platform. The location was set to Mexico, and the time frame was from March 3, 2019, to February 21, 2021. A descriptive analysis was performed. The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were used to identify significant changes in search volumes for this term between four consecutive time periods, each of 13 weeks, from March 1, 2020, to February 27, 2021. RESULTS: From the start of the pandemic in Mexico (February 2020), an upward trend was observed in the number of searches compared with that in 2019. Maximum volume trends were recorded during the week of July 19-25, 2020. The search volumes declined between September and November 2020, but another peak was registered in December 2020 through February 2021, which reached a maximum value on January 10.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analytical, observational, and transversal study was carried out in 403 dentistry students in the last two years from three Peruvian universities from May to July 2020. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale was used to detect anxiety symptoms and their respective diagnoses. A logit model was used to evaluate the association of the variables: age group (X1), gender (X2), type of university (X3), and marital status (X4), with the anxiety levels of the students, considering a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety resulted in 56.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.9C61.7) of 403 dentistry students. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the type of university was the only variable that demonstrated to have a significant influence on the development of anxiety with an odds ratio (OR = 1.98; CI: 1.29C3.02); whereas the other variables such as age group (OR = 0.77; CI: 0.49C1.20), gender (OR = 1.15; CI: 0.72C1.84), and marital status (OR = 0.75; CI: 0.35C1.60) were not considered factors that influenced the development of anxiety.

Those with more severe illness had older mean age, higher median body mass index, and pre-existing medical comorbidities. Four maternal deaths (0.3%) were attributed to COVID-19. Frequency of perinatal death or a positive neonatal SARS-CoV-2 test result did not differ by severity. Adverse perinatal outcomes were more frequent among patients with more severe illness, including 6% (95% CI 2-11%) incidence of venous thromboembolism among those with severe-critical illness compared with 0.2% in mild-moderate and 0% in asymptomatic (P<.001 for trend across severity). In adjusted analyses, severe-critical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of cesarean birth (59.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.90), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (40.4% vs 18.8%, aRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18-2.20), and preterm birth (41.8% vs 11.9%, aRR 3.53, 95% CI 2.42-5.14) compared with asymptomatic patients. Mild-moderate COVID-19 was not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes compared with asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: Compared with pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms, those with severe-critical COVID-19, but not those with mild-moderate COVID-19, were at increased risk of perinatal complications.","output":"Disease Severity and Perinatal Outcomes of Pregnant Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES To understand how children perceive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in relation to public representations and to evaluate their interpretations. METHODS Children's perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by asking 103 French children, aged 5 to 17 years old, first to draw a coronavirus and then to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a series of 16 images during summer 2020. RESULTS One hundred three children were included in the study, either during outpatient visits at the hospital (in Marseille and Paris) or through the authors' social network, and were grouped in terms of age, parents' occupation, mode of recruitment, and recollection of having previously seen a representation of a coronavirus. Half of the children drew the coronavirus as circular in shape, and almost all included a crownlike feature. One-third of the drawings had anthropomorphic features. Although the pictorial representations of the virus were fairly accurate overall, the children's interpretations of the crownlike structure were imaginative. The explanations the children gave for their drawings were in some cases surprising. Among the 16 pictures they were shown, the children correctly identified those of SARS-CoV-2, other than the electron micrograph, in more than two-thirds of cases. CONCLUSIONS Children of all ages, even the youngest, and both sexes had a relatively accurate perception of SARS-CoV-2, as evaluated through their drawings and their ability to recognize it among other pictures. The children's drawings of the coronavirus were colorful and had a less frightening tone than expected in the light of media coverage, suggesting that they had developed coping mechanisms.","output":"Children's Drawings of Coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a large-scale study, 128176 non-pregnant patients (228 studies) and 10000 pregnant patients (121 studies) confirmed COVID-19 cases included in this Meta-Analysis. The mean (confidence interval [CI]) of age and gestational age of admission (GA) in pregnant women was 33 (28-37) years old and 36 (34-37) weeks, respectively. Pregnant women show the same manifestations of COVID-19 as non-pregnant adult patients. Fever (pregnant: 75.5%; non-pregnant: 74%) and cough (pregnant: 48.5%; non-pregnant: 53.5%) are the most common symptoms in both groups followed by myalgia (26.5%) and chill (25%) in pregnant and dysgeusia (27%) and fatigue (26.5%) in non-pregnant patients. Pregnant women are less probable to show cough (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.67-0.75), fatigue (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.54-0.61), sore throat (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.61-0.7), headache (OR: 0.55; CI: 0.55-0.58) and diarrhea (OR: 0.46; CI: 0.4-0.51) than non-pregnant adult patients. The most common imaging found in pregnant women is ground-glass opacity (57%) and in non-pregnant patients is consolidation (76%). Pregnant women have higher proportion of leukocytosis (27% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 12.5%) and have lower proportion of raised C-reactive protein (52% vs. 81%) compared with non-pregnant patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are almost the same in both groups. The most common comorbidity in pregnant patients is diabetes (18%) and in non-pregnant patients is hypertension (21%). Case fatality rate (CFR) of non-pregnant hospitalized patients is 6.4% (4.4-8.5), and mortality due to all-cause for pregnant patients is 11.3% (9.6-13.3). Regarding the complications of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage (54.5% [7-94]), caesarean delivery (48% [42-54]), preterm labor (25% [4-74]) and preterm birth (21% [12-34]) are in turn the most prevalent complications. Comparing the pregnancy outcomes show that caesarean delivery (OR: 3; CI: 2-5), low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 9; CI: 2.4-30) and preterm birth (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.5-3.5) are more probable in pregnant woman with COVID-19 than pregnant women without COVID-19. The most prevalent neonatal complications are neonatal intensive care unit admission (43% [2-96]), fetal distress (30% [12-58]) and LBW (25% [16-37]). The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3-16), and the rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 is 8% (4-16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID-19 suggest a possible association between COVID-19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID-19 pregnant patients.","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 and comparison with control patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence of interest is present.

Epidemiological feature, clinical records, laboratory and radiology manifestations were collected and analyzed. 323 patients with mild-moderate symptoms on admission were observed to determine whether they exacerbated to severe-critically ill conditions (progressive group) or not (stable group). We used logistic regression to identify the risk factors associated with clinical progression. RESULTS: Of all the 333 patients, 70 (21.0%) patients progressed into severe-critically ill conditions during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group, 253 (76.0%) patients belonged to the stable group, another 10 patients were severe before admission. we found that the clinical features of aged over 40 (3.80 [1.72, 8.52]), males (2.21 [1.20, 4.07]), with comorbidities (1.78 [1.13, 2.81]) certain exposure history (0.38 [0.20, 0.71]), abnormal radiology manifestations (3.56 [1.13, 11.40]), low level of T lymphocytes (0.99 [0.997, 0.999]), high level of NLR (0.99 [0.97, 1.01]), IL-6 (1.05 [1.03, 1.07]) and CRP (1.67 [1.12, 2.47]) were the risk factors of disease progression by logistic regression.

We evaluated the trajectories of clinical and laboratory parameters in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: We used data from adult HD patients treated at an integrated kidney disease company who received a RT-PCR test to investigate suspicion of a SARS-CoV-2 infection between 01 May and 01 Sep 2020. Nonparametric smoothing splines were used to fit data for individual trajectories and estimate the mean change over time in patients testing positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 and those who survived or died within 30 days of first suspicion or positive test date. For each clinical parameter of interest, the difference in average daily changes between COVID-19 positive versus negative group and COVID-19 survivor versus non-survivor group was estimated by fitting a linear mixed effects model based on measurements in the 14 days before (i.e., day -14 to day 0) day 0. Results: There were 12,836 HD patients with a suspicion of COVID-19 who received RT-PCR testing (8,895 SARS-CoV-2 positive). We observed significantly different trends (p<0.05) in pre-HD systolic blood pressure (SBP), pre-HD pulse rate, body temperature, ferritin, lymphocytes, albumin, and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) between COVID-19 positive and negative patient.

Previous studies have found increased circulating levels of HSP60 in hypertensive patients, as well as enhanced HSP60 expression and membrane translocation in the hypertrophic myocardium. These observations are of particular interest, since they could provide a possible pathophysiological explanation of the severe course and worse outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in hypertensive patients, repeatedly reported during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related to hyperinflammatory response and cytokine storm development during the third phase of the disease.

This work employed the quantitative analysis of multi-components by a single marker (QAMS) method to quantitatively determine the six effective components of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and glycyrrhetinic acid in Glycyrrhiza uralensis, which was used for comprehensive evaluation of the optimal extraction process by DESs. First, Choline Chloride: Lactic Acid (ChCl-LA, molar ratio 1:1) was selected as the most suitable DES by comparing the extraction yields of different DESs. Second, the extraction protocol was investigated by extraction time, extraction temperature, liquid-to-material ratio, molar ratio, and ultrasonic power. The BoxCBehnken design (BBD) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the optimal DES conditions. The result showed that the best DES system was 1.3-butanediol/choline chloride (ChCl) with the molar ratio of 4:1. The optimal extraction process of licorice was 20 mL/g, the water content was 30%, and the extraction time was 41 min. The comprehensive impact factor (z) was 0.92. At the same time, it was found that the microstructure of the residue extracted by the eutectic solvent was more severely damaged than the residue after the traditional solvent extraction through observation under an electron microscope.

Background Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus that is associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal tract disease. Objectives To investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBoV amongst hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in Cambodia. Study Design Samples were collected from 2773 patients of all ages hospitalised with symptoms of ALRI between 2007 and 2009. All samples were screened by multiplex RT\\\\PCR/PCR for 18 respiratory viruses. All samples positive for HBoV were sequenced and included in this study. Results Of the samples tested, 43 (15%) were positive for HBoV. The incidence of HBoV did not vary between the consecutive seasons investigated, and HBoV infections were detected year\\\\round. The incidence of HBoV infection was highest in patients aged <2 years, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most common clinical diagnosis, regardless of age. A total of 19 patients (44%) were co\\\\infected with HBoV and an additional respiratory pathogen. All isolates were classified as HBoV type 1 (HBoV\\\\1). High conservation between Cambodian NP1 and V1V2 gene sequences was observed. Conclusions Human bocavirus infection can result in serious illness, however is frequently detected in the context of viral co\\\\infection.

We present a case of acute coagulopathy secondary to consumption in a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient. Case Report: A G6P5 35 weeks pregnant Asian woman was admitted after reporting no fetal movements for 14 h. She gave a history of lung disease, having been ventilated as a premature neonate. Her BMI was 30 kg/m2 and blood group AB. She was known to be SARS-CoV-2 positive from a test eight days earlier. She had a mild cough but was otherwise asymptomatic, with observations within normal ranges. Fetal heart rate on admission had poor variability and unprovoked decelerations necessitating delivery by caesarean section. Blood results before surgery revealed a platelet count of 55x10 9/L but on balance of risk she was consented for spinal anaesthesia. In theatre, bloods that were taken, including a thromboelastogram (TEG6, Haemonetics), revealed a coagulopathy with fibrinogen 0.7 g/L, platelets 45x10 9/L, APTT 55.9 s, and D-dimer [Formula presented]0 ug/ml. There was no evidence of placental abruption, bacterial sepsis, pre-eclampsia or liver dysfunction. The baby was delivered in poor condition with an arterial pH of 6.96 and base excess of -14. Due to prolonged operating time conversion to general anaesthesia was required. The woman was transferred to intensive care and remained sedated for 36 h before returning to theatre for removal of abdominal packs. Bloods taken on admission to intensive care included IL-6 27.3 pg/mL, troponin 15.3 ng/L and lipopolysaccharide binding protein 27.0 ug/mL, all suggestive of severe COVID-19 disease and poor prognosis. She made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home 11 days later with her baby. Placental pathology revealed multiple evolving infarcts in keeping with inflammatory changes induced by COVID-19. The working diagnosis was acute consumptive coagulopathy secondary to COVID-19. Discussion: The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommends that all patients presenting with COVID-19 have their platelet count, D-dimers and prothrombin time measured, as derangement has been associated with worse outcome.1 APTT and fibrinogen levels should also be measured in pregnant patients, and an individualised thromboprophylaxis programme commenced.2 Those developing a consumptive coagulopathy are at high risk of venous thromboembolism and must be treated accordingly. Timing of delivery and mode of anaesthesia in such patients needs a multidisciplinary team approach. Prolonged sedation meant difficulty in monitoring for the development of a neuraxial haematoma in this patient. We suggest a low threshold for magnetic resonance imaging in such circumstances.","output":"P.121 Acute consumptive coagulopathy in a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"de Garengeot herniae have been reported in <100 cases in literature.

The therapy can be complicated by venous thromboembolism due to COVID-19-related hypercoagulability, thus restricting vascular access beyond the vvECMO cannula. Although continuous renal replacement therapy can be performed via a vvECMO circuit, studies addressing sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) integration into vvECMO circuits are scarce. Here we address the lack of evidence by evaluating feasibility of SLED integration into vvECMO circuits. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study on nine critically ill COVID-19 patients, treated with integrated ECMO-SLED on a single intensive care unit at a tertiary healthcare facility between December 2020 and November 2021. The SLED circuits were established between the accessory arterial oxygenator outlets of a double-oxygenator vvECMO setup. Data on filter survival, quality of dialysis, and volume management were collected and compared with an internal control group receiving single SLED. RESULTS: This study demonstrates general feasibility of SLED integration into existing vvECMO circuits. Filter lifespans of ECMO-SLED compared with single SLED are significantly prolonged (median 18.3 h vs. 10.3 h, p < 0.01). ECMO-SLED treatment is furthermore able to sufficiently normalize creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum sodium, and allows for adequate ultrafiltration rates. CONCLUSIONS: We can show that ECMO-SLED is practical, safe, results in adequate dialysis quality and enables sufficient electrolyte and volume management.

Emergency departments (EDs) experienced unexpected and dramatic decreases in patient volume, raising concerns about exacerbating health disparities. METHODS: We queried our electronic health record to describe the overall change in visits to a two-ED healthcare system in Northern California from March-June 2020 compared to 2019. We compared weekly absolute numbers and proportional change in visits focusing on race/ethnicity, insurance, household income, and acuity. We calculated the z-score to identify whether there was a statistically significant difference in proportions between 2020 and 2019. RESULTS: Overall ED volume declined 28% during the study period. The nadir of volume was 52% of 2019 levels and occurred five weeks after a shelter-in-place order was enacted. Patient demographics also shifted. By week 4 (April 5), the proportion of Hispanic patients decreased by 3.3 percentage points (pp) (P = 0.0053) compared to a 6.2 pp increase in White patients (P = 0.000005). The proportion of patients with commercial insurance increased by 11.6 pp, while Medicaid visits decreased by 9.5 pp (P < 0.00001) at the initiation of shelter-in-place orders. For patients from neighborhoods <300% federal poverty levels (FPL), visits were -3.8 pp (P = 0.000046) of baseline compared to +2.9 pp (P = 0.0044) for patients from ZIP codes at >400% FPL the week of the shelter-in-place order. Overall, 2020 evidenced a consistently elevated proportion of high-acuity Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level 1 patients compared to 2019. Increased acuity was also demonstrated by an increase in the admission rate, with a 10.8 pp increase from 2019. Although there was an increased proportion of high-acuity patients, the overall census was decreased. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate changing ED utilization patterns circa the shelter-in-place orders. Those from historically vulnerable populations such as Hispanics, those from lower socioeconomic areas, and Medicaid users presented at disproportionately lower rates and numbers than other groups.

Researchers have primarily evaluated this technology in hospital settings; however, limited research has investigated its application in prehospital operations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the potential of smart glasses to support the work practices of prehospital providers, such as emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 EMS providers recruited from 4 hospital-based EMS agencies in an urban area in the east coast region of the United States. The interview questions covered EMS workflow, challenges encountered, technology needs, and users perceptions of smart glasses in supporting daily EMS work. During the interviews, we demonstrated a system prototype to elicit more accurate and comprehensive insights regarding smart glasses. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the open coding technique. RESULTS: We identified four potential application areas for smart glasses in EMS: enhancing teleconsultation between distributed prehospital and hospital providers, semiautomating patient data collection and documentation in real time, supporting decision-making and situation awareness, and augmenting quality assurance and training. Compared with the built-in touch pad, voice commands and hand gestures were indicated as the most preferred and suitable interaction mechanisms. EMS providers expressed positive attitudes toward using smart glasses during prehospital encounters. However, several potential barriers and user concerns need to be considered and addressed before implementing and deploying smart glasses in EMS practice. They are related to hardware limitations, human factors, reliability, workflow, interoperability, and privacy.

ARDS is mediated by increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to lung damage. ARDS remains an important unmet medical need. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been suggested as a potential treatment for ARDS due to their significant immunomodulatory properties. While MSCs and their sEVs share immunomodulatory properties, sEVs have the added advantages of increased safety and improved tissue penetration. Methods, Results & Conclusion: In this study we compared the effect of two types of sEVs: sEVs isolated from na?ve MSC (Exo MSC) or sEVs isolated from MSCs which were induced to secrete increased levels of neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors (Exo MSC-NTF). Exo MSC or Exo MSC-NTF were administered intratracheally to mice following induction of ARDS using lipopolysaccharide. We found that the beneficial effect of Exo MSC-NTF was superior to Exo MSC in multiple parameters, including increase in blood oxygen saturation and reduction in lung pathology, neutrophil infiltration and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Specifically, Exo MSC-NTF significantly decreased interferon gamma (IFN-), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) levels, while Exo MSC were not able to do so. To explore the differences between Exo MSC and Exo MSC-NTF we evaluated modifications in protein cargo. ELISA measurements revealed that amphiregulin (AREG) was 16-fold higher and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was greater than 3-fold higher in Exo MSC-NTF than in Exo MSC. Both AREG and LIF are reported to have beneficial effects in ARDS models, either through immunomodulation or cellular repair. The observed positive preclinical results suggest that intratracheal administration of Exo MSC-NTF may be suitable as a therapy for ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes, and may be more effective at modifying ARDS physiological, pathological, and biochemical outcomes than sEVs isolated from na?ve MSCs. Increased expression of LIF and AREG in Exo MSC-NTF may contribute to the effectiveness of this innovative treatment modality.","output":"Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Msc-ntf (nurown?)

The model is developed to explore the viral load dynamics within the host by considering the role of natural killer cells and T-cell. Through analytical simplifications, the model is found well-posed and asymptotically stable at disease-free equilibrium. The numerical results demonstrate that the influx of external natural killer (NK) cells alone or integrating with anti-viral therapy plays a vital role in suppressing the SARS-CoV-2 growth within-host. Also, within the host, the virus can not grow if the virus replication rate is below a threshold limit.

This key step in viral entry delivers the viral genome into the cytoplasm for replication. Although class II fusion proteins are genetically and structurally unrelated to class I fusion proteins, they use the same physical principles and topology as other fusion proteins to drive membrane fusion. Exposure of a fusion loop first allows it to insert into the host-cell membrane. Conserved hydrophobic residues in the fusion loop act as an anchor, which penetrates only partway into the outer bilayer leaflet of the host-cell membrane. Subsequent folding back of the fusion protein on itself directs the C-terminal viral transmembrane anchor towards the fusion loop. This fold-back forces the host-cell membrane (held by the fusion loop) and the viral membrane (held by the C-terminal transmembrane anchor) against each other, resulting in membrane fusion. In class II fusion proteins, the fold-back is triggered by the reduced pH of an endosome, and is accompanied by the assembly of fusion protein monomers into trimers. The fold-back occurs by domain rearrangement rather than by an extensive refolding of secondary structure, but this domain rearrangement and the assembly of monomers into trimers together bury a large surface area. The energy that is thus released exerts a bending force on the apposed viral and cellular membranes, causing them to bend towards each other and, eventually, to fuse.","output":"Class II Fusion Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a marker of inflammation and infection in the horse that can be assessed in the field, with rapid and marked changes seen following initiation of an inflammatory stimulus.

One field of research nowadays is to identify and treat viral-induced hyperinflammation with drugs used in other clinical conditions characterized by an hyperinflammation status. These drugs might help to reduce COVID19 mortality.

We used ruxolitinib in 18 patients with clinically progressive COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a primary endpoint to rapidly reduce the degree of respiratory impairment and as a secondary endpoint to rapidly restore the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, as an evaluation of clinical status, and monitoring of drug related Adverse Events. Parameters of inflammation responses and organ functions were assessed and monitored. The treatment plan was ruxolitinib 20 mg bid for the first 48 h and subsequent two-step de-escalation at 10 mg bid and 5 mg bid for a maximum of 14 days of treatment. Results: Our data collection shows a rapid clinical response with no evolution from non-invasive ventilation to mechanical ventilation in 16/18 patients and no response in two patients (overall response rateORR 89%). Already after 48 h of ruxolitinib treatment 16/18 patients showed evident clinical improvement, and after 7 days of treatment 11/18 patients showed fully recovered respiratory function (pO(2) > 98% in spontaneous breathing), 4/18 patients had minimal oxygen requirement (2C4 L/m), 1/18 patient showed stable disease, and 2/18 patient showed progressive disease.

We previously reported that JMJD5 could generate tailless nucleosomes at position +1 from transcription start sites (TSS), thus perhaps enable progression of Pol II. Here we find that knockout of JMJD5 leads to accumulation of nucleosomes at position +1. Absence of JMJD5 also results in loss of or lowered transcription of a large number of genes. Interestingly, we found that phosphorylation, by CDK9, of Ser2 within two neighboring heptad repeats in the carboxyl-terminal domain of Pol II, together with phosphorylation of Ser5 within the second repeat, HR-Ser2p (1, 2)-Ser5p (2) for short, allows Pol II to bind JMJD5 via engagement of the N-terminal domain of JMJD5.

It also explores the experimental evidence accumulated for inhibitors of TTSPs as novel, broad-spectrum antivirals against various influenza virus subtypes. The review also provides an overview of the properties of small molecules, proteins, and peptides that efficiently inhibit the proteolytic activation of the influenza virus. Expert opinion: TTSPs activate a wide range of influenza virus subtypes including avian influenza viruses, both in vitro and in vivo, via proteolytic cleavage of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) into infection-competent fusogenic conformation. Other viruses such as SARS-, MERS-coronaviruses and human metapneumoviruses may use the same host cell proteases for activation, implying that TTSP inhibition might be a novel strategy for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents for respiratory viral infections.","output":"Type II transmembrane serine proteases as potential target for anti-influenza drug discovery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Black sexual minority men (BSMM) are disproportionately affected by HIV.

This protocol describes LINX LA, a study that tests LINX, a web-based mobile app that provides tailored social services, legal resources, and peer support for BSMM living with HIV (BSMM+) in LAC using a randomized comparison trial. OBJECTIVE: During phase 1, the LINX LA study aims to engage in an iterative design process to develop the LINX App using qualitative data to inform and tailor the mobile app technology and its functionality. In phase 2 of LINX LA, we will test the efficacy of the LINX App compared with the LINX App Plus to improve HIV treatment outcomes (ie, antiretroviral therapy adherence, viral suppression) among BSMM+ in LAC by addressing social work and legal needs and developing a forum for peer support. METHODS: In this study funded by the California HIV/AIDS Research Program, we will recruit and enroll BSMM+ participants (aged 18 years) in LAC (N=400) to participate in a 12-month study that includes access to the LINX App, which provides a forum for peer support and tailored content aimed at improving the use of social and legal resources. All participants will also receive survey-based interviews at 3 time points (at baseline and 6- and 12-month intervals) and weekly text message surveys that assess medication and treatment adherence. Treatment adherence and viral suppression will be extracted from medical record data. Half of the participants will also be randomly assigned to receive 3 individualized coaching sessions (at 1-, 3-, and 6-month intervals) and the ability to directly message their coach via the LINX App. Over the course of the study, LINX App participants will receive a minimum of US $130 in cash and LINX App Plus participants will receive a minimum of US $190. We hypothesize that participants enrolled in LINX App Plus will demonstrate greater improvement in HIV outcomes compared with LINX App participants.

We also aimed to understand the characteristics of the misinformation and to provide suggestions to reduce public misconception on social media during the emerging disease outbreak. METHODS: The original microblog posts were collected from Chinas Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo using a combination of keywords between April 1, 2013 and June 2, 2013. We analyzed the weekly and daily trend of the relevant posts. Content analyses were applied to categorize the posts into 4 types with unified sorting criteria. The posts characteristics and geographic locations were also analyzed in each category. We conducted further analysis on the top 5 most popular misleading posts. RESULTS: A total of 1680 original microblog posts on the topic were retrieved and 341 (20.30%) of these posts were categorized as misleading messages. The number of relevant posts had not increased much during the first 2 weeks but rose to a high level in the next 2 weeks after the sudden increase in number of reported cases at the beginning of week 3. The posts under misleading messages occurred and increased from the beginning of week 3, but their daily posting number decreased when the daily number of posts under refuting messages outnumbered them. The microbloggers of the misleading posts had the lowest mean rank of followers and previous posts, but their posts had a highest mean rank of posts. The proportion of misleading messages in places with no reported cases was significantly higher than that in the epidemic areas (23.6% vs 13.8%).

Another aspect of the included studies was the susceptibility of oral tissues to 2019-nCoV due to the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as a receptor for the 2019-nCoV. Some review studies and clinical infection control protocols were also included to discuss the transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV from the oral cavity. Studies were not restricted to English language and they were not all full-text papers.Data extraction and synthesis A narrative synthesis of the results was conducted using distinct headings and subheadings, defined by the authors based on relevancy to the consensus about the importance of saliva with reference to 2019-nCoV.Results There was an inherent heterogeneity among the included clinical studies concerning their designs, sampling techniques, and the results about the diagnostic value of saliva. The percentage of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients with positive 2019-nCoV RNA varied from 12.9% to 91.67% among these studies. Regarding the possibility of direct virus invasion into the oral tissues, the results suggested that ACE2+ cells in salivary glands could possibly be the target cells of 2019-nCoV and theoretically could generate infectious saliva in a sustained way. Furin was suggested as another protein which makes the tongue more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV, especially in conditions inducing its upregulation (for example, squamous cell carcinoma). According to the comparisons between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, saliva could be considered of diagnostic value via the early detection of viral RNA for both of the viruses. Whilst the viral peak was shown to be at onset of symptoms for 2019-nCoV, it can linger up to the tenth day after the appearance of symptoms for SARS-CoV. Finally, this paper warns about airborne transmission, particularly for close contacts.Conclusions Saliva can be proposed as an easily accessible diagnostic source although further clinical studies are required. Given the presence of viral RNA in saliva in the early stages of COVID-19, the recommendations to wear masks to prevent the rapid transmission of infectious droplets into the air, and keep a safe distance from other people are clearly based in evidence.","output":"Saliva: a diagnostic option and a transmission route for 2019-nCoV"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Starting in the early 2000s, several reports were released recognizing the convergence of mathematics, biology and computer science, and calling for a rethinking of how undergraduates are prepared for careers in research and the science and technology workforce.

Twelve wastewater samples were collected from a metropolitan area in north-eastern France during April and May 2020. In addition to the quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, F-specific RNA phages of genogroup II (FRNAPH GGII), naturally present in wastewater, were used as an internal process control for the viral concentration and processing of RT-PCR inhibitors. A concentration method was required to allow the quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome over the longest possible period. A procedure combining ultrafiltration, phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol purification, and the additional purification of the RNA extracts was chosen for the quantification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in 100-mL wastewater samples. At the same time, the COVID-19 outbreak was evaluated through patients from the neighbouring University Hospital of Nancy, France. A regular decrease in the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from 10(4) gc/L to 10(2) gc/L of wastewater was observed over the eight weeks of the study, during which the population was placed under lockdown. The SARS-CoV-2 genome was even undetectable during one week in the second half of May and present but non-quantifiable in the last sample (28 May). A concordant circulation in the human community was highlighted by virological diagnosis using respiratory samples, which showed a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases from 677 to 52 per week over the same period. The environmental surveillance of COVID-19 using a reliable viral quantification procedure to test wastewater is a key approach. The real-time detection of viral genomes can allow us to predict and monitor the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings and survey the entire urban human population.","output":"Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 by genome quantification in wastewater applied to a city in the northeast of France: comparison of ultrafiltration- and protein precipitation-based methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The notoriously low fidelity of HIV-1 replication is largely responsible for the virus's rapid mutation rate, facilitating escape from immune or drug control. The error-prone activity of the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) is predicted to be the most influential mechanism for generating mutations. The low fidelity of RT has been successfully exploited by nucleoside and nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that halt viral replication upon incorporation. Consequently, drug-resistant strains have arisen in which the viral RT has an increased fidelity of replication, thus reducing analogue incorporation. Higher fidelity, however, impacts on viral fitness. The appearance of compensatory mutations in combination with higher fidelity NRTI resistance mutations and the subsequent reversion of NRTI-resistant mutations upon cessation of antiretroviral treatment lend support to the notion that higher fidelity exacts a fitness cost. Potential mechanisms for reduced viral fitness are a smaller pool of mutant strains available to respond to immune or drug pressure, slower rates of replication, and a limitation to the dNTP tropism of the virus. Unraveling the relationship between replication fidelity and fitness should lead to a greater understanding of the evolution and control of HIV.","output":"The high cost of fidelity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite scientific advances, there is no effective medical therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19).

ObjectiveAssessing the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection given high-risk exposure, through analysis of household members of confirmed cases. DesignRetrospective cohort study. Data of household members of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases between 20/12/2020 and 17/03/2021 were collected. SettingNationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the second largest Healthcare Maintenance Organization in Israel. Participants2.5 million MHS members were considered, of which we included only households with two adult members, given possible lower transmission and susceptibility among children. Households with no prior confirmed infections and a confirmed index case during the study period were included. ExposureParticipants were classified into three vaccination groups in time of the index case (the confirmed exposure)-Unvaccinated; Fully Vaccinated(7 or more days post second dose) and a reference control group of Recently Vaccinated Once(0-7 days from the first dose, presumably still unprotected). Main Outcomes and MeasuresAssessing the probability of an additional SARS-CoV-2 infection in the household occurring within 10 days of an index case, calculated separately for the three vaccination groups. Main outcome was vaccine effectiveness given confirmed exposure. High testing rates among household members enabled us to estimate with a high degree of confidence effectiveness against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. ResultsA total of 173,569 households were included, out of which 6,351 households had an index infection (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [13.5] years; 50% were women). Vaccine effectiveness of Fully Vaccinated compared to Unvaccinated participants was 80.0% [95% CI, 73.0-85.1] and 82.0% [95% CI, 75.5-86.7] compared to those Recently Vaccinated Once.

We review the mechanisms of action, clinical effectiveness and safety of treatment, with emphasis on recently published studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Several monoclonal antibodies targeting the surface molecule CD20 on B cells are approved or being developed for treatment of MS. Overall, they seem comparable in terms of strongly suppressing radiological disease activity and relapse biology. Novel approaches include anti-CD19 antibody therapy and treatment with oral drugs targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The main safety issue with persistent B cell depletion is an increased risk of infections - possibly including an increased risk of severe COVID-19. Vaccine responses are also blunted in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies. Lower doses or longer infusion intervals may be sufficient for control of disease activity. Whether this might also improve the safety of treatment and increase vaccination responses remains to be determined. SUMMARY: Available data support the widespread use of therapies targeting B cells in MS.

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood, thrombosis is clearly a highly important in the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19. As such, there is a need for diagnostic analysis and quantification of the coagulation potential in these patients, both at diagnosis and follow-up. Global coagulation assays like thrombin generation (TG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) might be suitable in estimating COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and thrombosis risk. Therefore, we aimed at validating both assays for samples with high levels of fibrinogen and in the presence of anticoagulant heparins, such as commonly observed for COVID-19 ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calibrated Automated Thrombography (CAT) was optimized to assess plasma thrombin generation in the presence of heparins. The final conditions with either 10 g/mL Ellagic acid (EA) or PPP Reagent HIGH (high tissue factor; HPPH) were validated according to the EP5 protocol for within-run and between-run variability. Overall variability was well below 10%. To estimate the influences of heparins and high fibrinogen levels, CAT was performed on spiked plasma aliquots from 13 healthy volunteers. Comparable to the CAT method, tPA-ROTEM was used to validate the effect of high fibrinogen and heparins on clotting time, clot firmness and clot lysis parameters. RESULTS: Our adjusted COVID-19 assay showed a heparin dose dependent decrease in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) for both EA and HPPH triggered variants. High fibrinogen did not alter the inhibitory effect of either LMWH or UFH, nor did it influence the peak height or ETP in any of the conditions. The tPA-ROTEM showed a significant prolongation in clotting time with the additions of heparin, which normalized with the addition of high fibrinogen. MCF was markedly increased in all hyperfibrinogenemic conditions. A trend towards increased lysis time and, thus, decreased fibrinolysis was observed. CONCLUSION: Thrombin generation and tPA-ROTEM protocols for measurements in the COVID-19 populations were adjusted and validated. The adjusted thrombin generation assay shows good sensitivity for measurements in heparin spiked plasma. High levels of fibrinogen did not alter the assay or the effectiveness of heparins as measured in this assay. t-PA ROTEM was effective in measurement of both high fibrinogen and heparins spiked samples and was sensitive to the expected relevant coagulant changes by these conditions. No clear fibrinolytic effect was observed in different conditions.","output":"Suggestions for global coagulation assays for the assessment of COVID-19 associated hypercoagulability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the prevailing apocalyptic times of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the whole scientific community is busy in designing anticovid drug or vaccine Under such a fascination, Schiff bases or azomethine compounds are continuously interrogated for antimicrobial properties These compounds represent interesting molecular scaffolds of huge medicinal and industrial relevance In order to update the current literature support of such facts this article introduces the synthetic chemistry, mechanism of formation of a Schiff base, followed by biological efficacy and finally a suitable discussion on the mechanism of respective bioactivity In most of the studies revealing the biological evaluation of azomethine functionalized frameworks, fascinated results have been recorded in case of azomethine-metal complexes as compared with the free ligands Also, the CH=N or C=N form of organic ligands have indicated marvellous results Therefore, in connection with the biological relevance and microbicidal implications of such metallic compounds, this works reviews the current update of microorganism fighting efficacy of azomethine metal complexes along with the introduction of some metallodrugs as excellent candidates having COVID-19 defending potentiality ? 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021","output":"Enhancement of Schiff base biological efficacy by metal coordination and introduction of metallic compounds as anticovid candidates: A simple overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT This study examined the associations among personality traits, media exposure regarding COVID-19, and deterioration of mental wellbeing among the public in Japan.

The research investigates sociodemographic and motivational factors that influence consumers willingness to pay a premium (WTPP) price for healthy beverages using survey data from 1021 consumers in Australia and New Zealand (NZ). Water and juice are rated as representing healthy beverages sold by hospitality businesses. Under 2% of respondents consider sugar free drinks as being healthy. Consumers rate a healthy beverage as having low/no sugar, natural/no additives, or containing vitamins and minerals. Less than 1% of respondents identify probiotics or organic as a healthy beverage. Censored Poisson finds consumers who frequently eat out or are younger have higher WTPP. Healthy eating goals increase WTPP, whereas food economizing goals decreases WTPP. Food hedonism goals reduces consumers WTPP, and gender differences moderates this relationship. The findings present new insights on consumer behavior and healthy consumption in hospitality.","output":"Consumer demand for healthy beverages in the hospitality industry: Examining willingness to pay a premium, and barriers to purchase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the impending spread of COVID-19, universities worldwide switched to digital learning. They switched to online platforms using technology in their learning processes. In this context, an online survey study was conducted in Saint Joseph University, Faculty of Business in which the authors collected 458 responses from students during the spring-summer 2020 semester. The quantitative study focused on (1) the students access to technology, (2) the facilitating conditions offered by the university during the semester (3) the learning value acquired from the online teaching and (4) the demographics characteristics as gender and level of education. The researchers tested the relationship between those variables and the intention to use e-learning and to continue using it after the pandemic crisis. In this paper, the authors present and discuss their studys results, where no gender differences were noted but a disparity in the level of education led to acceptance or rejection of future use of e-learning;moreover, the access to technology raised a major problem specially in the case of a developing country. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"E-learning: Factors Affecting Students Online Learning During COVID-19 Quarantine in a Developing Country"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Soccer referees (SRs) encounter stressful situations during competitions and sometimes even outside them, which may affect their decision making. Therefore, it is important that they possess or acquire optimal levels of self-efficacy, since it is related to less stress during competition, also guaranteeing sports performance and prevent sports abandonment. The objectives of this study were to characterize the profile, in terms of self-efficacy, of SRs depending on their category, age, and experience and to determine the relationship of these factors on SR self-efficacy. Two-hundred fifty-six Spanish referees participated in this study and Referee Self-Efficacy Scale was administered and completed. The results indicated that the SRs older than 25 years, of national category, and with experience greater than or equal to 8 years, have higher levels of self-efficacy than those with the least (p < .01). Likewise, moderate positive correlations were also observed between global self-efficacy and the category, age, and experience of the SRs. In conclusion, age, category and experience factors relate the self-efficacy of the SR, which can explain up to 17% of the variance, affecting decision-making and other decisive behaviors in the competition. These findings are of interest to delegations and referee committees seeking to implement psychological intervention programs to prevent burnout and abandonment of sports practice due to the consequences of low self-efficacy.","output":"Relationship between age, category and experience with the soccer referees self-efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is an urgent need to identify effective therapies for COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 host factor protease TMPRSS2 is required for viral entry and thus an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. In mouse, knockout of tmprss2 led to protection against SARS-CoV-1 with no deleterious phenotypes, and in human populations genetic loss of TMPRSS2 does not appear to be selected against. Here, we mined publicly available gene expression data to identify several compounds that down-regulate TMPRSS2. Recognizing the need for immediately available treatment options, we focused on FDA-approved drugs. We found 20 independent studies that implicate estrogenic and androgenic compounds as transcriptional modulators of TMPRSS2, suggesting these classes of drugs may be promising therapeutic candidates for clinical testing and observational studies of COVID-19. We also note that expression of TMPRSS2 is highly variable and skewed in humans, with a minority of individuals having extremely high expression. Combined with literature showing that inhibition of TMPRSS2 protease activity reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in human cells, our results raise the hypothesis that modulation of TMPRSS2 expression is a promising therapeutic avenue for COVID-19.","output":"TMPRSS2 Transcriptional Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Whenever there has been a worldwide contagious disease outbreak, there have been reports of infection and death of healthcare workers. Particularly because emergency nurses have contact with patients on the front line, they experience ethical problems in nursing while struggling with infectious diseases in an unfavorable environment. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to explore emergency nurses' ethical problems and to identify factors influencing these problems during the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in Korea. DESIGN AND SAMPLE For this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was conducted with emergency nurses working in six hospitals selected through convenience sampling from the hospitals designated for Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus patients in the capital area. METHODS Data were collected from 169 emergency nurses in Korea during August 2015. Ethical considerations: This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of G University in Korea. RESULTS The findings of this study suggest that during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus outbreak, emergency nurses experienced ethical problems tied to a mind-set of avoiding patients. Three factors were found to influence emergency nurses' ethical problems (in order of influence): cognition of social stigmatization, level of agreement with infection control measures, and perceived risk. CONCLUSION Through this study, we obtained information on emergency nurses' ethical problems during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus outbreak and identified the factors that influence them. As found in this study, nurses' ethical problems were influenced most by cognitions of social stigmatization. Accordingly, to support nurses confidently care for people during future health disasters, it is most urgent to promote appropriate public consciousness that encourages healthcare workers.","output":"Factors influencing emergency nurses' ethical problems during the outbreak of MERS-CoV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the rapid creation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, the precise correlates of immunity against severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unknown. Neutralizing antibodies represent a robust surrogate of protection in early Phase III studies, but vaccines provide protection prior to the evolution of neutralization, vaccines provide protection against variants that evade neutralization, and vaccines continue to provide protection against disease severity in the setting of waning neutralizing titers. Thus, in this study, using an Ad26.CoV2.S dose-down approach in nonhuman primates (NHPs), the role of neutralization, Fc effector function, and T-cell immunity were collectively probed against infection as well as against viral control. While dosing-down minimally impacted neutralizing and binding antibody titers, Fc receptor binding and functional antibody levels were induced in a highly dose-dependent manner. Neutralizing antibody and Fc receptor binding titers, but minimally T cells, were linked to the prevention of transmission. Conversely, Fc receptor binding/function and T cells were linked to antiviral control, with a minimal role for neutralization. These data point to dichotomous roles of neutralization and T-cell function in protection against transmission and disease severity and a continuous role for Fc effector function as a correlate of immunity key to halting and controlling SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.","output":"Defining the determinants of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral control in a dose-down Ad26.CoV2.S vaccine study in nonhuman primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Mexico, there is a high mortality rate among patients intubated because of COVID-19.

This investigation used three cases, particle transport in an isothermal clean room, an office with an underfloor air distribution system, and the first-class cabin of an MD-82 airliner, to validate the combined CFD and Markov chain method. The general trends of the particle concentrations vs. time predicted by the Markov chain method agreed with the CFD simulations for these cases. The proposed Markov chain method can provide faster-than-real-time information about particle transport in enclosed environments. Furthermore, for a fixed airflow field, when the source location is changed, the Markov chain method can be used to avoid recalculation of the particle transport equation and thus reduce computing costs.","output":"Predicting transient particle transport in enclosed environments with the combined computational fluid dynamics and Markov chain method."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE: Pharmacy departments across the country are problem-solving the growing issue of drug shortages. We aim to change the drug shortage management strategy from a reactive process to a more proactive approach using predictive data analytics. By doing so, we can drive our decision-making to more efficiently manage drug shortages. METHODS: Internal purchasing, formulary, and drug shortage data were reviewed to identify drugs subject to a high shortage risk (\\"shortage drugs\\") or not subject to a high shortage risk (\\"nonshortage drugs\\"). Potential candidate predictors of drug shortage risk were collected from previous literature. The dataset was trained and tested using 2 methods, including k-fold cross-validation and a 70/30 partition into a training dataset and a testing dataset, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1,517 shortage and nonshortage drugs were included. The following candidate predictors were used to build the dataset: dosage form, therapeutic class, controlled substance schedule (Schedule II or Schedules III-V), orphan drug status, generic versus branded status, and number of manufacturers. Predictors that positively predicted shortages included classification of drugs as intravenous-only, both oral and intravenous, antimicrobials, analgesics, electrolytes, anesthetics, and cardiovascular agents. Predictors that negatively predicted a shortage included classification as an oral-only agent, branded-only agent, antipsychotic, Schedule II agent, or orphan drug, as well as the total number of manufacturers. The calculated sensitivity was 0.71; the specificity, 0.93; the accuracy, 0.87; and the C statistic, 0.93.

It is believed MRSA clones are generated from S. aureus through insertion of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), and outbreaks occur as they spread. Several worldwide and regional clones have been identified, and their epidemiological, clinical, and genetic characteristics have been described. CA-MRSA is likely able to survive in the community because of suitable SCCmec types (type IV or V), a clone-specific colonization/infection nature, toxin profiles (including Pantone-Valentine leucocidin, PVL), and narrow drug resistance patterns. CA-MRSA infections are generally seen in healthy children or young athletes, with unexpected cases of diseases, and also in elderly inpatients, occasionally surprising clinicians used to HA-MRSA infections. CA-MRSA spreads within families and close-contact groups or even through public transport, demonstrating transmission cores. Re-infection (including multifocal infection) frequently occurs, if the cores are not sought out and properly eradicated.

The current rise in COVID-19 cases has led to an increasing involvement of hospitals, in order to face the Coronavirus outbreak, shifting healthcare resources towards the management of COVID+ patients. This has led, on the other hand, to a progressive decrease in hospital admissions due to conditions not associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. In other European countries interested by a national lockdown, a decrease in registered new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) cases was observed. Undiagnosed AF patients can develop complications that could potentially translate into poorer long-term outcomes. PURPOSE: In this scenario, we aimed to verify the impact of telemedicine (TLM) during lockdown, in comparison with the same period in 2019. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We analyzed 12-lead ECGs recorded by 5000 country pharmacies, evaluated and stored in one TLM platform provided by Health Telematic Network (HTN), in cooperation with our Cardiology Department, Federfarma, and Italian National Health Institute. RESULTS: During the lockdown period in 2020, 6,104 ECGs were performed in territorial pharmacies, compared to 17,280 ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019. Among ECGs performed, we detected AF in 344 patients (5.64%) in lockdown period, compared to 393 cases (2.27%) detected in the same period in 2019, with an increase of 40.25%. We detected also Atrial Flutter in 32 patients (0.52%) in lockdown period, compared to 25 cases (0.14%) detected in the same period in 2019. The difference was +26.92%. Moreover, we found Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia in 8 patients (0.13%) during lockdown, compared to 6 cases (0.03%) detected in the same period in 2019, with an increase of 23.07%. In lockdown period, a total of 384 patients (6.29%) were referred to ED because of symptomatic tachyarrhythmia, compared to 424 patients (3.47%) referred to ED in the same period in 2019, with an increase of 55.16%. In the Lombardy Region, during lockdown, were reported 194 cases of tachyarrhythmia in territorial pharmacies (about 50.52% of all cases in Italy). Among these, 93 cases of tachyarrhythmia were in the Brescia area (about 47.94%), whereas 50 cases were in the Bergamo one (about 25.77%). CONCLUSION: These data shown that, during the COVID outbreak, a large number of patients with CV symptoms preferred to go to territorial pharmacies rather than the closer hospital. TLM played a prominent role in managing patients with CV symptoms at home. Moreover, this service allowed to refer to the hospital only patients with clinically relevant tachyarrhythmia, avoiding the risks of treatment delay. This once again underlines how TLM network provided by pharmacies may become an important tool offered to citizens, especially during coronavirus pandemic emergency, within the Italian National Health System.

Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours (compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting mortalities at 96 hours.

The fear of painful needles is one of the primary reasons most people avoid getting vaccinated. Therefore, developing an alternative pain-free method of vaccination using microneedles has been a significant research area. Microneedles comprise arrays of micron-sized needles that offer a pain-free method of delivering actives across the skin. Apart from being pain-free, microneedles provide various advantages over conventional vaccination routes such as intramuscular and subcutaneous. Microneedle vaccines induce a robust immune response as the needles ranging from 50 to 900 m in length can efficiently deliver the vaccine to the epidermis and the dermis region, which contains many Langerhans and dendritic cells. The microneedle array looks like band-aid patches and offers the advantages of avoiding cold-chain storage and self-administration flexibility. The slow release of vaccine antigens is an important advantage of using microneedles. The vaccine antigens in the microneedles can be in solution or suspension form, encapsulated in nano or microparticles, and nucleic acid-based. The use of microneedles to deliver particle-based vaccines is gaining importance because of the combined advantages of particulate vaccine and pain-free immunization. The future of microneedle-based vaccines looks promising however, addressing some limitations such as dosing inadequacy, stability and sterility will lead to successful use of microneedles for vaccine delivery.

MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and the origins of MERS-CoV are not fully understood. Genomic analysis indicates it originated in bats and transmitted to camels. Human-to-human transmission occurs in varying frequency, being highest in healthcare environment and to a lesser degree in the community and among family members. Several nosocomial outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred, the largest in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and South Korea in 2015. MERS-CoV remains a high-threat pathogen identified by World Health Organization as a priority pathogen because it causes severe disease that has a high mortality rate, epidemic potential, and no medical countermeasures. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. MERS-CoV-2 causes a wide range of clinical presentations, although the respiratory system is predominantly affected. There are no specific antiviral treatments, although recent trials indicate that combination antivirals may be useful in severely ill patients. Diagnosing MERS-CoV early and implementation infection control measures are critical to preventing hospital-associated outbreaks. Preventing MERS relies on avoiding unpasteurized or uncooked animal products, practicing safe hygiene habits in health care settings and around dromedaries, community education and awareness training for health workers, as well as implementing effective control measures. Effective vaccines for MERS-COV are urgently needed but still under development.","output":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Clinical competency certifications are important parts of internal medicine residency training.

All studied patients were tested positive for COVID-19 and had serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D results measured within one year prior to the date of positive tests. Medical information was retrieved from the electronic medical record and were analyzed to determine the association between vitamin D status and hospital morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Among the 287 patients, 100 (36%) patients were vitamin D-sufficient [25(OH)D >30 ng/mL] and 41 (14%) patients died during the hospitalization. Multivariate analysis in patients aged 65 years old revealed that vitamin D sufficiency [25(OH)D 30 ng/mL] was statistically significantly associated with decreased odds of death (adjusted OR 0.33, 95%CI, 0.12C0.94), acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted OR 0.22, 95%CI, 0.05C0.96), and severe sepsis/septic shock (adjusted OR 0.26, 95%CI, 0.08C0.88), after adjustement for potential confounders.

DESIGN: a retrospective observational study based was used. Data deriving from the COVID-19 epidemic surveillance and from the collection of information on drugs consume by Sicilian residents. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: due to the data availability, the study was calibrated on the Region and included all population distinguishing by gender and age groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the risks of cumulative incidence for COVID-19 were investigated in people who had diabetes comorbidities to incur a hospitalization for COVID-19, to be treated within an intensive care unit, and lethality. The role of previous antidiabetic drug treatments with respect to each study outcome was also investigated. RESULTS: in Sicily, from 01.03.2020 to 26.06.2020, a number of 172 cases of COVID-19 disease with diabetes comorbidity were diagnosed. The data did not show any difference in the cumulative incidence for COVID-19 between diabetics (64.2/100,000 inhabitants) and non-diabetics (56.9/100,000 inhabitants) patients. Diabetes increases the risk of hospitalization in the under 80 in both men and women (men: OR 2.62; women OR 4.31), for treatment in intensive care (men: OR 4,41; women: OR 7.74), and for death (men: OR 5.21; women OR 5.92). The analysis of drug using showed risks effect of insulin (OR 2.13) on hospitalization, sulfonylureas/glinides (OR 2.58) on intensive care and protective of metformin on death both in single component (OR 0.44) and in multicomponent (OR 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: data availability made it possible to monitor the occurrence and explore some of the characteristics of the cases with COVID-19 in Sicily. Diabetes does not seem to represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sicily, while previous diabetes condition seems to determine greater risk of hospitalization, treatment in intensive care, and lethality among over 80. There are also gender differences with almost double risks in women for hospitalization and intensive care only. Among the antidiabetic drugs investigated, there was a risk for hospitalization and intensive care while protective for deaths.

Over 123,000,000 individuals have been infected with the coronavirus since a worldwide pandemic was declared in March 2020. We conducted this research to confirm the potential of herbal medicine as a treatment for coronavirus. Methods We infected the A549 cell line with beta coronavirus OC43 then treated with 100 g/mL Hyunggaeyungyo-tang (HGYGT) or distilled water with a control of HGYGT. We measured the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) to confirm the effectiveness of HGYGT upon coronavirus infection. Results We found the effects of HYGYT decrease the expression level of pPKR, peIF2, IFI6, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI27, IRF7, OASL and ISG15 when administered to cells with coronavirus infection. The expressions of IL-1, TNF-, COX-2, NF-B, iNOS and IKK mRNA were also significantly decreased in the HGYGT group than in the control group. Conclusion Through the reduction of the amount of coronavirus RNA, our research indicates that HGYGT has antiviral effects. The reduction of IKK and iNOS mRNA levels indicate that HGYGT reduces coronavirus RNA expression and may inhibits the replication of coronavirus by acting on NF-kB/Rel pathways to protect oxidative injury. In addition, decreases in mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate that the HGYGT may relieve the symptoms of coronavirus infections.","output":"Antiviral Effect of Hyunggaeyungyo-tang on A549 Cells Infected with Human Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on flavonoids from plant sources is showing growing evidence of the versatile health benefits of flavonoids through in vitro and in vivo studies [...].","output":"Flavonoids from Plants to Foods: From Green Extraction to Healthy Food Ingredient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dietary selenium (Se)-compounds accumulated in plants are essential for human metabolism and normal physiological processes. Inorganic and organic Se species can be readily absorbed by the human body, but are metabolized differently and thus exhibit distinct mechanisms of action.

Selenocysteine, in particular, is incorporated at the catalytic center of these proteins through a specific insertion mechanism and, due to its electronic features, enhances their catalytic activity against biological oxidants. Selenite and other Se-organic compounds may also act as direct antioxidants in cells due to their strong nucleophilic properties. In addition, Se-amino acids are more easily subjected to oxidation than the corresponding thiols/thioethers and can bind redox-active metal ions. Adequate Se intake aids in preventing several metabolic disorders and affords protection against viral infections.

Our aim was to provide a detailed account of case characteristics, resource use, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Germany, where the health-care system has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. METHODS: In this observational study, adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were admitted to hospital in Germany between Feb 26 and April 19, 2020, and for whom a complete hospital course was available (ie, the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included in the study cohort. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds were analysed. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics, duration of hospital stay, type and duration of ventilation, and survival status. Patients with adjacent completed hospital stays were grouped into one case. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had received any form of mechanical ventilation. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index. FINDINGS: Of 10a021 hospitalised patients being treated in 920 different hospitals, 1727 (17%) received mechanical ventilation (of whom 422 [24%] were aged 18-59 years, 382 [22%] were aged 60-69 years, 535 [31%] were aged 70-79 years, and 388 [23%] were aged &#8805;80 years). The median age was 72 years (IQR 57-82). Men and women were equally represented in the non-ventilated group, whereas twice as many men than women were in the ventilated group. The likelihood of being ventilated was 12% for women (580 of 4822) and 22% for men (1147 of 5199). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10a021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrhythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (1358 [14%]). Dialysis was required in 599 (6%) of all patients and in 469 (27%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The Charlson comorbidity index was 0 for 3237 (39%) of 8294 patients without ventilation, but only 374 (22%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The mean duration of ventilation was 135 days (SD 121). In-hospital mortality was 22% overall (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between patients without ventilation (1323 [16%] of 8294) and with ventilation (906 [53%] of 1727; 65 [45%] of 145 for non-invasive ventilation only, 70 [50%] of 141 for non-invasive ventilation failure, and 696 [53%] of 1318 for invasive mechanical ventilation). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients requiring dialysis was 73% (342 of 469). In-hospital mortality for patients with ventilation by age ranged from 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18-59 years to 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: In the German health-care system, in which hospital capacities have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality has been high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, particularly for patients aged 80 years or older and those requiring dialysis, and has been considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years.

Enoxaparin will be administered in both LMWH group and LMWH + steroid group at standard prophylactic dose (i.e., 4000 UI once day, increased to 6000 UI once day for patients weighting more than 90 kg). The treatment will be administered subcutaneously once a day up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge it may be continued or interrupted in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Methylprednisolone will be administered in both LMWH + steroid group and UHF + steroid group intravenously with an initial bolus of 0,5 mg/kg followed by administration of 0,5 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7 days, 0,5 mg/kg 3 times daily from day 8 to day 10, 0,5 mg/kg 2 times daily at days 11 and 12 and 0,5 mg/kg once daily at days 13 and 14. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at day 28 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: - Ventilation free days (VFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days that patient is alive and free of ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) between randomization and day 28 (censored at hospital discharge). - Need of rescue administration of high-dose steroids or immune-modulatory drugs; - Occurrence of switch from non-invasive to invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay; - Delay from start of non-invasive ventilation to switch to invasive ventilation; - All-cause mortality at ICU discharge and hospital discharge; - ICU free days (IFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days between ICU discharge and day 28. - Occurrence of new infections from randomization to day 28; including infections by Candida, Aspergillus, Adenovirus, Herpes Virus e Cytomegalovirus - Occurrence of new organ dysfunction and grade of dysfunction during ICU stay. - Objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction; Safety endpoints: - Occurrence of major bleeding, defined as transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells in a day, bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal], bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention and bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); - Occurrence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, defined ad acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of any bleeding compromising hemodynamic; spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm(2), intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography, haematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures; haemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention or any other bleeding requiring temporary cessation of a study drug. RANDOMIZATION: A block randomisation will be used with variable block sizes (block size 4-6-8), stratified by 3 factors: Centre, BMI (<30/30) and Age (<75/75). Central randomisation will be performed using a secure, web-based, randomisation system with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician using computer generated random numbers. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants to the study will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that the combined use of UHF and steroid versus the LMWH group will significantly reduce the risk of death at day 28. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 210 with a randomization 1:1:1 and seventy patients in each group. Assuming an alpha of 2.5% (two tailed) and mortality rate in LMWH group of 50%, as indicated from initial studies of ICU patients, the study will have an 80% power to detect at least a 25 % absolute reduction in the risk of death between: a) LMHW + steroid group and LMWH group or b) UHF + steroid group and LMWH group. The study has not been sized to assess the difference between LMHW + steroid group and UHF + steroid group, therefore the results obtained from this comparison will need to be interpreted with caution and will need further adequately sized studies confirm the effect. On the basis of a conservative estimation, that 8 participating sites admit an average of 3 eligible patients per month per centre (24 patients/month). Assuming that 80 % of eligible patients are enrolled, recruitment of 210 participants will be completed in approximately 10 months. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.1 of April 26(th), 2020.

Upon exposure to physiological or environmental fluids, it is likely that protein nanoparticles, like synthetic nanoparticles, will adsorb proteins and this protein corona will be dependent on the surface properties of the protein nanoparticles. As there is little understanding of this phenomenon for engineered protein nanoparticles, the purpose of this work was to create protein nanoparticles with variable surface hydrophobicity and surface charge and establish the effect of these properties on the mass and composition of the adsorbed corona, using the fetal bovine serum as a model physiological solution. Albumin, cationic albumin, and ovalbumin cross-linked nanoparticles were developed for this investigation and their adsorbed protein coronas were isolated and characterized by gel electrophoresis and nanoliquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Distinct trends in corona mass and composition were identified for protein nanoparticles based on surface charge and surface hydrophobicity. Proteomic analyses revealed unique protein corona patterns and identified distinct proteins that are known to affect nanoparticle clearance in vivo. Further, the protein corona influenced nanoparticle internalization in vitro in a macrophage cell line. Altogether, these results demonstrate the strong effect protein identity and properties have on the corona formed on nanoparticles made from that protein.

Social vulnerability in general can be understood as a risk of exposure to hazard impacts, where vulnerability is embedded in the normal functioning of the society. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systemic (political and health care systems), demographic (aging, race) and,based on the results of our approach, spatial (spatial isolation and connectivity) yvulnerabilities as well. In this paper, we develop a risk prediction model based on two composite indicators of social vulnerability. These indicators reflect the two main contrasting risks associated with COVID-19, demographic vulnerability and, as consequences of the lockdowns, economic vulnerability. We conceptualise social vulnerability in the context of the extremely uneven spatial population distribution in Australia.

METHODS: This study was an observational, prospective, single-center study, including adults suspected to have COVID-19 who were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). An intensivist in critical care ultrasound performed lung ultrasound (LUS) and echocardiology within 12 hours of patients' admission to the ICU. We calculated the trans mitral E/A ratio, E/e, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, right ventricle (RV) size and systolic function. RESULTS: In the group of patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, echocardiographic findings revealed normal E/e, deceleration time (DT), and transmittal E/A ratio compared to those in the non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively). IVC diameter was < 2 cm with > 50% collapsibility in 62 (81%) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia; a diameter of > 2 cm and < 50% collapsibility was detected among those with non-COVID-19 pneumonia (p-value of 0.001). In patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, there were 3 cases of myocarditis (3.9%) with poor EF, severe RV systolic dysfunction was seen in 9 cases (11.6%), and 3 cases exhibited RV thrombus. Lung US revealed 4 signs suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia in 77 patients (98.6%) (sensitivity 96.9%; confidence interval, 85%C99.5%) when compared with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results.

We aimed to summarize the presentations and outcomes of COVID-19-positive patients and compare with historical controls. METHODS: Patients with known chronic liver disease who presented with superimposed COVID-19 (n = 28) between 22 April 2020 and 22 June 2020 were studied. Seventy-eight cirrhotic patients without COVID-19 were included as historical controls for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 28 COVID-19 patients (two without cirrhosis, one with compensated cirrhosis, sixteen with acute decompensation [AD], and nine with acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF]) were included. The etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol (n = 9), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 2), viral (n = 5), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 6). The clinical presentations included complications of cirrhosis in 12 (46.2%), respiratory symptoms in 3 (11.5%), and combined complications of cirrhosis and respiratory symptoms in 11 (42.3%) patients. The median hospital stay was 8 (7-12) days. The mortality rate in COVID-19 patients was 42.3% (11/26), as compared with 23.1% (18/78) in the historical controls (p = 0.077). All COVID-19 patients with ACLF (9/9) died compared with 53.3% (16/30) in ACLF of historical controls (p = 0.015).

The regions had, however, tried to respond to demands or critiques from patients and the public along the way and to adapt the services to respond to their preferences. The need for rapid decision\\\\making, the uncertainty about whom to involve, as well as a hesitation about the appropriateness of involving patients and the public contributed to the lack of involvement.

This meant the reconfiguration of life in an unusual space;the home. However, not all households experienced it in the same way;many of them were vulnerable. A general increase in energy consumption and discomfort in many cases, led these families to suffer the ravages of confinement. This study analyzes the energy and comfort situation for the Madrid (Spain) population, according to the configuration of the homes, the characteristics of the dwellings, the vulnerability index by district, and energy poverty (measured with the 10% threshold of energy expenditure of home incomes). The results show a greater exposure, in confinement, of vulnerable and energy-poor households to scenarios of discomfort in the home, to which they could not respond, while energy consumption inevitably increased. Driven by need, energy-poor homes applied certain saving strategies, mainly resorting to thermal adaptation with clothing. This study shows the risk these households experienced in the face of an extreme situation, and invites reflection on preventive and containment measures that aim to avoid harming the disadvantaged in the future;harm that would also entail serious consequences on the health of their cohabitants.","output":"Behavior Patterns, Energy Consumption and Comfort during COVID-19 Lockdown Related to Home Features, Socioeconomic Factors and Energy Poverty in Madrid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Policymakers in Africa need robust estimates of the current and future spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Geniposide (GE) has anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and cholagogic effects. Whether GE provides inhibition on the development of sclerosing cholangitis is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of GE in a mouse model in which mice were fed with 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) for 4 weeks to induce sclerosing cholangitis. The results demonstrated that the increased hepatic gene expressions of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and F4/80) and profibrogenic markers (Col1&#945;1, Col1&#945;2, TGF-?, and &#945;-SMA) in DDC feeding mice were reversed after treatment with GE. GE also suppressed expressions of CK19 and Ki67 in DDC-fed mice, suggesting that GE could ameliorate DDC-induced hepatocytes and cholangiocytes proliferation. In addition, GE significantly increased bile acids (BAs) secretion in bile, which correlated with induced expressions of hepatic FXR, BAs secretion transporters (BSEP, MRP2, MDR1, and MDR2), and reduced CYP7A1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, higher expressions of ileal FXR-FGF15 signaling and reduced ASBT were also observed after GE treatment. Taken together, these data showed that GE could modulate inflammation, fibrosis, and BAs homeostasis in DDC-fed mice, which lead to efficiently delay the progression of sclerosing cholangitis.","output":"Geniposide suppresses liver injury in a mouse model of DDC-induced sclerosing cholangitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), caused by PirA(vp)- and PirB(vp)-releasing Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains, has resulted in massive mortality in shrimp aquaculture.

Using an in silico approach, we aimed to discover PirA(vp)/PirB(vp)-binding peptides from oilseed meals as alternatives to antibiotics. To search for peptides that remain intact in the shrimp digestive tract, and therefore would be available for toxin binding, we focused on peptides released from tryptic hydrolysis of 37 major proteins from seeds of hemp, pumpkin, rape, sesame, and sunflower. This yielded 809 peptides. Further screening led to 24 peptides predicted as being non-toxic to shrimp, fish, and humans, with thermal stability and low water solubility. Molecular docking on the 24 peptides revealed six dual-target peptides capable of binding to key regions responsible for complex formation on both PirA(vp) and PirB(vp). The peptides (ISYVVQGMGISGR, LTFVVHGHALMGK, QSLGVPPQLGNACNLDNLDVLQPTETIK, ISTINSQTLPILSQLR, PQFLVGASSILR, and VQVVNHMGQK) are 1139C2977 Da in mass and 10C28 residues in length.

Such oxidative and/or nitrative stress can damage the lipids, proteins and nucleic acids of cells and mitochondria, potentially causing cell death. Oligodendrocytes are more sensitive to oxidative and nitrative stress in vitro than are astrocytes and microglia, seemingly due to a diminished capacity for antioxidant defence, and the presence of raised risk factors, including a high iron content. Oxidative and nitrative stress might therefore result in vivo in selective oligodendrocyte death, and thereby demyelination. The reactive species may also damage the myelin sheath, promoting its attack by macrophages. Damage can occur directly by lipid peroxidation, and indirectly by the activation of proteases and phospholipase A(2). Evidence for the existence of oxidative and nitrative stress within inflammatory demyelinating lesions includes the presence of both lipid and protein peroxides, and nitrotyrosine (a marker for peroxynitrite formation).

However, dermatology services need to be resumed in future and dermatologists especially in developing countries face a mammoth task of devising plans to tackle the upcoming surge of patients while still maintaining the precautions to avoid risk of infection to health care workers and our patients. Teledermatology practice is a viable alternative and there is need of starting functioning teledermatology centers at primary health care centers and training health care workers in telemedicine. Several steps like increasing the working hours of outpatient clinics, posting dermatologists and health staffs in shifts, encouraging online registration and payment, providing time slots to patients should be taken to prevent overcrowding at outpatient departments in hospitals of developing countries like India where the usual patient turnover during summers maybe around 600 to 800 per day. Once diagnosed by the dermatologist, a subsequent meticulous use of teledermatology can limit the number of follow\\\\up visits. To avoid student gatherings, the undergraduate and postgraduate teaching schedule should be replaced by online or virtual teaching in form of webinars and video conferencing. Above all, intense upgradation of health care infrastructure, recruitment, training of new health care staffs on mass level and huge investment in health care sector is required in all the developing countries.","output":"Changing paradigms of dermatology practice in developing nations in the shadow of COVID\\\\19: Lessons learnt from the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning is the most widely used application in educational institutions, particularly during the pandemic (COVID-19). However, shortcomings in online learning systems negatively impact learner's attitudes and intention to use. Especially poor interface design can increase the cognitive load that ultimately affects the learner's intention to use. The design aspects that could be convenient, useful, and trustworthy in an online learning context are an emerging challenge and the primary purpose behind this study. So, in current research, the effect of different design aspects or attributes (i.e., interactivity, information, navigation, and visual) have been examined on learners' cognitive beliefs (i.e., ease of use and usefulness), trust, and ultimately intention to use. The proposed model was used to determine the learner's intention to use via trust, cognitive beliefs, and design aspects. Data was collected from the students at different Universities in Punjab, Pakistan, using a questionnaire embedded in an online learning prototype. PLS-SEM method was employed for analysis using the SmartPLS tool. The findings show that among the used design attributes, interaction, information, and visual design significantly influence the learner's cognitive beliefs, where navigation partially influences the cognitive beliefs. Furthermore, both cognitive beliefs (i.e., ease of use and usefulness) were observed to be strong determinants of trust. This study importantly contributes to the e-learning domain by providing a comprehensive understanding of learners' perceptions and experiences related to interface design that leads to intention to use.","output":"Role of Design Attributes to Determine the Intention to Use Online Learning via Cognitive Beliefs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We estimated socioeconomic factors associated with food insecurity during the first year of the Covid pandemic in the UK and explored potential mechanisms explaining these associations. METHODS: Data were from the April, July, and September 2020 waves of the UK Understanding Society Covid Survey. Food insecurity was measured as not having access to healthy and nutritious food and reporting being hungry but not eating. Logistic regression estimated the relationship between socioeconomic factors and food insecurity. A decomposition approach explored if financial vulnerability and having Covid-19 explained associations between socioeconomics factors and food insecurity. RESULTS: Single parents and young people aged 16C30 years had a higher odds of reporting both measures of food insecurity. Financial insecurity explained 5% to 25% of the likelihood of reporting being food insecure for young people and single parents depending on the food insecurity measure used. Experiencing Covid-19 symptoms explained less than 5% of the likelihood of being food insecure for single parents but approximately 30% of not having access to healthy and nutritious food for young people.

The present study investigated the associations among the three indicators (physical competence, physical well-being, and perceived physical literacy) among older adults in day care centers of Hong Kong. A total of 97 participants (aged 60 years old or above) participated in the study from April to July 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on participants sociodemographic information, physical competence (PC), physical well-being (PWB), and perceived physical literacy (PPL) were collected.

Therefore, the aim of the review is to collect and discuss aspects of the management of patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to save resources and to avoid unnecessary exposure to infected patients, there is the need to schedule interventions depending on their priority. During the peak of the pandemic, no elective surgery should be performed. Even urgent procedures might be postponed if there is a view to recovery of a COVID-19 patient within a few days. Emergency procedures do not allow any delay. Specialties with overlap in therapies should have well defined arrangements among each other concerning the treatment spectra in order to avoid redundancy and loss of resources. Inpatient and outpatient units have to be organized in such a way that the risk of cross-infection among patients is reduced to a minimum. Especially, testing of patients for SARS-CoV-2 is important to detect the infected patients at an early stage. When surgery is performed on COVID-19 patients, adequate personal protective equipment is crucial. There must be negative pressure in the operating room, and aerosol formation must be reduced to a minimum. In order to address the COVID-19 challenge adequately, significant changes in the infrastructure of outpatient units, inpatient units, and operating rooms are needed. In addition, the demands concerning personal protective equipment increase significantly.

Some IEIs have been linked to mutations of immune receptors or signaling molecules, resulting in defective signaling of respective cascades essential for combating specific pathogens. However, it remains incompletely understood why in selected IEIs, such as X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2 (XLP-2), hypo-immune response to specific pathogens results in persistent inflammation. Moreover, mechanisms underlying the generation of anticytokine autoantibodies are mostly unknown. Recently, IEIs have been associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with a small proportion of patients that contract severe COVID-19 displaying loss-of-function mutations in genes associated with type I interferons (IFNs). Moreover, approximately 10% of patients with severe COVID-19 possess anti-type I IFN-neutralizing autoantibodies. Apart from IEIs that impair immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins that suppress early type I IFN production. One primary consequence of the lack of type I IFNs during early SARS-CoV-2 infection is the increased inflammation associated with COVID-19. In XLP-2, resolution of inflammation rescued experimental subjects from infection-induced mortality. Recent studies also indicate that targeting inflammation could alleviate COVID-19. In this review, we discuss infection-induced inflammation in IEIs, using XLP-2 and COVID-19 as examples. We suggest that resolving inflammation may represent an effective therapeutic approach to these diseases.","output":"Infection-induced inflammation from specific inborn errors of immunity to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It spread widely around the world and was described as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The knowledge regarding the mortality rate and risk factors of COVID-19 among the pediatric population is lacking. In this regard, we aimed to report the clinical and laboratory characteristics of deceased pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from February 2020 to April 2021. Recorded documents of 59 pediatric patients (under 18 years old) assumed to have COVID-19 who had died in the COVID-19 ward and COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) were retrospectively evaluated. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (v. 26.0, Chicago, IL). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: From 711 COVID-19 definite and suspected patients, 59 children died. Of these deceased pediatric patients, 34 were boys (57.62%) and 25 were girls (42.37%), with a total mean age of 5.6 years. The median length of stay in the hospital was 10 days (range 1C215). 91.52% had underlying comorbidities of which neurological diseases accounted for the largest share. 54 patients were admitted to the ICU and 83.05% of them had intubation during their hospitalization. In addition, the most common reasons for death in our study were related to respiratory and multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: According to our knowledge, we are the first team to report such a thorough study in the field of COVID-19 pediatric mortality in Iran. Mortality was observed in all age groups of children, especially in those with previous comorbidities, specifically neurological disease. Abnormally elevated tests of ESR, CRP, LDH, AST, and ALT as well as the presence of proteinuria and hematuria were found in more than 50% of patients in our investigations, and ICU admission between both definite and suspected groups had significant differences, so monitoring and considering these factors may help to control and reduce the progression of the disease to death.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality in Children: A Referral Center Experience from Iran (Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a current global health crisis with dreadful repercussions all over the world. A global economic recession is anticipated, with strong impacts in all economic and social sectors, including the cultural sector.

Sites management and heritage conservation have not only been vulnerable to strong economic and social disruptions, like most of other cultural fields, but have been greatly challenged because heritage values and the paradigm of conservation (50 years after adoption of the UNESCO convention) are being themselves revisited in the perspective of the Sustainable Development Goals. The paper aims also to consider cultural heritage as part of the Cultural and Creative Sectors (CCS) and how creativity and innovation contribute to post-COVID recoveries through Schumpeter-related creative destruction process. The current crisis might be perceived in a perspective of long wave theory of innovations and economic growth. The economic history is filled with many examples of such transition period when inventions, innovations, and growth reactivate the economic development in an upward long-term trend. In such framework, crisis can trigger innovation and creativity and can be understood as opportunity to increase the CCS resilience and sustainability, as well as harness the universality and the power of creativity.

Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a key antigen that is targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601.

Specific acute phase reactants might be useful for risk stratification. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of studies on serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched, covering the period January 2020 to December 2020, for studies reporting SAA concentrations, COVID-19 severity, and survival status. RESULTS: Nineteen studies involving 5617 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that SAA concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe disease and non-survivors (standard mean difference (SMD) 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.91-1.49, P < 0.001). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I2 = 92.4%, P < 0.001). In the sensitivity analysis, the effect size was not significantly affected when each study was removed in turn (range 1.10-1.29).

We aim to determine the prevalence and characteristics of headache in COVID-19-infected individuals and make a comparison with those without headaches. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted from 1 October to 31 October 2020. Data were collected using a detailed questionnaire. We compared the data of those with and without headaches to identify the differences between the groups. RESULTS: During the study period of 1 month, among 225 COVID-19-infected patients, 33.8% patients had headaches. The mean age of patients with headache was 48.89  15.19 years. In all, 53.9% were females. In 65.8%, headache occurred at the onset of viral illness; 44.7% described the headache as dull aching; 39.5% had bifrontal headache; and 32.9% had holocranial headache. In total, 78.9% had complete resolution of headache within 5 days. A comparison between those with and without headaches showed that those with headaches were more younger (48.89  15.19 vs 54.61  14.57 years, p = 0.007) and of female gender (41/76(53.9%) vs 41/149 (27.5%), p = 0.001). Primary headache disorders were more common in the headache group. Levels of inflammatory markers such as leukocyte count (7234.17  3054.96 vs 8773.35  5103.65, p = 0.017), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (39.28  23.29 vs 50.41  27.61, p = 0.02) and ferritin (381.06  485.2 vs 657.10  863.80, p = 0.014) were lower in those with headaches. CONCLUSIONS: Headaches are a common and early symptom of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection more frequently seen in young females and in those with a history of primary headache disorders. The lower level of inflammatory markers in those with headaches suggests that these headaches are probably due to the local spread of virus through the trigeminal nerve endings, resulting in activation of the trigeminovascular system.","output":"Headaches associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection: A prospective cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Global health education partnerships should be collaborative and reciprocal to ensure mutual benefit. Utilisation of digital technologies can overcome geographic boundaries and facilitate collaborative global health learning.

Principles of reciprocity and interinstitutional partnership informed the development of the GHCR. This study explores learning outcomes and experiences in the GHCR between students from New Zealand and Samoa. METHODS: This study used a mixed methods approach employing post-GHCR questionnaires and semi-structured face-to-face interviews to explore self-reported learning and experiences among medical students in the GHCR. The GHCR collaboration studied was between the medical schools at the University of Otago, New Zealand and the National University of Samoa, Samoa. RESULTS: Questionnaire response rate was 85% (74/87). Nineteen interviews were conducted among New Zealand and Samoan students. Students reported acquiring the intended learning outcomes relating to patient care, health systems, culture, and determinants of health with regards to their partner country. Interview data was indicative of attitudinal changes in relation to cultural humility and curiosity. Some reported a vision for progress regarding their own health system. Students in the GHCR reported that learning with their international peers in the virtual classroom made learning about global health more real and tangible. The benefits to students from both countries indicated reciprocity. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates GHCR to be a promising model for collaborative and reciprocal global health learning using a student-led format and employing digital technology to create a virtual classroom.

For many, social distancing has become a form of civic duty and expression of unity. In the classic Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam describes community-mindedness as an important pillar of social capital that promotes civic engagement. We hypothesize that citizens who exhibit higher levels of social capital are more likely to socially distance. To test the hypothesis, we utilize publicly available county-level data from Kansas (105 counties) and Nebraska (93 counties) and proxy social capital with county voter turnout from the 2016 presidential election. To gauge social distancing, we use social distancing grades as assigned by Unacast, a company specializing in mobility data. We discover social capital has a significant impact on distancing. In other words, counties with the highest levels of voter turnout produced the best social distancing grades. Furthermore, population is not a significant predictor of social distancing. A vast majority of the counties examined were in fact rural. Rural counties with high numbers of infections-largely those with oligopoly in the meatpacking industry-yield better social distancing grades than the most populated counties.","output":"Staying Home on the Range: Social Capital and Social Distancing in the Great Plains during COVID- 19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Open Educational Resources (OER) are an integral part of the debate about the digitization of education.

The results reveal that research concentrates on the higher education sector while only a few studies are available for the school sector. In terms of research methodology, quantitative studies are prevalent, mostly using surveys. The research interest of the studies lies in the perception of OER and their adoption and usage in educational practices. Open Textbooks and their comparative cost advantages or qualitative comparability with traditional educational material is a newly emerging field. Research gaps exist regarding usability and user-friendliness of OER repositories. Addressing these gaps could support the numerous initiatives of the German federal states to establish OER portals.

Results Twenty-six studies were included with 1228 pooled subjects, with a mean age of 8.6 years, which were dominated by male gender (53%), and African ethnicity (31%). 732 (38%) patients were reactive on a serological test, and 457 patients (45%) were positive on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. ST-segment abnormalities were the most common ECG findings (16%, n/N: 34/212). Various markers of troponin and the pooled mean of BNP and NT-pro-BNP levels were elevated. Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion (21.8%, n/N: 164/751) was the most common chest X-ray findings. In echocardiography, the majority of patients left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (59.0%, n/N: 180/305), with pericardial effusion/ pericarditis seen the most (17.44%, n/N: 221/1267), and Z score  2 in 28% (n/N: 42/139). Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myocarditis. Intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and vasoactive drugs were frequently utilized. The mean length of stay was 6 days, with most patients (71%, n/N: 834/1163) were admitted to the ICU. However, the overall prognosis was favourable, with 98% alive (n/N: 1235/1260), and more than 50% of patients experienced recovery of left ventricular systolic functions at discharge (116 out of 206 patients). Conclusion PIMS-TS is a rare clinical syndrome associated with a multiorgan system dysfunction, especially acute cardiac injury, and mandates a higher level of care.

In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more government leaders encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask-wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask-wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April[boxh]September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May[boxh]October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask-wearing policy for the general public reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19.

The dynamic of SQEIAR model is defined by six ordinary differential equations that describe the numbers of Susceptible, Quarantined, Exposed, Infected, Asymptomatic, and Recovered individuals. The goal of this paper is to reduce the size of susceptible, infected, exposed and asymptomatic groups to consequently eradicate the infection by using two actions: the quarantine and the treatment of infected people. To reach this purpose, optimal control theory is presented to control the epidemic model over free terminal optimal time control with an optimal cost. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimal final time. Also, an impulsive epidemic model of SQEIAR is considered to deal with the potential suddenly increased in population caused by immigration or travel. Since this model is suitable to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, especial attention is devoted to this case. Thus, numerical simulations are given to prove the accuracy of the theoretical claims and applied to the particular data of this infection. Moreover, numerical computations of the COVID-19 are compared with diseases like Ebola and Influenza.

Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged 18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer InstituteCdesignated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. RESULTS: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to refocus and re-energize; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual mind-body programming supported patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic through a behavioral-psychological-social coping model by enhancing psychological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated patients with cancer.

METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we included 58 out of 186 potentially eligible patients from our prospectively maintained database of CRC liver metastasis patients between 2001 and 2012 with a median follow-up of 42 months who underwent a formal right or left hemihepatectomy. Liver regeneration in CT volumetry was correlated with recurrence of CRC liver metastases and overall survival. RESULTS Liver regeneration increased up to 14 months to 21.0% for left and 122.6% for right hemihepatectomy, respectively, with comparable final volumes. Regeneration was independent of initial tumor stage, number of metastases, and preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with lower liver regeneration showed earlier recurrence of CRC liver metastases (p = 0.006). Overall survival did not differ in patients with weak versus strong liver regeneration.

Our aim was to investigate the frequency of bleeding in hospitalized adult pts with cancer andCOVID-19, enrolled between March 16, 2020 and Feb 8, 2021. The incidence of bleeding complications was captured as defined by CCC19 and included both major and non major bleeding . Associated baseline clinic-pathologic prognostic factors and outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality rates were assessed Results :3849 pts met analysis inclusion criteria. Bleeding was reported in 276 (7%) pts with median age of 70years; incidence was 6.6 % in females and 7.6 % in males, 6.5% in non-Hispanic white pts, 8.2 % in non-Hispanic Black pts, and 7.8 % in Hispanic pts. 74% had solid cancer and 29% had hematologic malignancies, 33% had received anti-cancer therapy in preceding 30 days, and 8% had surgery within 4weeks. In pts taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications at baseline, 7.2% developed bleeding. Need for mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, 30-day mortality, and total mortality were significantly higher in those with bleeding complications compared to those without, p<0.05 Conclusion : We describe the incidence of bleeding in a large cohort of pts with cancer and COVID-19. Bleeding events were observed in those with adverse outcomes including mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and high mortality; the overall mortality of 43% in patients with bleeding complications is especially notable.

MethodsThis review is based on the Cochrane review: \\"International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic\\" and followed the same methodology. In brief, we searched for clinical and modelling studies in general health and COVID-19-specific bibliographic databases. The primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. ResultsWe included 55, mostly modelling, studies that met our inclusion criteria. Fourteen new studies were identified in the updated search, as well as updated companions (e.g., peer-reviewed publications that were previously only available as pre-prints).

Additionally, the underlying psychological stressors remain unexplored, and few studies have been conducted nationally on the social distancing measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the psychological impacts of the implementation of social distancing measures by analyzing the Internet search trends of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms. METHODS: Using Naver(?) Trends relative search volumes (RSVs), we analyzed the average search volumes and trend changes of 16 terms, adopted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 criteria for diagnosing MDD. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed using the data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. Furthermore, changes in RSVs, according to the intensity of the social distancing measures implemented from January 1 to December 31, 2020, were determined using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS: Of the 16 terms, the search trends of feeling guilty (P < 0.001) and wanting to die (P = 0.002) showed a significant increase as of February 29, 2020, when the social distancing measures were officially implemented. Additionally, the average search volumes for hopelessness (P = 0.003), sexual desire (P < 0.001), insomnia (P = 0.002), hypersomnia (P < 0.001), restlessness (P < 0.001), and feeling lethargic (P < 0.001) increased significantly. Moreover, gender analysis showed that the average search volume of depressed mood (P = 0.033) and the trend of impaired concentration (P < 0.001) increased in males only. However, the average search volume of feeling lethargic (P = 0.001) and the trend of feeling guilty (P = 0.001) increased in females only. The average search volumes for depressed mood (P < 0.001), impaired concentration (P = 0.038), and indecisiveness (P < 0.001) were significantly higher during the enforcement of level 2 or higher social distancing measures.

Although studies conducted prior to the pandemic have suggested that telemedicine is an acceptable format for older adults, there is a paucity of data on the practical implementation of telemedicine visits. Due to prior lack of reimbursement for telemedicine visits involving nonrural patients, no studies have compared telephone visits to video visits in geriatric primary care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine (1) whether video visits had longer durations, more visit diagnoses, and more advance care planning discussions than telephone visits during the rapid implementation of telemedicine in the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether disparities in visit type existed based on patient characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of patients seen at two geriatric clinics from April 23 to May 22, 2020. Approximately 25% of patients who had telephone and video appointments during this time underwent chart review. We analyzed patient characteristics, visit characteristics, duration of visits, number of visit diagnoses, and the presence of advance care planning discussion in clinical documentation. RESULTS: Of the 190 appointments reviewed, 47.4% (n=90) were video visits. Compared to telephone appointments, videoconferencing was, on average, 7 minutes longer (mean 37.3 minutes, SD 10 minutes; P<.001) and had, on average, 1.2 more visit diagnoses (mean 5.7, SD 3; P=.001). Video and telephone visits had similar rates of advance care planning. Furthermore, hearing, vision, and cognitive impairment did not result in different rates of video or telephone appointments. Non-White patients, patients who needed interpreter services, and patients who received Medicaid were less likely to have video visits than White patients, patients who did not need an interpreter, and patients who did not receive Medicaid, respectively (P=.003, P=.01, P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although clinicians spent more time on video visits than telephone visits, more than half of this study's older patients did not use video visits, especially if they were from racial or ethnic minority backgrounds or Medicaid beneficiaries.

Methodology A narrative chronological account of events after declaring an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs. As part of the investigations, HCWs were offered testing during the outbreak. These were: (1) screening by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) to detect a current infection; and (2) serum samples to determine seroprevalence. Results Over 180 HCWs were tested by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rate of infection was 15.2% (23.7% for clinical or directly patient-facing HCWs vs. 4.8% in non-clinical non-patient-facing HCWs). Of the infected HCWs, 57% were asymptomatic. Seroprevalence (SARS-CoV-2 IgG) among HCWs was 13%. It was challenging to establish an exact source for the outbreak. The importance of education, training, social distancing and infection prevention practices were emphasised. Additionally, avoidance of unnecessary transfer of patients and minimising cross-site working for staff and early escalation were highlighted. Establishing mass and regular screening for HCWs are also crucial to enabling the best care for patients while maintaining the wellbeing of staff.

Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice.

Most of the tested compounds interact with both sigma receptors to different degrees. However, only six of them showed higher affinity toward (1)R than (2)R with the highest binding preference to (1)R for compounds 5, 11, and 12. Moreover, all these ligands share a common structural feature: the piperidine moiety as the fundamental part of the molecule. It is most likely a critical structural element for dual H(3)/(1) receptor activity as can be seen by comparing the data for compounds 4 and 5 (hH(3)R K(i) = 3.17 and 7.70 nM, (1)R K(i) = 1531 and 3.64 nM, respectively), where piperidine is replaced by piperazine. We identified the putative proteinCligand interactions responsible for their high affinity using molecular modeling techniques and selected compounds 5 and 11 as lead structures for further evaluation. Interestingly, both ligands turned out to be high-affinity histamine H(3) and (1) receptor antagonists with negligible affinity at the other histamine receptor subtypes and promising antinociceptive activity in vivo. Considering that many literature data clearly indicate high preclinical efficacy of individual selective (1) or H(3)R ligands in various pain models, our research might be a breakthrough in the search for novel, dual-acting compounds that can improve existing pain therapies. Determining whether such ligands are more effective than single-selective drugs will be the subject of our future studies.","output":"Structural and Molecular Insight into Piperazine and Piperidine Derivatives as Histamine H(3) and Sigma-1 Receptor Antagonists with Promising Antinociceptive Properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination and hygiene are currently the main strategies for helping limit the spread and impact of acute respiratory infections However, the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severe consequences require the search for additional measures for reducing the morbidity and mortality from coronavirus infection One of these additional prevention strategies is micronutrient status optimization, which is safe and cost-effective Vitamins and minerals are important components of the immune response The effect of micronutrients such as vitamin D, ascorbic acid, zinc, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on the immune response has been studied for several decades As a result, significant shreds of evidence have been accumulated regarding the importance of provision immuno-nutrients on the adequate immune response This implies in both contexts: the prevention of infectious diseases and their course At the same time, the problem of insufficient supply with various micronutrients is gaining global significance, affecting every country and every socio-economic class of people This review contains data on the state of micronutrient status of the global and Russian population, discussion of the role of key immunonutrients in the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, and results of recent meta-analyses It will also provide recommendations of experts in the field of nutrition, developed in 2020 with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic ѧܧڧߧѧڧ  ާ֧ ԧڧԧڧ֧ߧ ӧݧ ߧӧߧާ ѧ֧ԧڧާ, ܧ ާԧѧ ԧѧߧڧڧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ  ӧ٧է֧ۧӧڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ,   ڧݧ  ֧ڧѧߧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ էߧѧܧ ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ SARS-CoV-2  ا֧ݧ ڧէ COVID-19 ֧ҧ ڧܧ էݧߧڧ֧ݧߧ ާ֧, ߧѧѧӧݧ֧ߧߧ ߧ ߧڧا֧ߧڧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧ֧ާ  ާ֧ߧ  ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ ݧߧڧ֧ݧߧ ѧ֧ԧڧ֧ ڧݧѧܧڧܧ, ҧ֧٧ѧߧ  ܧߧާڧ֧ܧ ֧ܧڧӧߧ, ӧݧ֧ ڧާڧ٧ѧڧ ާڧܧߧڧ֧ߧߧԧ ѧ ҧݧߧԧ ڧѧާڧߧ  ާڧߧ֧ѧݧߧ ӧ֧֧ӧ ӧӧݧ֧֧ߧ  ֧ѧݧڧ٧ѧڧ ӧ֧ ٧ӧ֧ߧ֧ ڧާާߧߧԧ ӧ֧,  ߧ֧էѧߧѧ ާڧܧߧڧ֧ߧߧѧ ҧ֧֧֧ߧߧ ߧ֧ڧ٧ҧ֧اߧ ܧѧ٧ӧѧ֧ ߧ ڧާާߧߧ ѧ ݧڧߧڧ ѧܧڧ ާڧܧߧڧ֧ߧ, ܧѧ ӧڧѧާڧ D, ѧܧҧڧߧӧѧ ܧڧݧ, ڧߧ, ާ֧ԧ-3 ݧڧߧ֧ߧѧ֧ߧߧ اڧߧ ܧڧݧ, ߧ ڧާާߧߧ ӧ֧ ڧ٧ѧ֧ ߧ ا֧ߧڧ ߧ֧ܧݧܧڧ է֧ڧݧ֧ڧ ѧܧݧ֧ߧ ٧ߧѧڧ֧ݧߧѧ էܧѧ٧ѧ֧ݧߧѧ ҧѧ٧  ٧ߧѧ֧ߧڧ ҧ֧֧֧ߧߧ ڧާ ߧڧ֧ߧѧާ էݧ ѧէ֧ܧӧѧߧԧ ڧާާߧߧԧ ӧ֧  ܧߧ֧ܧ ڧݧѧܧڧܧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧ ҧݧ֧٧ߧ֧  ҧ֧ߧߧ֧ ڧ ֧֧ߧڧ   ا ӧ֧ާ ߧ֧էѧߧѧ ҧ֧֧֧ߧߧ ѧ٧ݧڧߧާ ާڧܧߧڧ֧ߧѧާ ڧҧ֧ѧ֧ ԧݧҧѧݧߧ ާѧѧ, ٧ѧѧԧڧӧѧ ӧ ѧߧ  ӧ ݧ ߧѧ֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ҧ٧ է֧اڧ էѧߧߧ  ߧڧ ާڧܧߧڧ֧ߧߧԧ ѧ ߧѧ֧ݧ֧ߧڧ, ҧاէѧ֧ ݧ ܧݧ֧ӧ ڧާާߧߧڧ֧ߧ  ڧݧѧܧڧܧ  ݧ֧֧ߧڧ ֧ڧѧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ, ڧӧ֧է֧ߧ էѧߧߧ ݧ֧էߧڧ ާ֧-ѧߧѧݧڧ٧, ֧էѧӧݧ֧ߧ ѧܧا ֧ܧާ֧ߧէѧڧ ܧ֧  ҧݧѧ ߧڧڧݧԧڧ, ѧ٧ѧҧѧߧߧ  2020   ӧ٧  ѧߧէ֧ާڧ֧ COVID-19","output":"Micronutrients Availability, Immune Response, and Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 is unique within the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SrC) species.

Alcohol exposure during adolescence causes persistent molecular, cellular, and behavioral changes that increase the risk of alcohol use disorder (AUD) into adulthood. It is established that alcohol abuse in adulthood increases the likelihood of pain hypersensitivity and the genesis of chronic pain, and humans report drinking alcohol to relieve pain symptoms. However, the longitudinal effects of alcohol exposure on pain and the underlying CNS signaling that mediates it are understudied. Specific brain regions mediate pain effects, alcohol effects, and pain-alcohol interactions, and neural signaling in those brain regions is modulated by neuropeptides. The CNS melanocortin system is sensitive to alcohol and modulates pain sensitivity, but this system is understudied in the context of pain-alcohol interactions. In this review, we focus on the role of melanocortin signaling in brain regions sensitive to alcohol and pain, in particular the amygdala. We also discuss interactions of melanocortins with other peptide systems, including the opioid system, as potential mediators of pain-alcohol interactions.

METHODS: Forty hospitalized patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test were evaluated. They were randomly divided into an experimental group (n= 20; gargling with 1.0% H(2)O(2) and nasal wash with 0.5% H(2)O(2)) or a control group (n= 20). The solutions were used for 7 days and the patients were monitored every 2 days, for a total of 8 days. At check-ups, patients were asked about their symptoms and possible adverse effects of the solutions. The presence and severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of symptoms were recorded. Data were compared using the Student test and the Fisher exact test (= 0.05). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the length of hospital stay (p= 0.65). The most frequent symptom on day 0 was coughing (72.0% in the experimental group and 76.5% in the control group), which abated over time. There was no significant difference between the groups in the evaluated symptoms. Most (75.0%) of the patients in the experimental group presented a reduction in dyspnea between days 0 and 2.

Therefore, the possibility of detection of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 in saliva by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization is tested, utilizing probes targeting the antisense or sense genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2. This method was applied in a pilot study with saliva samples collected from healthy persons and those presenting with mild or moderate COVID-19 symptoms. In all participants, saliva appeared a suitable matrix for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Among the healthy, mild COVID-19-symptomatic and moderate COVID-19-symptomatic persons, 0%, 90% and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Moreover, the procedure allows for simultaneous measurement of viral load (presence, sense genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA) and viral replication (activity, antisense genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA) and may yield qualitative results. In addition, the visualization of DNA in the cells in saliva provides an additional cytological context to the validity and interpretability of the test results.

The progresses reported here are mainly from various computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics, pharmacophore modelling, molecular docking, and peptide-cleavage site prediction, among others. It is highlighted that the compounds C(28)H(34)O(4)N(7)Cl, C(21)H(36)O(5)N(6) and C(21)H(36)O(5)N(6), as well as KZ7088, a derivative of AG7088, might be the promising candidates for further investigation, and that the octapeptides ATLQAIAS and ATLQAENV, as well as AVLQSGFR, might be converted to effective inhibitors against the SARS protease. Meanwhile, how to modify these octapeptides based on the distorted key theory to make them become potent inhibitors is explicitly elucidated. Also, a brief introduction is given for how to use computer-generated graphs to rapidly diagnose SARS coronavirus.

TSC acts via a novel mechanism of action, improving the diffusivity of oxygen in blood plasma. Thus, it is based on physical-chemical principles, unlike most drugs which are based on biochemistry-based mechanisms. We explored the use of escalating doses and multiple daily dosing of TSC as a potential therapeutic for patients suffering from hypoxemia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Individuals []18 years who were hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypoxemia, defined as SpO2 < 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, WHO ordinal scale 3 through 7 (exclusive of Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation [ECMO]) were enrolled in cohorts of six subjects, each of whom received the same dose (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg) of TSC via intravenous bolus every 6 hours in addition to standard of care (SOC). This report describes the safety and efficacy results from the lead-in phase of the study and the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses. Safety was assessed as the number of serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed with each dose. Several efficacy parameters were examined in the lead-in phase and descriptive statistics of efficacy parameters are provided. No formal statistical analyses were performed. The population PK analyses were based on previous analyses and examination of the concentration profiles, and two-compartment linear pharmacokinetic models were evaluated and validated. Covariates, including body size, age, sex, organ function, and dose level, were evaluated for inclusion into the model. Results: TSC was well tolerated. There were no treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported. There were 2 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study, neither were considered treatment-related. A total of 24 (96%) subjects survived. One subject (4.0%) died during the study as a result of an SAE (respiratory failure), and that event was determined to be due to COVID-19 complications and not related to study drug. There was an observed reduction in the time to improvement in WHO Ordinal Scale with increasing dose. The median time to 1-point reduction in subjects receiving 0.25 mg/kg was 11.5 days versus 7.5 days in the 1.5 mg/kg treatment cohort. The overall range across all doses was 1 day to 28 days. A total of 36.0% of subjects had a 1-point improvement in WHO Ordinal Scale to Day 7. The 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in observed superior outcomes for multiple secondary clinical outcomes: time to 1-point WHO Ordinal Score improvement through Day 29/discharge, 1-point improvement by Day 7, days to return to room air, and hospital length of stay. The PK results showed that the two-compartment model fit the data well. Clearance decreased with increasing dose level and there was no evidence that clearance was affected by covariates other than dose level. Conclusions: These findings suggest that TSC administration every 6 hours at doses up to 1.5 mg/kg for up to 15 days is safe and well tolerated with predictable pharmacokinetics and demonstrated an observed clinical benefit in the treatment of COVID-19-related hypoxemia.","output":"Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) to Improve Oxygenation in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Long-term effects after COVID-19 may affect surgical safety.

The level of evidence was stratified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. RESULTS: A total of 1020 records were identified, from which 20 studies (12 peer-reviewed) were included. None were randomized trials. The studies comprised one case-control study (level III-2 evidence), one prospective cohort study (level III-2) and 18 case-series studies (level IV).

In this paper, charges produced by a triboelectric charging process were designed to provide melt-blown nonwoven fabrics with high filtration efficiency by making full use of the electrostatic attraction filtration mechanism. Influences of water conductivity and drying temperature on the filtration efficiency of melt-blown nonwoven fabrics were investigated. And the corresponding properties such as the surface charge potential and charge stability were analyzed by using the electrostatic voltmeter, bio atomic force microscope and thermally stimulated discharge technique. In addition, metal and inorganic elements in the masterbatch and water before and after triboelectric charging were measured in order to uncover the charge transfer mechanism.

The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, first identified in Botswana on November 11, 2021, has spread globally faster than any previous variant of concern. Understanding the transmissibility of Omicron is vital in the development of public health policy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks driven by Omicron to those driven by prior variants of concern in terms of both the speed and magnitude of an outbreak. METHODS: We analyzed trends in outbreaks by variant of concern with validated surveillance metrics in several southern African countries. The region offers an ideal setting for a natural experiment given that most outbreaks thus far have been driven primarily by a single variant at a time. With a daily longitudinal data set of new infections, total vaccinations, and cumulative infections in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated how the emergence of Omicron has altered the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We used the Arellano-Bond method to estimate regression coefficients from a dynamic panel model, in which new infections are a function of infections yesterday and last week. We controlled for vaccinations and prior infections in the population. To test whether Omicron has changed the average trajectory of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we included an interaction between an indicator variable for the emergence of Omicron and lagged infections. RESULTS: The observed Omicron outbreaks in this study reach the outbreak threshold within 5-10 days after first detection, whereas other variants of concern have taken at least 14 days and up to as many as 35 days. The Omicron outbreaks also reach peak rates of new cases that are roughly 1.5-2 times those of prior variants of concern. Dynamic panel regression estimates confirm Omicron has created a statistically significant shift in viral spread. CONCLUSIONS: The transmissibility of Omicron is markedly higher than prior variants of concern. At the population level, the Omicron outbreaks occurred more quickly and with larger magnitude, despite substantial increases in vaccinations and prior infections, which should have otherwise reduced susceptibility to new infections. Unless public health policies are substantially altered, Omicron outbreaks in other countries are likely to occur with little warning.","output":"Has Omicron Changed the Evolution of the Pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atopic dermatitis/eczema (hereafter 'eczema') affects around 20% of children in the UK and symptoms can be difficult to manage.1 Parents of children with eczema often request food allergy tests or exclude foods from their diets to manage the symptoms.2 Whilst it is understood that early-onset eczema is associated with food allergy and allergic reactions to foods can exacerbate eczema symptoms,3 evidence that foods cause long-term eczema symptoms is weak.4.","output":"Health care professionals' beliefs and practices regarding food allergy testing for children with eczema."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Micro-hotplate gas sensors are widely used in air quality monitoring, identification of hazardous chemicals, human health monitoring, and other fields due to their advantages of small size, low power consumption, excellent consistency, and fast response speed.

To understand the disease progression and control and also to produce vaccines and therapeutic efforts, whole genome sequence analysis is important. In the current investigation, we sequenced a single sample of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (accession no. MT879619) from a male suspect from Peshawar, the KPK capital city, during the first wave of infection. The local SARS-CoV-2 strain shows some unique characteristics compared to neighboring Iranian and Chinese isolates in phylogenetic tree and mutations. The circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 represent an intermediate evolution from China and Iran. Furthermore, eight complete whole genome sequences, including the current Pakistani isolates which have been submitted to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), were also investigated for specific mutations and characters. Some novel mutations [NSP2 (D268del), NSP5 (N228K), and NS3 (F105S)] and specific characters have been detected in the coding regions, which may affect viral transmission, epidemiology, and disease severity.

Understanding the issues and needs expressed in online discussions can be valuable for improving the support provided in times of crisis. AIMS: To map and characterize online Hebrew discourse about diabetes during the first period of the COVID-19 outbreak and the preceding period. METHODS: Data about frequency and distribution of posts in social-networks and online-forums were gathered, analysed and compared with respect to these two periods of time. Qualitative text analysis was manually performed on a sample of the posts. RESULTS: Our findings show a growth in the extent of discourse during the first wave of the pandemic. A substantial difference was found between the two periods in informative discourse about the association between COVID-19 and diabetes (rose from 6% to 39%). A decrease had occurred in the perception of unhealthy-diet and lack of physical-activity as causes of diabetes (from 27% to 17% and from 6% to none, respectively). A new theme, concerns about coping with diabetes during the epidemic, has emerged. CONCLUSIONS: There is room for an elaborative explication on social-media about the causes of diabetes, recommended conduct, and possible means to communicate with health professionals, all in times of routine and crisis.

Currently, commercial methods for SWE rely on directional filtering based on the prior knowledge of the wave propagation direction, to remove complicated wave patterns formed due to reflection and refraction. The result is a set of decomposed directional waves that are separately analyzed to construct shear modulus fields that are then combined through compounding. Instead, PWE relies on a rigorous representation of the wave propagation using the frequency-domain scalar wave equation to automatically select appropriate propagation directions and simultaneously reconstruct shear modulus fields. Specifically, assuming a homogeneous, isotropic, incompressible, linear-elastic medium, we represent the solution of the wave equation using a linear combination of plane waves propagating in arbitrary directions. Given this closed-form solution, we formulate the SWE problem as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem which can be solved very efficiently. Through numerous phantom studies, we show that PWE can handle complicated waveforms without prior filtering and is competitive with state-of-the-art that requires prior filtering based on the knowledge of propagation directions.","output":"Plane Wave Elastography: A Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious disease is an increasing threat to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, the long-term outcome in critically ill septic patients with SLE remains unclear, and we aimed to address the impact of SLE on 5-year survival in critically ill septic patients. METHODS: We used the 2003C2017 nationwide data with 825,556 patients with sepsis in Taiwan. We identified lupus cases with sepsis that required admission to the intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation and selected controls matched (1:4) for age, sex, and index-year. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for mortality risk and shown as odds ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 513 SLE-sepsis patients and 2052 matched non-SLE septic individuals were enrolled. The mortality rate was higher in the SLE group (38.5 per 100,000 person-year) than that in the non-SLE group (13.7 per 100,000 person-year), with an IRR of 2.8 (95% CI, 2.5C3.2). We found that SLE was independently associated with a high mortality rate after adjusting relevant variables (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.27C1.77). In addition to SLE, a higher age (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.02C1.02), more comorbidities, and receiving prednisolone equivalent dose higher than 5 mg/day (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27C1.90), methotrexate (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.61C2.99), and immunosuppressants (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.22C1.74) were also independent risks for mortality.

HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated efficacy; however, there is limited data on PrEP implementation in South Africa, particularly in rural areas. Using grounded theory analysis of semi-structured interviews and exploratory factor analyses of structured surveys, this mixed methods study examines healthcare workers' (HCWs)' beliefs about their patients and the likelihood of PrEP uptake in their communities. The disproportionate burden of HIV among Black South Africans is linked to the legacy of apartheid and resulting disparities in wealth and employment. HCWs in our study emphasized the importance of addressing these structural barriers, including increased travel burden among men in the community looking for work, poor transportation infrastructure, and limited numbers of highly skilled clinical staff in their rural community. HCWs also espoused a vision of PrEP that prioritizes women due to perceived constraints on their sexual agency, and that minimizes the impact of HIV-related stigma on PrEP implementation. However, HCWs' additional concerns for risk compensation may reflect dominant social mores around sexual behavior. In recognition of HCWs' role as both informants and community members, implementation scientists should invite local HCWs to partner as early as the priority-setting stage for PrEP interventions. Inviting leadership from local HCWs may increase the likelihood of delivery plans that account for unique local context and structural barriers researchers may otherwise struggle to uncover.","output":"\\"We've Got Our Own Beliefs, Attitudes, Myths\\": A Mixed Methods Assessment of Rural South African Health Care Workers' Knowledge of and Attitudes Towards PrEP Implementation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There has been increased interest in hypofractionated accelerated chemoradiation for head and neck cancer during the recent first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DESIGN This is a cross-sectional study using a structured survey tool between January and September 2020. PARTICIPANTS 1700 Lebanese and Syrian refugee patients seeking primary care for hypertension and diabetes. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES The main outcome is the comprehensiveness of service delivery comparing differences in use and service delivery patterns by fragility setting, gender, nationality and health coverage. RESULTS Compliance with routine NCD care management (eg, counselling, immunisations, diagnostic testing and referral rates) was significantly better in Beirut compared with Beqaa. Women were significantly less likely to be offered lifestyle counselling advice and referral to cardiologists (58.4% vs 68.3% in Beqaa and 58.1% vs 62% in Beirut) and ophthalmologists, compared with men. Across both settings, there was a significant trend for Lebanese patients to receive more services and more advice related to nutrition and diabetes management (89.8% vs 85.2% and 62.4% vs 55.5%, respectively).

The mothers' anxiety levels according to the Beck Anxiety Inventory and their opinions about COVID-19 in relation to their child were assessed and compared based on whether the mother/patient attended their appointments in person and whether the child had frequent or infrequent seizures. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety level between the mothers of 64 children with epilepsy who attended their appointment during the pandemic and those of the mothers of 52 who did not attend their appointment. However, the mothers of children with frequent seizures had significantly higher anxiety levels.

This paper proposes a comparison approach for the combined usage of Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT) and Machine Learning (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees, and Naive Bayes) methods for phishing email detection. The evaluation was performed on two datasets, one balanced and one imbalanced, both of which were comprised of emails from the well-known Enron corpus and the most recent emails from the Nazario phishing corpus. The best combination in the balanced dataset proved to be the Word2Vec with the Random Forest algorithm, while in the imbalanced dataset the Word2Vec with the Logistic Regression algorithm. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"A Comparison of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods for Phishing Email Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The Carlos Slim Foundation implemented the Integrated Measurement for Early Detection (MIDO), a screening strategy for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Mexico as part of CASALUD, a portfolio of digital health services focusing on healthcare delivery and prevention/management of NCDs. We investigated the disease profile of the screened population and evaluated MIDOs contribution to the continuum of care of the main NCDs. DESIGN: Using data from MIDO and the chronic diseases information system, we quantified the proportion of the population screened and diagnosed with NCDs, and measured care linkage/retention and level of control achieved. We analysed comorbidity patterns and estimated prevalence of predisease stages. Finally, we estimated characteristics associated with unawareness and control of NCDs, and examined efficacy of the CASALUD model in improving NCD control. SETTING: Public primary health centres in 27/32 Mexican states. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 20 years lacking healthcare access. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2018, 743 000 individuals were screened using MIDO. A predisease or disease condition was detected in 70% of the population who were unaware of their NCD status. The screening identified 38 417 new cases of type 2 diabetes, 53 133 new cases of hypertension and 208 627 individuals with obesity. Dyslipidaemia was found in 77.3% of individuals with available blood samples. Comorbidities were highly prevalent, especially in people with obesity. Only 5.47% (n=17 774) of individuals were linked with their corresponding primary health centre. Factors associated with unawareness of and uncontrolled NCDs were sex, age, and social determinants, for example, rural/urban environment, access to healthcare service, and education level. Patients with type 2 diabetes treated at clinics under the CASALUD model were more likely to achieve disease control (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.61). CONCLUSION: Patient-centred screening strategies such as MIDO are urgently needed to improve screening, access, retention and control for patients with NCDs.","output":"Integrated Measurement for Early Detection (MIDO) as a digital strategy for timely assessment of non-communicable disease profiles and factors associated with unawareness and control: a retrospective observational study in primary healthcare facilities in Mexico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is commonly accepted that frailty and dementia-related cognitive decline are strongly associated. However, degree of this association is often debated, especially in homebound elders with disabilities. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of frailty on cognitive function in older adults receiving homecare. A screening for frailty and cognitive function was conducted at 12 primary healthcare settings of the nationally funded program \\"Help at Home\\" in Heraklion Crete, Greece. Cognitive function and frailty were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment questionnaire and the SHARE-f index, respectively. Barthel-Activities of Daily Living and the Charlson Comorbidity Index were also used for the identification of disability and comorbidity, respectively. The mean age of the 192 participants (66% female) was 78.04  8.01 years old. In depth-analysis using multiple linear regression, revealed that frailty was not significantly associated with cognitive decline (frail vs. non-frail (B'=-2.39, p=0.246) even after adjusting for depression and multi-comorbidity.

Medical therapy was classified into two phases in our guideline. In the initial phase, workload or patients' visit was to be reduced without impairing disease control and survival. In the successive phase under restriction of medical resources, only therapies with higher priority and alternate therapies were to be practiced. Whereas no significant effect on medical practice was observed during first wave pandemic, actual impact was evaluated in this study. Methods: Among patients in our division from April to May 2020, cases of treatment change, postponement of treatment introduction, treatment interruption, long-term prescription, telephone consultation, postponement of visit, reference to other hospital, and COVID-19 diagnosis were retrospectively searched from medical records. Results: There were estimated 984 patients, 389 perioperative and 595 metastatic, of whom 119(12%) were affected by COVID-19. The breakdown is 7 cases of treatment changes, 7 cases of postponements of introduction, 20 cases of interruptions, 12 cases of long-term prescriptions of oral chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy, 36 cases of prescriptions by telephone consultation, 94 cases of postponements of visit, 3 cases of reference to other hospital, and 4 cases of fever for which COVID-19 infection could not be denied. Conclusion: 12% of patients in the division of medical oncology at the breast center changed their treatment or schedule of visit.

Hence, the availability of an artificial intelligent driven system can be an assistive tool to provide accurate diagnosis using radiology imaging techniques. In this paper, we put forward a new deep learning architecture, which integrates the Nested Residual Connections (NRCs) in a DarkCovidNet model, called DarkCovidNet-NRC, in order to classify chest images and to detect COVID-19 cases. The proposed architecture is validated with the K-fold cross-validation technique on X-ray and CT chest datasets separately and then combined. The experimental results reveal that the suggested model performs very well in the medical classification task and it competes with the state of the art in multiple performance metrics by respectively achieving an accuracy and precision of 0.9609 and 0.978 on the combined dataset. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"A Novel Deep Learning Model for COVID-19 Detection from Combined Heterogeneous X-ray and CT Chest Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is one of ten reviews selected from the Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2022.

The Clinical Problem Solvers (CPSolvers) podcast has emerged as a novel strategy to help teach DR through case conferences with expert diagnosticians and trainees. CPSolvers has 25,000 listeners in 147 countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the podcast by eliciting the developers goals of the podcast, then determining to what extent they aligned with the listeners actual usage habits, features they valued, and perceptions of the podcast. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 3 developers and 8 listeners from AprilCMay 2020, followed by qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: 1. To teach diagnostic reasoning in a case-based format by (1a) teaching schemas, (1b) modeling expert diagnostic reasoning, (1c) teaching clinical knowledge, and (1d) teaching diagnostic reasoning terminology. 2. To change the culture of medicine by (2a) promoting diversity, (2b) modeling humility and promoting psychological safety, and (2c) creating a fun, casual way to learn. 3. To democratize the teaching of diagnostic reasoning by leveraging technology. Listeners usage habits, valued features, and perceptions overall strongly aligned with all these aspects, except for (1c) clinical knowledge, and (1d) diagnostic reasoning terminology. Listeners identified (1a) schemas, and (2c) promotion of psychological safety as the most valuable features of the podcast. CONCLUSION: CPSolvers has been perceived as a highly effective and novel way to disseminate DR education in the form of case conferences, serving as an alternative to traditional in-person case conferences suspended during COVID-19.

Mortality from COVID-19 was 13% and 20% of patients required oxygen. 27% of patients were asymptomatic, these patients also had the lower risk mortality scores. 67% presented with pyrexia, 33% had a cough and 13% had breathlessness. Non-specific symptoms were also seen;53% had fatigue, 20% had diarrhoea and 20% had unresponsive episodes. Post COVID delirium was seen in 20% of patients.ConclusionMortality rates were lower than expected, indicating that the 4C mortality score might not be appropriate to use in this patient demographic due to confounding factors. Atypical symptoms were common in patients, with a variability of clinical presentations within the patient demographic. These findings suggest the importance of having a low threshold for COVID-19 infection even in the absence of typical symptoms. Development of an alternative risk stratification tool would be beneficial for this patient group, with further studies needed on a larger scale to facilitate this.","output":"Confusion and a cough: an experience of COVID-19 in dementia patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 large scale immunization in the US has been associated with breakthrough positive molecular testing. In this study, we investigated whether a positive test is associated with a high anti-viral IgG, specific viral variant, recovery of infectious virus, or symptomatic infection during an early phase after vaccination rollout. METHODS: We identified 133 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who had received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines, the 2nd of which was received between January and April of 2021. The positive samples were collected between January and May of 2021. Samples were sequenced to characterize the whole genome and Spike protein changes and cycle thresholds that reflect viral loads were determined using a single molecular assay. Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were examined using ELISA and specimens were grown on cell culture to assess the recovery of infectious virus as compared to a control unvaccinated cohort. RESULTS: Of 133 specimens, 24 failed sequencing and yielded a negative or very low viral load on the repeat PCR. Of 109 specimens that were used for further genome analysis, 68 (62.4%) were from symptomatic infections, 11 (10.1%) were admitted for COVID-19, and 2 (1.8%) required ICU admission with no associated mortality. The predominant virus variant was the Alpha (B.1.1.7), however a significant association between lineage B.1.526 and amino acid change S: E484K with positives after vaccination was noted. A significant reduction of the recovery of infectious virus on cell culture was accompanied by an increase in localized IgG levels in respiratory samples of vaccinated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination reduces the recovery of infectious virus in breakthrough infections caused primarily by the Alpha variant accompanied by an increase in upper respiratory tract IgG levels.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infections in mRNA vaccinated individuals are biased for viruses encoding spike E484K and associated with reduced infectious virus loads that correlate with respiratory antiviral IgG levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ganga River basin, being the largest river basin in India, adheres with its social and spiritual importance for the country. Although many studies have been conducted on the Ganga basin, however, trend observed in flow and sediment yield in Ganga River has been scarcely studied. Alteration in flow pattern and sediment transport in rivers brings remarkable impact on river geomorphology and entire ecosystem of the region. The present paper attempts to identify trends observed in Ganga River in terms of annual maximum and annual minimum discharges, water and sediment yield during monsoon season. The trend analysis was accomplished by performing the Mann-Kendall (M-K), Sens slope, and innovative trend analysis at various gauging sites along the river for the monsoon months. Significance of trend tests were tested at 5% significance level. Innovative trend analysis (ITA) revealed non-monotonicity within the time series and provided more detailed understanding of changes in hydrological changes. While observed annual maximum discharge showed a negative trend at almost all the sites, annual minimum discharge showed positive trend at gauging sites upstream of confluence of Yamuna River. Data of discharge and sediment load for monsoon months also revealed declining trends at most of the gauging sites. Water and sediment yields at all sites except Gandhighat showed a negative trend. Decline in trend of sediment and water yield is more pronounced in Western Ganga Plain (WGP) as compared to Eastern Ganga Plain (EGP). Incorporating these trends can be helpful for various water management projects in the future. Both climatic factors and human intervention appear to be responsible for the alteration in flow pattern of Ganga River.","output":"Trend analysis of hydrological parameters of Ganga River"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing social connection and access to care has been found to decrease the rate of suicide in U.S. veterans.

There are two major histologic types: pure seminoma and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. The latter ones are rarer but also more aggressive and include embryonic carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolc sac tumors and teratomas. Rarely, in 2% of cases, teratomas may contain elements of somatic cancer, such as sarcoma or adenocarcinoma and it is then referred to as a teratoma with somatic type malignancy. In this summary we present a case of a 25-year old man with no previous medical history who noticed painless swelling of his right testical in 4./2018. Clinical examination revealed a testicular cancer with biomarker levels HCG 12.9 IU/L, AFP 63.8 IJ/mL, LDH 190 U/L. Patient underwent a right-sided orchiectomy and according to pathologic report tumor was seminoma, pT2, stage IB. We requested revision of pathologic report which confirmed the original finding. Postoperatively, tumor biomarkers were HCG 0 IU/L, AFP 5.5 IJ/mL, LDH 180 U/L. According to all diagnostic findings it was clear that we diagnosed seminoma with increased levels of AFP which is treated as nonseminomatous tumor. Accordingly, we continued patient active surveillance until 12./2018. when PET-CT showed malignant activity in retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring 5.3 x 3.6 cm. Due to the above, we decided to start a chemotherapy. Before starting chemotherapy we encouraged patient to do a semen cryopreservation. Also From January to April of 2019. patient received a total of 3 cycles of PEB chemotherapy and radiologic surveillance reported regression of the disease. In 12./2019. PET-CT finding showed progression of retroperitoneal lymph nodes conglomerate. After MDT discussion, in 2./2020. an open biopsy and partial resection of the conglomerate was done. Pathologic report verified teratoma with somatic neuroendocrine differentiation reaching the resection margin. Soon after the biopsy, disease progressed, so therefore in 6./2020. resection of tumor conglomerate, paraaortal lymph nodes and right ureter was done. Pathologic report confirms teratoma with somatic neuroendocrine differentiation. Two months after the surgery, PET-CT showed disease progression with retroperitoneal nodules up to 2.4 cm in size and new pathologic neck lymph node. Patient presented with severe pain of the anal region, tenesmus and fever. Clinical examination showed the remaining testicle was tumor-free. Due to rapid disease progression in 9./2020. we started second-line PEI chemotherapy. Patient received a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy so far with a delay of last cycle for a few days due to overcoming COVID 19 infection. After six cycles of therapy patient is pain-free and PET-CT reports constantly show regression of the disease. Since two independent pathologic analysis reported seminoma after orchiectomy, the question is wheather it is teratoma with somatic type malignancy.

More than 80% of COVID-19 patients exhibit mild or moderate symptoms. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of viral load and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe and mild/moderate diseases. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information were obtained. Serial samples of blood, nasal and pharyngeal and anal swabs were collected at different time points post-onset. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured by qRT-PCR and immunoassays, respectively. RESULTS: Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in 58.0% (58/100) COVID-19 patients upon admission and lasted for a median of 13 days post-onset. In addition, 5.9% (1/17) and 20.2% (19/94) of the blood and anal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, respectively. Anal viral RNA was more frequently detected in the patients who were positive for viral RNA in the respiratory samples upon admission. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody developed within two weeks after onset, reached peak approximately 17 days post-onset and then maintained at relatively high level up to 50 days we analyzed in most patients. However, the levels of antibodies were variable among the patients. High titers of antibodies appeared to be associated with the severity of the disease. Furthermore, viral proteins from different sources showed significant difference of serological sensitivity especially during the first week post-onset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate rapid clearance or self-elimination of viral RNA in about half of the COVID-19 patients upon admission. Viral RNA shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in multiple tissues including the respiratory system, blood, and intestine. Variable levels of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody may be associated with disease severity.

Generally, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation intensely induces cytokine production as an inflammatory response to viral infection. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome can be a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, this review first introduces the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway. Second, we review the cellular/molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., viroporins, ion flux and the complement cascade). Furthermore, we describe the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (e.g., cytokine storm, respiratory manifestations, cardiovascular comorbidity and neurological symptoms).

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.","output":"Time from Symptom Onset to Hospitalisation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Cases: Implications for the Proportion of Transmissions from Infectors with Few Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although Salmonella spp. infection has been identified in captive and free-ranging rhinoceros, clinical cases in black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis ) calves have not been described.

If immunity wanes quickly, millions of people may be at risk for reinfection after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, memory B cells (MBCs) could provide durable humoral immunity even if serum neutralizing antibody titers decline. We performed multidimensional flow cytometric analysis of S protein receptor binding domain-specific (S-RBD-specific) MBCs in cohorts of ambulatory patients with COVID-19 with mild disease (n = 7), and hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease (n = 7), at a median of 54 days (range, 39-104 days) after symptom onset. We detected S-RBD-specific class-switched MBCs in 13 of 14 participants, failing only in the individual with the lowest plasma levels of anti-S-RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Resting MBCs (rMBCs) made up the largest proportion of S-RBD-specific MBCs in both cohorts. FCRL5, a marker of functional memory on rMBCs, was more dramatically upregulated on S-RBD-specific rMBCs after mild infection than after severe infection. These data indicate that most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop S-RBD-specific, class-switched rMBCs that resemble germinal center-derived B cells induced by effective vaccination against other pathogens, providing evidence for durable B cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after mild or severe disease.","output":"Durable SARS-CoV-2 B cell immunity after mild or severe disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zeolites have unique pore structures of molecular dimensions and tunable compositions, making them ideal for shape selective catalysis and separation. However, targeted synthesis of zeolites with new pore structures and compositions remains a key challenge. Here, we propose an approach based on a unique 3D-3D topotactic transformation, which takes advantage of weak bonding in zeolites. This is inspired by the structure transformation of PST-5, a new aluminophosphate molecular sieve, to PST-6 by calcination. The structure of nano-sized PST-5 crystals is determined by 3D electron diffraction. We find that the 3D-3D topotactic transformation involves two types of building units where penta- or hexa-coordinated Al is present. We apply this approach to several other zeolite systems and predict a series of new zeolite structures that would be synthetically feasible. This method provides a concept for the synthesis of targeted zeolites, especially those which may not be feasible by conventional methods.","output":"3D-3D topotactic transformation in aluminophosphate molecular sieves and its implication in new zeolite structure generation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Venous access for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) is commonly performed by cephalic venous cut down, or axillary or subclavian vein puncture. The latter technique carries a risk of complications such as pneumothorax or lead crush. Cephalic venous cut down is free of these complications but often less successful due to technical difficulties. We report a highly successful, simplified cephalic venous access with a modified Seldinger technique. METHODS We prospectively studied 221 patients undergoing de novo implantation of a one, two or three lead device system performed over a 1-year period at our centre, and assessed the efficacy of the cephalic vein access including the number of leads successfully placed for each procedure. RESULTS In 83 percent of patients undergoing CIED implantation a suitable cephalic vein was present. In respectively 98% and 99% of patients undergoing single or dual chamber CIED implantation, lead placement could be performed exclusively via the cephalic vein and in 72% of CRT implants, all three leads were placed via cephalic access.

To improve the oral bioavailability of OLM, a delivery system based on ethylcellulose (EC, a biobased polymer) nanosponges (NSs) was developed and evaluated for cytotoxicity against the A549 lung cell lines and antihypertensive potential in a rat model. Four OLM-loaded NSs (ONS1-ONS4) were prepared and fully evaluated in terms of physicochemical properties. Among these formulations, ONS4 was regarded as the optimized formulation with particle size (487 nm), PDI (0.386), zeta potential (P = ?18.1 mV), entrapment efficiency (EE = 91.2%) and drug loading (DL = 0.88%). In addition, a nanosized porous morphology was detected for this optimized system with NS surface area of about 63.512 m(2)/g, pore volume and pore radius Dv(r) of 0.149 cc/g and 15.274 ?, respectively, measured by nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis. The observed morphology plus sustained release rate of OLM caused that the optimized formulation showed higher cytotoxicity against A549 lung cell lines in comparison to the pure OLM. Finally, this system (ONS4) reduced the systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly (p < 0.01) as compared to control and pure OLM drug in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

The assertion of a universal power law is controversial because the linearity and slope appear to vary over time and among countries. We compare census enumerations and night light luminance as proxies for population density and intensity of development in the contiguous United States. Treating population density and development intensity as continuous quantities allows for the definition of spatial networks based on the level of spatial connectivity. The resulting distributions of spatial network components (subsets of connected nodes) vary with degree of connectivity, but maintain consistent scaling over a wide range of network sizes. At continental scales, spatial network rank-size distributions obtained from both population density and night light brightness are well-fit by power laws with exponents near -1 for a wide range of density and luminance thresholds. However, the largest components (10,000 - 100,000 sq.km) are far larger than individual cities and represent spatially contiguous agglomerations of urban, suburban and periurban development.

Objective: To explore the current situation and influencing factors of job stress among clinical first-line nurses fighting COVID-19. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used to conduct a questionnaire survey with 110 nurses who were on the clinical frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic in a hospital in Wuhan. Results: The job stress scores of clinical nurses on the frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic were collected (91.42  26.09); the dimensions of work environment and resources as well as workload and time pressure were ranked first and second, respectively. The results of a multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that working hours per day, service years, number of night shifts per week, and level of academic qualification were the main factors affecting the job stress levels of nursing staff. Conclusions: The job stress of nurses on the clinical frontline of the COVID-19 epidemic was found to be at a medium level.

Understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still in its infancy. A 382-nt deletion strain lacking ORF8 (382 herein) was isolated in Singapore in March 2020. Infection with 382 was associated with less severe disease in patients, compared to infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Here, we established Nasal Epithelial cells (NECs) differentiated from healthy nasal-tissue derived stem cells as a suitable model for the ex-vivo study of SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathogenesis. Infection of NECs with either SARS-CoV-2 or 382 resulted in virus particles released exclusively from the apical side, with similar replication kinetics. Screening of a panel of 49 cytokines for basolateral secretion from infected NECs identified CXCL10 as the only cytokine significantly induced upon infection, at comparable levels in both wild-type and 382 infected cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed the temporal up-regulation of distinct gene subsets during infection, with anti-viral signaling pathways only detected at late time-points (72 hours post-infection, hpi). This immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was significantly attenuated when compared to infection with an influenza strain, H3N2, which elicited an inflammatory response within 8 hpi, and a greater magnitude of anti-viral gene up-regulation at late time-points. Remarkably, 382 induced a host transcriptional response nearly identical to that of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 at every post-infection time-point examined. In accordance with previous results, 382 infected cells showed an absence of transcripts mapping to ORF8, and conserved expression of other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Our findings shed light on the airway epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and demonstrate a non-essential role for ORF8 in modulating host gene expression and cytokine production from infected cells.","output":"Infection of human Nasal Epithelial Cells with SARS-CoV-2 and a 382-nt deletion isolate lacking ORF8 reveals similar viral kinetics and host transcriptional profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming more prominent in the tourism industry Nowadays, consumers are faced with multiple options involving both human and robot interactions A series of experimental studies were implemented Four experiments demonstrated that consumers had a more positive attitude toward robot-staffed (vs human-staffed) hotels when COVID-19 was salient The results were different from previous studies, which were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic Since the moderating role of perceived threat in consumers preference for robot-staffed hotels was significant, the respondents preference was attributed to the global health crisis This research provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications by improving the understanding of technology acceptance during a health crisis","output":"Preference for robot service or human service in hotels?

Despite 24/7 monitoring from the nearby state-of-the-art Montserrat volcano observatory, with little warning, the Soufriere Hills Volcano, located a distant 5 miles Southeast of the Campus spontaneously roared back to life in January 2007, venting clouds of volcanic ash and gas 8 kilometers (5 miles) into the sky with overflow lava and debris reaching the sea to the East and West;the volcano's lava dome continued to grow as it had since 2006, and local volcano experts worried that the rapidly growing lava dome, the mounting pressure building inside the dome could cause a catastrophic explosive eruption, and the renewed volcanic activity indicates that the volcano is now predicted to remain active well into the future. The volcanic activity caused the partial evacuation of the Island, including areas bordering the campus, resulting in the establishment of the USAT Campus satellite transmitter system [CST] in 2007.

Whereas, EF data for idling vehicles have scarcely been reported in the literature, let alone comparison of different fuels. In this study, the EFs of passenger cars burning four types of fuels - gasoline, compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) were measured and compared. The emissions data for CO, CO2, unburned hydrocarbon (HC), and NO were recorded to calculate fuel-based EFs in units of g pollutants/kg fuel burned. EFs for CO, HC, and NO were compared for the four fuels. Diesel vehicles had the highest EF for CO, with an average value of 35.12  21.37 g/kg fuel, due to low concentration of CO2 in lean operation compared to CO emission. CNG vehicles had the highest EF for HC, with an average value of 28.15  11.97 g/kg fuel, due to high concentration of unburned methane gas due to slow CNG flame speed whereas diesel vehicles again had the highest EF for NO due to high temperature and pressure and freezing of NO decomposition reaction, with an average value of 12.07  5.37 g/kg fuel. Further comparison was conducted to analyze the effects of two additional variables on EF: engine displacement volume and model/brand year. Only the gasoline-fueled vehicles showed an increase in EFs (for CO, HC and NO) with the vehicle age according to the model year. However, no clear correlation was observed for CNG, LPG, and diesel-fueled vehicles. Finally, the EF results were compared with those reported in the literature, which have been measured in various countries under both idling and non-idling conditions. Because the idling EFs were not substantially smaller than those under moving conditions, and vehicles spend substantial time idling in large cities, idling emissions should not be ignored in the emission inventories for large cities.","output":"Comparison of the emission factors of air pollutants from gasoline, CNG, LPG and diesel fueled vehicles at idle speed"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for rapidly designing, initiating, and delivering therapeutic clinical trials. PRINCIPLE (Platform Randomised Trial of Treatments in the Community for Epidemic and Pandemic Illnesses) is the UK national platform investigating repurposed therapies for COVID-19 treatment of older people in the community at high risk of complications. Standard methods of patient recruitment were failing to meet the required pace and scale of enrolment. This paper describes the development and appraisal of a near real-time, data-driven, ethical approach for enhancing recruitment in community care by contacting people with a recent COVID-19 positive test result from the central NHS Test and Trace service within approximately 24C48 h of their test result. METHODS: A multi-disciplinary team was formed to solve the technical, ethical, public perception, logistical and information governance issues required to provide a near-real time (approximately within 24C48 h of receiving a positive test) feed of potential trial participants from test result data to the research team. PRINCIPLE was also given unique access to the Summary Care Record (SCR) to ensure safe prescribing, and to enable the trial team to quickly and safely bring consented patients into the trial. A survey of the public was used to understand public perceptions of the use of test data for this proposed methodology. RESULTS: Prior to establishing the data service, PRINCIPLE registered on average 87 participants per week. This increased by up to 87 additional people registered per week from the test data, contributing to an increase from 1013 recruits to PRINCIPLE at the start of October 2020 to 2802 recruits by 20 December 2020. Whilst procedural caveats were identified by the public consultation, out of 2639 people contacted by PRINCIPLE following a positive test result, no one raised a concern about being approached. CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes a novel approach to using near-real time NHS operational data to recruit community-based patients within a few days of presentation with acute illness. This approach increased recruitment and reduced time between positive test and randomisation, allowing more rapid evaluation of treatments and increased safety for participants.

METHODS: The DocStyles survey collected data from primary care providers (PCPs), obstetricians-gynecologists (OB/GYNs), and nurse practitioners/physician assistants (NP/PAs) in fall 2020 (n=1,502). We investigated clinical practice changes for monitoring hypertension that were implemented early in the COVID-19 pandemic and examined differences by clinician and practice characteristics (p<0.05). RESULTS: Overall, 369 (24.6%) of clinicians reported their clinical practices made no changes in monitoring hypertension early in the pandemic, 884 (58.9%) advised patients to monitor blood pressure at home or a pharmacy, 699 (46.5%) implemented or increased use of telemedicine for blood pressure monitoring visits, and 545 (36.3%) reduced the frequency of office visits for blood pressure monitoring. Compared with NP/PAs, PCPs were more likely to advise SMBP monitoring (adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) 1.28, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.11-1.47), implement or increase use of telemedicine (aPR 1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.46) and reduce the frequency of office visits (aPR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.70) for blood pressure monitoring, and less likely to report making no practice changes (aPR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: We noted variation in clinical practice changes by clinician type and practice characteristics.

Despite numerous clinical trials and vaccines, the burden remains immense, and the host determinants of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 severity remain largely unknown. Signatures of positive selection detected by comparative functional-genetic analyses in primate and bat genomes can uncover important and specific adaptations that occurred at virus-host interfaces. Here, we performed high-throughput evolutionary analyses of 334 SARS- CoV-2 interacting proteins to identify SARS-CoV adaptive loci and uncover functional differences between modern humans, primates and bats. Using DGINN (Detection of Genetic INNovation), we identified 38 bat and 81 primate proteins with marks of positive selection. Seventeen genes, including the ACE2 receptor, present adaptive marks in both mammalian orders, suggesting common virus-host interfaces and past epidemics of coronaviruses shaping their genomes. Yet, 84 genes presented distinct adaptations in bats and primates. Notably, residues involved in ubiquitination and phosphorylation of the inflammatory RIPK1 have rapidly evolved in bats but not primates, suggesting different inflammation regulation versus humans. Furthermore, we discovered residues with typical virus-host arms-race marks in primates, such as in the entry factor TMPRSS2 or the autophagy adaptor FYCO1, pointing to host-specific in vivo important interfaces that may be drug targets. Finally, we found that FYCO1 sites under adaptation in primates are those associated with severe COVID-19, supporting their importance in pathogenesis and replication. Overall, we identified functional adaptations involved in SARS- CoV-2 infection in bats and primates, critically enlightening modern genetic determinants of virus susceptibility and severity.

Individual acute URI between the case and control periods was reviewed. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of SSNHL risk associated with acute URIs after adjustments for potential confounders. In total, 1131 patients with SSNHL between 2010 and 2013 fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included. The aOR (95% confidence interval [CI]) for SSNHL was 1.57 (1.20C2.05) in relation to acute URIs one month before the index date. Moreover, the aORs (95% CIs) of the female and young to middle-aged (65 years) populations were 1.63 (1.13C2.36) and 1.76 (1.29C2.40), respectively. In addition, the association between SSNHL and acute URIs was decreased over time. The aOR for SSNHL was 1.25 (1.01C1.56) in relation to acute URIs three months before the index date.

There are available methods in literature that have used FC patterns as inputs for binary classification models, but the results barely reach an accuracy of 80%. Additionally, the generalizability across multiple sites of the models has not been investigated. Due to the lack of ASD subtypes identification model, the multi-class classification is proposed in the present study. This study aims to develop automated identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subtypes using convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dynamic FC as its inputs. The rs-fMRI dataset used in this study consists of 144 individuals from 8 independent sites, labeled based on three ASD subtypes, namely autistic disorder (ASD), Aspergers disorder (APD), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from 116 brain nodes of automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas are used, where the top-ranked node is determined based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the power spectral density (PSD) values. Based on the statistical analysis of the PSD values of 3-level ASD and normal control (NC), putamen_R is obtained as the top-ranked node and used for the wavelet coherence computation. With good resolution in time and frequency domain, scalograms of wavelet coherence between the top-ranked node and the rest of the nodes are used as dynamic FC feature input to the convolutional neural networks (CNN). The dynamic FC patterns of wavelet coherence scalogram represent phase synchronization between the pairs of BOLD signals. Classification algorithms are developed using CNN and the wavelet coherence scalograms for binary and multi-class identification were trained and tested using cross-validation and leave-one-out techniques.

We determined the magnitude, quality and persistence of cellular and humoral memory responses up to 6 months after vaccination with BBV152/Covaxin. Here, we show that the quantity of vaccine-induced spike- and nucleoprotein-antibodies is comparable to that following natural infection and the antibodies are detectable up to 6 months. The RBD-specific antibodies decline in the range of 3 to 10-fold against the SARS-CoV-2 variants in the order of alpha (B.1.1.7) > delta (B.1.617.2) > beta (B.1.351), with no observed impact of gamma (P.1) and kappa (B.1.617.1) variant. We found that the vaccine induces memory B cells, similar to natural infection, which are impacted by virus variants in the same order as antibodies. The vaccine further induced antigen-specific functionally potent multi-cytokine expressing CD4+ T cells in ~85% of the subjects, targeting spike and nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Marginal ~1.3 fold-reduction was observed in vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells against the beta variant, with no significant impact of the alpha and the delta variants. The antigen-specific CD4+ T cells were populated in the central memory compartment and persisted up to 6 months of vaccination. Importantly the vaccine generated Tfh cells that are endowed with B cell help potential, similar to the Tfh cells induced after natural infection. Altogether, these findings establish that the inactivated virus vaccine BBV152 induces robust immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern, which persist for at least 6 months after vaccination.

STUDY DESIGN Guided by the Learning Health System framework and QUERI Implementation Roadmap, QUERI engaged stakeholders to nominate and rank-order priorities, peer-reviewed and funded initiatives to scale up and spread evidence-based practices (EBPs) using theory-based implementation strategies, and evaluated the impact of these initiatives using the QUERI Impact Framework. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS QUERI collected priority nominations through qualitative discussions and a web-based survey, and live voting was used to rank-order priorities. QUERI-funded teams regularly submitted progress reports describing the key activities, findings, and impacts of the quality improvement (QI) initiatives using a standardized form created in the VA Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).

The vaccine effect on infection, while important both as a proxy for transmission and to describe a vaccine's total effects, requires frequent longitudinal sampling to capture all infections. Such sampling may not always be feasible. A logistically easy approach is to collect a sample to test for infection at a regularly scheduled visit. Such point or cross-sectional sampling does not permit estimation of classic vaccine effciacy on infection, as long duration infections are sampled with higher probability. Building on work by Rinta et al 2009, we evaluate proxies of the vaccine effect on transmission at a point in time; the vaccine efficacy on prevalent infection and on prevalent viral load, VE$_{PI}$ and VE$_{PVL}$, respectively. Longer infections with higher viral loads should have more transmission potential and prevalent vaccine efficacy naturally captures this aspect. We apply a proportional hazards model for infection risk and show how these metrics can be estimated using longitudinal or cross-sectional sampling.

We sought to review the economic costs and benefits of prescribed CBMs in any chronic illness, and the frameworks used for their economic evaluation. METHODS A systematic review of eight medical and economic databases, from inception to mid-December 2016, was undertaken. MeSH headings and text words relating to economic costs and benefits, and CBMs were combined. Study quality was assessed using relevant checklists and results were synthesised in narrative form. RESULTS Of 2514 identified records, ten studies met the eligibility criteria, all for the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Six contained economic evaluations, four studies reported utility-based quality of life, and one was a willingness-to-pay study. Four of five industry-sponsored cost-utility analyses for MS spasticity reported nabiximols as being cost-effective from a European health system perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for these five studies were 49,257 (UK); 10,891 (Wales); 11,214 (Germany); 4968 (Italy); and dominant (Spain). Nabiximols for the management of MS spasticity was not associated with statistically significant improvements in EQ-5D scores compared with standard care.

RESULTS: A total of 76 out of 170 patients (44.7%) developed PE without having any major risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The most severe pulmonary arteries involvement, expressed in terms of PAO Index, occurred in those patients with markedly elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) values and those patients with an advanced temporal stage of lung disease. The majority PE-positive patients were hospitalized in non-intensive wards. PE-positive patients showed a slightly higher hospitalization time in comparison with PE-negative ones. In the three months of study, overall 85.9% of patients were discharged while 14.1% died, of whom 13 PE-positive (54.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection present a higher cumulative incidence of PE compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, regardless of the severity of lung inflammation or the temporal stage of the disease.

An umbrella review of systematic reviews was conducted to summarise the magnitude and quality of the evidence for each prognostic factor investigated. Searches were limited to the last 10 years (2008-11th April 2018, updated 28th September 2020). A two-stage approach was undertaken: in stage one, data on prognostic factors was extracted from systematic reviews identified from the systematic search that met the inclusion criteria. Where a prognostic factor was investigated in 1 systematic review and where 50% or more of those reviews found an association between the prognostic factor and one of the outcomes of interest, it was taken forward to stage two. In stage two, additional information extracted included the strength of association found, consistency of effects, and risk of bias. The GRADE approach was used to grade confidence in the evidence. Stage one identified 41 reviews (90 prognostic factors), with 35 reviews (25 prognostic factors) taken forward to stage two. Seven prognostic factors (disability/activity limitation, mental health; pain intensity; pain severity; coping; expectation of outcome/recovery; and fear-avoidance) were judged as having moderate confidence for robust findings. Although there was conflicting evidence for the strength of association with outcome, these factors may be used for identifying vulnerable subgroups or people able to self-manage.

Consequently, purinergic receptors are considered to be promising therapeutic targets for many respiratory diseases, including asthma. This review explores how online bioinformatics resources combined with recently generated datasets can be utilized to investigate purinergic receptor gene expression in tissues and cell types of interest in respiratory disease to identify potential therapeutic targets, which can then be investigated further. These approaches show that different purinergic receptors are expressed at different levels in lung tissue, and that purinergic receptors tend to be expressed at higher levels in immune cells and at more moderate levels in airway structural cells. Notably, P2RX1, P2RX4, P2RX7, P2RY1, P2RY11, and P2RY14 were revealed as the most highly expressed purinergic receptors in lung tissue, therefore suggesting that these receptors have good potential as therapeutic targets for asthma and other respiratory diseases.","output":"Purinergic Receptors in the Airways: Potential Therapeutic Targets for Asthma?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Patients undergoing haemodialysis may experience troubling symptoms such as fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality, which may affect their quality of life. The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients receiving haemodialysis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to explore the contributing predictors. METHODS: A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using Qualtrics software was performed. Data were collected using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue (FACT-F), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the predictors that were associated with fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 123 patients undergoing haemodialysis who participated, 53.7% (n = 66) reported fatigue, 43.9% (n = 54) reported anxiety, 33.3% (n = 41) reported depression and 56.9% (n = 70) reported poor sleep. Fatigue, anxiety and sleep quality (P < .05) were significantly associated with being female, and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. Logistic regression showed that being within the age group 31-40, having a secondary education level, anxiety, depression and sleep quality were the main predictors affecting the fatigue group. CONCLUSION: Fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality are significant problems for patients receiving haemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate interventions to monitor and reduce fatigue, psychological problems and sleep quality amongst these patients are needed.

This affects most business operations and companies have to switch to Working From Home (WFH). This paper aim to propose WFH Facilities Model during a pandemic (COVID-19). The scope of this study pertains to Malaysian citizens. The main methods used in this research were a deductive approach that suit to cross-sectional research. This research employs a simple random sampling technique to achieve the required minimum sample size. Therefore, to gather data, a questionnaire survey technique was selected.Meanwhile, using the SmartPLS3, structural equation modeling (SEM) technique was used to test the research hypotheses. A total of 500 questionnaires was circulated via a web-based self-administered questionnaire using the Google Forms survey. Out of 500 questionnaires distributed, only 363 sets were replied to and completed with a high response rate of up to 73%. The findings of the study show that from six research hypotheses, only two hypotheses are supported which are Work-Family Related (WF) and Modern Technology (MT).Hence, this study recommends that it is important for any organisation that wants to implement WFH to pay an attention to both attributes. ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

The strategy to protect patients and healthcare workers from infection by SARS-CoV-2 in surgical departments has needed step-by-step development. Based on the evaluation of international recommendations and guidelines, as well as personal experiences in a clinical hot spot and in a 450-bed surgical clinic, an adapted surgical site infection (SSI) prevention checklist was needed to develop concise instructions, which described roles and responsibilities of health care professionals that could be used for wider guidance in pandemic conditions. METHOD: Publications of COVID-19-related recommendations and guidelines, produced by health authorities and organizations, such as WHO, US-CDC, ECDC, the American College of Surgery and the Robert Koch Institute, were retrieved, assessed and referenced up to January 31(st), 2020. Additionally, clinical personal experiences in Germany were evaluated and considered. RESULTS: Part 1 of this guidance summarizes the experience of a tertiary care, surgical centre which utilised redundant hospital buildings for immediate spatial separation in a hot spot COVID-19 area. Part 2 outlines the successful screening and isolation strategy in a surgical clinic in a region of Germany with outbreaks in surrounding medical centres.

However, there is limited information on the characteristics and use patterns of these tools in practice. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to describe the characteristics of people who use digital health tools to address COVID-19-related concerns; explore their self-reported symptoms and characterize the association of these symptoms with COVID-19; and characterize the recommendations provided by digital health tools. METHODS: This study used data from three digital health tools on the K Health app: a protocol-based COVID-19 self-assessment, an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven symptom checker, and communication with remote physicians. Deidentified data were extracted on the demographic and clinical characteristics of adults seeking COVID-19-related health information between April 8 and June 20, 2020. Analyses included exploring features associated with COVID-19 positivity and features associated with the choice to communicate with a remote physician. RESULTS: During the period assessed, 71,619 individuals completed the COVID-19 self-assessment, 41,425 also used the AI-driven symptom checker, and 2523 consulted with remote physicians. Individuals who used the COVID-19 self-assessment were predominantly female (51,845/71,619, 72.4%), with a mean age of 34.5 years (SD 13.9). Testing for COVID-19 was reported by 2901 users, of whom 433 (14.9%) reported testing positive. Users who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to have reported loss of smell or taste (relative rate [RR] 6.66, 95% CI 5.53-7.94) and other established COVID-19 symptoms as well as ocular symptoms.

Background: Air-powered costumes use a small motor to create positive pressure within the costume. This mechanism is similar to Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR).1 However, unlike a PAPR the air-powered costume does not filter the incoming air through a HEPA filter. Nor does it capture the air inside a contained space and filter it before it is released into the environment. The affect is that droplets from the person in the costume or from air that is drawn into the costume, which would normally be too heavy to travel farther than 6 feet, are aerosolized by traveling through the turbulent blower. These small particles can easily penetrate the thin fabric that makes the costume. This creates an infection control problem by aerosolizing the particles and then propelling them with the force of positive pressure.\\" Case Description: In January of 2021, a Covid-19 outbreak in San Jose, CA, was contact traced back to a surprising source. On Christmas day, a worker wishing to lift spirits, unknowingly spread Covid-19 via an air-powered Christmas tree costume. The worker did not have symptoms of SARS-COV-2 and did not know they were infected. The result is tragic. In San Jose, at least 60 people were infected, and one person died.\\" Conclusion: This case manifests a tragic outcome to what was meant to be a benevolent action. All evidence points to lack of information guiding this well-intentioned action. What was meant to decrease the stress and burden of the pandemic, became a greater stress and burden. Tragically with a loss of life and unknown morbidity. Further, there is the potential for a psychologic toll on the person who thought they were helping others, only to learn that they had harmed them. Given that these costumes in hospitals are rare, further tragedies such as this one should be preventable. Covid-19 is not the only pathogen that could theoretically be spread by this mechanism. Hospital should have a policy that restricts the use of these costumes. Education about the danger of these costumes should be provided to staff. Given that personal may act by finding replacement, risk management and infection control should create an adequate policy to address the mental health needs of staff and patients, while maintain appropriate infection control. Now that there is documentation of this methods of pathogenic spread, hospitals may face liability if they fail to establish a reasonable policy and education regarding turbulent flow air-powered costumes.","output":"Turbulent Airflow Costume Compromises Occupational Safety and Infection Control: A Hospital Risk Management Case Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microglia and macrophages initiate and orchestrate the innate immune response to central nervous system (CNS) virus infections. Microglia initiate neurotropic coronavirus clearance from the CNS, but the role of infiltrating macrophages is not well understood. Here, using mice lacking cell-specific expression of DP1, the receptor for prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)), we delineate the relative roles of PGD(2) signaling in microglia and macrophages in murine coronavirus-infected mice. We show that the absence of PGD(2)/DP1 signaling on microglia recapitulated the suboptimal immune response observed in global DP1(?/?) mice. Unexpectedly, the absence of the DP1 receptor on macrophages had an opposite effect, resulting in enhanced activation and more rapid virus clearance. However, microglia are still required for disease resolution, even when macrophages are highly activated, in part because they are required for macrophage recruitment to sites of infection. Together, these results identify key differences in the effects of PGD(2)/DP1 signaling on microglia and macrophages and illustrate the complex relationship between the two types of myeloid cells.","output":"Differential Effects of Prostaglandin D(2) Signaling on Macrophages and Microglia in Murine Coronavirus Encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes respiratory infection in humans, with symptom severity that ranges from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. Known risk factors for severe MERS include male sex, older age, and the presence of various comorbidities. MERS-CoV gains entry into cells by binding its receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), on the surface of airway epithelia. We hypothesized that expression of this receptor might be an additional determinant of outcomes in different individuals during MERS-CoV infection. To learn more about the role of DPP4 in facilitating MERS-CoV infection and spread, we used ELISA and immunofluorescent staining to characterize DPP4 expression in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelia (HAE). We noted wide inter-individual variation in DPP4 abundance, varying by as much as 1000-fold between HAE donors. This variability appears to influence multiple aspects of MERS-CoV infection and pathogenesis, with greater DPP4 abundance correlating with early, robust virus replication and increased cell sloughing. We also observed increased induction of interferon and some interferon-stimulated genes in response to MERS-CoV infection in epithelia with the greatest DPP4 abundance. Overall, our results indicate that inter-individual differences in DPP4 abundance are one host factor contributing to MERS-CoV replication and host defense responses, and highlight how HAE may serve as a useful model for identifying risk factors associated with heightened susceptibility to serious respiratory pathogens.","output":"Inter-individual Variation in Receptor Expression Influences MERS-CoV Infection and Immune Responses in Airway Epithelia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The decisions of whether and how to evacuate during a climate disaster are influenced by a wide range of factors, including sociodemographics, emergency messaging, and social influence. Further complexity is introduced when multiple hazards occur simultaneously, such as a flood evacuation taking place amid a viral pandemic that requires physical distancing. Such multi-hazard events can necessitate a nuanced navigation of competing decision-making strategies wherein a desire to follow peers is weighed against contagion risks. To better understand these nuances, we distributed an online survey during a pandemic surge in July 2020 to 600 individuals in three midwestern and three southern states in the United States with high risk of flooding. In this paper, we estimate a random parameter logit model in both preference space and willingness-to-pay space. Our results show that the directionality and magnitude of the influence of peers' choices of whether and how to evacuate vary widely across respondents. Overall, the decision of whether to evacuate is positively impacted by peer behavior, while the decision of how to evacuate is negatively impacted by peers. Furthermore, an increase in flood threat level lessens the magnitude of these impacts. These findings have important implications for the design of tailored emergency messaging strategies. Specifically, emphasizing or deemphasizing the severity of each threat in a multi-hazard scenario may assist in: (1) encouraging a reprioritization of competing risk perceptions and (2) magnifying or neutralizing the impacts of social influence, thereby (3) nudging evacuation decision-making toward a desired outcome.","output":"Protection or Peril of Following the Crowd in a Pandemic-Concurrent Flood Evacuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to discuss a better understanding of existing levels of Islamic environmental behavior in the perspective of eco-feminist environmental activism in Pakistan with the analysis of existing literature, media reports, NGOs environmental movements, and the environmental activists campaigns.

The outbreak of coronavirus in 2019 occurred close to the Spring Festival in China, when many rural-to-urban workers moved to their hometowns, resulting in increased household (HH) consumption of solid fuels for space heating in the rural north. In this study, field measurements of HH PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic size ?2.5 m) from a rural village were performed to evaluate changes in indoor, outdoor, and total exposure during the quarantine. Both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were, as expected, higher during the heating period than during the non-heating period, resulting in much more exposure during the heating season. Indoor exposure accounted for up to 87% and 95% of the total PM2.5 exposure during the non-heating and heating periods, respectively. The contributions of indoor exposure associated with internal sources were 46% and 66%, respectively. Indoor coal combustion resulted in an increment of about 62  12 g m?3 in indoor PM2.5 exposure. Due to the quarantine, the indoor-originated PM2.5 exposure increased by 4 g m?3 compared to that during the heating period before the lockdown. In comparison with the exposure before the quarantine during the heating period, the outdoor exposure decreased by 5 g m?3 during the quarantine, which was mainly attributable to much less time spent outdoors, although the outdoor PM2.5 levels increased from 86  49 g m?3 to 104  85 g m?3. However, the overall exposure increased by 13 g m?3 during the quarantine, resulting from the changes in outdoor exposure (?5 g m?3), outdoor-originated indoor PM2.5 exposure (+9 g m?3), PM2.5 from indoor sources before the quarantine (+5 g m?3), and quarantine-induced indoor PM2.5 increments (+4 g m?3).

Program Webpages were then evaluated during September and October 2020 based on the presence of 48 criteria, organized into seven main categories including visibility & communication, program information, curriculum information, faculty description, research, recruitment, and salary and benefits. Programs were also evaluated based on region and research ranking. Additionally, 166 programs with accreditation for Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) were assessed for the presence or absence of ESIR pathway acknowledgement on program webpages. RESULTS: The online search yielded information on all integrated programs (89/89, 100%) and 74 independent programs (74/91, 80.3%). For the ESIR programs, the online search for accreditation acknowledgement yielded 108 programs (108/166, 65%) approved for this pathway. Only seven of the 89 integrated programs met at least 75% of the criteria. Of the 91 independent programs, only one met at least 75% of the criteria. On average, integrated programs met more criteria (25, 52%) than independent programs (17, 36%).

Given the novelty of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, transmission associated with air travel is based on transmission dynamics of other respiratory viruses. Our objective was to provide a rapid summary and evaluation of relevant data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft, report policy implications and to highlight research gaps requiring urgent attention. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases (1 February 2020C27 January 2021) and included studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission aboard aircraft. We assessed study quality based on five criteria and reported important findings. KEY FINDINGS: We included 18 studies on in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission (130 unique flights) and 2 studies on wastewater from aircraft. The quality of evidence from most published studies was low. Two wastewater studies reported PCR-positive samples with high cycle threshold values (33C39). Index case definition was heterogeneous across studies. The proportion of contacts traced ranged from 0.68 to 100%. Authors traced 2800/19 729 passengers, 140/180 crew members and 8/8 medical staff. Altogether, 273 index cases were reported, with 64 secondary cases. Three studies, each investigating one flight, reported no secondary cases. Secondary attack rate among studies following up >80% of passengers and crew (including data on 10 flights) varied between 0 and 8.2%. The studies reported on the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Two studies performed viral cultures with 10 positive results. Genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in individuals from four flights. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted during aircraft travel, but published data do not permit any conclusive assessment of likelihood and extent. The variation in design and methodology restricts the comparison of findings across studies.

Consequently, a variety of studies using different neuroimaging techniques attempted to identify the existence of a brain phenotype in people with gender dysphoria (GD). However, to date, brain sexual differences at the metabolite level using magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) have not been explored in transgender people. In this study, 28 cisgender men (CM) and 34 cisgender women (CW) and 29 transgender men with GD (TMGD) underwent (1)H-MRS at 3 Tesla MRI to characterize common brain metabolites. Specifically, levels of NCacetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), glutamate and glutamine (Glx), and myo-inositol + glycine (mI + Gly) were assessed in two brain regions, the amygdala-anterior hippocampus and the lateral parietal cortex. The results indicated a sex-assigned at birth pattern for Cho/Cr in the amygdala of TMGD. In the parietal cortex, a sex-assigned at birth and an intermediate pattern were found. Though assessed post-hoc, exploration of the age of onset of GD in TMGD demonstrated within-group differences in absolute NAA and relative Cho/Cr levels, suggestive for a possible developmental trend. While brain metabolite levels in TMGD resembled those of CW, some interesting findings, such as modulation of metabolite concentrations by age of onset of GD, warrant future inquiry.","output":"Characterization of the (1)H-MRS Metabolite Spectra in Transgender Men with Gender Dysphoria and Cisgender People"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Visual impairment affects over 19 million children globally and, if left untreated, can result in significant ocular morbidity.

Platelets and monocytes isolated from healthy subjects (HS, n = 15) were stimulated with TRAP-6 and LPS to release MVs that were added to human vascular endothelial cell (hECV) culture to evaluate superoxide anion production, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF, NF-B mRNA expression), and hECV adhesiveness. The effects of the MVs-induced from HS were compared to those induced by MVs spontaneously released from cells of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, n = 7). MVs released by HS-activated cells triggered a threefold increase in oxidative burst in a concentration-dependent manner. Only MVs released from monocytes doubled IL-6, TNF, and NF-B mRNA expression and monocyte-endothelial adhesion. Interestingly, the effects of the MVs isolated from STEMI-monocytes were not superimposable to previous ones except for adhesion to hECV. Conversely, MVs released from STEMI-platelets sustained both redox state and inflammatory phenotype. These data provide evidence that MVs released from activated and/or pathologic platelets and monocytes differently affect endothelial behavior, highlighting platelet-MVs as causative factors of impaired endothelial function in the acute phase of STEMI.","output":"Different Contribution of Monocyte- and Platelet-Derived Microvesicles to Endothelial Behavior"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O objetivo deste trabalho  propor sugest?es prticas para a atuao no atendimento  populao em situao de rua diante da pandemia da COVID-19 no Brasil Com base numa pesquisa qualitativa contendo entrevistas com profissionais da rea, anlise de informaes levantadas num portal de notcias de amplitude nacional e levantamento de artigos, relatrios de pesquisa e documentos informativos de outros pases, sugerimos algumas estratgias que podem contribuir para a atuao da gest?o municipal, sobretudo no ambito da assistncia social e nos equipamentos de assistncia s pessoas em situao de rua no Brasil Nossos resultados s?o parciais, embora incluam um panorama comparativo que permite inclus?o de estratgias, ao que parece, ainda n?o implementadas no pas Destacamos tambm algumas quest?es que precisam ser repensadas pelos governos federal, estadual e municipal diante da urgncia da implementao de polticas durante a pandemia da COVID-19 Alternate abstract: The objective of this work is to propose practical strategies to support the homeless population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil It adopts qualitative research, based on interviews with professionals in the field, analysis of information collected on a national news online portal, and analysis of articles, research reports and information documents from other countries The findings allow suggesting strategies for local governments, particularly regarding social assistance and equipment to support homeless people in Brazil The results, although partial, include a comparative panorama that allows strategies that are unprecedented in Brazil We also highlight some issues that need to be considered by the federal, state, and local governments in view of the urgency posed by the COVID-19 pandemic Alternate abstract: El objetivo de este trabajo es proponer sugerencias prcticas para actuar en la asistencia a la poblacin sin hogar que frente a la pandemia de COVID-19 en Brasil Con base en una investigacin cualitativa que contiene entrevistas con profesionales del rea;anlisis de informacin extrada de un portal nacional de noticias;y recopilacin de artculos, informes de investigacin y documentos de informacin de otros pases;sugerimos algunas estrategias que pueden contribuir al desempe?o de la gestin municipal, especialmente en el mbito de la asistencia social y en el equipamiento de asistencia para las personas que viven en las calles en Brasil Nuestros resultados son parciales, aunque incluyan un panorama comparativo que permite la inclusin de estrategias que, al parecer, an no se han implementado en Brasil Tambin destacamos algunos problemas que los gobiernos federales, estatales y municipales deben repensar en vista de la urgencia de implementar polticas durante la pandemia de COVID-19","output":"Populao em situao de rua e COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Pandemic outbreaks necessitate effective responses to rapidly mitigate and control the spread of disease and eliminate the causative organism(s). While conventional chemical and biological solutions to these challenges are characteristically slow to develop and reach public availability; recent advances in device components operating at Super High Frequency (SHF) bands (3-30 GHz) of the electromagnetic spectrum enable novel approaches to such problems. METHODS: Based on experimentally documented evidence, a clinically relevant in situ radiation procedure to reduce viral loads in patients is devised and presented. Adapted to the currently available medical device technology to cause viral membrane fracture, this procedure selectively inactivates virus particles by forced oscillations arising from Structure Resonant Energy Transfer (SRET) thereby reducing infectivity and disease progression. RESULTS: Effective resonant frequencies for pleiomorphic Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is calculated to be in the 10-17 GHz range. Using the relation y = -3.308x + 42.9 with x and y representing log10 number of virus particles and the clinical throat swab Ct value respectively; in situ patient-specific exposure duration of ~15x minutes can be utilized to inactivate up to 100% of virus particles in the throat-lung lining, using an irradiation dose of 14.5  1 W/m2; which is within the 200 W/m2 safety standard stipulated by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

In this work, we developed a predictive model that can estimate the expected period that the virus can be stopped and the risk of the second rebound of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we have considered the SARIMA model to predict the spread of the virus on several selected countries and used it for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle and its end. The study can be applied to predict the same for other countries as the nature of the virus is the same everywhere. The proposed model investigates the statistical estimation of the slowdown period of the pandemic which is extracted based on the concept of normal distribution.

Improving public knowledge of COVID-19 is critical to controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to determine China's public knowledge of COVID-19 and the attitudes towards control measures. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted over 48 h from 22:30 29 February 2020 to 22:30 2 March 2020 based on a self-administered web-based questionnaire. The survey was conducted on the WeChat network. Exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling was applied. The questionnaire was voluntarily completed by WeChat users. The questionnaire covered basic demographic information, public knowledge of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, psychological state, and attitudes towards the overall control measures. The primary outcome was the China's public knowledge of COVID-19 and the attitudes towards control measures and secondary outcome was the psychological state of the public during this pandemic. RESULTS: The study included 10,905 participants and 10,399 valid questionnaires were included for analysis. Participants with tertiary education, younger participants and healthcare workers had better overall knowledge than other participants (all P < 0.05). Approximately 91.9% of the participants believed in person-to-person transmission and 39.1% believed in animal-to-person transmission. No significant correlation between anxiety and the number of regional existing confirmed cases was found, while participants in Hubei were more anxious than those in other regions. In general, 74.1% of the participants acknowledged the effectiveness of the overall control measures, and the percentage of participants with agreement with the overall control measures was negatively correlated with the number of regional existing confirmed cases (r = - 0.492, P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the survey revealed that the Chinese public had overall good knowledge of COVID-19 except for those indeterminate knowledges.

METHODS: Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 and 8 June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10,659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies.

The experimental layout was a split plot in three replicates; the five rice cultivars (Skaha 101, Giza178, Yasmeen, Fourate, and Amber 33) were distributed in the main plots while the four foliar applications of Zn (1,500, 2,000, 2,500 mg/L besides spray water) were occupied the sub-plots. The findings showed significant differences among the five rice cultivars regarding plant height, grain yield, straw yield, biological yield, harvest index, 1,000-grain weight, panicle length, protein percentage, and grain Zn content. There is a significant effect of Zn on all plant attributes. A significant interaction between rice cultivars and foliar application of Zn was observed, whereas fertilizing Giza 178 with foliar application of Zn at the rate of 2,500 mg/L achieved the highest mean values of grain yield and straw yield, biological yield, harvest index, 1,000-grain weight, panicle length, protein %, and Zn content followed by Sakha 101 with Zn application at the rate of 2,000 mg/L, respectively, in both seasons.

We conducted a model-based analysis to project long-term health and economic outcomes for birth cohorts with different HPV vaccine exposure, i.e., pre-adolescent vaccination (2000- and 2008-cohorts), multi-age cohort vaccination (1991-cohort) or no vaccination (1985-cohort). We compared the cost-effectiveness of switching current guidelines with clinician-collected HPV testing to HPV self-sampling for these cohorts and considered an additional 44 strategies involving either HPV self-sampling or clinician-collected HPV testing at different screening frequencies for the 2000- and 2008-cohorts. Given Norwegian benchmarks for cost-effectiveness, we considered a strategy with an additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year below $55,000 as cost-effective. HPV self-sampling strategies considerably reduced screening costs (i.e., by 24-40% across cohorts and alternative strategies) and were more cost-effective than clinician-collected HPV testing. For cohorts offered pre-adolescent vaccination, cost-effective strategies involved HPV self-sampling three times (2000-cohort) and twice (2008-cohort) per lifetime.

All practical DFT calculations require an approximation to the unknown exchange-correlation energy, which is then used self-consistently in the Kohn-Sham scheme to produce an approximate energy from an approximate density. Density-corrected DFT is simply the study of the relative contributions to the total energy error. In the vast majority of DFT calculations, the error due to the approximate density is negligible. But with certain classes of functionals applied to certain classes of problems, the density error is sufficiently large as to contribute to the energy noticeably, and its removal leads to much better results. These problems include reaction barriers, torsional barriers involving $\\\\pi$-conjugation, halogen bonds, radicals and anions, most stretched bonds, etc. In all such cases, use of a more accurate density significantly improves performance, and often the simple expedient of using the Hartree-Fock density is enough.

Bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy has recently been demonstrated to be safe and effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Preliminary evidence has suggested that bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy can present increased difficulties in reaching lesional temperatures as compared to unilateral thalamotomy. The authors of this article aimed to study the parameters associated with successful MRgFUS capsulotomy lesioning and to present longitudinal radiographic findings following MRgFUS capsulotomy. METHODS Using data from 22 attempted MRgFUS capsulotomy treatments, the authors investigated the relationship between various sonication parameters and the maximal temperature achieved at the intracranial target. Lesion volume and morphology were analyzed longitudinally using structural and diffusion tensor imaging. A retreatment procedure was attempted in one patient, and their postoperative imaging is presented. RESULTS Skull density ratio (SDR), skull thickness, and angle of incidence were significantly correlated with the maximal temperature achieved. MRgFUS capsulotomy lesions appeared similar to those following MRgFUS thalamotomy, with three concentric zones observed on MRI. Lesion volumes regressed substantially over time following MRgFUS. Fractional anisotropy analysis revealed a disruption in white matter integrity, followed by a gradual return to near-baseline levels concurrent with lesion regression. In the patient who underwent retreatment, successful bilateral lesioning was achieved, and there were no adverse clinical or radiographic events. CONCLUSIONS With the current iteration of MRgFUS technology, skull-related parameters such as SDR, skull thickness, and angle of incidence should be considered when selecting patients suitable for MRgFUS capsulotomy. Lesions appear to follow morphological patterns similar to what is seen following MRgFUS thalamotomy. Retreatment appears to be safe, although additional cases will be necessary to further evaluate the associated safety profile.","output":"Technical and radiographic considerations for magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound capsulotomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The novel 2019 coronavirus outbreak that first appeared in Wuhan has quickly gained global attention, due to its high transmissibility and devastating clinical and economic outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the possible roles of Jordanian pharmacists in minimizing the stage of community transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using Google forms targeting Jordanian pharmacists was conducted during March 2020 and distributed electronically by means of social media. Using the survey tool, we measured the pharmacists' knowledge, the educative activities they perform, and their perceptions regarding undertaking traditional and untraditional roles during the COVID-19 outbreak, as specified by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version-19. RESULTS: Jordanian pharmacists (n = 449) reported performing various educative activities, and in general, they were knowledgeable about various aspects of the COVID-19 disease (median knowledge score: 20 [range, 13-25]), but certain gaps in knowledge were detected that must be addressed. Pharmacists had positive perceptions about both their traditional and untraditional roles specified by the FIP, the median perceptions score was 4 (range, 1-5).

However, gynecological emergencies and malignancies must be addressed despite the restricted resources and the need for protective measures against COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the types of gynecological surgeries performed, difficulties encountered, and their outcomes in the setting of the pandemic. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study over 6 months at a single tertiary center, including 60 women with gynecological complaints, categorized as emergencies and semi-emergencies, who underwent further surgery. Their surgical outcomes were measured through various parameters. Results: We found that 68.3% were emergency cases, while the rest were classified as semi-emergencies. Fibroid and adenomyosis with failed medical management (48.3%), followed by CIN (10%), and malignancies (10%) accounted for the semi-emergency cases, while ruptured ectopic pregnancies (13.3%) and torsion and ovarian cysts (18.4%) comprised the emergency cases. The decision to incision time between emergency and semi-emergency cases varied widely due to the safety prerequisites during the pandemic, ranging from 1 hour in emergency cases to 48 hours in semi-emergency cases. In addition, we studied the ease of preoperative preparation, patient satisfaction, and the average number of personnel available to run the operation theaters at these times.

We observed an OR, CR, and 48-month PFS rates of 87%, 22.6%, and 77%, respectively. Responses with undetectable MRD were observed in 6.2% of all patients and 27% of CR patients. TP53 disruption and B-symptoms revealed a significant and independent impact on PFS. The 48-month cumulative treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events in this patient population was 29.1%. It was significantly higher in male patients, in patients aged 70 years, and in those managed at centers that enrolled less than five patients. In conclusion, the ibrutinib and rituximab combination was an effective front-line treatment for unfit patients with CLL. However, a high rate of treatment discontinuations due to adverse events was observed in this unfit population. ABSTRACT: The GIMEMA group investigated the efficacy, safety, and rates of discontinuations of the ibrutinib and rituximab regimen in previously untreated and unfit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Treatment consisted of ibrutinib, 420 mg daily, and until disease progression, and rituximab (375 mg/sqm, given weekly on week 1C4 of month 1 and day 1 of months 2C6). This study included 146 patients with a median age of 73 years, with IGHV unmutated in 56.9% and TP53 disrupted in 22.2%. The OR, CR, and 48-month PFS rates were 87%, 22.6%, and 77%, respectively. Responses with undetectable MRD were observed in 6.2% of all patients and 27% of CR patients. TP53 disruption (HR 2.47; p = 0.03) and B-symptoms (HR 2.91; p = 0.02) showed a significant and independent impact on PFS. The 48-month cumulative rates of treatment discontinuations due to disease progression (DP) or adverse events (AEs) were 5.6% and 29.1%, respectively. AEs leading more frequently to treatment discontinuation were atrial fibrillation in 8% of patients, infections in 8%, and non-skin cancers in 6%. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were higher in male patients (HR: 0.46; p = 0.05), patients aged 70 years (HR 5.43, p = 0.0017), and were managed at centers that enrolled <5 patients (HR 5.1, p = 0.04). Patients who discontinued ibrutinib due to an AE showed a 24-month next treatment-free survival rate of 63%. In conclusion, ibrutinib and rituximab combination was an effective front-line treatment with sustained disease control in more than half of unfit patients with CLL.

We engineered synthetic plasmid DNA to encode two novel and broadly cross-protective monoclonal antibodies targeting influenza A and B. We utilized enhanced in vivo delivery of these plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) constructs and show that this strategy induces robust levels of functional antibodies directed against influenza A and B viruses in mouse sera.

Furthermore, these two DMAbs can be delivered coordinately resulting in exceptionally broad protection against both influenza A and B.

We find the percent solids and protein content are greatly elevated in COVID-19 compared to heathy control samples and closely resemble levels seen in cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease known for thick, tenacious respiratory secretions. DNA and hyaluronan (HA) are major components of respiratory secretions in COVID-19 and are likewise abundant in cadaveric lung tissues from these patients. COVID-19 secretions exhibit heterogeneous rheological behaviors with thicker samples showing increased sensitivity to DNase and hyaluronidase treatment. In histologic sections from these same patients, we observe increased accumulation of HA and the hyaladherin versican but reduced tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG6) staining, consistent with the inflammatory nature of these secretions. Finally, we observed diminished type I interferon and enhanced inflammatory cytokines in these secretions. Overall, our studies indicate that increases in HA and DNA in COVID-19 respiratory secretion samples correlate with enhanced inflammatory burden and suggest that DNA and HA may be viable therapeutic targets in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Biochemical, Biophysical, and Immunological Characterization of Respiratory Secretions in Severe SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evidence from the US and UK suggests that ethnic minority populations are at an increased risk for developing severe COVID-19, however data from other West-European countries are scarce. METHODS: We analysed data from 1439 patients admitted between February 2020 and January 2021 to four main hospitals in Amsterdam and Almere, the Netherlands. Differences in the risk for hospitalization were assessed by comparing demographics to the general population. Using a population-based cohort as reference, we determined differences in the association between comorbidities and COVID-19 hospitalization. Outcomes following hospitalization were analysed using Cox-regression. RESULTS: The hospitalization risk was higher in all ethnic minority groups than in those of Dutch origin, with age-adjusted odds ratios ranging from 2.2(95%CI, 1.7-2.6) in Moroccans to 4.5(95%CI 3.2-6.0) in Ghanaians. Hypertension and diabetes were similarly associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. For all other comorbidities, we found differential associations.

Providing care to patients in non-conventional spaces is not new, however, experience in safely caring for COVID-19 patients in these settings is lacking. Our aim is to describe the implementation of our MHU and associated outcomes of these COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary clinical and operations team was created to plan, execute and operate a safe environment for COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers within the MHU. Patient selection was restricted to patients with COVID-19 who were clinically recovering from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Ventilation was optimized with air flow directed away from patient areas, velocity reduced to below 0.25 meters per second, and air exchanges of 24-28 per hour. All healthcare workers working in the MHU were offered COVID-19 vaccine and required to complete mandatory education if they declined (vaccination rate of 87% was achieved among dedicated staff). Universal masking and eye protection was used throughout the MHU with designated areas for donning and doffing personal protective equipment. RESULTS: In total, 32 patients with COVID-19 were managed in the MHU between 26 April and 21 May, 2021. Table 1 provides the summary of patient characteristics.

METHODS ARAMIS was first compared with two transanal minimally invasive surgery platforms (SILS Port and GelPOINT Path) on human cadavers. Surgeons with different experience performed running sutures at different distances, at four quadrants, using the three platforms and gave a score to visibility, safety, and maneuverability. ARAMIS was then utilized on patients affected with rectal neoplasia who met the inclusion criteria. Patients and tumor characteristic and results were prospectively collected. The follow-up examinations included proctoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS According to surgeons' scores, ARAMIS improves visibility and safety with respect to other platforms for distances beyond 10 cm. The procedure, which lasted an average of 59 min, was successfully carried out in 14 patients. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported. The mean tumor size was 3 cm; they were located a mean of 11 cm from the anal verge. Complete removal of the lesion was possible in 13/14 patients.

To understand the basis of this aggressive spread, it is essential to determine the transmission rate and define the factors that increase the risk of transmission. One complication is the large fraction of asymptomatic cases, particularly in young populations: these individuals have viral loads indistinguishable from symptomatic people and do transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but they often go undetected. As university students living in residence halls commonly share a small living space with roommates, some schools established regular, high density testing programs to mitigate on-campus spread. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal testing data of residence hall students at the University of Colorado Boulder. We observed that students in single rooms were infected at a lower rate than students in multiple occupancy rooms. However, this was not due to high rates of transmission between roommates, which only occurred approximately 20% of the time. Since these cases were usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, this provides further evidence for asymptomatic transmission. Notably, individuals who likely transmitted to their roommates had an average viral load [~]6.5 times higher than individuals who did not. Although students were moved to separate isolation rooms after diagnosis, there was no difference in time to isolation between these cases with or without transmission. This analysis argues that inter-roommate transmission occurs in a minority of cases in university residence halls and provides strong correlative evidence that viral load can be proportional to the probability of transmission.","output":"Higher viral load drives infrequent SARS-CoV-2 transmission between asymptomatic residence hall roommates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social media influence almost every aspect of our lives by facilitating instant many-to-many communication and self-expression.

Based on participants narratives, our analysis suggested that positive mental health among youth could be influenced by 3 features of social media consumption (connection with friends and their global community, engagement with social media content, and the value of social media as an outlet for expression). Through these, pathways leading to the following 5 positive mental health components were identified: (1) positive relationships and social capital, (2) self-concept, (3) coping, (4) happiness, and (5) other relevant aspects of mental health (for example, positivity and personal growth). CONCLUSIONS: The study results highlight the integral role of social media in the lives of todays youth and indicate that they can offer opportunities for positive influence, personal expression, and social support, thus contributing to positive mental health among youth. The findings of our research can be applied to optimize engagement with youth through social media and enhance the digital modes of mental health promotion.","output":"Social MediaCDriven Routes to Positive Mental Health Among Youth: Qualitative Enquiry and Concept Mapping Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 patients in the critical care unit tend to have prolonged hospital stay requiring high doses of sedation and paralysis to treat acute respiratory distress syndrome, resulting in a shortage of these drugs.

In order to allow students to gain exposure to the field of pathology, make connections with pathologists, and provide opportunities for letters of recommendation, the authors quickly developed a Virtual Anatomic Pathology Elective at the University of Minnesota. We succeeded in developing the foundation of a Virtual Anatomic Pathology Elective that allows for the rotation to be accessible not only to our medical students but also to international medical graduates and medical students from different programs. In 1 month, we were able to create a 4-week elective that was available before the start of the 2021 residency application season. We provided students with the closest possible experience to an in-person Anatomic Pathology Elective by developing an introductory week of lectures and assignments that provided structure for the rotation, introduced the field of anatomic pathology, and demonstrated the role of pathologists in health care. Furthermore, students attended virtual resident lectures and grand rounds, participated in virtual sign-out sessions, and presented an interesting case to the faculty at the end of their rotation. The goal was ultimately to customize the curriculum to students interests by making the rotation applicable to those applying to pathology as well as to other specialties (eg, general surgery, internal medicine, dermatology). Overall, we were able to design and implement a novel Virtual Anatomic Pathology Elective which we know can be effectively reproduced by other medical schools. ?

With the spread of the coronavirus around the world and its epidemic among humans, we are losing many humans. The long process of treatment in hospitalized patients who are receiving intensive care and medication is associated with physical weakness. It has been suggested that lifelong exercise can create a safe margin for a person that allows them to avoid becoming infected with the virus. The current study was conducted to assess the effects of low-intensity exercise and breathing exercises on cardiorespiratory responses and physical status in an overweight 20-year-old woman infected with COVID-19. The patient was referred to Hazrat Ali Ibn Abitaleb Hospital in Rafsanjan. The patient had initial symptoms of coronavirus including weakness, shortness of breath, fever, and chills, and the initial tests confirmed that the person was infected with the coronavirus. Although COVID-19 reduces respiration and blood oxygen and severely reduces movement and physical activity, low-intensity rehabilitation and breathing exercises along with medication can improve blood oxygen status, resting heart rate, blood pressure, and hand power status in patients and possibly speeding up the healing process. The results of the present study show that low-intensity exercise and breathing exercises in patients with COVID-19, whose disease severity is mild to moderate, can be performed safely under the supervision of their physicians to prevent the disease process.","output":"Exercise in an Overweight Patient with Covid-19: A Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"none.","output":"The real time effective reproductive number for COVID-19 in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An LTR-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was modified and optimized for the quantification of total HIV-1 nucleic acids in plasma and PBMC.

We studied the clinical characteristics of survivor and non-survivor COVID-19-infected cancer patients in Pakistan. Patients and Methods: We did a retrospective study of 70 cancer patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore and Peshawar, Pakistan between April 13 and July 09, 2020. These patients were discharged from the hospital or had died by July 09, 2020. Clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors by fisher's exact test and chi-square test. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to explore the risk factors of mortality. Results: Seventy cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled and the majority were males 38 (54.3%). 57 (81.4%) had solid tumors and 13 (18.6%) had hematological malignancies. Dyspnea (44 cases) was the most common symptom (62.9%). Complications were reported in 51 (72.9%) patients during the course of disease. 19 (27.1%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). A significant increase in the C-reactive protein level and neutrophil count was observed in the deceased patients as compared to the surviving patients. D-dimer values of &gt;=0.2 mg/L were significantly associated with mortality (P=0.01). We identified two independent risk factors associated with death, ICU admission (P=0.007) and D-dimer (P=0.003).

However, it is not clear how the chirality of the extracellular microenvironment regulates cell adhesion and cytoskeletal structures and therefore affects gene transfection. In this study, the chirality of focal adhesions and the cytoskeleton of single human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) was controlled by specially designed micropatterns, and its influence on gene transfection was investigated. Micropatterns with different cell adhesion areas and swirling stripe lines were prepared by micropatterning fibronectin on polystyrene surfaces. The chiral micropatterns induced the formation of chiral focal adhesions and chiral cytoskeletal structures. Gene transfection efficiency was enhanced with increasing adhesion area, while hMSCs on left-handed and right-handed swirling micropatterns showed the same level of gene transfection. When the swirling angle was changed from 0, 30, and 60 to 90, the gene transfection efficiency at a swirling angle of 60 was the lowest. The influence of cell chirality on gene transfection was strongly associated with cellular uptake capacity, DNA synthesis and cytoskeletal mechanics.

This study aims to assess the associations between Covid-19 infection and thromboembolism including myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemic stroke, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients and Methods A self-controlled case-series study was conducted covering the whole of Scotlands general population. The study population comprised individuals with confirmed (positive test) Covid-19 and at least one thromboembolic event between March 2018 and October 2020. Their incidence rates during the risk interval (5 days before to 56 days after the positive test) and the control interval (the remaining periods) were compared intra-personally. Results Across Scotland, 1,449 individuals tested positive for Covid-19 and experienced a thromboembolic event. The risk of thromboembolism was significantly elevated over the whole risk period but highest in the 7 days following the positive test (IRR 12.01, 95% CI 9.91-14.56) in all included individuals. The association was also present in individuals not originally hospitalised for Covid-19 (IRR 4.07, 95% CI 2.83-5.85). Risk of MI, stroke, PE and DVT were all significantly higher in the week following a positive test. The risk of PE and DVT was particularly high and remained significantly elevated even 56 days following the test. Conclusion Confirmed Covid-19 infection was associated with early elevations in risk with MI, ischaemic stroke, and substantially stronger and prolonged elevations with DVT and PE both in hospital and community settings.

As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, the Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly analyzed the energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the high structural similarity, the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor is estimated to be -16.35 kcal mol-1 stronger than that of SARS-CoV. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (F486, Y505, N501, Y489, Q493, L455, etc.), which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces arise from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found seven mutational sites (K417, L455, A475, G476, E484, Q498 and V503) on SARS-CoV-2 that unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Interestingly, the E484 site is recognized to be the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface, indicating that from the energy point of view, a mutation of E484 would be beneficial to RBD-ACE2 binding. This is in line with recent findings that it is mutated by lysine (E484K mutation) in the rapidly spreading variants of COVID-19 belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. In addition, this mutation is reported to cause virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Thus, further efforts are required to probe its functional relevance.

Data were prospectively collected via a web-based questionnaire and review of medical records. Data on baseline characteristics were obtained for all patients with COVID-19 to analyze risk factors for hospitalization. Data were also collected on asymptomatic patients and those with COVID-19-like symptoms who tested negative or were not tested. Statistical analyses were limited to confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS: A total of 226 SLE patients were included: 41 with confirmed COVID-19, 19 who tested negative for COVID-19, 42 with COVID-19-like symptoms who did not get tested, and 124 who remained asymptomatic without testing.

Children and young adults with MIS-C typically present with fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally, respiratory symptoms. Myocardial dysfunction (as measured by TTE, elevated troponin, or elevated brain natriuretic peptide [BNP]) has been reported in 51-90% of these patients. Case Report An 18-year-old male without significant medical history was transferred to the Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit with cardiogenic shock after presenting with headache, myalgias, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting. Initial workup revealed hypotension, tachycardia, and positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed severe biventricular failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 26%. Vasopressors were started for blood pressure support. Right heart catheterization (RHC) was consistent with cardiogenic shock. Impella CP percutaneous left ventricular assist device was placed. The patient developed hypoxemia and tachypnea. He was intubated and underwent cannulation for veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO). He was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute anuric renal failure. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed benign myocardium. Vasopressors were weaned and repeat TTE on day 3 revealed LVEF of 34%; subsequent TTE on day 5 showed recovery up to 53%. The Impella device was removed, VA ECMO was decannulated, and the patient was extubated. He improved clinically over the next weeks with normalizing vital signs, inflammatory markers, respiratory status, and renal function. The patient was discharged on day 28, about six weeks after symptom onset. TTE prior to discharge revealed mild LV hypertrophy and normal systolic function.

As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and humanCrobot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels.

More than 90 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 2 million people have died of complications due to COVID-19 worldwide. COVID-19, in its severe form, presents with an uncontrolled, hyperactive immune response and severe immunological injury or organ damage that accounts for morbidity and mortality. Even in the absence of complications, COVID-19 can last for several months with lingering effects of an overactive immune system. Dysregulated myeloid and lymphocyte compartments have been implicated in lung immunopathology. Currently, there are limited clinically-tested treatments of COVID-19 with disparities in the apparent efficacy in patients. Accurate model systems are essential to rapidly evaluate promising discoveries but most currently available in mice, ferrets and hamsters do not recapitulate sustained immunopathology described in COVID19 patients. Here, we present a comprehensively humanized mouse COVID-19 model that faithfully recapitulates the innate and adaptive human immune responses during infection with SARS-CoV-2 by adapting recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-driven gene therapy to deliver human ACE2 to the lungs (1) of MISTRG6 mice. Our unique model allows for the first time the study of chronic disease due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the context of patient-derived antibodies to characterize in real time the potential culprits of the observed human driving immunopathology; most importantly this model provides a live view into the aberrant macrophage response that is thought to be the effector of disease morbidity and ARDS in patients. Application of therapeutics such as patient-derived antibodies and steroids to our model allowed separation of the two aspects of the immune response, infectious viral clearance and immunopathology. Inflammatory cells seeded early in infection drove immune-patholgy later, but this very same early anti-viral response was also crucial to contain infection.","output":"A humanized mouse model of chronic COVID-19 to evaluate disease mechanisms and treatment options"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 was declared a pandemic and confinement with movement restriction measures were applied in Spain. Postnatal mental disorders are common but frequently undiagnosed, being a risk period to develop anxiety and depression symptoms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of confinement as depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women (PrW) and puerperal women (PuW) mental health, as well as obstetric and perinatal outcomes during this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS The self-administered survey consists of a total of 28 questions, the first 16 providing contextual information and the following ones corresponding to the GHQ-12 that has been evaluated in a binomial form. A logistic regression model has been used to assess whether the contextual variables acted as a protective or risk factor and its fitting has been represented by a receiver operating curve. RESULTS Of the 754 PrW interviewed, 58.22% were screened positive. Confinement time for these was 54.93  9.75 days. The risk factors that were identified after the refinement have been to have a worse general state of health, to be sadder and to be more nervous. Among the protectors have been found to have a higher Apgar 10 score and induction of labor. The area under the adjusted regression adjustment curve was 0.8056. CONCLUSIONS Our results show a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms with strict confinement measures. PrW and PuW must be considered a risk group to develop mental health disorders during disruption circumstances. Using a mental health screening tool could help to identify a group of patients with more risk and to carry out a careful monitoring to allow adequate management.","output":"GESTACOVID project: psychological and perinatal effects in Spanish pregnant women subjected to confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Every country has vulnerable populations that require special attention from policymakers in their response to a pandemic. This is because those populations may have specific characteristics, culture and behaviours that can accelerate the spread of the virus, and they usually have less access to healthcare, particularly in times of crisis. In order to carry out a comprehensive national intervention plan, policy makers should be sensitive to the needs and lifestyles of these groups, while taking into account structural and cultural gaps.In the context of Israel, the two most prominent and well-defined minority groups are the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community and parts of the Arab population. The government was slow to recognize the unique position of these two groups, public pressure eventually led to a response that was tailored to the ultra-Orthodox community and during the month of Ramadan a similar response has been implemented among the Arab community.","output":"Israel's response to the COVID-19 pandemic: tailoring measures for vulnerable cultural minority populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: As a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, institutions needed innovative solutions to provide care. With implementation of telehealth, a cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacist was able to incorporate a virtual medication tour during appointments. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to describe the uptake and impact of pharmacist-led virtual medication tours during telehealth visits in the CF clinic setting. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a CF pharmacist participated in in-person multidisciplinary team visits to complete medication history reconciliation, assess adherence, assess efficacy and address possible adverse effects of medications, and work collaboratively with the CF care team and patient to create therapeutic plans. The virtual medication tour described in this study was completed in addition or as a complement to these pre-existing pharmacist roles and responsibilities. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Patients seen via telehealth visit were asked to provide a virtual tour of their medications. A pharmacist completed medication history and evaluated whether storage conditions were appropriate in regard to temperature, humidity, light exposure, and accessibility to children. EVALUATION METHODS: A pharmacist recorded findings from the virtual medication tours and made interventions when appropriate. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Of 20 patients seen via telehealth for a quarterly visit during the first 3 months after implementation, 13 were willing to participate in a virtual medication tour. Before the visit, 25% had information missing from their medication list. Virtual medication tour allowed for resolution of this information 80% of the time. Three of the 4 participating patients with a child under 12 years old had medications stored in a location accessible to children. CONCLUSION: A virtual medication tour led by a pharmacist can be successfully incorporated into telehealth visits and was accepted by a majority of patients. Most patients stored medications appropriately but might benefit from education on poison prevention practices.","output":"Virtual medication tours with a pharmacist as part of a cystic fibrosis telehealth visit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is commonly treated with chest tube insertion, which requires hospitalization. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy, costs, and benefits of a portable small-bore chest tube (Thoracic Egg; Sumitomo Bakelite Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) compared with a conventional chest tube. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients who underwent treatment at Gangnam Severance Hospital between August 2014 and May 2018. Results A total of 279 patients were divided into 2 groups: the conventional group (n=236) and the Thoracic Egg group (n=43). Of the 236 patients in the conventional group, 100 were excluded because they underwent surgery during the study period. The efficacy and cost were compared between the 2 groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding recurrence (conventional group, 36 patients [26.5%]; Thoracic Egg group, 15 patients [29.4%]; p=0.287). However, the Egg group had statistically significantly lower mean medical expenses than the conventional group (433,413 Korean won and 522,146 Korean won, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion Although portable small-bore chest tubes may not be significantly more efficacious than conventional chest tubes, their use is significantly less expensive. We believe that the Thoracic Egg catheter could be a less costly alternative to conventional chest tube insertion.","output":"Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness of Portable Small-Bore Chest Tube (Thoracic Egg Catheter) in Spontaneous Pneumothorax."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini menggunakan pendekatan fenomenologi dan bertujuan untuk memahami pengalaman perawat di ruang intensif yang rentan mengalami distres psikologis dan bagaimana mereka memaknai pengalamannya.

Technologies such as Internet of Skills and Industry 4.0 will become stable and viable, as a direct consequence of networks that offer sustained and reliable mobile performance levels. The primary challenges for future technologies are not just low-latency and high-bandwidth. The more critical problem Mobile Service Providers (MSPs) will face will be in balancing the inflated demands of network connections and customers' trust in the network service, that is, being able to interconnect billions of unique devices while adhering to the agreed terms of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To meet these targets, it is self-evident that MSPs cannot operate in a solitary environment. They must enable cooperation among themselves in a manner that ensures trust, both between themselves as well as with customers. In this study, we present the BEAT (Blockchain-Enabled Accountable and Transparent) Infrastructure Sharing architecture. BEAT exploits the inherent properties of permissioned type of distributed ledger technology (i.e., permissioned distributed ledgers) to deliver on accountability and transparency metrics whenever infrastructure needs to be shared between providers. We also propose a lightweight method that enables device-level accountability. BEAT has been designed to be deployable directly as only minor software upgrades to network devices such as routers. Our simulations on a resource-limited device show that BEAT adds only a few seconds of overhead processing time -- with the latest state-of-the-art network devices, we can reasonably anticipate much lower overheads.","output":"BEAT: Blockchain-Enabled Accountable and Transparent Infrastructure Sharing in 6G and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThe purpose of the present study is to examine the general and travel-specific job exhaustion of international business travelers (IBTs).

The data (N = 569), collected in 2015, were analyzed with path models.FindingsThe results suggest that a higher number of international business travel days is related to a higher level of job exhaustion, especially the exhaustion related to international business travel. Moreover, a high-quality LMX was found to be linked to lower levels of both types of exhaustion. Interestingly, for those IBTs' with a low-quality LMX, even a high number of long-haul international business travel days was not connected with IBTExhOriginality/valueThe contribution of our study is threefold. First, this study contributes to JD-R theory and the ill-health process by focusing on a job-specific well-being indicator, IBTExh, in addition to general exhaustion. Second, specific job demands related to international business travel, particularly the duration of business travel spent in short-haul and long-haul destinations, contributes to the literature on global mobility. This study sheds light on the potential effects on IBTs of different types of business travel.

We analyze the municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality rate (MR) of in Mexico. METHODS: We retrieved information from cumulative confirmed symptomatic cases and deaths from COVID-19 as of June 20, 2020, and data from most recent census and surveys of Mexico. A negative binomial regression model was adjusted, the dependent variable was the number of COVID-19 deaths, and the independent variables were the quintiles of the distribution of sociodemographic and health characteristics among the 2457 municipalities of Mexico. RESULTS: Factors associated with high MRs from COVID-19, relative to quintile 1, were diabetes and obesity prevalence, diabetes mortality rate, indigenous population, economically active population, density of economic units that operate essential activities, and population density. Among factors inversely associated with lower MRs from COVID-19 were high hypertension prevalence and houses without sewage drainage. We identified 1351 municipalities without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had high and 82 very high expected COVID-19 mortality (mean = 8 and 13.8 deaths per 100,000, respectively).

DESIGN: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods including focus group discussions, interviews, and surveys were conducted with Somali community members and expert advisors to design the educational content. Co-design approaches with community input were employed in a phased approach to develop the VR storyline. PARTICIPANTS: 60 adult Somali refugees and seven expert advisors who specialise in healthcare, autism research, technology development and community engagement. SETTING: Somali refugees participated at the offices of a community-based organisation, Somali Family Service, in San Diego, California and online. Expert advisors responded to surveys virtually. RESULTS: We find that a CBPR approach can be effectively used for the co-design of a VR educational programme. Additionally, cultural and linguistic sensitivities can be incorporated within a VR educational programme and are essential factors for effective community engagement. Finally, effective VR utilisation requires flexibility so that it can be used among community members with varying levels of health and technology literacy. CONCLUSION: We describe using community co-design to create a culturally and linguistically sensitive VR experience promoting vaccination within a refugee community. Our approach to VR development incorporated community members at each step of the process.

A total of 18 noninstitutionalized older adults(78.4  6.0 y.), members of the Spanish cohort of the EXERNET-Elder 3.0 project, participated in the study. They were recommended to perform an exercise prescription based on resistance, balance, and aerobic exercises during the pandemic. Wrist triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph GT9X) were used to assess the percentage of sedentary time, physical activity, sedentary bouts and breaks of sedentary time. An ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analyse the differences between the three different periods. During home quarantine, older adults spent more time in sedentary behaviours (71.6  5.3%) in comparison with either the situation prior to the pandemic (65.5  6.7%) or the ending of isolation (67.7  7.1%) (all p < 0.05). Moreover, participants performed less bouts of physical activity and with a shorter duration during home quarantine (both p < 0.05). Additionally, no differences in the physical activity behaviours were found between the situation prior to the pandemic and the phase-0 of deescalation.

Adequate views to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to occupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends, designers may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside with an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants. To better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design feedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to capture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research remains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use early-design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be advantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation, plan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper, hence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with 590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to predict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an existing view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that the new prediction is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework. Further, the prediction performance was generally high for most responses, verifying the reliability.

To perform an interim analysis of epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 related to contacts and secondary cases of infection in the Russian Federation. Materials and methods. We analyzed 190,856 primary COVID-19 cases and 146,996 people who had been in contact with them. We used some data of monitoring performed by the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing in JanuaryCJune 2020. We characterized the foci of infection and people who had contacts with primary COVID-19 cases and secondary cases of infection. Results. Just over half (50.02%) of study participants who had contacts with COVID-19 contacted with primary patients with mild disease, whereas 45.40% of individuals contacted with patients with moderate disease and 4.58% of individuals had contacts with patients with severe disease. Patients with mild COVID-19 interacted with more people, which resulted in a greater number of secondary cases of infection. The highest proportion of both primary COVID-19 patients and people who had contact with COVID- 19 was observed in the age group of 41C64 years (44.42% and 44.51%, respectively). Approximately one third of COVID-19 patients and people who had contact with COVID-19 were 18 to 40 years old (30.20% and 34.21% respectively). The proportions of children aged 0C6 years and 7C17 years among COVID-19 patients were 2.70% and 4.02%, respectively;the same proportions among those who had contact with COVID-19 cases were 1.94 and 3.13%, respectively. Household contacts were the most common ways of COVID-19 transmission in all age groups. Patients aged between 40 and 64 years played the most significant role in the transmission of this infection in different foci. Individuals from this age group comprised 42.02% of patients infected in social institutions, 43.40% of those who had household contacts, and 47.70% of those infected at work. Conclusion. Patients with mild and moderate disease aged 18 to 64 years had the highest number of contacts and, therefore, caused the highest number of secondary cases of infection.

We are iteratively developing Active Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older adults with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility; acceptability; and signs of improvement in emotional, physical, and cognitive functions when delivered in person to older adults. OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AB-F versus a time- and dose-matched educational control (health enhancement program [HEP]) in older adults with CP and CD. Here, we describe virtual adaptions to our study protocol, manualized treatments, evaluation plan, and study design in response to feedback from former participants and COVID-19. We will evaluate the feasibility benchmarks and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and cognitive functions. METHODS: This is a single-blind pilot RCT. Participants are randomized to AB-F or HEP. Patients are recruited through pain clinic referrals, institutional registries, and flyers. Interested participants are screened for eligibility via telephone and provide electronic informed consent. After randomization, participants are mailed all study documents, including their treatment manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate envelope for AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via Zoom. Participants complete self-report and performance-based (6-min walk test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) outcome measures via Zoom at baseline and post intervention. Primary outcomes are a priori set feasibility (recruitment, quantitative measures, and adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional functions as well as intervention targets (social function, pain intensity, pain-specific coping, and mindfulness). RESULTS: The trial is ongoing. We have recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F and 11 HEP) across 2 rounds. Only 2 participants have withdrawn (1 before baseline and 1 before the first session). All 19 remaining participants have completed the baseline assessment. In the first round, attendance is high (11 out of 12 participants completed all 4 sessions so far), and AB-F participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step goals (5 out of 6 participants). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our completely virtual AB-F intervention. However, these findings need to be confirmed at the trial conclusion. This study will answer important questions about the feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body activity program to older adults with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Details on integrating multiple digital platforms for virtual assessments and intervention delivery will inform treatment development for older adults and those with comorbid CP and CD, which is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It has been observed that various coagulation abnormalities are not infrequent in COVID-19. Bleeding and coagulation abnormalities have surfaced as one of the mechanisms that could be related to increased mortality associated with it. Through our work, we look forward to discovering more on this association & we believe our study could provide new insight that could save additional lives. AIMS & OBJECTIVES - To study coagulation abnormalities in Covid-19 Positive patients. - To correlate these coagulation abnormalities with severity of disease and outcome of Covid-19 Positive patients. Material & Methods:This is a prospective study being carried out on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitted Covid 19 positive patients, in a tertiary care hospital. Fifty cases have been studied so far, to look for coagulation abnormalities. Covid 19 positive patients by RNA detection by RT PCR method, admitted in ICU of hospital have been investigated for Prothrombin Time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), Thrombin Time (TT), Fibrinogen levels and D-Dimer levels.The results of these investigations were correlated with clinical condition of these ICU patients, to assess the prognosisand outcome, of Covid-19 Positive patients. Results: Fifty COVID positive patients admitted in ICU have been studied & out of these 19 patients eventually expired (Non-survivors group) and 31 recovered from their illness (Survivors group). These fifty patients were investigated,at the time of presentation in ICU. Prothrombin time (PT)was prolonged in Covid 19 positive patients. Prothrombin time (PT) values in theSurvivors group ranged from 13.47 to 15.36 seconds(Mean 14.42 seconds). Prothrombin time (PT) values in theNon-survivors group ranged from 13.63 to 15.43 seconds (Mean 14.53 seconds).Normal control of Prothrombin time (PT) was 13 seconds. Prothrombin time (PT) values in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.865(statistically not significant). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)values in theSurvivors group ranged from 33.44 to 36.38 seconds(Mean 34.91 seconds). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values in theNon-survivors group ranged from 33.68 to 38.32 seconds(Mean 36.00 seconds). Normal control of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 34 seconds. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.397(statistically not significant). Thrombin time (TT)values in theSurvivors group ranged from 17.61 to 19.81 seconds(Mean 18.71 seconds). Thrombin time (TT) values in theNon-survivors group ranged from 18.68 to 22.32 seconds(Mean 20.50 seconds). Normal control of thrombin time (TT) was 18 seconds. Thrombin time (TT) values in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.072(statistically not significant). Fibrinogen levelsin theSurvivors group ranged from 378 mgm/dl to 441mgm/dl(Mean 410mgm/dl). Fibrinogen levels in theNon-survivors group ranged from 331 mgm/dl to 419mgm/dl(Mean 375mgm/dl). Normal values for fibrinogen levels were 150 to 450 mgm/dl. Fibrinogen levels in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.184(statistically not significant). D-Dimer levelswere increased in Covid 19 positive patients. D-Dimer levels in theSurvivors group ranged from 854 ngm/ml to 1847ngm/ml(Mean 1401ngm/ml). D-Dimer levels in theNon-survivors group ranged from 1308 ngm/ml to 2858 ngm/ml(Mean 2083ngm/ml). Normal values for D-Dimer levels were 135 to 250 ngm/ml. D-Dimer levels in the Survivors group were compared with Non-survivors group with ap value = 0.130(statistically not significant). Conclusion Ours is a small single centre study, however, shows coagulopathies in Covid 19 positive patients. Although, there is a difference between coagulation abnormalities in survivor & non-survivor group of ICU patients but this difference is statistically not significant.

Antibiotics have been widely applied to promote growth and prevent diseases. However, the overuse of antibiotics in animal feed has caused serious environmental and health risks, especially the wide spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which seriously affects animal and human health, food safety, ecosystems, and the sustainable future development of animal protein production. Unfortunately, AMR has already become a worldwide challenge, so international cooperation is becoming more important for combatting it. Chinas efforts and determination to restrict antibiotic usage through law enforcement and effective management are of significance. In this review, we address the pollution problems of antibiotics; in particular, the AMR in water, soil, and plants caused by livestock and poultry manure in China. The negative impact of widespread and intensive use of antibiotics in livestock production is discussed.

A systemic state of stress characterized by low-grade inflammation and pathological formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) usually manifests in obesity. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) is the master regulator of the redox homeostasis and plays a critical role in the resolution of inflammation. Here, we show that the natural isothiocyanate and potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane reverses diet-induced obesity through a predominantly, but not exclusively, NRF2-dependent mechanism that requires a functional leptin receptor signaling and hyperleptinemia. Sulforaphane does not reduce the body weight or food intake of lean mice but induces an anorectic response when coadministered with exogenous leptin. Leptin-deficient Lep(ob/ob) mice and leptin receptor mutant Lepr(db/db) mice display resistance to the weight-reducing effect of sulforaphane, supporting the conclusion that the antiobesity effect of sulforaphane requires functional leptin receptor signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest the skeletal muscle as the most notable site of action of sulforaphane whose peripheral NRF2 action signals to alleviate leptin resistance. Transcriptional profiling of six major metabolically relevant tissues highlights that sulforaphane suppresses fatty acid synthesis while promoting ribosome biogenesis, reducing ROS accumulation, and resolving inflammation, therefore representing a unique transcriptional program that leads to protection from obesity. Our findings argue for clinical evaluation of sulforaphane for weight loss and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.","output":"Sulforaphane reduces obesity by reversing leptin resistance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of complete deficiency of the interferon alpha/beta receptor alpha chain (IFNAR1) in a child with fatal systemic hyperinflammation, apparently provoked by live-attenuated viral vaccination.

This study aims to identify epidemiological and procedure related factors in VHR and their influence on surgical training. Methods: Data from 86 consecutive patients who underwent VHR in 2019 was collected. Moreover, 66 primary ventral hernias and 20 incisional hernias were repaired in open procedures. Linear regression models were made. Results: Primary VHR procedures showed a mean deficit of ?378.17 CHF per case. Incisional hernia repair procedures resulted in a deficit of ?1442.50 CHF per case. The two hernia groups were heterogeneous. For the primary VHR procedures, the surgery time ( = 0.564, p < 0.001) had the greatest influence, followed by the costs of the mesh ( = ?0.215, p < 0.001). The epidemiological factors gender ( = 0.143, p < 0.01) and body mass index (BMI) ( = ?0.087, p = 0.074) were also influential. For incisional hernia procedures a surgeons experience had the most significant influence ( = 0.942, p < 0.001), and the second largest influence was the price of the mesh ( = ?0.500, p < 0.001). The epidemiological factor BMI ( = ?0.590, p < 0.001), gender ( = ?0.113, p = 0.055) and age ( = ?0.026, p < 0.050) also had a significant influence. Conclusion: Our analysis shows a way of improving financial results in the field of ventral hernia repair. Costs can be visualized and reduced to optimize revenue enhancement in surgical departments. In our analysis primary ventral hernias are an appropriate training operation, in which the experience of the surgeon has no significant impact on costs. In primary VHR procedures, revenue enhancement is limited when using an expensive mesh. However, the treatment of incisional hernias is recommended by specialists. The financial burden is significantly higher with less experience. Therefore, these operations are not suitable for surgical training. The re-operation rate decreases with increasing experience of the surgeon. This directly affects the Patient Related Outcome (PROM) and quality of treatment. Therefore, high-quality training must be enforced. Since financial pressure on hospitals is increasing further, it is crucial to investigate cost influencing factors. The majority of Swiss public hospitals will no longer be able to operate ventral hernias profitably without new concepts. In addition to purchasing management, new construction projects, and mergers, improving the results of individual departments is a key factor in maintaining the profitability of hospitals in the future regarding hernia repair without losing the scope of teaching procedures.","output":"Analysis of Factors Relevant to Revenue Improvement in Ventral Hernia Repair, Their Influence on Surgical Training, and Development of Predictive Models: An Economic Evaluation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives of this review is to evaluate the role of cytochrome P450 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 infected patients with pre-existing OA on corticosteroids.

METHODS: As a proxy for home or in-lab testing, validation of a symptom-based measure of OSA risk is presented, based on an on-going larger prospective study of 156 family medicine patients with OSA (88 women, 68 men; mean age 57) and 60 Control participants (36 women, 24 men; mean age 54) recruited from the community. Participants completed the Sleep Symptom Checklist (SSC) as well as a range of other self-report measures; primary care patients also underwent a polysomnographic sleep study. RESULTS: Results show (a) that individuals with OSA reported more symptoms on the SSC related to Insomnia, Daytime Symptoms, Sleep Disorders and Psychological Maladjustment than the Control group (all p<.001), and (b) that their sleep-related symptoms were significantly more severe than those of Controls. In addition, (c) several PSG indices in recently diagnosed, untreated individuals with OSA were significantly correlated with SSC measured Sleep Disorder symptoms, and (d) SSC scores significantly distinguished OSA participants from Controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that family practitioners can effectively pre-screen patients for possible OSA by inquiring about 5 items that form the SSC Sleep Disorders subscale. If OSA is suspected, there are a range of behavioral techniques which we recommend to improve symptoms. The current pandemic causes us to reflect that provisional targeting of symptoms and guidance as to mitigation strategies while waiting for specialist care could serve patients well at any time.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstructive sleep apnea: recommendations for symptom management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the start of the UK coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, this rare point prevalence study revealed that one-third of patients (15 of 45) in a London inpatient rehabilitation unit were found to be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but asymptomatic.

OBJECTIVE: We present some remarkable imaging findings of the first two patients identified in Italy with COVID-19 infection travelling from Wuhan, China. The follow-up with chest X-Rays and CT scans was also included, showing a progressive adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Moderate to severe progression of the lung infiltrates, with increasing percentage of high-density infiltrates sustained by a bilateral and multi-segmental extension of lung opacities, were seen. During the follow-up, apart from pleural effusions, a tubular and enlarged appearance of pulmonary vessels with a sudden caliber reduction was seen, mainly found in the dichotomic tracts, where the center of a new insurgent pulmonary lesion was seen. It could be an early alert radiological sign to predict initial lung deterioration. Another uncommon element was the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy with short-axis oval nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Although only two patients have been studied, these findings are consistent with the radiological pattern described in literature. Finally, the pulmonary vessels enlargement in areas where new lung infiltrates develop in the follow-up CT scan, could describe an early predictor radiological sign of lung impairment.","output":"2019-novel Coronavirus severe adult respiratory distress syndrome in two cases in Italy: An uncommon radiological presentation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salvia species have a cosmopolitan distribution and comprise several well-known plants valuable for pharmaceutical and food industries due to their recognized medicinal, food flavouring, and preservative properties.

Rising temperatures are particularly threatening to wheat production. A detailed overview of morpho-physio-biochemical responses of wheat to HS is critical to identify various tolerance mechanisms and their use in identifying strategies to safeguard wheat production under changing climates. The development of thermotolerant wheat cultivars using conventional or molecular breeding and transgenic approaches is promising. Over the last decade, different omics approaches have revolutionized the way plant breeders and biotechnologists investigate underlying stress tolerance mechanisms and cellular homeostasis. Therefore, developing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data sets and a deeper understanding of HS tolerance mechanisms of different wheat cultivars are needed. The most reliable method to improve plant resilience to HS must include agronomic management strategies, such as the adoption of climate-smart cultivation practices and use of osmoprotectants and cultured soil microbes. However, looking at the complex nature of HS, the adoption of a holistic approach integrating outcomes of breeding, physiological, agronomical, and biotechnological options is required. Our review aims to provide insights concerning morpho-physiological and molecular impacts, tolerance mechanisms, and adaptation strategies of HS in wheat.

METHODS: This observational cohort study used Canadian data from 32 selected hospitals included in a global multisite cohort between Jan. 24 and July 7, 2020. Adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who received care in an intensive care unit (ICU) and a sampling of up to the first 60 patients receiving care on hospital wards were included. We performed descriptive analyses of characteristics, interventions and outcomes. The primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality, with secondary analyses of the length of hospital and ICU stay. RESULTS: Between January and July 2020, among 811 patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19, the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 53-75) years, 495 (61.0%) were men, 46 (5.7%) were health care workers, 9 (1.1%) were pregnant, 26 (3.2%) were younger than 18 years and 9 (1.1%) were younger than 5 years. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 (IQR 3-10) days. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, shortness of breath, cough and malaise. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac, kidney and respiratory disease were the most common comorbidities. Among all patients, 328 received care in an ICU, admitted a median of 0 (IQR 0-1) days after hospital admission. Critically ill patients received treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation (88.8%), renal replacement therapy (14.9%) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.0%); 26.2% died.

Investors will respond to this phenomenon by issuing capital (capital outflow) and investing (capital inflow), which causes the presumption of inflating the price of the asset value of the shares (asset bubbles). This study aims to detect the presence of an asset bubble and to determine the effect of macroeconomic fundamentals on the asset bubble during the global financial crisis in Indonesia. To detect an asset bubble, it can be done by comparing the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The fundamental influence of macroeconomics on asset bubbles is studied using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The results of this study found that in Indonesia there was a small asset bubble from September to December 2010. In the short term, interest rates have a significant positive effect on the asset bubble, while in the long run all fundamental variables of exchange rates and interest rates have a positive effect, while inflation has a significant negative effect. Efforts to overcome this phenomenon can be controlled by reducing interest rates in the short term, while in the long run, increasing inflation and exchange rate depreciation can be controlled by decreasing the exchange rate. ? 2021, Academy of Strategic Management Journal.

The mechanism of CVD graphene growth is governed by interactions in both the gas phase and at the surface. Here we present a simulation of the CVD graphene growth mechanism which includes thermodynamics, gas phase kinetics and the surface reaction in a sequential manner. The thermodynamic simulation shows that the deposition driving force is the greatest for high carbon to hydrogen ratios and reaches a maximum at around 850 C. No graphene growth is observed below this temperature. The surface kinetic model also shows that below this temperature, the carbon surface concentration is less than the solubility limit, thus no film can grow. The effect of the reaction chamber geometry on the product concentrations was clear from the gas phase decomposition reactions. The gas residence times studied here (around 0.07 s) show that the optimum gas phase composition is far from that expected at thermodynamic equilibrium. The surface kinetics of CH4 reactions on Ni, Cu and Cu-Ni surfaces shows good agreement with the experimental results for different growth pressures (0.1 to 0.7 mbar), temperatures (600 to 1200 C) and different Ni thicknesses (25-500 m). Also, the model works well when substrates with various C solubilities are used. The thermodynamic and kinetic models described here can be used for the design of improved reactors to optimise the production of graphene with differing qualities, either single or multi-layer and sizes. More importantly, the transfer to a continuous process with a moving substrate should also be possible using the model if it is extended from 2D to 3D.","output":"Chemical vapour deposition of graphene on copper-nickel alloys: the simulation of a thermodynamic and kinetic approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, a questionnaire was conducted among foreigners living in the Czech Republic focused on gambling, in which 110 respondents from Vietnam and 80 respondents from Ukraine answered.

However, the functional role of antibody\\\\dependent immune response against antigens present in the damaged vessel remains unresolved. We hypothesized that engagement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptors (FcR) by immune complexes (IC) in the aortic wall contributes to AAA development. We therefore evaluated FcR expression in AAA lesions and analysed whether inhibition of FcR signaling molecules (é\\\\chain and Syk kinase) influences AAA formation in mice. METHODS: FcR gene/protein expression was assessed in human and mouse AAA tissues. Experimental AAA was induced by aortic elastase perfusion in wild\\\\type (WT) mice and é\\\\chain knockout (KO) mice (devoid of activating FcR) in combination with macrophage adoptive transfer or Syk inhibitor treatment. To verify the mechanisms of FcR in vitro, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and macrophages were stimulated with IgG IC. RESULTS: FcR overexpression was detected in adventitia and media layers of human and mouse AAA. Elastase\\\\perfused KO mice exhibited a decrease in AAA incidence, aortic dilation, elastin degradation, and VSMC loss. This was associated with (1) reduced infiltrating leukocytes and immune deposits in AAA lesions, (2) inflammatory genes and metalloproteinases downregulation, (3) redox balance restoration, and (4) converse phenotype of anti\\\\inflammatory macrophage M2 and contractile VSMC. Adoptive transfer of FcR\\\\expressing macrophages aggravated aneurysm in KO mice.

METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients who were operated in our department during two periods: 1 April to 31 October 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) and 1 April to 31 October 2020 (COVID-19 period). The perioperative clinical outcomes and productivity of our department for the two time periods were compared. RESULTS In the pre-COVID-19 period, 130 operations were carried out, whereas in the COVID-19 group, this reduced to 89. The baseline characteristics between the two groups did not significantly differ. Parathyroid operations decreased significantly by 68% between the two study periods. Overall, during the COVID-19 phase, the department maintained 68% of its operating workload compared with the respective 2019 time period. The clinical outcomes for the patients who had a thyroid/parathyroid/adrenal operation were not statistically different for the two study periods. There were no COVID-19 related perioperative complications for any of the operated patients and no patient tested positive for COVID-19 while an inpatient. For the COVID-19 group, the department maintained 67% of its outpatient appointments for endocrine surgery and 26% for general surgery pathologies. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the clinical activity of our department. However, it is possible to continue providing clinical services for urgent/cancer cases with the appropriate safety measures in place.","output":"Safe provision of elective endocrine surgery operations amid the COVID-19 crisis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The notorious COVID 19 pandemic has caused rapid and drastic changes in cancer care worldwide in 2020. This online survey aims to assess the extent to which the pandemic has affected cancer care in gynecological oncology amongst members of the Association of Gynecological Oncologists of India (AGOI), a registered professional society founded in 1991. METHODS: We developed and administered a cross-sectional, flash survey to members of AGOI in the first week of April 2020. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel 2016. Results were expressed as percentages of total responses excluding blank or unattended response. Overall theme-specific responses were described as a spectrum of findings, and related inferences were drawn. RESULTS: Among approached practitioners, 90 responded to the survey, more than 80% were practicing consultants, and more than 50% from academic institutions. The results of the study showed that the ongoing pandemic had severely affected gynecological oncology practice and care amongst all respondents. There were modifications in diagnostic pathways, interventions, and follow-ups across all organ sites. There was a near-unanimous opinion on the use of general safety measures to combat the virus and to use complete PPEs in a high-risk situation. There were mixed responses to alternative educational activities, especially using electronic technology and distant learning methods. There was optimism among respondents with regards to the current situation normalizing in 3C6 months. CONCLUSION: This study documents the pandemic affected scenario of gynecological cancer care and perceptions of Gynecological Oncologists in India. A significant effect on all aspects of cancer care was observed. Technological learning methods, both for patient care and educational activities, were being adopted by many respondents.

The requirement for ubiquitin provides a link between all three pathways. Sorting nexins are a highly conserved and diverse family of membrane-associated proteins that not only traffic proteins throughout the cells but also provide a second common thread between protein homeostasis pathways. In this review, we will discuss the connections between sorting nexins, ubiquitin, and the interconnected roles they play in maintaining protein quality control mechanisms. Underlying their importance, genetic defects in sorting nexins are linked with a variety of human diseases including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, and cancer.

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P < 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P < 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P < 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P < 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on.

However, there are few antiviral drugs that can effectively treat these infections. The standard approach in the development of antiviral drugs involves the identification of a unique viral target, followed by the design of an agent that addresses that target. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent a novel source of potential antiviral drugs. AMPs have been shown to inactivate numerous different enveloped viruses through the disruption of their viral envelopes. However, the clinical development of AMPs as antimicrobial therapeutics has been hampered by a number of factors, especially their enzymatically labile structure as peptides. We have examined the antiviral potential of peptoid mimics of AMPs (sequence-specific N-substituted glycine oligomers). These peptoids have the distinct advantage of being insensitive to proteases, and also exhibit increased bioavailability and stability. Our results demonstrate that several peptoids exhibit potent in vitro antiviral activity against both HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 when incubated prior to infection. In other words, they have a direct effect on the viral structure, which appears to render the viral particles non-infective. Visualization by cryo-EM shows viral envelope disruption similar to what has been observed with AMP activity against other viruses. Furthermore, we observed no cytotoxicity against primary cultures of oral epithelial cells. These results suggest a common or biomimetic mechanism, possibly due to the differences between the phospholipid head group makeup of viral envelopes and host cell membranes, thus underscoring the potential of this class of molecules as safe and effective broad-spectrum antiviral agents. We discuss how and why differing molecular features between 10 peptoid candidates may affect both antiviral activity and selectivity.","output":"Potent Antiviral Activity against HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 by Antimicrobial Peptoids"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article addresses some elements of the work of Giovanni Berlinguer in the field of social medicine, namely the relationship between science and society, on one hand, and bioethics, on the other.

It is expected to improve the results of medical interventions and ensure health gains at a relatively low cost. The major research question: Does the design and implementation of the program meet the expectations? METHODS: We analyze regulatory acts and the literature on the design and the outcomes of the Program. Physicians surveys and interviews are conducted to understand the capacity of primary care providers to meet the requirements of the Program, as well as the link between the early identification of new illnesses and their follow-up management, administration of the program, the barriers to its successful implementation. RESULTS: There is a substantial progress in the coverage of the population and increase in the number of identified illnesses. Some specific instruments of the Program implementation work well, others require more careful design and additional integrative and managerial activities. The capacity of primary care providers does not allow to provide high quality preventive services, as well as to ensure a continuum of preventive and curative work. The pattern of the Program administration facilitates its nation-wide implementation according to the unified rules, but makes it more difficult to account for the local conditions and limits the autonomy of professionals to choose specific population risk groups and a list of services. The interaction of providers in preventive activities is inadequate. CONCLUSION: The expectations of the Program are too high due to the inconsistencies in its design and implementation. The major lesson learnt is that the program like this should meet the capacity of primary care and be designed as a complex of interrelated activities to identify illnesses and provide their follow-up management.

In this experimental study, we examined narrative coherence and social support in relation to trauma resilience. Participants were asked to write about a turning point memory, after which they did the Maastricht Acute Stress Test, our lab analog of a traumatic event. Following, half of the participants received social support, whereas the other half did not. Afterwards, all participants wrote a narrative on the traumatic event. Moment-to-moment fluctuations in psychological and physiological well-being throughout the experiment were investigated with state anxiety questionnaires and cortisol measures. Results showed that narratives of traumatic experiences were less coherent than narratives of turning point memories. However, contrary to our predictions, coherence, and, in particular, thematic coherence, related positively to anxiety levels. Possibly, particular types of thematic coherence are a non-adaptive form of coping, which reflect unfinished attempts at meaning-making and are more similar to continuous rumination than to arriving at a resolution. Furthermore, coherence at baseline could not buffer against the impact of trauma on anxiety levels in this study. Contrary to our hypotheses, social support did not have the intended beneficial effects on coherence, neither on well-being. Multiple explanations as to why our support manipulation remained ineffective are suggested. Remarkably, lower cortisol levels at baseline and after writing about the turning point memory predicted higher coherence in the trauma narratives. This may suggest that the ability to remain calm in difficult situations does relate to the ability to cope adaptively with future difficult experiences. Clinical and social implications of the present findings are discussed, and future research recommendations on the relations between narrative coherence, social support, and trauma resilience are addressed.","output":"Keep Calm and Carry On: The Relations Between Narrative Coherence, Trauma, Social Support, Psychological Well-Being, and Cortisol Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy is feasible, but requires adaptations to established surgical techniques.

RP and non-RP (NRP) patients were grouped according to disease severity, and the characterization at re-admission was analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and plasma antibody levels were measured, and all patients were followed up for at least 14 days, with a cutoff date of March 10, 2020. Results A total of 14.5% of RP patients were detected. These patients were characterized as young and displayed mild and moderate conditions compared to NRP patients while no severe patients were RP. RP patients displayed fewer symptoms but similar plasma antibody levels during their hospitalization compared to NRP patients. Upon hospital readmission, these patients showed no obvious symptoms or disease progression. All 21 close contacts of RP patients were tested negative for viral RNA and showed no suspicious symptoms. Eighteen out of 24 of RNA-negative samples detected by the commercial kit were tested positive for viral RNA using a hyper-sensitive method, suggesting that these patients were potential carriers of the virus after recovery from COVID-19. Conclusions Our results indicated that young patients, with a mild diagnosis of COVID-19 are more likely to display RP status after discharge.

In the present study, the interaction of remdesivir and its nucleoside analog GS-441524 with OATP4C1 was evaluated to provide the detailed information about its renal handling. METHODS: We used HK-2 cells, a proximal tubular cell line derived from normal kidney, to confirm the transport of remdesivir and GS-441524. To assess the involvement of OATP4C1 in handling remdesivir and GS-441524, the uptake study of remdesivir and GS-441524 was performed by using OATP4C1-overexpressing Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells. Moreover, we also evaluated the IC50 and Ki value of remdesivir. RESULTS: The time-dependent remdesivir uptake in HK-2 cells was observed. The results of inhibition study using OATs and OCT2 inhibitors and OATP4C1 knockdown suggested the involvement of renal drug transporter OATP4C1. Remdesivir was taken up by OATP4C1/MDCKII cells. OATP4C1-mediated uptake of remdesivir increased linearly up to 10 min and reached a steady state at 30 min.

Data analysis was done by SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 16.0. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A multivariate linear regression model was constructed to study the correlation between mean dose to the parotid glands and the other variables. All statistical modeling and analysis were done using SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) version 9.4. Results: Of the 45 patients, 25 were male and 20 were female. The majority of the patients had malignancies in the oral cavity (16) and hypopharynx (14). Most of them had Stage III/IV (AJCC v 8) disease (41). There were a 36% decrease in the PTV-high risk (PTV-HR) volume and a 6.05% decrease in the PTV-intermediate risk (PTV-IR) volume CT15. In CT25, the volume decrease in the PTV-HR and the PTV-IR was 47% and 9.06%, respectively. The parotid glands also underwent a reduction in their volume which has been quantified as 21.7% and 20.9% in the ipsilateral and contralateral parotids in CT15 and 36% and 33.6% in CT25, respectively. The D2 (dose received by 2% of the volume) and D98 (dose received by 98% of the volume) of the PTV-IR showed changes of +3.5% and -0.2% in CT15 and + 4.6% and -0.31% in CT25, respectively. The homogeneity index and conformity number of the PTV-IR changes by 0.03 and 0.08 in CT15 and by 0.04 and 0.12 in CT25, respectively. The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid gland increased by 14% in CT15 and 19% in CT25. The mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland increased by 17% in CT15 and 25% in CT25. Conclusion: The dose to the parotid glands increases as a result of the changes that occur during the course of radiation. The changes are significant after 15 fractions of radiation. A replanning at this juncture might be considered to reduce the dose to the parotid glands.","output":"Volume changes during head-and-neck radiotherapy and its impact on the parotid dose - A single-institution observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the trend of research has been focused on the role of hematological indicators in assessing the activities of various diseases. The aim of the present study was to determine the usefulness of such hematological indicators for assessment of the relationship between inflammation and oxidative stress in order to provide new predictive tools for a non-invasive investigation of disease outcome for liver cirrhosis patients. A total of 35 subjects with compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, patients with toxic metabolic cirrhosis due to ethanol consumption; group 2, patients with liver cirrhosis following hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Using hematological data obtained after the complete counting of peripheral blood cells, the monocyte/lymphocyte (MLR), neutrophil/lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte (PLR) ratios as well as systemic immune inflammation biomarkers were determined. The erythrocyte sedimentation ratio (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and biochemical parameters related to liver function were also registered. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyl content (PCARB), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were also investigated in the peripheral blood samples of healthy subjects and liver cirrhosis patients. The results revealed that NLR, MLR and PLR were significantly increased in group 2. PLR was significantly increased in group 1 compared with that noted in the control group. TBARS and PCARB were increased in patients from group 1 compared to patients from group 2 and the control group. However, no difference in TAC was found between the liver cirrhosis groups and the control. We showed that the pro-inflammatory status of liver cirrhosis patients can be easily appreciated by NLR, MLR but not PLR. However, the increase in these ratios was not significantly associated with a decrease in the antioxidant capacity and an augmentation of oxidative stress markers for the patients diagnosed with cirrhosis included in the two groups of study.","output":"Interrelation of inflammation and oxidative stress in liver cirrhosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arrhythmias are a common problem in the critically ill and they can have significant effects on patient outcome.

Antibody analysis is an important procedure for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. We investigated the IgG, IgM, and IgA responses against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 178) in the Al Madinah region, Saudi Arabia, participated in this study. Of the 178 patients, 72 (40%) were categorized as severe, including 50 (69%) males and 22 (31%) females. The remaining106 (60%) patients were categorized as non-severe, including 85 (80%) males and 21 (20%) females. Qualitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used to confirm the diagnosis of each patient. The specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies in patients' sera were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared between case presentations. Results: The current study showed that all severe hospitalized patients presented significantly (p < 0.0001) increased anti-S IgG and IgM antibody accumulation compared with non-severe patients. Additionally, the results also showed that 50% of severe males were positive to anti-S IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, whereas only 40% positivity for all three-antibody isotypes was observed in severe females. The study also showed that 86% of males and 81% of females categorized as severe were positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies but negative for the IgA antibody against the S protein. Conclusion: The humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 proteins commonly results in the production of antibodies against viral proteins. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG class antibodies were detected at significantly higher levels than IgM class antibodies, and both IgG and IgM antibodies were detected at significantly higher levels than the IgA antibody among all patients. The variations of the humoral immune responses among hospitalized patients reflect the association between disease presentations and immunity against the virus. Collectively, these findings afford new insights into the different antibody isotypes in responses to COVID-19 hospitalized patients with dissimilar disease severity.","output":"Humoral immune responses in hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural and man-made disasters lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses annually worldwide.

In this study, a survey was conducted to gain an understanding of veterinary practice and practitioner preparedness for natural and man-made disasters in the United States and Canada, with questions assessing pandemic preparedness. The participants graduated from 28 American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)-accredited veterinary colleges globally and 2 non-accredited veterinary colleges, represent a diverse set of veterinary practice types, and have an average of 26 years' practice experience. Overall, 63.5% of veterinary respondents had experienced a natural disaster, while only 9.6% had experienced a man-made disaster. Approximately 66% report having a practice disaster preparedness plan, while less than 20% of those actively maintain and update the plan. Furthermore, less than 50% of the practices and practitioners were ready to face the challenges of a global pandemic. Approximately 68% reported using some form of communication to educate clients about family and pet disaster readiness.

We consecutively recruited CHB patients with well-controlled viremia (serum HBV-DNA<2,000 IU/ml) receiving antiviral therapy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded. Among 1763 patients, CAGE-B score provided the highest Heagerty's integrated area under the curve (iAUC) (0.820), followed by SAGE-B (0.804), mREACH-B (0.800), CAMD (0.786), mPAGE-B (0.748), and PAGE-B (0.721) scores. CAGE-B score showed a significantly better performance than SAGE-B, CAMD, PAGE-B, and mPAGE-B scores, but was similar to mREACH-B. SAGE-B score also showed significantly better performance than mPAGE-B and PAGE-B, but was similar to CAMD and mREACH-B.

We investigate if CCP transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure increases plasma titres of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n=34) were consented for CCP transfusion and serial blood draws pretransfusion and post-transfusion. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and IgM titres were measured by ELISA serially, and compared with serial plasma titre levels from control patients (n=68). The primary outcome was survival at 30 days, and secondary outcomes were length of ventilator and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes were compared with matched control patients (n=34). Kinetics of antibodies and clinical outcomes were compared using LOess regression and ORs, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to CCP transfusion, 74% of patients were anti-RBD seropositive for IgG (median 1:3200), and 81% were anti-RBD IgM seropositive (median 1:320), while 16% were seronegative. The kinetics of antibody titres in CCP recipients were similar to controls. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS compared with controls.

In this approach, symptom-based QR health codes are issued by public health authorities. The codes do not retrieve the location data of the users; instead, two different colors are displayed to differentiate the health status of individuals. The QR codes are officially regarded as electronic certificates of individuals' health status, and can be used for contact tracing, exposure risk self-triage, self-update of health status, health care appointments, and contact-free psychiatric consultations. This approach can be effectively deployed as a uniform platform interconnecting a variety of responders (eg, individuals, institutions, and public authorities) who are affected by the pandemic, which minimizes the errors of manual operation and the costs of fragmented coordination. At the same time, this approach enhances the promptness, interoperability, credibility, and traceability of containment measures. The proposed approach not only provides a supplemental mechanism for manual control measures but also addresses the partial failures of pandemic management tools in the abovementioned facets. The QR tool has been formally deployed in Fujian, a province located in southeast China that has a population of nearly 40 million people. All individuals aged &#8805;3 years were officially requested to present their QR code during daily public activities, such as when using public transportation systems, working at institutions, and entering or exiting schools.

The extent to which the participants relied exclusively on visual cues was affected by testing time in interaction with age. After a month of reduced access to lipreading, reliance on visual cues (present at test) somewhat lowered for younger and increased for older persons. This implies that adults adapt their speech perception faculty to an altered environmental availability of multimodal cues, and that younger adults do so more efficiently.

To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between gestational PFAS and DNA methylation. OBJECTIVES: We examined associations of gestational PFAS exposure with longitudinal DNA methylation measures at birth and in adolescence using the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003C2006; Cincinnati, Ohio). METHODS: We quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in mothers during pregnancy. We measured DNA methylation in cord blood ([Formula: see text]) and peripheral leukocytes at 12 years of age ([Formula: see text]) using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. We analyzed associations between [Formula: see text] PFAS concentrations and repeated DNA methylation measures using linear regression with generalized estimating equations. We included interaction terms between childrens age and gestational PFAS. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways. We used Project Viva (1999C2002; Boston, Massachusetts) to replicate significant associations. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, 435 cytosineCguanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites were associated with PFAS (false discovery rate, [Formula: see text]).

Finally, white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were included in our models. The AUC of the nomogram model and the simple risk scoring model were 0.854 and 0.842, respectively. The prediction performance of the two models on sepsis is comparable (p = 0.1298). CONCLUSION: This study combining five commonly available inflammatory markers (WBC, CRP, IL-6, PCT and NLR) developed a nomogram model and a simple risk scoring model to predict sepsis in critically ill patients. Although the prediction performance of the two models is comparable, the simple risk scoring model may be simpler and more practical for clinicians to identify potential sepsis in critically ill patients at an early stage and strategize treatments.","output":"Comparison of Two Predictive Models of Sepsis in Critically Ill Patients Based on the Combined Use of Inflammatory Markers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Road transport is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions due to the current dependence on fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline. This situation needs to be changed through the retirement of fossil fuels and the implementation of alternative fuels and vehicles such as biofuels, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles fuelled by hydrogen. Nevertheless, the environmental suitability of alternative fuels is conditioned by how they are produced. Through the case study of Spain, this article prospectively assesses C from a techno-economic and carbon footprint perspectiveC the production technology mix of alternative fuels from 2020 to 2050. The proposed energy systems optimisation model includes a large number of production technologies regarding biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, synthetic diesel/gasoline, and hydrotreated vegetable oil), electricity, and hydrogen. The combined study of these fuels provides a relevant framework to discuss the targets established for the road transport sector with a high level of detail not only regarding fuel type but also technology breakdown. The results show the relevance of second-generation biofuel production technologies in fulfilling the future biofuel demand. Regarding the extra electricity demand associated with the penetration of electric vehicles, the results suggest a key role of wind- and solar-based technologies in meeting such a need. Concerning hydrogen as an option to decarbonise the transport system, even though steam methane reforming is the most mature and cost-competitive production technology, hydrogen production would be satisfied through electrolysis in order to avoid relying on fossil resources as the main feedstock. Overall, this integrated approach to the long-term production technology mix of alternative fuels for road transport is expected to be relevant to a wide range of decision-makers willing to prospectively assess road transport systems from a technology perspective.","output":"Long-term production technology mix of alternative fuels for road transport: A focus on Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Males are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than females.

Hypochloremia has been associated with higher mortality. On the other hand, COVID-19 pandemic continues to be, to date, a threat to public health. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity or chronic kidney disease are particularly vulnerable. There are some studies that show a trend towards a lower serum chloride concentration in patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine if there is a relationship between serum chloride levels at the time of diagnosis and a greater tendency to develop COVID-19 pneumonia in chronic hemodialysis patients. METHOD: Retrospective cohort study. We analyzed the serum chloride, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, neutrophil-lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte (PLR) ratios of 11 chronic hemodialysis patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 TMA PCR test during the second wave of the pandemic in our hospital (August-December 2020). We collected the length of hospital stay, the diagnosis of pneumonia (yes/no) and the final state of the infection (cure or death). The patients were divided into two groups taking the median serum chloride as the cut-off point (1: <97 mEq / L and 2:> 97mEq / L) RESULTS: The mean age was 57  13 years and 36.36% (N = 4) were women. All patients required hospital admission and mean hospitalization time was 19  13 days. 3 patients (27.3%) died. The medians of the parameters were the following: serum chloride 97 mEq / L (IQR 94-99); CRP 29.04 mg / L (IQR 8.53-76.13); NLR 4.13 (IQR 2.67-8.48) and PLR 244.06 (IQR 208.08-320). 81.8% (N = 9) had COVID-19 pneumonia. Group 1 patients (Chloride <97 mEL / L) had a higher incidence of pneumonia (p = 0.049) (Figure 1) and a greater tendency to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (p = 0.029). Despite not reaching statistical significance, there was also a higher mortality in patients with lower chloride levels.

The medical records and radiological CT Features of 236 confirmed COVID-19 patients were reviewed at one public hospital and one respiratory clinic in Quom, from 1 August to 30 September 2020. Results: : Among a total of 236 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 62 were infected with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease and required hospital admission, and 174 were followed up on outpatient bases. A significant difference was verified in the mean age between outpatients and hospitalized groups. The incidences of bilateral lung involvement, consolidation, linear opacities, crazy-paving pattern, air bronchogram sign, and the number of lobe involvement were significantly higher in hospitalized groups. However, only the crazy-paving pattern was significantly associated with an SpO2 level lower than 90%, with clinical sign of cough severity.

The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3'-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3'-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched and located with the template base in the active center, and this may impair proofreading by the viral 3'-exonuclease.

OBJECTIVES: To identify sociodemographic characteristics of patients with pain obtaining care through video, telephone, and in-person visits as social distancing restrictions evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using our institutional clinical data warehouse, we identified 3314 patients with pain receiving care at a large academic institution in New York City during a baseline period (September 23, 2019CMarch 22, 2020) and counted telephone, video, and in-person visits during the following conditions: a shutdown period (March 23, 2020CMay 23, 2020), when nonessential in-person visits were strictly limited, and a reopening period (May 23, 2020CSeptember 23, 2020), when restrictions were relaxed and in-person visits were available. Patients were categorized into 4 groups based on the technology used to complete a visit: (1) video, (2) telephone, (3) in-person, and (4) no visit. RESULTS: Patients who were older, publicly insured, and identified as Black or Hispanic were overrepresented in the telephone visit group during shutdown and the in-person group during reopening.

Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that 1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and 2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit) and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the 4th tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n=19) and individuals with ASD (n=21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures. Lay Summary We tested the idea that the brains ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals.

About 14% of the sample met the criteria for at least one mental health disorder, but most were not receiving mental health care. During the lockdown, compared with other phases, female students reported worse symptoms in the obsessive-compulsive, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism dimensions. The increasing symptomatology disappeared after the lifting of the lockdown. The results showed no difference in the male groups.

A number of studies have demonstrated that wastewater analysis is an effective approach to understand the prevalence and diversity of enteric viruses in local population. However, a comprehensive analysis of classic and novel HAstVs in sewage is still lacking. In this study, sewage samples were collected monthly from Jinan, China during 2018-2019. Quantification of HAstV genomes was performed by real-time quantitative PCR. Different from previous studies which focused on partial ORF1b or ORF2 gene, complete ORF2 region of HAstV was amplified from sewage concentrates, and amplicons were subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) and genetic analysis. This methodology allowed detection of 18 astroviruses, of which 7 (HAstV-1, -2, -4, -5, VA1, VA2, and VA3) were detected in all sewage samples. A new strain VA6 mapped to the HMO clade was identified in 20.8% of samples, with 82.4%-83.3% nucleotide identities to the closest strain VA5. The viral load of classic, MLB and VA clades in sewage samples ranged from 3.7  104 to 4.6  107, 3.4  104 to 3.9  106, and 3.3  104 to 4.1  106 copies per liter, respectively.

Mortality from rhabdomyolysis is approximately 10%. This study aimed to develop an interpretable and generalizable model for early mortality prediction in RM patients. METHOD Retrospective analyses were performed on two electronic medical record databases: the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC- III) database. We extracted data from the first 24h after patient ICU admission. Data from the two datasets were merged for further analysis. The merged datasets were randomly divided, with 70% used for training and 30% for validation. We used the machine learning model XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with the Shapley additive explanation method to conduct early and interpretable predictions of patient mortality. Five typical evaluation indexes were adopted to develop a generalizable model. RESULTS In total, 938 patients with RM were eligible for this analysis. The AUC of the XGBoost model in predicting hospital mortality was 0.871, the sensitivity was 0.885, the specificity was 0.816, the accuracy was 0.915 and the F1 score was 0.624.

Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the hosts immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-B/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-B p65, p-IB and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of IB.

As if this weren't enough, Tropical Storm Grace was bearing down on the nation, about to dump biblical amounts of rain on the heels of Tropical Storm Fred. When the Haitian President was assassinated on July 7, Haiti still had not received a single dose of any COVID-19 vaccine-indeed, it was the last country in the Americas to receive vaccines. Later that month, 500,000 doses arrived in the country, donated by the United States via COVAX, the WHO-led initiative to assure at least some vaccines reached low- and middle-income countries. In Haiti, getting those vaccines into the arms of the population is beset by cold chain, distribution and bureaucratic problems, and compounded by widespread vaccine hesitancy; when the earthquake struck, only 14,074 of those doses had been administered.[1,2] Suddenly there was a new, more urgent tragedy, the earthquake leaving thousands of dead, injured and displaced-perhaps hundreds of thousands once the real tally emerges.

As an indication of the heterogeneity of ARDS, there are patients whose syndrome improves rapidly (i.e., within 24 hours), others whose hypoxemia improves gradually and still others whose severe hypoxemia persists for several days. The latter group of patients with persistent severe ARDS poses challenges to clinicians. We attempted to assess the baseline characteristics and outcomes of persistent severe ARDS and to identify which variables are useful to predict it. METHODS: A secondary analysis of patient-level data from the ALTA, EDEN and SAILS ARDSNet clinical trials was conducted. We defined persistent severe ARDS as a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2:FiO2) of equal to or less than 100 mmHg on the second study day following enrollment. Regularized logistic regression with an L1 penalty [Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)] techniques were used to identify predictive variables of persistent severe ARDS. RESULTS: Of the 1531 individuals with ARDS alive on the second study day after enrollment, 232 (15%) had persistent severe ARDS. Of the latter, 100 (43%) individuals had mild or moderate hypoxemia at baseline. Usage of vasopressors was greater [144/232 (62%) versus 623/1299 (48%); p<0.001] and baseline severity of illness was higher in patients with versus without persistent severe ARDS.

Most of these patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to excessive inflammatory response and the ensuing cytokine storm. Anti-inflammatory drugs including corticosteroids can be used to effectively reduce the effect of this cytokine storm and lung damage. However, corticosteroids can have side effects, so simultaneous administration of immunoglobulin (IV-IG) and interferon-beta can help manage treatment using corticosteroids. Therefore, we designed a trial to test our hypothesis that early administration of dexamethasone in combination with IV-IG and interferon-beta can reduce the effect of the cytokine storm in critically ill patients COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase two multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel arms (1:1:1 ratio). PARTICIPANTS: They will be hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who have positive RT-PCR test and have blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) less than 90% and respiratory rate higher than 24 per minute or have involvement of more than 50% of their lung when viewed using computed tomography (CT)-scan. The age range of patients will be 18-70 years old. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: the need for intubation; allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study drug including dexamethasone, IV-IG, and interferon-beta; pregnancy or lactation; known HIV positive or active hepatitis B or C. The study will be conducted in several hospitals of the Golestan province, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The study subjects will be randomly allocated to three treatment arms: two experimental groups (two arms: Intervention 1 and Intervention 2) and one Control Group, which will be matched for age and sex using frequency matching method. Each eligible patient in the control arm will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 based on WHO guidelines and the Ministry of the Health and Medical Education (MOHME) of Iran. Each patient in the Intervention Group 1 will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 and dexamethasone, at the first 24 hours' time of admission. The intervention begins with the administration of dexamethasone based on the SpO2 levels. If the level of SpO2 does not improve after 24 hours, IV-IG (400 mg/kg once daily for 5 days) and interferon-beta (7 doses every other day) will be prescribed along with dexamethasone administration. In Intervention Group 2, the administration of dexamethasone will be started within the first 24 hours' time of admission and will be continued for 48-72 hours and then the SpO2 level will be checked. Then, if the level of SpO2 has not improved after that time, IV-IG and interferon-beta will be prescribed as the same dosage as Group 1. If the percentages of the SpO2 level are between 85 and 90/ 80 and 85/ 75 and 80/ less than 75, the dosages will be 4 mg every 12 hours/ 4 mg every 8 hours/ 8 mg every 12 hours/ 8 mg every 8 hours, respectively. According to the WHO recommendation, all participants will have the best available supportive care with full monitoring. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: An increase in the SpO2 level to reach more than 90% in each case, which will be assessed by the oximeter. Secondary: The duration of hospital stays; intubation status and the percentage of patients who are free of mechanical ventilation; the mortality rates during hospitalization and one month after the admission time. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be allocated into either control or intervention groups with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio using a computer random number generator to generate a table of random numbers for simple randomization. BLINDING (MASKING): The project's principal investigator (PI) is unblinded. However, the PI will not analyse the data and interpret the results. An unblinded researcher (a pharmacist) will cover the drug's bottles with aluminium foil and prepare them interventions and control drugs in a syringe with a code so that patients are blinded.

Lf blocks the early interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host cells by binding to specific cell receptors and has been proposed as a preventative and adjunct treatment for COVID-19. This preliminary report aimed to investigate concentrations of Lf in early milk of SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers versus non-infected controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS In a cohort of 13 SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and 15 controls, breast milk concentrations of Lf were determined by ELISA on day 3 postpartum. Additionally, colostrum samples of infected mothers were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG determination using RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS No differences were found in breast milk Lf concentrations between SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers and controls. In a subgroup analysis, however, symptomatic mothers (n = 7) presented with lower breast milk Lf concentrations, as compared to asymptomatic mothers (p = .041) and healthy controls (p = .029). All milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Early human milk of infected mothers displayed IgA and IgG SARS-CoV-2 specific reactivity. CONCLUSIONS Our data showed a different early breast milk Lf \\"profile\\" between COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers with the latter being at non-COVID levels (control group).

However, no previous studies have investigated the association between dietary patterns and COVID-19. Methods: Healthcare workers (HCWs) from six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, USA) with substantial exposure to COVID-19 patients completed a web-based survey from 17 July to 25 September 2020. Participants provided information on demographic characteristics, dietary information, and COVID-19 outcomes. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association between self-reported diets and COVID-19 infection, severity, and duration. Results: There were 568 COVID-19 cases and 2316 controls. Among the 568 cases, 138 individuals had moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity whereas 430 individuals had very mild to mild COVID-19 severity. After adjusting for important confounders, participants who reported following  plant-based diets' and  plant-based diets or pescatarian diets' had 73% (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.81) and 59% (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99) lower odds of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 severity, respectively, compared with participants who did not follow these diets.

Currently, no drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19. The current computational study was attempted to identify a novel therapeutic inhibitor against novel SARS-CoV-2 using in silico drug discovery pipeline. METHODS: In the present study, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was the target for the designing of drugs against the deadly virus. The 3D structure of the receptor was modeled & validated using a Swiss-model, Procheck & Errat server. A molecular docking study was performed between a group of natural & synthetic compounds having proven anti-viral activity with ACE2 receptor using Autodock tool 1.5.6. The molecular dynamics simulation study was performed using Desmond v 12 to evaluate the stability and interaction of the ACE2 receptor with a ligand. RESULTS: Based on the lowest binding energy, confirmation, and H-bond interaction, cinnamic acid (?5.20 kcal/mol), thymoquinone (?4.71 kcal/mol), and andrographolide (Kalmegh) (?4.00 kcal/mol) were screened out showing strong binding affinity to the active site of ACE2 receptor. MD simulations suggest that cinnamic acid, thymoquinone, and andrographolide (Kalmegh) could efficiently activate the biological pathway without changing the conformation in the binding site of the ACE2 receptor. The bioactivity and drug-likeness properties of compounds show their better pharmacological property and safer to use. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes the high potential of cinnamic acid, thymoquinone, and andrographolide against the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor protein.

The State of Goa where 5 cases / 100,000 with no death reported as of May 25, 2020, 8:21 A.M. At the time of the data analysis, India was on 62nd day of lockdown. Based on the data available at this time, here we present an inverse correlation of decreased morbidity and mortality rate with increased social distancing, stay-home program / shelter-in program administered by Indian authorities. It is intriguing that a population of approximately 1.3 billion people, reporting a minimum morbidity and mortality rate (M&M rate) could be an exceptional example of coordination of incredibly diverse cultural and complex administrative fabric. In all, our hypothesis is that it is the herd immunity conferred the protection for an en masse from the current pandemic event. Based on the lessons learned from this current SARS-CoV-2, here we present a ?Cogent Transmission Model? (CTM) in which community living confer and/or reinforce herd immunity induced protection from the future pandemic of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic resistance bacterial pathogens (ARBP). The success in sustaining a minimum M&M rate could be due in part by the social support system which is a significant element for the development of hardiness to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The success of the current lockdown is a reflection of the social support system which is intertwined with perceptions of personal control enabling the coping process. Such a level of hardiness is also referred to as ?Internal Locus of Control? (ILC). It is our observation that a pattern of consistency on the confidence level of each and every member of the community having considerable control over the events in overcoming the illness and combating the diseases is truly flabbergasting. Such a level of resilience draws a corollary of the hardy personality as identified in the ?Personal Hardiness? (J. Pers and Soci. Psych 37, 1?11: 1979). Traits such as a. sense of commitment to self, b. control over their life at the individual level and c. view and make adjustments as challenges arise rather than viewing it as a source of stress. Taken together we suggest that commitment to self, control of self in dynamic social environmental circumstances and readjustment to challenges separate the people with ?Personal Hardiness? from the rest of the society as a remarkable trait to overcome the fear of the unknown in a pandemic event (FASEB Journal 2019 33:1_supplement, 483.16-483.16).

In this paper, we reproduce the analyses of Abdollahpouri et al. in the context of music recommendation.

In line with Abdollahpouri et al., we find that state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms favor popular items also in the music domain. However, their proposed Group Average Popularity metric yields different results for Last.fm than for the movie domain, presumably due to the larger number of available items (i.e., music artists) in the Last.fm dataset we use.

Similar vaccine regimens have also not consistently protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) against viral acquisition. Conversely, experimental vaccines of different designs have protected macaques from viral challenges but then failed to protect humans, while many other HIV-1 vaccine candidates have not protected NHPs. While efficacy varies more in NHPs than humans, vaccines have failed to protect in the most stringent NHP model. Intense investigations have aimed to identify correlates of protection (CoPs), even in the absence of net protection. Unvaccinated animals and humans vary vastly in their susceptibility to infection and in their innate and adaptive responses to the vaccines; hence, merely statistical associations with factors that do not protect are easily found. Systems biological analyses, including artificial intelligence, have identified numerous candidate CoPs but with no clear consistency within or between species. Proposed CoPs sometimes have only tenuous mechanistic connections to immune protection. In contrast, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are a central mechanistic CoP for vaccines that succeed against other viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. No HIV-1 vaccine candidate has yet elicited potent and broadly active NAbs in NHPs or humans, but narrow-specificity NAbs against the HIV-1 isolate corresponding to the immunogen do protect against infection by the autologous virus.

In classical thermodynamics, the spontaneity of a process is established through the assessment of the change in Gibbs free energy. So far, the feasibility of nuclear reactions has been characterized in terms of cross section and Q-value while the entropic term (T S) has been neglected. Such an assumption is always justified for fission reactions where the term S is positive. In the case of fusion reactions that operate at very high temperatures (106C107 K) and where S is negative, the change in Gibbs free energy may be positive, making the reaction non-spontaneous. This paper proposes a classical thermodynamic analysis of D-based reactions of interest for the magnetic-confinement fusion applications. The entropy contribution was evaluated via the SackurCTetrode equation while the change in enthalpy was considered constant and as corresponding to the Q-value of the fusion reaction. The results of the thermodynamic analysis are compared with nuclear reaction feasibility criteria based on the reaction reactivity. The DT and D3He reactions show a high degree of spontaneity although the second one presents a lower reactivity. An increase in temperature could enhance the reactivity of the D3He reaction at the cost of decreasing its thermodynamic spontaneity. Both branches of the  reaction are characterized by a much lower thermodynamic spontaneity than that of the DT and D3He reactions. Furthermore, at the temperature of their maximum cross section, the  reactions exhibit a largely positive change in Gibbs free energy and, therefore, are not spontaneous.

METHODS: We used data from adults treated at 2,600 hemodialysis facilities in United States between February 1st and June 8th, 2020. We performed a retrospective case-control study matching each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient (case) to a non-SARS-CoV-2 patient (control) treated in the same dialysis shift. Cases and controls were matched on age, sex, race, facility, shift date, and treatment count. For each case-control pair, we traced backward 14 days to assess possible prior exposure from a shedding SARS-CoV-2 positive patient who sat in the same chair immediately before the case or control. Conditional logistic regression models tested whether chair exposure after a shedding SARS-CoV-2 positive patient conferred a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the immediate subsequent patient. RESULTS: Among 170,234 hemodialysis patients, 4,782 (2.8 %) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean age 64 years, 44 % female). Most facilities (68.5 %) had 0 to 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 patient.

Early clinical series of transanal TME with laparoscopic assistance (n = 72) are promising, with overall intraoperative and postoperative complication rates of 8.3% and 27.8%, respectively, similar to laparoscopic TME. The mesorectal specimen was intact in all patients, and 94.4% had negative margins. There was no oncological recurrence in average-risk patients at short-term follow up, and 2-year survival rates in high-risk patients were comparable to that after laparoscopic TME. These preliminary studies demonstrate transanal NOTES TME with laparoscopic assistance to be clinically feasible and safe given careful patient selection, surgical expertise, and appropriate procedural training.

Concerns regarding cardiac complications associated with fluid challenges and inotropes may prevent clinicians from performing GDT in patients who need it most. We hypothesized that GDT is not associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications in high-risk, non-cardiac surgical patients. We performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GDT in high-risk surgical patients. Studies including cardiac surgery, trauma, and paediatric surgery were excluded. We reviewed the rates of all cardiac complications, arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, and acute pulmonary oedema. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan software. Data are presented as odds ratios (ORs), [95% confidence intervals (CIs)], and P-values. Twenty-two RCTs including 2129 patients reported cardiac complications.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","output":"COVID-19 in aged care homes: a comparison of effects initial government policies had in the UK (primarily focussing on England) and Australia during the first wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in March 2020 in Europe, which is normally the peak incidence period of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections, implying cocirculation and potentially causing competition between them. METHODS: We investigated differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of HMPV infections in hospitalized patients before (January 2016-28 February, 2020) and HMPV and COVID-19 during part of the COVID-19 pandemic (28 February, 2020-1 April, 2020). RESULTS: A total of 239 HMPV patients and 303 COVID-19 patients were included. Incidence of HMPV peaked in March. Despite a 324% increase in HMPV testing during the COVID-19 outbreak, incidence of HMPV remained stable. Clinical characteristics showed 25 (11%) ICU admissions and 14 (6%) deaths. History of myocardial infarction, higher age and lower BMI were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Clinical characteristics of HMPV-infected patients did not differ between the non-COVID-19 period and the examined COVID-19 period except for length of hospital stay (7 vs. 5 days). HMPV infection and COVID-19 shared many clinical features but HMPV was associated with female gender, elderly patients and chronic conditions (COPD and chronic heart failure). Clinical outcomes did not differ between the viruses during the COVID-19 period. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of HMPV infection did not change during the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of incidence and/or disease severity; hence, HMPV and SARS-CoV-2 are probably co-circulating independently.

In Alberta there is a huge delivery gap in providing healthcare services for children with TS and OCD. A stakeholder consultation was performed to ascertain how service delivery could be improved across the province and to inform the development of a provincial information and support organization, the Tourette OCD Alberta Network. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was employed: 10 parents were recruited for interview and 140 parents responded to a survey. RESULTS: Qualitative data showed there was often an absence of a clear pathway to access healthcare for people with TS and OCD. The negative impact of not receiving treatment, information, and resources in a timely and prompt manner was also revealed. Good clinical practice existed across the province but too often it was hindered by a shortage of knowledge about TS and OCD. In schools, learning for students with TS and OCD was also impaired by educators lack of knowledge and preparedness in relation to the disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified ways that challenges with healthcare access, school learning, and seeking information can be overcome. Skills-based training webinars, educational outreach in schools, and peer support were recognized as actions for improving healthcare outcomes for people with TS and OCD.

Prompt and effective predictors of clinical outcomes are crucial to recognize potentially critically ill patients and improve the management of COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to identify potential predictors of clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, which included 318 patients treated from June 2020 to January 2021 in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Clinical Hospital Center Bezanijska Kosa in Belgrade, Serbia. The verified diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, patients over 18 years of age, and the hospitalization in ICU were the criteria for inclusion in the study. The optimal cutoff value of D-dimer, CRP, IL-6, and PCT for predicting hospital mortality was determined using the ROC curve, while the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to assess survival. Results The study included 318 patients: 219 (68.9%) were male and 99 (31.1%) female. The median age of patients was 69 (60-77) years. During the treatment, 195 (61.3%) patients died, thereof 130 male (66.7%) and 65 female (33.3%). 123 (38.7%) patients were discharged from hospital treatment. The cutoff value of IL-6 for in-hospital death prediction was 74.98 pg/mL (Sn 69.7%, Sp 62.7%);cutoff value of CRP was 81 mg/L (Sn 60.7%, Sp 60%);cutoff value of procalcitonin was 0.56 ng/mL (Sn 81.1%, Sp 76%);and cutoff value of D-dimer was 760 ng/mL FEU (Sn 63.4%, Sp 57.1%).

Highly sensitive molecular tools have been developed to help determine the hidden reservoir of malaria transmission in low transmission settings. In this study we compare the performance of PvLAP5 and Pvs25 qRT-PCR assays to LM for the detection of Plasmodium vivax gametocytes in field samples preserved at ambient temperature from malaria endemic regions of Panama. METHODS: For this purpose, we collected a total of 83 malaria field samples during 2017-2020 preserved in RNAprotect (RNAp) of which 63 (76%) were confirmed P. vivax by LM and selected for further analysis. Additionally, 16 blood samples from local healthy malaria smear negative volunteers, as well as, from 15 malaria na?ve lab-bred Aotus monkeys were used as controls. To optimize the assays, we first determined the minimum blood volume sufficient for detection of PvLAP5 and Pv18SrRNA using P. vivax infected Aotus blood that was preserved in RNAp and kept either at ambient temperature for up to 8 days before freezing or was snap-frozen at -80 Celsius at the time of bleeding. We then compared the mean differences in gametocyte detection rates of both qRT-PCR assays to LM and performed a multivariate correlation analysis of study variables. Finally, we determined the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the assays at detecting gametocytes compared to LM. RESULTS: Blood volume optimization indicated that a blood volume of at least 60 L was sufficient for detection of PvLAP5 and Pv18SrRNA and no significant differences were found between RNA storage conditions. Both PvLAP5 and Pvs25 qRT-PCR assays showed a 37-39% increase in gametocyte detection rate compared to LM respectively. Strong positive correlations were found between gametocytemia and parasitemia and both PvLAP5 and Pvs25 gametocyte markers. However, no significant differences were detected in the Se and Sp of the Pvs25 and PvLAP5 qRT-PCR assays, even though data from control samples suggested Pvs25 to be more abundant than PvLAP5. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the PvLAP5 qRT-PCR assay is as Se and Sp as the gold standard Pvs25 assay and is at least 37% more sensitive than LM at detecting P. vivax gametocytes in field samples preserved in RNAp at ambient temperature from malaria endemic regions of Panama. AUTHOR SUMMARY: Plasmodium vivax is one of the five species of malaria (P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi) that are transmitted to man by the bite of female anopheles mosquitoes. It causes ~14.3 million cases mainly in Southeast Asia, India, the Western Pacific and the Americas annually. In the Americas, malaria remains a major problem in underdeveloped areas and indigenous communities in the Amazon region and eastern Panama, where it is endemic and difficult to eliminate. As malaria elimination progresses, detection of P. vivax by light microscopy (LM) becomes more difficult. Therefore, highly sensitive molecular tools have been developed that use genetic markers for the parasite to help determine the hidden reservoir of malaria transmission. This study compares the performance of two molecular assays based on the genetic markers of mature gametocytes PvLAP5 and Pvs25 with LM. The study shows that the PvLAP5 qRT-PCR assay is as sensitive and specific as the gold standard Pvs25 assay and is at least 37% more sensitive than LM at detecting P. vivax gametocytes. These data suggest that the PvLAP5 qRT-PCR assay can be a useful tool to help determine the hidden reservoir of transmission in endemic foci approaching elimination.","output":"Comparison of PvLAP5 and Pvs25 qRT-PCR assays for the detection of Plasmodium vivax gametocytes in field samples preserved at ambient temperature from remote malaria endemic regions of Panama"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Epidemic COVID-19 in 2020 was one of the crises that confronted the Islamic Republic of Iran's health system as a developing low-income country with many challenges. The purpose of this study is to explain the requirements of similar health systems in facing epidemics such as COVID-19 as well as sharing experiences of Iran. METHODS: The present study was a qualitative study using content analysis of the Iranian Ministry of Health website (behdasht.gov.ir) during the official onset of COVID-19 in Iran (February 20) to March 7, 2020. To Integrate data, interviews with experts were used. In this regard, 4 national health policymakers and 5 provincial health managers were interviewed. After implementation using 8-step content analysis method, data were analyzed using MAXQDA software by research team members who had no conflict of interest. RESULTS: The findings show that the disease began on February 20, 2020, with two cases of death from COVID-19 in Qom province in central Iran and within two weeks it has widely affected 31 provinces, with 4747 approved cases and 124 deaths. According to the results, the Islamic Republic of Iran's health system faced five major challenges to confronting with COVID-19: 1- Medical consumables supply 2- Hospital beds allocation and intensive care units (ICU) equipment 3-The lack of a comprehensive COVID-19 protocol in the country 4- the lack of a single command authority to deal with the crisis 5- Insufficient public health literacy and information as a result of social anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of this case indicate that health systems require policy action to prevent and control diseases rather than other implementations. In this regard, training should be given to children and adolescents, at-risk persons and health system staff. In addition, to confront with COVID-19, an integrated policy implementation team should be established in collaboration with the health sector and other relevant bodies. KEY MESSAGES: It seems obvious that policy implementation requires to prepare the country for future contingencies. A comprehensive National Prevention Protocol needs to be developed.","output":"The Requirements of Developing Countries' Health Systems Facing with COVID-19: A Case Study of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 crisis has rapidly increased the vulnerability of groups of population already facing precarious living conditions The emergence of food and housing insecurity have forced health and social actors along with the local authorities to implement innovative responses in order to respond to these unmet needs This article presents some of these responses, such as an interdisciplinary mobile COVID-19 screening team, an emergency housing program and a large-scale food assistance program These examples highlight the need for an intersectoral, coordinated and collaborative response simultaneously targeting different domains of insecurity in parallel to actions on the underpinning social and political determinants of these vulnerabilities","output":"[Vulnerable populations and COVID-19 : need for innovation and cooperation to address health and social needs]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Back ground: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) in Uganda was first reported in a male traveler from Dubai on 21 st March, 2020 shortly after WHO had announced the condition as a global pandemic. Timely laboratory diagnosis of COVID -19 for all samples from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was observed as key in containing the pandemic and breaking the chain of transmission. However, there was a challenge of limited resources required for testing SARS-COV-2 in low and middle income countries. To mitigate this, a study was conducted to evaluate a sample pooling strategy for COVI-19 using real time PCR. The cost implication and the turn around time of pooled sample testing versus individual sample testing were also compared. Methods: : In this study, 1260 randomly selected samples submitted to Uganda Virus Research Institute for analysis were batched in pools of 5, 10, and 15. The pools were then extracted using a Qiagen kit. Both individual and pooled RNA were screened for the SARS-COV-2 E gene using a Berlin kit. Results: : Out of 1260 samples tested, 21 pools were positive in pools of 5 samples, 16 were positive in pools of 10 and 14 were positive in pools of 15 samples. The study also revealed that the pooling strategy helps to save a lot on resources, time and expands diagnostic capabilities without affecting the sensitivity of the test in areas with low SARS-COV-2 prevalence.

We develop a coastal urban model family, where the population growth and urbanization rates are modeled in the framework of diffusion over the half-bounded and bounded domains, and apply the maximum entropy principle to the latter case. Population density distributions are derived analytically whenever possible. Steady-state wave solutions balancing the width of inhabited coastal zones, with the skewed distributions maximizing population entropy, might be responsible for the coastward migrations outstripping the demographic development of the hinterland.

CHX has strong biocidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria and weaker activity against Gram-negative bacteria. It is also active against yeasts, some dermatophytes and some lipophilic viruses. The most widely application CHX has found in dentistry and antisepsis. Numerous studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of CHX in reducing of plaque accumulation, in tooth caries, gingivitis, periodontitis and in alveolar osteitis. Unfortunately, CHX exhibits cytotoxic activity on human cells, can cause colorization of teeth and fillings, and its activity depends on the pH of the environment and the presence of organic substances.

Many viruses have evolved countermeasures to inhibit the IFN pathway, thereby subverting the innate antiviral response. Here, we demonstrate that the mildly myocarditic reovirus type 1 Lang (T1L), but not the nonmyocarditic reovirus type 3 Dearing, represses IFN induction of a subset of ISGs and that this repressor function segregates with the T1L M1 gene. Concordantly, the T1L M1 gene product, mu2, dramatically inhibits IFN-beta-induced reporter gene expression. Surprisingly, T1L infection does not degrade components of the ISGF3 complex or interfere with STAT1 or STAT2 nuclear translocation as has been observed for other viruses. Instead, infection with T1L or reassortant or recombinant viruses containing the T1L M1 gene results in accumulation of interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in the nucleus. This effect has not been previously described for any virus and suggests that mu2 modulates IRF9 interactions with STATs for both ISGF3 function and nuclear export. The M1 gene is a determinant of virus strain-specific differences in the IFN response, which are linked to virus strain-specific differences in induction of murine myocarditis. We find that virus-induced myocarditis is associated with repression of IFN function, providing new insights into the pathophysiology of this disease. Together, these data provide the first report of an increase in IRF9 nuclear accumulation associated with viral subversion of the IFN response and couple virus strain-specific differences in IFN antagonism to the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis.","output":"Reovirus mu2 protein inhibits interferon signaling through a novel mechanism involving nuclear accumulation of interferon regulatory factor 9."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that reverses the post-translational modification of target proteins by ISG15 or ubiquitin, and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, viral infection, and cancer development. Although high levels of USP18 mRNA have been observed in several types of cancer, its pathological significance in ovarian cancer (OV) is still elusive.

We further showed that activated Jak-STAT3 signaling induced the expression of USP18, which in turn feedback maintained the activity of Jak-STAT3 signaling in OV. In addition, we found that USP18 played a cancer-promoting role in OV mainly through the transcriptional regulation of FBXO6. Silencing USP18 reduced the malignancy of OV, which can be largely reversed by overexpression of FBXO6. On the contrary, silencing FBXO6 significantly weaken the pro-proliferation function of USP18 in OV cells.

We aimed to further evaluate the influence of corticosteroids on patients with coronavirus infection. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of literature published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) from January 1, 2002 to March 15, 2020. All statistical analyses in this study were performed on stata14.0. Results A total of 5270 patients from 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis.

Each has a broad species tropism and can cause disease with high mortality in both animal and human hosts. These viruses infect cells by a pH-independent membrane fusion event mediated by their attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins (Envs). Seven Fabs, m101 to -7, were selected for their significant binding to a soluble form of Hendra G (sG) which was used as the antigen for panning of a large na?ve human antibody library. The selected Fabs inhibited, to various degrees, cell fusion mediated by the HeV or NiV Envs and virus infection. The conversion of the most potent neutralizer of infectious HeV, Fab m101, to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) significantly increased its cell fusion inhibitory activity: the 50% inhibitory concentration was decreased more than 10-fold to approximately 1 microg/ml. The IgG1 m101 was also exceptionally potent in neutralizing infectious HeV; complete (100%) neutralization was achieved with 12.5 microg/ml, and 98% neutralization required only 1.6 microg/ml. The inhibition of fusion and infection correlated with binding of the Fabs to full-length G as measured by immunoprecipitation and less with binding to sG as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Biacore. m101 and m102 competed with the ephrin-B2, which we recently identified as a functional receptor for both HeV and NiV, indicating a possible mechanism of neutralization by these antibodies. The m101, m102, and m103 antibodies competed with each other, suggesting that they bind to overlapping epitopes which are distinct from the epitopes of m106 and m107. In an initial attempt to localize the epitopes of m101 and m102, we measured their binding to a panel of 11 G alanine-scanning mutants and identified two mutants, P185A and Q191 K192A, which significantly decreased binding to m101 and one, G183, which decreased binding of m102 to G. These results suggest that m101 to -7 are specific for HeV or NiV or both and exhibit various neutralizing activities; they are the first human monoclonal antibodies identified against these viruses and could be used for treatment, prophylaxis, and diagnosis and as research reagents and could aid in the development of vaccines.","output":"Potent neutralization of Hendra and Nipah viruses by human monoclonal antibodies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ERGIC-53 is a lectin-type membrane protein that continuously recycles between the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis- Golgi.

Multiple linear regression was applied, then a predictive model of severity called Age-AST-D dimer (AAD) was constructed (n = 166) and validated (n = 170). Results: Derivation cohort: from 166 patients included, there were 27 (16.3%) ICU patients that showed higher levels of liver injury markers (P < 0.01) compared with non-ICU patients: alanine aminotrasnferase (ALT) 225.4  341.2 vs. 41.3  41.1, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 325.3  382.4 vs. 52.8  47.1, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 764.6  401.9 vs. 461.0  185.6, D-dimer () 7765  9109 vs. 1871  4146, and age 58.6  12.7 vs. 49.1  12.8.

However, previous literature did not account for patients illness severity. Our objective was to examine the variation in risk-standardized NIV use after adjusting for illness severity. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed AECOPD hospitalizations from 2011 to 2017 at 106 acute-care Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals in the USA. We stratified hospitals based on the percentage of NIV use among patients who received ventilation support within the first 24 hours of admission into quartiles, and compared patient characteristics. We calculated the risk-standardized NIV % using hierarchical models adjusting for comorbidities and severity of illness. We then stratified the hospitals by risk-standardized NIV % into quartiles and compared hospital characteristics between quartiles. We also compared the risk-standardized NIV % between rural and urban hospitals. RESULTS: In 42,048 admissions for AECOPD over 6 years, the median risk-standardized initial NIV % was 57.3% (interquartile interval [IQI]=41.9C64.4%). Hospitals in the highest risk-standardized NIV % quartiles cared for more rural patients, used invasive ventilators less frequently, and had longer length of hospital stay, but had no difference in mortality relative to the hospitals in the lowest quartiles. The risk-standardized NIV % was 65.3% (IQI=34.2C84.2%) in rural and 55.1% (IQI=10.8C86.6%) in urban hospitals (p=0.047), but hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups.

Although cadmium (Cd) exposure might be involved in the pathogenesis of DN, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we explored the protective effects and possible mechanism of proanthocyanidins (OPC) from grape seed using a mouse model of Cd-induced DN. The successful establishment of this model was verified by analyzing the physiological and biochemical indices of mice, including their body weight and tissue ratio; levels of blood glucose, creatinine, microalbumin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; and was based on histopathological examination. Oxidative-antioxidative status, elemental analysis, and key signaling pathway analysis were performed to explore the possible protective mechanism of OPC. The protective effects of OPC and its possible mechanism in preventing the progression of DN were investigated using a multidimensional approach, including its ability in regulating oxidative-antioxidative status (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione GST, GSH-Px), metal-binding ability (Cd levels in the kidneys and urine and MT content) and mediation of essential elements (Zn, Ca, Cu, and Fe levels in the kidneys), and activation of the p38 MAPK and Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathways. OPC exhibited a significant renoprotective effect, attributed to the metal-chelating ability, anti-oxidative effect, and mediation of oxidative stress-related signaling pathway. These results highlight the potential of OPC in preventing or treating DN in humans and suggest the dietary intake of grapes, which are rich in polyphenols, for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications.","output":"Proanthocyanidins Protect Against Cadmium-Induced Diabetic Nephropathy Through p38 MAPK and Keap1/Nrf2 Signaling Pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic strained medical systems worldwide.

Crystallography gives the impression that proteins adopt a fixed shape, yet enzymes are functionally dynamic. Molecular dynamics offers the possibility of probing protein movement while predicting ligand binding. Accordingly, we choose the bacterial F1Fo ATP synthase  subunit to unravel why ATP affinity by  subunits from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus PS3 differs ~500-fold, despite sharing identical sequences at the ATP-binding site. METHODS We first used the Bacillus PS3  subunit structure to model the B. subtilis  subunit structure and used this to explore the utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the influence of residues outside the ATP binding site. To verify the MD predictions, point mutants were made and ATP binding studies were employed. RESULTS MD simulations predicted that E102 in the B. subtilis  subunit, outside of the ATP binding site, influences ATP binding affinity. Engineering E102 to alanine or arginine revealed a ~10 or ~54 fold increase in ATP binding, respectively, confirming the MD prediction that E102 drastically influences ATP binding affinity. CONCLUSIONS These findings reveal how MD can predict how changes in the \\"second shell\\" residues around substrate binding sites influence affinity in simple protein structures. Our results reveal why seemingly identical  subunits in different ATP synthases have radically different ATP binding affinities.

DAR-901 represents a scalable manufacturing process for SRL172. We sought to determine if DAR-901 would prevent infection with M. tuberculosis among BCG-primed adolescents age 13-15 years in Tanzania. METHODS: Adolescents with a negative T- SPOT.TBR interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) were randomized 1:1 to three intradermal injections of DAR-901 or saline placebo at 0, 2 and 4 months. Repeat IGRAs were performed at 2 months, and at 1, 2, and 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was time to new TB infection (IGRA conversion to positive); the secondary outcome was time to persistent TB infection (IGRA conversion with repeat positive IGRA). RESULTS: Among 936 participants screened 667 were eligible and randomized to their first dose of vaccine or placebo (safety cohort). At 2 months, 625 participants remained IGRA-negative and were scheduled for the additional two doses (efficacy cohort). DAR-901 was safe and well-tolerated. One DAR-901 recipient developed a vaccine site abscess. Neither the primary nor secondary endpoints differed between the two treatment arms (p = 0.90 and p = 0.20, respectively). DAR-901 IGRA converters had median responses to ESAT-6 of 50.1 spot-forming cells (SFCs) vs. 19.6 SFCs in placebo IGRA converters (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A three-dose series of 1 mg DAR-901 was safe and well-tolerated but did not prevent initial or persistent IGRA conversion. DAR-901 recipients with IGRA conversion demonstrated enhanced immune responses to ESAT-6. Since protection against disease may require different immunologic responses than protection against infection a trial of DAR-901 to prevent TB disease is warranted.

On impact, the seat propels the driver's torso forward relative to the head, resulting in forced flexion of the occipitoatlantal (OA) joint, accompanied by forced stretching of the rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm) muscles. Flexion of the OA joint and stretching of the RCPm muscles continues to increase until the vehicle's headrest strikes the back of the driver's head. It is known that externally applied forces that attempt to move the OA joint beyond its anatomic barrier can result in fracture, dislocation, or soft tissue damage to its structural components. However, the magnitude of headrest backset, defined as the distance between the driver's head and the vehicle's headrest, that would result in RCPm muscles being stretched to a length that would put them at risk for a muscle strain injury is unknown. OBJECTIVES To quantify the relationships among flexion of the OA joint, RCPm muscle stretch, and backset, and to quantify the biomechanical response of RCPm muscles to increasing levels of axial load due to stretching. METHODS Unembalmed head and neck specimens from three White females aged 85, 63, and 70 years were obtained from the Anatomical Services Division at the University of Maryland. Donors had provided written consent allowing use of their body for research purposes. Using an analytic model of the OA joint, the relationships between flexion of the OA joint and RCPm muscle stretch as a function of backset were estimated. RCPm muscles were removed from the cadavers and forcibly stretched using a servomechanism controlled hydraulic testing machine to quantify the load/displacement properties. After testing, the tissues were sectioned, mounted, and stained using Masson's trichrome to selectively stain muscle fibers red and collagen blue. RESULTS Forced flexion of the OA joint was seen to be directly related to the magnitude of headrest backset. For values of backset greater than 7.2 cm, biomechanical testing of the RCPm muscles revealed that strain injuries ranged from the tearing of a few muscle fibers to complete rupture of the muscle and separation of the tendon at the posterior process of C1. CONCLUSIONS Results showed that headrest backset at the time of vehicle impact is an important factor in estimating the risk of muscle strain injury to RCPm muscles. Muscle strain injury would be expected to impact the functional relationship between the RCPm muscles and the pain sensitive spinal dura. Physicians should be alert to the possibility that cervicogenic pain patients who have experienced whiplash associated with REMVA may show clinically relevant structural damage to the RCPm muscles on MRI.","output":"Assessment of potential strain injury to rectus capitis posterior minor muscles during whiplash type distortions of the cervical spine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a short span, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has captured global consciousness by significantly affecting the day-to-day life of humans and emerged as a public health emergency.

A prime example lies in neuroscience where groups of neurons (not individual ones) may provide the building blocks for neurocomputation. Here, we study consensus dynamics on edges in simplicial complexes using a type of Laplacian matrix called a Hodge Laplacian, which we generalize to allow higher- and lower-order interactions to have different strengths. Using techniques from algebraic topology, we study how collective dynamics converge to a low-dimensional subspace that corresponds to the homology space of the simplicial complex. We use the Hodge decomposition to show that higher- and lower-order interactions can be optimally balanced to maximally accelerate convergence, and that this optimum coincides with a balancing of dynamics on the curl and gradient subspaces. We additionally explore the effects of network topology, finding that consensus over edges is accelerated when 2-simplices are well dispersed, as opposed to clustered together.","output":"Balanced Hodge Laplacians Optimize Consensus Dynamics over Simplicial Complexes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Im sozialwissenschaftlichen Diskurs und den medialen Debatten wird die Covid-19-Pandemie zunehmend als disruptive Kraft in Bezug auf die Digitalisierung der Arbeitswelt wahrgenommen.

Physical activity is well-known to provide mental health benefits across the lifespan. However, the underlying mechanisms linking physical activity and psychiatric symptoms remain underexplored. In this context, we aim to systematically synthesise evidence focused on the mechanisms through which physical activity might reduce psychiatric symptoms across all ages. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: With the aid of a biomedical information specialist, we will develop a systematic search strategy based on the predetermined research question in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane and PsycINFO. Two independent reviewers will screen and select studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias. In case of inability to reach a consensus, a third person will be consulted. We will not apply any language restriction, and we will perform a qualitative synthesis of our findings as we anticipate that studies are scarce and heterogeneous. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Only data that have already been published will be included. Then, ethical approval is not required.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the principal proteins of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and plays a vital role in the virus life cycle. The N protein has only 123 or 128 amino acids, some of key amino acid sites which could affect the protein functions or impair the viral biological characteristics have been identified. In this research, our objective was to find out whether there are other novel amino acid sites of the N protein can affect N protein functions or PRRSV-2 replication. RESULTS: In this study, we found mutated the serine(78) and serine (99)of the nucleocapsid (N) protein can reduce the N-induced expression of IL-10 mRNA; Then, by using reverse genetics system, we constructed and rescued the mutant viruses, namely, A78 and A99.The IFA result proved that the mutations did not affect the rescue of the PRRSV-2. However, the results of the multistep growth kinetics and qPCR assays indicated that, compared with the viral replication ability, the titres and gRNA levels of A78 were significantly decreased compared with the wild-type. Further study showed that a single amino acid change from serine to alanine at position 78 of the N protein could abrogates the level of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. It means the mutation could significant decrease the viral replication efficiency in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the serine(78) of N protein is a key site which could affect the N protein function and PRRSV replication ability.

PURPOSE This report calls attention to the potential risks of diminished kidney function when administering immune globulin (IG). The goal is to increase awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney function impairment in patients receiving IG and provide recommendations for screening, monitoring, and management to promote risk prevention and mitigation. SUMMARY Human IG preparations for intravenous (IVIG) or subcutaneous (SCIG) administration are the mainstay of treatment in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. Increasingly, IVIG at high doses (1,000 to 2,400 mg/kg) is also used as a treatment for a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Although some autoinflammatory disorders respond to a single course of IVIG therapy, the majority of patients require long-term, regular infusions, thereby increasing the overall risks. Often, both patients and physicians treating adults with IG are unaware of underlying CKD or kidney function impairment. This lack of awareness constitutes a major risk factor for potential worsening, particularly when using high doses of IVIG. Therefore, screening of all patients for CKD and kidney function impairment before the use of IG is essential. Identification of the cause of kidney impairment is strongly encouraged, as IG therapy may need to be modified. CONCLUSION As detailed here, there are potential risks to patients with impaired kidney function with administration of IG, particularly at high doses. Product selection, volume, route of administration, and rate of infusion may impact those with compromised kidney function. Therefore, screening of all patients for CKD and kidney function impairment before the use of IVIG and SCIG, as well as ongoing monitoring and management, is critical. As with all potential adverse drug reactions, the best approach is to prevent them.","output":"Immune globulin therapy and kidney disease: Overview and screening, monitoring, and management recommendations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Nesse ensaio, objetivamos pensar a pandemia a partir da situao das mulheres.

Several methods for nail matrix biopsy have been introduced but are often difficult to perform because of their invasiveness and technical difficulty. Therefore, a less invasive and novel biopsy technique is needed. OBJECTIVE To introduce a window technique for nail matrix biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and histopathological specimens of patients with LM who underwent the window technique for nail matrix biopsy at our institution between September 2015 and December 2016. RESULTS Eleven cases from 10 patients with LM were subjected to our tailored window technique assisted by carbon dioxide (CO2) laser and dermoscopy. We performed nail plate dermoscopy to select the biopsy site and used CO2 laser to create the window in the proximal nail plate. Nail matrix pigmentation was carefully investigated using intraoperative dermoscopy. The technique established appropriate diagnosis in 11 LM cases, without significant complications, as follows: melanoma in situ (4 cases) and nail matrix activation (7 cases). CONCLUSION The window technique assisted by CO2 laser and dermoscopy can be a minimally invasive and effective method for nail matrix LM biopsy under local anesthesia.","output":"A Novel Window Technique Using CO2 Laser, and a Review of Methods for Nail Matrix Biopsy of Longitudinal Melanonychia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite all the scientific and technological developments in the past one hundred years, biologic issues such as pandemics are a constant threat to society.

Biochemical markers of cardiac dysfunction are associated with high mortality in many respiratory conditions. The aim of this systematic review is to examine the link between elevated biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction in ARDS and mortality. METHODS: A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases was performed. We included studies of adult intensive care patients with ARDS that reported the risk of death in relation to a measured biomarker of cardiac dysfunction. The primary outcome of interest was mortality up to 60 days. A random-effects model was used for pooled estimates. Funnel-plot inspection was done to evaluate publication bias; Cochrane chi-square tests and I(2) tests were used to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review and 18 in the meta-analysis. Biomarkers of cardiac stretch included NT-ProBNP (nine studies) and BNP (six studies). Biomarkers of cardiac injury included Troponin-T (two studies), Troponin-I (one study) and High-Sensitivity-Troponin-I (three studies). Three studies assessed multiple cardiac biomarkers. High levels of NT-proBNP and BNP were associated with a higher risk of death up to 60 days (unadjusted OR 8.98; CI 4.15-19.43; p<0.00001). This association persisted after adjustment for age and illness severity. Biomarkers of cardiac injury were also associated with higher mortality, but this association was not statistically significant (unadjusted OR 2.21; CI 0.94-5.16; p= 0.07).

Nucleic acids can also be used to develop sensing platforms for detecting ions, small molecules, proteins, and cells. Their performance can be improved through integration with other organic or inorganic nanomaterials. To further enhance their biological properties, various chemically modified nucleic acid analogues can be generated by modifying their phosphodiester backbone, sugar moiety, nucleobase, or combined sites. Alternatively, using nucleic acids as building blocks for self-assembly of highly ordered nanostructures would enhance their biological stability and cellular uptake efficiency. In this review, we will focus on the development and biomedical applications of structural and functional natural nucleic acids, as well as the chemically modified nucleic acid analogues over the past ten years.

Methods: A retrospective, observational study of adult inpatients with a length of stay of 1 or more days at an urban hospital in Detroit, Michigan. Individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis were compared with a cohort within similar diagnostic categories (respiratory, fever, and sepsis) but without COVID-19. Outcome measures included PT or OT intervention on 1 or more days, the timing of initial PT or OT visit, the average number of visits and units per patient, length of stay, discharge to home, and readmission within 30 days. Results: Individuals with COVID-19 had lower rates of discharge to home (P =.001), higher rates of readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge (P =.01), increased hospital length of stay (P =.001), and waited an average of 3.1 days longer for therapy evaluations than subjects in the comparison group (P =.001). The percentage of subjects who had one or more PT or OT visits during their hospital stays was comparable between groups. Once therapy was initiated, the average number of visits per patient and dosing of units in 15-minute increments were similar between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Patients acutely ill with COVID-19 hospitalized with the virus during the first 6 weeks of the pandemic remained in the intensive care unit and hospital longer than their counterparts without COVID-19 and had a delay in initiation of PT and OT intervention.

Clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with coexisting liver disease as well as the predictors of disease severity and mortality of COVID-19 were assessed.<br/>. RESULTS: Of the 47 patients (4.7%) who had liver-related comorbidities, 14 patients (1.4%) had liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis was more common in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia than in those with non-severe pneumonia (4.5% vs. 0.9%, P=0.006). Compared to patients without liver cirrhosis, a higher proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis required oxygen therapy; were admitted to the intensive care unit; had septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute kidney injury; and died (P<0.05). The overall survival rate was significantly lower in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without liver cirrhosis (log-rank test, P=0.003). Along with old age and diabetes, the presence of liver cirrhosis was found to be an independent predictor of severe disease (odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-17.02;P=0.026) and death (hazard ratio, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.04-9.30; P=0.042) in COVID-19 patients.<br/>.

Studies suggested that cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is expressed in bone tissue and it plays a positive role in osteogenesis. However, whether CB2 could enhance bone formation and blood supply in GC-induced ONFH remains unknown. In this study, we focused on the effect of CB2 in GC-induced ONFH and possible mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. By using GC-induced ONFH rat model, rat-bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to address the interaction of CB2 in vitro and in vivo, we evaluate the osteogenic and angiogenic effect variation and possible mechanisms. Micro-CT, histological staining, angiography, calcein labeling, Alizarin red staining (ARS), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, TUNEL staining, migration assay, scratch assay, and tube formation were applied in this study. Our results showed that selective activation of CB2 alleviates GC-induced ONFH. The activation of CB2 strengthened the osteogenic activity of BMSCs under the influence of GCs by promotion of GSK-3/-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, CB2 promoted HUVECs migration and tube-forming capacities. Our findings indicated that CB2 may serve as a rational new treatment strategy against GC-induced ONFH by osteogenesis activation and maintenance of blood supply.

In this opinion paper, we review the currently available tests and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed clinical care pathways. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 testing but test results are largely influenced by viral load, sample site, specimen collection method, and specimen shipment technique, such that a negative result in a symptomatic patient cannot be relied upon. Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies exhibit a temporal increase in sensitivity and specificity after symptom onset irrespective of the assay used, with sensitivity estimates ranging from 0 to 50% with the first 3 days of symptoms, to 83 to 88% at 10 days, increasing to almost 100% at  14 days.

Hence, targeting metabolic enzymes remains an attractive approach for treating tumors. However, the influence and regulation of cysteine desulfurase (NFS1), a rate-limiting enzyme in ironCsulfur (FeCS) cluster biogenesis, in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. Here, using an in vivo metabolic enzyme gene-based clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 library screen, we revealed that loss of NFS1 significantly enhanced the sensitivity of CRC cells to oxaliplatin. In vitro and in vivo results showed that NFS1 deficiency synergizing with oxaliplatin triggered PANoptosis (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis) by increasing the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, oxaliplatin-based oxidative stress enhanced the phosphorylation level of serine residues of NFS1, which prevented PANoptosis in an S293 phosphorylation-dependent manner during oxaliplatin treatment. In addition, high expression of NFS1, transcriptionally regulated by MYC, was found in tumor tissues and was associated with poor survival and hyposensitivity to chemotherapy in patients with CRC. Overall, the findings of this study provided insights into the underlying mechanisms of NFS1 in oxaliplatin sensitivity and identified NFS1 inhibition as a promising strategy for improving the outcome of platinum-based chemotherapy in the treatment of CRC.","output":"Phosphorylated NFS1 weakens oxaliplatin-based chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer by preventing PANoptosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Currently, it is thought that uterine cervix mucosal samples present a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. So far, there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection in Papanicolaou (Pap) smears. Nevertheless, clinicians could be exposed unaware to the coronavirus while performing and handling a Pap smear. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples in women who tested positive for a nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test. METHODS: From our laboratory database, we identified patients with data on a cervical cancer screening LBC sample paired with a positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test. Relevant LBC samples taken within an incubation period of 14 days and post-onset RNA shedding interval of 25 days were subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR tests.

CONCLUSIONS: CRP levels > 1.0 mg/dL, lymphocyte proportion < 20%, AST/ALT ratio < 1, and triglyceride levels > 1.7 mol/L are potential risk factors for LI.","output":"Clinical features and risk factors of COVID-19-associated liver injury and function: A retrospective analysis of 830 cases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Without proven, targeted therapies against SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to counter the known pathophysiological causes of severe COVID-19, potentially utilizing existing drugs. Severe COVID-19 is largely the result of a dysregulated immune response characterized by lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and critical hypercytokinemia, also called a cytokine storm. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) could potentially suppress effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine which drives the cytokine storm and thereby lower mortality from the disease. This systematic analysis aimed to investigate and synthesize existing evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in reducing COVID-19 mortality. PubMed and SearchWorks searches were performed to locate clinical studies with primary data on TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19. 9 case-control studies comparing mortality between TCZ and standard of care (SOC) were identified for a qualitative synthesis. In all of the studies, the odds ratio of mortality from COVID-19 pointed towards lower fatality with TCZ versus the SOC and a combined random effects odds ratio calculation yielded an odds ratio of 0.482 (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.326-0.713). Additionally, 12 uncontrolled trials were identified for a qualitative analysis producing a raw combined mortality rate of 13.6%. Results from the systematic analysis provide positive evidence for the potential efficacy of TCZ, validating the merit and need for ongoing clinical trials of the drug to treat severe COVID-19.","output":"The Efficacy of IL-6 Inhibitor Tocilizumab in Reducing Severe COVID-19 Mortality: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Different human populations across the globe responded in a different way against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is anticipated that host genetic variants have straight association with the COVID-19. Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) may help to understand this aspect.Methods: We carried out GWAS analysis with 571 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from Gujarat state of India with different phases of COVID-19 severity. After quality filtering, total 94, 320 and 147, deceased, recovered (after admitting in intensive care unit), and asymptomatic, patients were included in the final analysis using three tools i.e. PLINK, OrdinalGWASjl and SAIGE.Findings: We identified total ten, thirteen, and ten unique genomic loci for deceased vs recovered, deceased vs asymptomatic and recovered vs asymptomatic groups, respectively. TNFSF4, LRRC56 and TUBD1 genes have shown an association in deceased vs recovered. Similarly, genomic markers where nearby genes are OR7C2, OR7A17, PAX5, etc. are significant for disease vs asymptomatic comparison. For recovered vs asymptomatic comparison, a strong signal at chromosome 6, locus 6p2132 where HLA group of genes, which are key regulators of the immune system, is found. Unfavorable alleles in AX-11318356, AX-11403743, and AX-11509434 have shown the higher frequency in European compared to the South Asian population and it is reversed for AX-40266551, AX-40266553, AX-38975337, AX-11258333, and AX-30353919.Interpretation: Unfavorable alleles of the markers showing association with the disease severity and outcome can be used for risk prediction in the SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Most biomedical waste substances do not degrade in the environment, and may also not be thoroughly removed through treatment processes. Therefore, the long-lasting persistence of biomedical waste can effectively have adverse impact on wildlife and human beings, as well. Hence, photocatalysis is gaining increasing attention for eradication of pollutants and for improving the safety and clearness of the environment due to its great potential as a green and eco-friendly process. In this regard, nanostructured photocatalysts, in contrast to their regular counterparts, exhibit significant attributes such as non-toxicity, low cost and higher absorption efficiency in a wider range of the solar spectrum, making them the best candidate to employ for photodegradation.

We assessed review quality using a modified version of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews. RESULTS We identified 7804 studies and included 28 systematic reviews. The median (IQR) percentage of CERT and TIDieR items appropriately reported was 24% (19%) and 49% (33%), respectively. TIDieR items 1, Brief name (median=100%, IQR 4) and 2, Why (median=98%, IQR 6), as well as CERT item 4, Supervision and delivery (median=68%, IQR 89), were the best reported.

In some rare cases, cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST) have been reported as a severe side effect occurring 4C14 days after the first vaccination and were often accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Besides CVST, splanchnic vein thromboses (SVT) and other thromboembolic events have been observed. These events only occurred following vaccination with adenoviral vector-based vaccines but not following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists have proposed an immune-based pathomechanism and the condition has been coined vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). Here, we describe an unexpected mechanism that could explain thromboembolic events occurring with DNA-based but not with RNA-based vaccines. We show that DNA-encoded mRNA coding for Spike protein can be spliced in a way that the transmembrane anchor of Spike is lost, so that nearly full-length Spike is secreted from cells. Secreted Spike variants could potentially initiate severe side effects when binding to cells via the ACE2 receptor. Avoiding such splicing events should become part of a rational vaccine design to increase safety of prospective vaccines.","output":"Vaccine-induced COVID-19 mimicry syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At many breeding facilities, rats are housed at relatively high densities until they are 5 weeks old, at which point they are either shipped for research or rehoused at standard cage densities according to weight.

Despite this, many countries have worked to ensure that child helplines remain operational, making such mechanisms even more critical for reporting and referring cases of violence and for providing support to victims. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to document what has occurred, and been reported, to child helplines during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed primary data collection from child helplines and a search of media articles and news stories. METHODS: Child helplines submitted data on the contacts received during the first six months of 2020. Data on contacts related to violence were also available from 2019, and used as baseline. The media search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and news stories published between March 1 st and June 17 th 2020. RESULTS: Overall, the number of contacts to helplines seems to have drastically increased since the beginning of the pandemic. However, the number of contacts related to violence has increased in some countries, while it decreased in others. CONCLUSIONS: While a mixed picture emerges with respect to violence, the increase in overall contacts made to helplines provides evidence that such services are a critical lifeline for many children and women during times of crisis.

It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy.

We investigated whether metabolic biomarkers measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy could be associated with susceptibility to severe pneumonia (2507 hospitalised or fatal cases) and severe COVID-19 (652 hospitalised cases) in 105,146 generally healthy individuals from UK Biobank, with blood samples collected 2007C2010. The overall signature of metabolic biomarker associations was similar for the risk of severe pneumonia and severe COVID-19. A multi-biomarker score, comprised of 25 proteins, fatty acids, amino acids, and lipids, was associated equally strongly with enhanced susceptibility to severe COVID-19 (odds ratio 2.9 [95%CI 2.1C3.8] for highest vs lowest quintile) and severe pneumonia events occurring 7C11 years after blood sampling (2.6 [1.7C3.9]). However, the risk for severe pneumonia occurring during the first 2 years after blood sampling for people with elevated levels of the multi-biomarker score was over four times higher than for long-term risk (8.0 [4.1C15.6]). If these hypothesis generating findings on increased susceptibility to severe pneumonia during the first few years after blood sampling extend to severe COVID-19, metabolic biomarker profiling could potentially complement existing tools for identifying individuals at high risk. These results provide novel molecular understanding on how metabolic biomarkers reflect the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and other infections in the general population.","output":"Metabolic biomarker profiling for identification of susceptibility to severe pneumonia and COVID-19 in the general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study assessed internet users? attention to hospitality companies?

OBJECTIVES: To assess mental health outcomes on GPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore their associations with personal characteristics and features of GP practices. METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study conducted on a sample of GPs working in Verona province (Italy) during the first pandemic wave. Participants were invited to complete a web-based form addressing socio-demographic and work-related information, previous practice organization, practice re-organization during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a set of measures for post-traumatic stress (IES-R), anxiety (SAS), depression (PHQ-9), and burnout (MBI-GS). RESULTS: A total of 215 GPs (38.3% of the eligible population) participated. Overall, 44.7% reported COVID-19-related traumatic events; among these, 35.9% (95% CI, 26%?46%) developed symptoms of post-traumatic distress. Furthermore, 36% (95% CI, 29%?43%) reported symptoms of anxiety, 17.9% (95% CI, 12%?23%) symptoms of at least moderate depression, and 25.4% (95% CI, 19%?32%) symptoms of burnout. Multivariate regressions showed that being quarantined or admitted for COVID-19 was associated with all the mental health outcomes considered. Being female, working in rural settings, and having less professional experience were associated with higher anxiety and depression. The ability to diagnose COVID-19 increased self-perceived professional efficacy, thus contributing to burnout reduction. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes among GPs during the pandemic highlights the importance of timely interventions in this population and promoting targeted preventive actions in the event of future healthcare crises.","output":"The psychological impact of COVID-19 among primary care physicians in the province of Verona, Italy: a cross-sectional study during the first pandemic wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The integrated clinical, laboratory and ultrasound approach is essential for the diagnosis, monitoring and evaluation of the patient's therapy in COVID-19 pneumonia.

Following exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) that undermine deeply held moral beliefs and expectations, HSCWs might experience moral injury (MI) and other deleterious psychiatric consequences. The present study examined associations between exposure to PMIEs, MI symptoms, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), complex PTSD (CPTSD), and self-criticism among HSCWs. METHOD: A sample of 296 Israeli HSCWs responded to online validated self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional designed survey in February and March 2021. RESULTS: Participants' self-reported PTSD (8.9%) and CPTSD (4.8%) rates match the rates of Israel's general population. A moderated-mediation model shows that high self-criticism intensified the relations between exposure to PMIEs and MI symptoms, and between MI symptoms and CPTSD symptoms. Importantly, the indirect effect of exposure to PMIEs on both PTSD and CPTSD symptoms via MI symptoms existed only among those with high levels of self-criticism. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings offer a novel overview of the associations between patterns of exposure to PMIEs, MI, PTSD, and CPTSD.

The aim of our study was to explore social and health-related factors associated with mental health (anxiety and depression) among people who do not identify with the man/woman binomial during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. A cross-sectional study with online survey, aimed at the population residing in Spain during lockdown, was conducted. Data were collected between the 8(th) of April until the 28(th) of May 2020, the time period when lockdown was implemented in Spain. Mental health was measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale for anxiety, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. The survey included the question: Which sex do you identify with? The options Man, Woman, Non-binary and I do not identify were given.

Much of the existing academic writing focuses on North-South cooperation in global health, and emphasizes the role of security and economic interests by Northern countries as drivers of GHD. Chile presents a favourable environment for an expanded involvement in future GHD activities. However, there is little knowledge about what has been driving Chiles integration of health into foreign policy, and little effort to appropriate knowledge from international relations theories to better theoretically grasp the emergence of GHD. METHODS: To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a narrative literature review of the driving forces behind Chiles integration of health into foreign policy. Drawing on a popular analytical framework used in international relations scholarship, we identified driving forces of the integration of health into Chile foreign policy at three levels of analysis. RESULTS: At the international/global level of analysis, the main driving forces were related to national security concerns and compliance with regulations of international organizations. At the regional level, GHD was driven by a commitment to regional solidarity through mutually beneficial cooperation in response to neoliberal reforms; health coordination in emergencies; and protection of indigenous peoples. Finally, at the domestic level, drivers identified include economic interests of various productive sectors and how health regulations might impact those; the high degree of social inequity which impacts on access to healthcare; and management of natural disasters. CONCLUSION: Health actions in the context of international relations in Chile are still mainly motivated by more traditional foreign policy interests rather than by a desire to satisfy health needs per se. This seems to conform with findings of existing GHD scholarship that emphasize the importance of security and economic interests as driving forces of GHD, and how health is often appropriated instrumentally within foreign policy settings to achieve other goals. But the review also reveals that in the context of South-South cooperation (and regional health diplomacy), solidarity and normative considerations can be important driving forces as well. Finally, the review demonstrates that there has been an evolution from chiefly domestically focused health policies (e.g. maternal and child nutrition treatment) towards internationally inspired integrated policies (e.g. maternal and child nutrition promotion aligned with international guidelines).

Forty-three had CD and 14 of them had a seton placed during surgery and they kept it on while they had anti-TNF-alpha therapy. Patients were interviewed with the Cleveland Global Quality of Life (CGQL) and SF-12 quality of life questionnaires. Disease activity was defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) and Perianal Disease Activity Index (PDAI). Comparisons between groups were carried out with the nonparametric tests, and multiple regression models were used to assess predictors of quality of life. Results The total CGQL score and SF-12 mental component score (MCS) were significantly higher (and thus better) in the seton group than in patients treated without seton. On the contrary, SF-12 physical component score (PCS) was not different between the two groups. HBI was significantly better in patients in the seton group. At multivariate analysis, seton placement and HBI were confirmed to be independent predictors of long-term SF-12 MCS whereas only HBI confirmed to be a predictor of total CGQL score. Conclusions Seton placing during anti-TNF-alpha therapy is independently associated with a better MCS.

Ischaemic injury produced by hilar clamping during partial nephrectomy is the main determinant of renal function loss. The exact measurement of ipsilateral renal function loss can be underestimated by serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR. Few reports of unclamped laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) are available in the literature, although this technique shows promising results. The present study includes a series of patients with the longest follow-up of LPN without hilar clamping and without parenchymal reconstruction. Excellent cancer control and optimum renal functional preservation suggest that this technique could be performed in selected patients, i.e. those with small and peripheral tumours (also classified as low nephrometry score tumours). OBJECTIVE To describe the technique and report the results of 'zero ischaemia', sutureless laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for renal tumours with a low nephrometry score. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between August 2003 and January 2010, data from 101 consecutive patients who underwent 'zero ischaemia', sutureless LPN were collected in a prospectively maintained database. Inclusion criteria were tumour size  4 cm, predominant exophytic growth and intraparenchymal depth  1.5 cm, with a minimum distance of 5 mm from the urinary collecting system. Hilar vessels were not isolated, tumour dissection was performed with 10-mm LigaSure(TM) (Covidien, Boulder, CO, USA) and haemostasis was performed with coagulation and biological haemostatic agents without reconstructing the renal parenchyma. Clinical, perioperative and follow-up data were collected prospectively, and modifications of functional outcome variables were analysed using the paired Wilcoxon test. RESULTS The median (range) tumour size was 2.4 (1.5-4) cm, and the median (range) intraparenchymal depth was 0.7 (0.4-1.4) cm. Hilar clamping was not necessary in any patient, and suture was performed in four patients to ensure complete haemostasis. The median (range) operation duration was 60 (45-160) min, and median (range) intraoperative blood loss was 100 (20-240) mL. Postoperative complications included fever (n= 4), low urinary output (n= 3) and haematoma, which was treated conservatively (n= 2). The median (range) hospital stay was 3 (2-5) days. The pathologist reported 30 benign tumours and renal cell carcinoma in 71 cases (pT1a in 69 patients, and pT1b in two patients). At a median follow-up of 57 months, one patient underwent radical nephrectomy for ipsilateral recurrence. The 1-year median (range) decrease of split renal function at renal scintigraphy was 1 (0-5) %. CONCLUSIONS Zero ischaemia LPN is a reasonable approach to treating small and peripheral tumours, and a sutureless procedure is feasible in most cases. This technique has a low complication rate and provides excellent functional outcome without impairing oncological results.","output":"'Zero ischaemia', sutureless laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal tumours with a low nephrometry score."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), large amounts of antivirals were consumed and released into wastewater, posing risks to the ecosystem and human health. Ozonation is commonly utilized as pre-oxidation process to enhance the disinfection of hospital wastewater during COVID-19 spread. In this study, the transformation of ribavirin, antiviral for COVID-19, during ozone/PMS-chlorine intensified disinfection process was investigated. a?OH followed by O3 accounted for the dominant ribavirin degradation in most conditions due to higher reaction rate constant between ribavirin and a?OH vs. SO4a?- (1.9  109 vs. 7.9  107 M-1 s-1, respectively). During the O3/PMS process, ribavirin was dehydrogenated at the hydroxyl groups first, then lost the amide or the methanol group. Chloride at low concentrations (e.g., 0.5- 2 mg/L) slightly accelerated ribavirin degradation, while bromide, iodide, bicarbonate, and dissolved organic matter all reduced the degradation efficiency. In the presence of bromide, O3/PMS process resulted in the formation of organic brominated oxidation by-products (OBPs), the concentration of which increased with increasing bromide dosage.

Continuing nutritional behaviour resulting from emotional eating, uncontrolled eating and cognitive restriction may turn into eating disorders in the future. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible effects of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social isolation process on individuals' nutritional behaviours and body weight changes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Nutritional behaviours of the participants before the COVID-19 pandemic and in the social isolation process were evaluated with the Three Factor Nutrition Questionnaire. The changes in individuals' body weight during this period were also evaluated. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1036 volunteer individuals (827 women, 209 men) aged 18 years and over participated in the study. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation process, there was an increase in emotional eating and uncontrolled eating behaviours of individuals, but no significant change in cognitive restriction behaviour occurred (P = <000; P = <000 and P = 053, respectively). It was reported that the body weight of 35 % of the individuals who participated in the study increased during this period. CONCLUSION: Social isolation process practiced as a result of COVID-19 pandemic may lead to changes in some nutritional behaviours. Some precautions should be taken to prevent this situation that occurs in nutritional behaviours from causing negative health problems in the future.","output":"Evaluation of nutritional behaviour related to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, which spread to the rest of the world, led the World Health Organization to classify it as a global pandemic. COVID-19 belongs to the Bettacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, and it mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Studies have now confirmed a human-to-human transmission as the primary pathway of spread. COVID-19 patients with a history of diseases such as respiratory system diseases, immune deficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer are prone to adverse events (admission to the intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation or even death). The current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. However, although there is undoubtedly an urgent need to identify effective treatment options against infection with COVID-19, it is equally important to clarify management protocols for the other significant diseases from which these patients may suffer, including cancer. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of patients with COVID-19. It also aims to provide the reader with insights into COVID-19 in pregnant patients and those with cancer, outlining necessary precautions relevant to cancer patients.

PARTICIPANTS: 6 655 672 adults aged 70 years (mean 78.8 years, 55.2% women) who were alive on 15 March 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Having received the first dose of a vaccine against COVID-19 by 15 March 2021. We calculated vaccination rates and estimated unadjusted and adjusted ORs using logistic regression models. RESULTS: By 15 March 2021, 93.2% of people living in England aged 70 years and over had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. While vaccination rates differed across all factors considered apart from sex, the greatest disparities were seen between ethnic and religious groups. The lowest rates were in people of black African and black Caribbean ethnic backgrounds, where only 67.2% and 73.8% had received a vaccine, with adjusted odds of not being vaccinated at 5.01 (95% CI 4.86 to 5.16) and 4.85 (4.75 to 4.96) times greater than the white British group. The proportion of individuals self-identifying as Muslim and Buddhist who had received a vaccine was 79.1% and 84.1%, respectively. Older age, greater area deprivation, less advantaged socioeconomic position (proxied by living in a rented home), being disabled and living either alone or in a multigenerational household were also associated with higher odds of not having received the vaccine.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on how to reduce the spread of the virus and one of the most important measures is social distancing. Maintaining a minimum of one meter distance from other people is strongly suggested to reduce the risk of infection. This has created a strong interest in monitoring the social distances either as a safety measure or to study how the measures have affected human behavior and country-wise differences in this. The need for automatic social distance estimation algorithms is evident, but there is no suitable test benchmark for such algorithms. Collecting images with measured ground-truth pair-wise distances between all the people using different camera settings is cumbersome. Furthermore, performance evaluation for social distance estimation algorithms is not straightforward and there is no widely accepted evaluation protocol. In this paper, we provide a dataset of varying images with measured pair-wise social distances under different camera positionings and focal length values. We suggest a performance evaluation protocol and provide a benchmark to easily evaluate social distance estimation algorithms. We also propose a method for automatic social distance estimation. Our method takes advantage of object detection and human pose estimation. It can be applied on any single image as long as focal length and sensor size information are known. The results on our benchmark are encouraging with 92% human detection rate and only 28.9% average error in distance estimation among the detected people.","output":"Automatic Social Distance Estimation From Images: Performance Evaluation, Test Benchmark, and Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Online sexual health research can be convenient, efficient and low cost, but there are debates about the adequacy of online informed consent, privacy, and the acceptability of different methods of follow-up.

It is composed of 3 different subdimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). In the last years, interest in BS in the neurosurgical community has increased. Here we investigated burnout among neurosurgeons and residents in neurosurgery. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines. A search of bibliographic databases was conducted from study inception to February 2020. A total of 16,377 studies were found. Six articles were included in our final analysis. Their references were checked for additional studies, but none were found. RESULTS: From the initial 16,377 studies identified, only 6 met our inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 3310 physicians. The general prevalence of BS was 48%. The prevalence in neurosurgeons was 51.1%, higher than that recorded in neurosurgical residents (45.4%). Regarding subdimensions, personal accomplishment seemed to be the most influential factor for burnout development among neurosurgeons (42.57%) and residents (51.56%) alike. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery is a rewarding career choice, but numerous challenges and stressors can lead to lower levels of satisfaction and dangerously increased levels of burnout.

SARS-CoV-2 can induce both a classic viral eruption and a paraviral eruption, the meaning of which in terms of pathophysiology and prognosis are very different. Some patients infected with COVID-19 have a papulovesicular eruption involving mainly the trunk. Those patients have active viremia, and some have developed pneumonia and died. Biopsy of the eruption revealed cytopathogenic viral effect, and thus a direct interaction of the virus with the skin; it is, therefore, a classic viral exanthema. Other, mainly young patients, developed chilblains of the fingers and toes 3 or 4weeks after minor signs of COVID-19 or after contact with a diseased person. They did not develop severe COVID-19. Biopsy revealed classic findings of chilblains without cytopathogenic viral effect. Most of those patients did not develop specific antibodies. Those chilblains can be considered as paraviral. Classic viral manifestations are the consequence of a direct interaction of the skin with the virus, while paraviral manifestations result from the activation of the immune system. In the case of paraviral chilblains, I hypothesize that it is the innate immune system that rejects SARS-CoV-2. Chilblains are also observed in rare monogenic disorders called type 1 interferonopathies, where anti-viral innate immunity is abnormally activated. This would explain why these individuals do not develop specific antibodies, because they are probably naturally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection via their innate immune system.","output":"Paraviral eruptions in the era of COVID-19.

A very strong correlation was observed between HHS and MHHS (r=0.995, p=0.000) as well as between HHS and OHS (r=0.845, p=0.003) in the general study population. In subgroup analysis, there was a very strong correlation between HHS and MHHS in primary THA, revision THA, THA in hip HA, and Crowe Type IV DDH groups (r=0.984, p=0.000; r=0.977, p=0.000; r=0.984, p=0.000; and r=0.995, p=0.000; respectively). However, there was a significant correlation between HHS and OHS in these groups except revision THA group (r=0.851, p=0.023; r=0.587, p=0.069; r=0.989, p=0.002; and r=0.965, p=0.000; respectively). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to investigate the usefulness of MHHS and OHS in hip HA and THA in patients with Crowe Type IV DDH. Our findings suggest that MHHS and OHS are useful for evaluating functional outcomes with HA, primary and revision THA, and THA with femoral shortening osteotomy for Crowe type IV DDH.","output":"Correlation between Harris, modified Harris hip, and Oxford hip scores of patients who underwent hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty following hip fracture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We assessed patient-provider communication in HIV care; data were from the 2019 Positive Perspectives Survey of people living with HIV (PLHIV) from 25 countries (n = 2389).

Researchers in Saudi Arabia have reported an increase in physical inactivity among Saudis, especially among University female population. Current efforts in the field in Saudi Arabia have yet to explore barriers and facilitators that influence female University student's participation in physical activity. This study aims to provide an assessment of the situation regarding physical activity among female University students in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This mixed method study preceded a participatory action research initiative. The first part of the mixed method consisted of a cross-sectional survey of 375 female University students in Saudi Arabia who completed the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The second part consisted of semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 14 female University students and 16 female exercise trainers. Results: Results showed that most participants (91%) spent more time in walking activity compared to moderate (66%) and vigorous activity (57%) for at least 10 min at a time over a period of 7 days. Results showed that 70% of participants did not meet the WHO recommendation of 150 min per week of moderate activity, while around 62% of participants did not meet the WHO recommendation of 75 min per week of vigorous activity. Barriers to participation included limited facilities for physical activities, academic workload, gender role, and the need to adhere to cultural standards. Facilitators included valuing positive results, general health concerns, and family support. Conclusion: Knowledge gained from this study might support organizations and public health authorities to develop physical activity interventions that better address Saudi women's perceived needs.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-stage proportionate stratified cluster sample was designed for the survey. 22 600 students were screened for visual acuity in schools; 5944 of them were selected for analysis as a nationally representative sample. Those with 20/40 or worse vision were referred to photoscreening and rapid ophthalmic assessment in schools and then were provided with vouchers for free comprehensive eye examination in eye clinics. Data were collected through data collection forms and analysed using SPSS V.23. RESULTS: While majority of the children (85%) had normal vision, 15% had a visual acuity 20/40. The prevalence of vision impairment (VI) in at least one eye was 9.7% and blindness in at least one eye was 0.05%. The prevalence of abnormal vision and VI was higher among girls and older children. VI was more prevalent in urban areas. The most common diagnoses were myopia (60%), astigmatism (33.7%), hyperopia (29.5%) and strabismus (3.8%).

This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive.

An extensive literature has examined the effect of inequality on health, finding health outcomes to be worse in more unequal countries. Among the measures of health used are life expectancy, mental illness, obesity, infant mortality, teenage births, homicides, imprisonment, etc., or some weighted index of such measures. While these measures of health are informative, they are indirect. Secondly, many studies fail to establish an independent effect of inequality on health. Finally, as noted, if the individual-level relationship between health and income is non-linear, cross-section studies may detect a spurious association between inequality and health due to an aggregation problem.This paper studies the relationship between the incidence of infectious disease, a direct and vital measure of health, and ambient income inequality. Our hypothesis is, the more income-unequal a society, the higher the chance a random mixing of people from different income strata brings the infected and uninfected closer, thereby raising disease spread. This implies two countries with similar per capita incomes but with varying levels of income inequality can exhibit very different trajectories of disease spread. We investigate this causal pathway by examining whether countries with elevated levels of income inequality have higher rates of Tuberculosis (TB) incidence per capita. The choice of TB is appropriate because it is an enduring, serious threat to global public health, the leading cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide. Moreover, it is well known that the four stages of TB pathogenesis (exposure to infection, progression to disease, late or inappropriate diagnosis and treatment, and treatment adherence) vary across rich and poor individuals.MethodsWe used publicly available panel data for one hundred and thirty-three countries between 1997 and 2013. The data include TB incidence and prevalence per 100,000 people. It also contains data on income inequality (Gini coefficient) both across countries and across time within countries. Our multivariate regression model controlled, among other variables, for economic output per capita, HIV prevalence, public health expenditures, population density, and poverty, and also incorporated a country-level fixed effect and time-fixed effects. A novel correction for aggregation bias using data on diabetes (a non-communicable disease) is also applied.FindingsOverall, elevated levels of income inequality were positively associated and causally connected to tuberculosis prevalence. All else same, countries with income-Gini coefficients a mere 10% apart would likely see a 5% difference in tuberculosis prevalence.InterpretationLike any air-borne infectious disease, TB is akin to a pollutant that spoils air quality and makes it unhealthy for all who breathe it. Our findings suggest a significant cause of this externality is ambient income inequality. In effect, TB is a negative externality whose reach amplified by income inequality. Around the world, the emergence of COVID-19 has renewed focus on the importance of reducing income differences. We join in that chorus by arguing that policy action aimed at reducing income inequities could directly contribute to a reduced TB burden by reducing the chance of infection spread via contact between the poor and the rich.","output":"Infectious Disease as a Mechanism Linking Health and Income Inequality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Myanmar had one of the lowest confirmed COVID-19 caseloads in the world in mid-2020 and was one of the few developing countries not projected to go into economic recession. However, macroeconomic projections are likely to be a poor guide to individual and household welfare in a fast-moving crisis that has involved disruption to an unusually wide range of sectors and livelihoods. To explore the impacts of COVID-19 disruptions on household poverty and coping strategies, as well as maternal food insecurity experiences, this study used a telephone survey conducted in June and July 2020 covering 2,017 mothers of nutritionally vulnerable young children in urban Yangon and rural villages of Myanmars Dry Zone.Stratifying results by location, livelihoods, and asset-levels, and using retrospective questions on pre-COVID-19 incomes and various COVID-19 impacts, we find that the vast majority of households have been adversely affected from loss of income and employment. Over three-quarters cite income/job losses as the main impact of COVID-19 C median incomes declined by one third and $1.90/day income-based poverty rose by around 27 percentage points between January and June 2020. Falling into poverty was most strongly associated with loss of employment (including migrant employment), but also with recent childbirth. The poor commonly coped with income losses through taking loans/credit, while better-off households drew down on savings and reduced non-food expenditures. Self-reported food insecurity experiences were much more common in the urban sample than in the rural sample, even though income-based and asset-based poverty were more prevalent in rural areas. In urban areas, around one quarter of respondents were worried about food quantities and quality, and around 10 percent stated that there were times when they had run out of food or gone hungry. Respondents who stated that their household had lost income or experienced food supply problems due to COVID-19 were more likely to report a variety of different food insecurity experiences.These results raise the concern that the welfare impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are much more serious and widespread than macroeconomic projections would suggest. Loss of employment and casual labor are major drivers of increasing poverty. Consequently, economic recovery strategies must emphasize job creation to revitalize damaged livelihoods. However, a strengthened social protection strategy should also be a critical component of economic recovery to prevent adversely affected households from falling into poverty traps and to avert the worst forms of food insecurity and malnutrition, particularly among households with pregnant women and young children.

All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between hospitalization and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.4715.62, were analyzed. Men were about 1.54 times more likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37C1.74); individuals aged 50C74 and 74 were more likely to be hospitalized than people aged 25C49 (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81C2.32, and OR 3.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90C5.15, respectively).

Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR = 1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30C1.81) and individuals aged 50C74 and 75 were more likely to die than people aged 25C49 (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63C2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80C4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination conveyed a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR = 2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50C2.93).

DESIGN In an online survey, 10,061 responded at T1. At T2, these respondents were asked to complete the survey again, and 4936 (49.1%) of them responded. RESULTS Loneliness decreased from T1 to T2, but only to a minor extent. Using a multilevel approach, younger age was found to be related to more reduction of loneliness from T1 to T2. Higher health anxiety was found to predict less reduction of loneliness across time. Reduction of maladaptive coping strategies and negative metacognitive beliefs from T1 to T2 were both associated with reduction in loneliness. In turn, reductions in loneliness were associated with reductions of depression and anxiety symptoms.

Our aim in this study is to determine which scoring system is most useful in determining disease severity and to guide clinicians. Materials: and Methods We classified the patients into two groups according to the stage of the disease (severe and non-severe) by using the slightly modified and adopted interim guidance of the World Health Organization. Severe cases were divided into a group of surviving patients and a deceased group according to the prognosis. According to admission values, the BCRSS, qSOFA, SOFA, MuLBSTA, and HScore were evaluated at admission using the worst parameters available in the first 24 hours. Results: Of the 417 patients included in our study, 46 (11%) were in the severe group, while 371 (89%) were in the non-severe group. Of these 417 patients, 230 (55.2%) were men. The median (IQR) age of all patients was 44 (25) years. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, BRCSS in the highest tertile (HR: 6.1, 95% CI: 2.105C17.674, p = 0.001) was determined as an independent predictor of severe disease in cases of COVID-19. In multivariate analyses, qSOFA was also found to be an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 (HR: 4.757, 95% CI: 1.438C15.730, p = 0.011). The area under the curve (AUC) of the BRCSS, qSOFA, SOFA, MuLBSTA, and HScore was 0.977, 0.961, 0.958, 0.860, and 0.698, respectively. Conclusion: Calculation of the BRCSS and qSOFA at the time of hospital admission can predict critical clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and their predictive value is superior to that of HScore, MuLBSTA, and SOFA.

Effective drugs are urgently needed to decrease the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently unavailable. Herein, we systematically evaluated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of both lung tissue and blood from COVID-19 patients using transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed potential core mechanism of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in which IFN-&#945;, IFN-?, IFN-?3, TNF and IL6 triggered cytokine storm mediated by neutrophil, macrophage, B and DC cells. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two gene modules that are highly correlated with clinical traits of COVID-19 patients, and confirmed that over-activation of immune system-mediated cytokine release syndrome is the underlying pathogenic mechanism for acute phase of COVID-19 infection.

We tested the hypothesis that infusion of BNP after an acute myocardial infarction would reduce left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes and improve left ventricular ejection fraction compared with placebo. METHODS A total of 58 patients who underwent successful revascularisation for an acute ST elevation anterior myocardial infarction were randomised to receive 72-hour infusion of BNP at 0.006 g/kg/min or placebo. Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction were measured at baseline and at 30 days by multigated acquisition scan. Left ventricular infarction size was measured by cardiac MRI. RESULTS BNP infusion led to significantly higher BNP levels and plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate at 72 hours. No significant difference in change of left ventricular volumes or ejection fraction from baseline to 30 days was observed between groups. Although left ventricular infarction size measured by cardiac MRI was not significantly different between BNP infusion versus placebo (p=0.39), there was a trend towards reduced infarction size in patients with a baseline ejection fraction of <40% (p=0.14). CONCLUSIONS Infusion of BNP in patients with an anterior myocardial infarction did not affect parameters of left ventricular remodelling. Patients treated with BNP who had a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction of <40% had a trend towards reduced left ventricular infarction size compared with placebo. These results do not support the use of intravenous BNP in patients after recent myocardial infarction.

Our study found that gamification using a reward-based system is a strategy that can improve the educational experience under exceptional circumstances. This article reports the results of two gamified undergraduate courses (Calculus and Development of Transversal Competencies) designed with a reward system. The results derived from analyses of online surveys, the final grades, and their correlations revealed that gamification helped motivate students to participate actively and improved their academic performance, in a setting where the mode of instruction was remote, synchronous, and online. From the results we conclude that gamification favours the relationship between attention, participation, and performance, while promoting the humanisation of virtual environments created during academic confinement. Implications for practice or policy: Gamification using a reward based system promoted active class participation and improved student performance after the transition from face-to-face to virtual instruction required as a result of the global pandemic. Systemic recognition in a reward-based system improved the participants' emotional states, reducing their anxiety and the feeling of isolation caused by the pandemic, and leading to student engagement with.

In this report, we outline the clinical presentation of a 40-year-old male who developed severe coughing and sneezing before presenting to the emergency department with confusion, somnolence, and respiratory distress. CT head without contrast revealed extensive pontine and midbrain hemorrhage with intraventricular extension and early hydrocephalus. Neurological examination revealed pinpoint, minimally reactive pupils, withdrawal to painful stimuli in the right hemibody, left hemibody paresis, and intact left corneal, cough, and gag reflexes. MRI and MRA brain revealed no evidence of an underlying vascular lesion. Over the next two days, the patient had worsening multiorgan failure and hypoxemia without intracranial hypertension. He remained too unstable to undergo cerebral angiogram. On hospital day four, his neurological examination deteriorated to quadriparesis and only cough and gag reflexes remaining intact after which his family opted for comfort measures only.

However, current COVID-19 vaccination trials are not adequately representing a diverse participant population in terms of age, ethnicity and comorbidities. Achieving the representative recruitment targets that are adequately powered to the study remains one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial management. To ensure accuracy and generalisability of the safety and efficacy conclusions generated by clinical trials, it is crucial to recruit patient cohorts as representative as possible of the future target population. Missing these targets can lead to reduced validity of the study results and can often slow down drug development leading to costly delays. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the key factors related to perceptions and participation in vaccination trials. METHODS: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK. Statistical analysis was done in six phases. Multi-nominal logistic models examined demographic and geographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. RESULTS: The survey had 4884 participants of which 9.44% were Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME). Overall, 2020 (41.4%) respondents were interested in participating in vaccine trials; 27.6% of the respondents were not interested and 31.1% were unsure. The most interested groups were male (OR = 1.29), graduates (OR = 1.28), the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups (OR = 1.88 and OR = 1.46 respectively) and those with no health issues (OR = 1.06). The least interested groups were BAME (OR = 0.43), those from villages and small towns (OR = 0.66 and 0.54 respectively) and those aged 70 and above (OR = 1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In order to have a vaccination that is generalisable to the entire population, greater work needs to be done in engaging a diverse cohort of participants. Public health campaigns need to be targeted in improving trial recruitment rates for the elderly, BAME community and the less educated rural population.","output":"The UPTAKE study: implications for the future of COVID-19 vaccination trial recruitment in UK and beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of confirmed cases were reported in almost all major countries and territories ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 in the early 2020.

Differentiation between pure viral COVID-19 pneumonia and secondary infection can be challenging. In patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission physicians often decide to prescribe antibiotic therapy. However, overuse of anti-infective therapy in the pandemic should be avoided to prevent increasing antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin (PCT) and CRP have proven useful in other lower respiratory tract infections and might help to differentiate between pure viral or secondary infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 between 6th March and 30th October 2020. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory findings with focus on PCT and CRP levels and microbiology results were evaluated. Patients with and without secondary bacterial infection in relation to PCT and CRP were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the best discriminating cut-off value of PCT and CRP with the corresponding sensitivity and specificity was calculated. RESULTS: Out of 99 inpatients (52 ICU, 47 Non-ICU) with COVID-19, 32 (32%) presented with secondary bacterial infection during hospitalization. Patients with secondary bacterial infection had higher PCT (0.4 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p = 0.016) and CRP (131 versus 73 mg/L; p = 0.001) levels at admission and during the hospital stay (2.9 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001 resp. 293 versus 94 mg/L; p < 0.001). The majority of patients on general ward had no secondary bacterial infection (93%). More than half of patients admitted to the ICU developed secondary bacterial infection (56%). ROC analysis of highest PCT resp. CRP and secondary infection yielded AUCs of 0.88 (p < 0.001) resp. 0.86 (p < 0.001) for the entire cohort. With a PCT cut-off value at 0.55 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 91% with a specificity of 81%; a CRP cut-off value at 172 mg/L yielded a sensitivity of 81% with a specificity of 76%.

We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.","output":"Analysis of a mathematical model for COVID-19 population dynamics in Lagos, Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper presents a new mathematical model for the SARS-CoV-2 virus propagation, designed to include all the possible actions to prevent the spread and to help in the healing of infected people After a discussion on the equilibrium and stability properties of the model, the effects of each different control actions on the evolution of the epidemic spread are analysed, through numerical evaluations for a more intuitive and immediate presentation, showing the consequences on the classes of the population","output":"Evaluation of the effect of different policies in the containment of epidemic spreads for the COVID-19 case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and MethodsProfessionals in Liverpool have designed the IMPaCT (Integrated Mersey Palliative Care Team) model of care to improve access for patients, their families and other professionals The COVID-19 pandemic enabled implementation of this much more quickly than envisaged The IMPaCT service in North Liverpool was piloted over July to September 2020 and went live in October The Hub accepts calls and referrals from anyone and comprises coordinators from hospice outpatient, hospital and community palliative care specialist nursing teams This single point of access allows for sharing of information, elimination of duplication, and reduces delays in care Patients are no longer discharged when they move between settings;once they are referred to the IMPaCT service, they remain on the locality caseload until their death ResultsIn North Liverpool 136 patients have been regularly reviewed under the newly formed nurse-led surveillance clinic in place of the old medical outpatient system Where medical input was required, advice could be sought from the hub doctor and patients could be seen in the new ambulatory clinic or at home as needed Of 21 patients were referred for hospice inpatient admission, 18 were admitted within 1 day, an improvement on the 2019C2020 average time from referral to admission of 3 working days Of 26 patients triaged for medical outpatient review 23 were reviewed within 24 hours (8 same day) a the previous average was 15 working days from referral to appointment ConclusionsThe switch to a daily ambulatory clinic has improved timeliness of medical assessment and domiciliary visits have been completed in a more timely manner due to freeing up medical availability Co-location of team members has enhanced information sharing and transfer of care between settings Patients, carers and staff have reported the benefits of reduced waiting times for specialist input across the services","output":"105 Breaking barriers and building bridges: a synergistic future for palliative care in Liverpool"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Based on the recent literature, chest computed tomography (CT) examination could aid for management of patients during COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of chest CT in management of COVID-19 patients is not exactly the same for medical or surgical specialties. In orthopaedic or trauma emergency, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, dorsal, and lumbar spine CT are performed to investigate patients; the result is a thoracic CT scan incorporating usually the thorax; however, information about lung parenchyma can be obtained on this thorax CT, and manifestations of COVID-19 can be diagnosed. The objective of our study was to evaluate this role in orthopedic patients to familiarize orthopaedists with the value and limits of thoracic CT in orthopaedic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among the 1397 chest CT scans performed during the pandemic period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, in two centres with orthopaedic surgery, we selected all the 118 thoracic or chest CT performed for patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with a diagnosis of trauma for orthopaedic surgical treatment. Thirty-nine of these 118 patients were tested with PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Depending on clinical status (symptomatic or non-symptomatic), the information useful for the orthopaedist surgeon and obtained from the Chest CT scan according to the result of the PCR (gold standard) was graded from 0 (no or low value) to 3 (high value). The potential risks of chest CT as exposure to radiation, and specific pathway were analyzed and discussed. A group of patients treated during a previous similar period (1 March 2018 to 15 April 2018) was used as control for evaluation of the increase of CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among the 118 patients with chest CT, there were 16 patients with positive COVID-19 chest CT findings, and 102 patients with negative chest CT scan. With PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 81%, 93%, and 86%, respectively (p = 0.001). A useful information for the orthopaedic surgeon (graded as 1 for 71 cases, as 2 for 5 cases, and as 3 for 11 cases) was obtained from 118 chest CT scans for 87 (74%) patients, while the CT was no value in 30 (25%) cases, and negative value in one (1%) case. Roughly 20% of the total number of CT scanner performed over the pandemic period was dedicated to COVID-19, but only 2% were for orthopaedic or trauma patients. However, this was ten times higher than during the previous control period of comparison. CONCLUSION: Although extremely valuable for surgery management, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied are not specific for COVID-19, and the positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, which was the case during this period.","output":"Thoracic computerised tomography scans in one hundred eighteen orthopaedic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: identification of chest lesions; added values; help in managing patients; burden on the computerised tomography scan department"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. METHODS: Data of 45,160 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; 4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; 4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use was associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%).

METHOD We performed a systematic literature search on articles that evaluate the efficacy and safety of PulseRider-assisted coiling of the wide-necked aneurysm from several electronic databases. The primary endpoint was adequate occlusion, defined as Raymond-Roy Class I + Raymond-Roy Class II upon immediate angiography and at six-month follow-up. RESULTS There were a total of 157 subjects from six studies. The rate of adequate occlusion on immediate angiography was 90% (95% CI, 85%-94%) and 91% (95% CI, 85%-96%) at six-month follow-up. Of these, Raymond-Roy Class I can be observed in 48% (95% CI, 41%-56%) of aneurysms immediately after coiling, and 64% (95% CI, 55%-72%) of aneurysms on six-month follow-up. Raymond-Roy Class II was found in 30% (95% CI, 23%-37%) of aneurysms immediately after coiling, and 25% (17-33) after six-month follow-up. Complications occur in 5% (95% CI, 1%-8%) of the patients.

Despite this large body of research, few studies have attempted to evaluate racial discrimination as a casual factor of worse health among racial minority groups. The current study utilized nationally representative data to estimate the causal effect of racial discrimination on cardiovascular disease (CVD), self-rated physical health (SRH), body mass index (BMI), depression disorder, and substance use disorder. In addition, we examined whether the effect of racial discrimination on health was moderated by socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, marital status, geographic location, and health insurance coverage). METHODS Data were from the combined National Survey of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Study. We applied a propensity score weighting approach to estimate the differences between individuals who reported ever (N = 4358) or never (N = 1836) experiencing racial discrimination on a list of health outcomes (e.g., CVD, SRH, BMI, depression disorder, and substance use disorder). RESULTS Participants who reported ever experiencing racial discrimination were about 5 % higher CVD risk, had 0.12 points lower SRH, a 3 % higher probability of a depression disorder, and a 2 % higher probability of a substance use disorder. Moderation effects by race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and health insurance coverage were found.

However, the underlying mechanism is not yet understood. Tea, for its polyphenol content, has also been investigated. The main objective of this research was to concurrently study gastric emptying, appetite perceptions and glycemic responses to bread consumed with water, tea, or lemon juice. METHODS In this randomized, crossover intervention, ten participants consumed equal portions of bread (100 g) with 250 mL of water, water-diluted lemon juice, or black tea at breakfast. Gastric volumes, blood glucose concentrations and appetite perceptions were alternately assessed over 180 min using magnetic resonance imaging, the finger-prick method and visual analogue scales, respectively. RESULTS Compared to water, lemon juice led to a 1.5 fold increase of the volume of gastric contents, 30 min after the meal (454.0  18.6 vs. 298.4  19.5 mL, [Formula: see text]  SEM P < 0.00001). Gastric emptying was also 1.5 times faster (P < 0.01). Conversely, lemon juice elicited a lower glycemic response than water (blood glucose concentrations at t = 55 min were 35% lower, P = 0.039). Tea had no effect. Changes in appetite perceptions and gastric volumes correlated well, but with no significant differences between the meals. CONCLUSIONS Lemon juice lowered the glycemic response and increased both gastric secretions and emptying rate. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the reduction of the glycemic response is mainly due to the interruption of starch hydrolysis via the acid-inhibition of salivary -amylase.

Failure to fight the pandemic with considerable success subsequently raised the topic of revising the policymakers previous predictions at the start of the pandemic based on incomplete information. So, the calendar put forward for the pandemic went forward day by day, and the authorities who failed to adopt a prudent approach were obliged to pay increasingly higher costs for their mistakes. In the chapter, the financial and economic effects of the pandemic in selected countries are examined. While examining the policies followed in these countries, in terms of fiscal stimulus packages and monetary expansion packages, it is aimed to shed light on the pandemic experience in the Turkish economy and to develop policy recommendations. Thus the persistence of the pandemic pushes all countries to update their current policies and seek new methods.

Nasal swabs from 667 equids with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs were tested by qPCR for SARS-CoV-2. Further, 633 serum samples collected from a cohort of 587 healthy racing Thoroughbreds with possible exposure to humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA targeting the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. All 667 horses with fever and respiratory signs tested qPCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 35/587 (5.9%) Thoroughbred racing horses had detectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. While horses appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 when in close contact with humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical disease was not observed in the study horses. Experimental challenge studies using pure inocula are needed in order to study the clinical, hematological, molecular, and serological features of adult horses infected with SARS-CoV-2. ABSTRACT: More and more studies are reporting on the natural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans with COVID-19 and their companion animals (dogs and cats). While horses are apparently susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the homology between the human and the equine ACE-2 receptor, no clinical or subclinical infection has yet been reported in the equine species. To investigate the possible clinical role of SARS-CoV-2 in equids, nasal secretions from 667 horses with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR. The samples were collected from January to December of 2020 and submitted to a commercial molecular diagnostic laboratory for the detection of common respiratory pathogens (equine influenza virus, equine herpesvirus-1/-4, equine rhinitis A and B virus, Streptococcus equi subspecies equi). An additional 633 serum samples were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA targeting the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The serum samples were collected from a cohort of 587 healthy racing Thoroughbreds in California after track personnel tested qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. While 241/667 (36%) equids with fever and respiratory signs tested qPCR-positive for at least one of the common respiratory pathogens, not a single horse tested qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst the racing Thoroughbreds, 35/587 (5.9%) horses had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Similar to dogs and cats, horses do not seem to develop clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, horses can act as incidental hosts and experience silent infection following spillover from humans with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-infected humans should avoid close contact with equids during the time of their illness.","output":"Investigation of the Role of Healthy and Sick Equids in the COVID-19 Pandemic through Serological and Molecular Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nutraceutical, a term derived from 'nutrition' and 'pharmaceutical', refers to any product isolated from herbs, nutrients, specific diets, processed foods, and beverages used not only for nutritional but also for medicinal purposes [...].","output":"Nutraceuticals in Immune Function"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human travel is one of the primary drivers of infectious disease spread.

We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations.

During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. Results: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and RT-PCR negativity from positivity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 to 15 years demonstrated a longer period of RT-PCR negativity from positivity, compared to patients aged 16 to 22 years (median=32 versus 18 days, p=0.015). Median time to seropositivity from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days while median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as equivalent to 160 titer) was 36 days. Conclusions: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. Whether this correlates with persistent infectivity is unknown.

Known to be more susceptible to the negative effects of COVID-19 and often coping with higher levels of social isolation, many worried that older adults mental health would suffer. While computer-mediated communication (CMC) is on the rise among older adults, whether and how older adults leverage the social benefits of CMC remains underexplored. This study assesses older adults CMC use after COVID and the impact of CMC engagement on access to connection, information, and resources. We follow 22 older adults over 6 weeks, using longitudinal qualitative surveys to study CMC use patterns and mental health outcomes. Results revealed that while older adults exhibited purpose-driven CMC engagement, limited integration into larger online communities restricted access to up-to-the-minute information, notably early in the pandemic. Longitudinal findings show progressively less engagement with online news and information, withdrawal from online social engagement, and a progressive relaxing of social distancing. This study sheds light on how best to reach older adults following disaster, and where older adults may be disadvantaged as social media becomes a modern emergency broadcast system.","output":"Older Adults Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC) Engagement Following COVID-19 and Its Impact on Access to Community, Information, and Resource Exchange: A Longitudinal, Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Few US studies have examined the usefulness of participatory surveillance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for enhancing local health response efforts, particularly in rural settings. We report on the development and implementation of an internet-based COVID-19 participatory surveillance tool in rural Appalachia. METHODS: A regional collaboration among public health partners culminated in the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Self-Checker, a local online symptom tracker. The tool collected data on participant demographic characteristics and health history. County residents were then invited to take part in an automated daily electronic follow-up to monitor symptom progression, assess barriers to care and testing, and collect data on COVID-19 test results and symptom resolution. RESULTS: Nearly 6500 county residents visited and 1755 residents completed the COVID-19 Self-Checker from April 30 through June 9, 2020. Of the 579 residents who reported severe or mild COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 symptoms were primarily reported among women (n = 408, 70.5%), adults with preexisting health conditions (n = 246, 70.5%), adults aged 18-44 (n = 301, 52.0%), and users who reported not having a health care provider (n = 131, 22.6%). Initial findings showed underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic and non-English-speaking groups. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This low-cost internet-based platform provided a flexible means to collect participatory surveillance data on local changes in COVID-19 symptoms and adapt to guidance.

To date, data are limited regarding the trend of liver biochemistries over the course of illness. We aimed to evaluate the trend, etiology, and outcomes associated with liver biochemistries in COVID-19. APPROACH AND RESULTS: A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 were admitted between March 21 and March 28, 2020. The mean age was 57 years, 65% were male, and 28% were Hispanic. At the study conclusion, 6 patients were deceased, 28 were discharged, and 26 remained admitted. Patients who remained admitted were followed for a median of 12 days. Of 60 patients, 41 (69%) had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry on admission. Median aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at admission (46 vs. 30 U/L) and during the hospital course. Aminotransferases rose above normal in 54 (93%) patients, whereas alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin elevations were rare. Ten (17%) patients developed aminotransferases more than 5 times the upper limit of normal. AST highly correlated with ALT throughout the illness course (r = 0.97; P < 0.0001), whereas correlations with markers of muscle injury and inflammation were weak. Statin use was common before (40%) and during admission (80%) at our center, with no difference in peak liver biochemistries between users and nonusers. No demographic or comorbid illness was associated with liver injury. Admission AST (69 vs. 49; P < 0.05), peak AST (364 vs. 77; P = 0.003), and peak ALT (220 vs. 52; P = 0.002) were higher in intubated patients.

Assigning blame to a virus takes attention away from the structural contradictions and instabilities of capitalism that would have led to a crash in any case. This narrative also helps justify non-evidence-based public health policies, including lockdowns, travel bans, closed schools and factories, and forced quarantines of large populations rather than individuals and clustered groups who harbor the infection. Advantages of such drastic measures happen primarily in countries that did not prepare adequately, that did not respond quickly enough with more focused measures to test and isolate people infected with the virus, and that have health care systems either organized by capitalist principles or suffering cutbacks and privatization as a result of capitalist economic ideologies, such as austerity. Authoritarian tactics purportedly intended to protect public health pave the way to antidemocratic rule, militarism, and fascism.

Currently in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear whether antenatal corticosteroids for infant benefit outweigh the potential harm to a pregnant woman with a COVID-19 infection.Objective: To determine at which gestational ages administering antenatal corticosteroids is the optimal management strategy for hospitalized women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) who have a COVID-19 infection.Methods: We designed a decision-analytic model to assess the maternal and infant outcomes associated with antenatal corticosteroid administration for risk of preterm delivery following rupture of membranes in the setting of a COVID-19 infection. We used a theoretical cohort of 10,000 women at each gestational age between 24 and 32 weeks who were hospitalized with PPROM and found to be COVID-19 positive. Maternal outcomes included intensive care unit admission and death related to COVID-19 infection. The infant outcomes of interest included respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, neurodevelopmental delay, and death, and were assessed along with maternal and infant quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to evaluate model assumptions.Results: In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women with COVID-19 infection and preterm prelabor rupture of membrane between 24 and 32 weeks, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths at each gestational age. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths at each gestational age. Antenatal corticosteroid administration also resulted in fewer cases of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and infant death. Overall, we found that between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation, administering antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy as it resulted in higher combined QALYs than no corticosteroid use. For 31 and 32 weeks of gestation, antenatal corticosteroid administration resulted in lower combined QALYs. On sensitivity analyses, we found that with increasing gestational age, the probability which antenatal corticosteroids was the optimal management strategy decreased.Conclusion: Administration of antenatal corticosteroids was an effective management strategy compared to no corticosteroid administration at gestational ages less than 31 weeks. These results provide data for clinicians to utilize when counseling pregnant patients hospitalized with PPROM and have a COVID-19 infection.","output":"Antenatal corticosteroids for pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes: a decision analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/Aims : This study aimed to design a structured simulation training curriculum for upper endoscopy and validate a new assessment checklist.

A total of 5 experienced and 10 novice endoscopists were recruited. All participants performed each of the selected modules twice, and mean and median performance were compared between the two groups. Novices pre-set level of proficiency was set as 2 standard deviations below the mean of experts.

Prolonged fever, particularly that above 39.5 C, is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, little is known about the pathological effects of fever caused by SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Primary bovine alveolar macrophages (PBAMs), RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and THP-1 human cells were transfected with plasmids carrying the genes encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein or receptor-binding domain (RBD). Proteins in the macrophages interacting with S-RBD at 39.5 C or 37 C were identified by immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown, surface plasmon resonance, and immunofluorescence were performed to evaluate the transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) interaction with SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD at 39.5 C. Using an RNA sequencing-based approach, cytokine gene expression induced by SARS-CoV-2 S transfection at 39.5 C and 37.5 C in primary alveolar macrophages was measured. Fluo-4 staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to assess the regulatory function of TRPV2 in intracellular Ca 2+ and cytokines under SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD at 39.5 C. Additionally, cytokine release was examined after TRPV2 knockdown with shRNA oligonucleotides or inhibition using the SKF-96365 antagonist. Results: We identified an interaction between the primary alveolar macrophage receptor TRPV2 and S-RBD under febrile conditions. Febrile temperature promotes Ca2+ influx through SARS-CoV-2 infection in PBAMs, further activates the NF-&#954;B p65 signaling pathway, and enhances the secretion of cytokines. Furthermore, knockdown or antagonist (with SKF-96365) of TRPV2 significantly decreased the release of cytokines that drive the inflammatory response. Conclusion: Collectively, our findings identified TRPV2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in conditions of febrile temperature, providing insight into critical interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with macrophages, as well as a useful resource and potential drug target for coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"TRPV2-spike protein interaction mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into macrophages in febrile conditions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the most crucial health emergencies in the last decade where almost all entities of a nations ecosystem like inhabitants, businesses, governments, economies, and environment are impacted. The large volumes of epidemiological, clinical, personal, and environmental data generated during any pandemic can provide useful insights about the underlying causes, symptoms, relations, and correlations, which if analyzed can assist in mitigating the impact to a great extent. The cheap and easy connectivity and communication provided by the social media platforms (SMP) have established them as one of the most preferred mediums of communications among the masses. The data generated by these platforms can be analyzed in context of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis to provide critical information and insights related to the ground level realities like spread and severity of infection, the state of implementation of control measures, the mental state of individuals, and their needs. The tweets and comments of the users can provide information about the current situation and intensity of the problems in the affected regions. With the help of techniques like sentiment analysis and web mining, we can identify the emergent requirements and needs (like food, shelter, medicine, medical emergencies, security, etc.) of the population in the COVID-19-affected areas. With this chapter we aim to identify several use cases where the big medical data from the patients, epidemiological data, social media data, and environment-related data can be used to identify patterns, causes, and other growing factors of the COVID-19 pandemic with a goal to mitigate the damages and contain further spread of the disease.

However, little is known on the impact of undiagnosed diabetes in the COVID-19 population. We investigated whether diabetes, particularly undiagnosed diabetes, was associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study identified adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Diabetes was determined using patients' past history (diagnosed) or was newly defined if the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at admission was &#8805;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (undiagnosed). The in-hospital mortality rate and survival probability were compared between the non-diabetes and diabetes (overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes) groups. Risk factors of mortality were explored using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 373 patients, 233 were included in the final analysis, among whom 80 (34.3%) had diabetes: 44 (55.0%) reported a diabetes history, and 36 (45.0%) were newly defined as having undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c testing at admission. Compared with the non-diabetes group, the overall diabetes group had a significantly increased mortality rate (22.5% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). Moreover, the overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes groups displayed lower survival probability in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (all p < 0.01). Using multivariate Cox regression, diabetes, age, quick sequential organ failure assessment score, and D-dimer &#8805;1.0 g/mL were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19.

Avian species lack a ubiquitin-like protein found in mammals and other non-avian reptiles; interferon stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15). ISG15 serves as a messenger molecule and can be conjugated to both host and viral proteins leading them to be stabilized, degraded, or sequestered. Structurally, ISG15 is comprised of a tandem ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl), which serves as the motif for post-translational modification. The 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase-like proteins (OASL) also encode two Ubl domains in series near its C-terminus which binds OASL to retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I). This protein-protein interaction increases the sensitivity of RIG-I and results in an enhanced production of type 1 interferons and a robust immune response. Unlike human and other mammalian OASL homologues, avian OASLs terminate their tandem Ubl domains with the same LRLRGG motif found in ubiquitin and ISG15, a motif required for their conjugation to proteins. Chickens, however, lack RIG-I, raising the question of structural and functional characteristics of chicken OASL (chOASL). By investigating chOASL, the evolutionary history of viruses with deubiquitinases can be explored and drivers of species specificity for these viruses may be uncovered. Here we show that the chOASL tandem Ubl domains shares structural characteristics with mammalian ISG15, and that chOASL can oligomerize and conjugate to itself. In addition, the ISG15-like features of avian OASLs and how they impact interactions with viral deubiquitinases and deISGylases are explored.","output":"The Structure and Immune Regulatory Implications of the Ubiquitin-Like Tandem Domain Within an Avian 2-5 Oligoadenylate Synthetase-Like Protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease of the brain, caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV) is usually seen in patients who are immunocompromised.

Thus, the primal variables of both systems can be condensed in the element level leading a positive-definite global problem involving only the degrees of freedom associated with the multipliers. This approach, compared to the classical conforming Raviart-Thomas, present a reduction of the computational cost because, in both problems, the Lagrange multiplier is associated with a scalar field. In this context, a staggered algorithm is employed to decouple the Darcy problem from the convection-diffusion mixed system. However, both formulations are solved at the same time step, and the time discretization adopted for the convection-diffusion problem is the implicit backward Euler method.

Methods & Materials An analysis of pregnancy outcomes was carried out in 40 women who had asymptomatic forms of COVID-19. Results The COVID-19 pandemic in conditions of high fertility in the southern regions of Kazakhstan caused pregnant women to become ill with coronavirus infection, including asymptomatic forms. Often asymptomatic forms remain undiagnosed and unaccounted for. We have studied cases of visits to a doctor by pregnant women for various reasons: stopping fetal movement, reducing the size of the abdomen and other complications of pregnancy. When examining them by ultrasound, oligohydroamnion was detected in 85% of cases, premature aging of the placenta, placental cysts in 27.5%, and impaired blood flow in the utero-fetal-placental circulation in 12.5%. Subsequently, 51.4% of women gave birth at full term, 48.5% gave birth prematurely, that is every second woman in the study group gave birth prematurely. In a detailed retrospective laboratory examination of women with the above pathology, IgG SARS-Cov-2 was detected in 92.5% of cases, indicating an asymptomatic coronavirus infection. The development of obstetric complications required from the medical staff reinforced observation and additional assessment, more frequent reclassification of the condition of the mother and fetus, and in some cases induction of labor. This tactic was applied in 12 cases (34.2% of the total number of women who gave birth), when prolongation of pregnancy was associated with a high risk to the health of the mother and fetus. Conclusion Asymptomatic forms of COVID-19 in pregnant women have long-term consequences in the form of oligohydroamnion, premature aging of the placenta and impaired uterine blood flow. All cases of the transferred coronavirus infection in pregnant women, including asymptomatic ones, require more careful, in comparison with the generally accepted and frequent monitoring of pregnancy, in the form of control of the gravidogram, measurement of the abdominal circumference, the height of the uterine fundus, control ultrasonography of the fetus, amniotic fluid and uterine dopplerometry of fetal-placental blood flow.","output":"Asymptomatic forms of COVID-19 in pregnant women: long-term consequences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bodenbakterien aus der Gruppe der Actinomyceten sind seit langem Lieferanten fr hoch wirksame Antibiotika.

Moreover, the impact of CP treatment on the composition of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19 patients and antibody markers that differentiate between those who survive and those who succumb to the COVID-19 disease are not well understood. Herein, we performed longitudinal analysis of antibody profile on 115 sequential plasma samples from 16 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with either CP or standard of care, only half of them survived. Differential antibody kinetics was observed for antibody binding, IgM/IgG/IgA distribution, and affinity maturation in survived vs. fatal COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, CP treatment did not predict survival. Strikingly, marked decline in neutralization titers was observed in the fatal patients prior to death, and convalescent plasma treatment did not reverse this trend. Furthermore, irrespective of CP treatment, higher antibody affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike was associated with survival outcome, while sustained elevated IgA response was associated with fatal outcome in these COVID-19 patients. These findings propose that treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma should be carefully targeted, and effectiveness of treatment may depend on the clinical and immunological status of COVID-19 patients as well as the quality of the antibodies in the convalescent plasma.","output":"Impact of convalescent plasma therapy on SARS CoV-2 antibody profile in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued guidance authorizing trained pharmacy technicians in all states to administer immunizations.

As of 4 October 2020, there were 1738 reported COVID-19 cases in Kano with 54 associated deaths. In this work, we estimate the number of under-ascertainment cases and the basic reproduction number, B, of COVID-19 in Kano, Nigeria. We also predict the number of COVID-19 cases in the short term. Methods: We employ the exponential growth and modelled the outbreak curve of COVID-19 cases, in Kano, Nigeria from 11 to 30 April 2020. We estimated the number of under-ascertainment cases using the maximum likelihood estimation. We adopted the SI estimated for Hong Kong as approximations of the unknown SI for COVID-19 in Kano to estimate the a. We use ARIMA model to provide a short term (15 days) prediction of the COVID-19 cases in Kano, Nigeria. Results: We revealed that the initial growth phase mimic an exponential growth pattern.

Methods: A two-group, parallel-arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was conducted in six English stop smoking services from 2019-2020. Adults enrolled onto a 12-week programme of in-person one-to-one behavioural smoking cessation support (N=92) were randomised to receive either (i) a nicotine e-cigarette starter-kit alongside varenicline or (ii) varenicline alone. The primary outcome was biochemically-verified abstinence from cigarette smoking between weeks nine-to-12 post quit-date, with those lost to follow-up considered not abstinent. The trial was stopped early due to COVID-19 restrictions and a varenicline recall (92/1266 participants recruited). Results: Nine-to-12-week smoking abstinence rates were 47.9% (23/48) in the e-cigarette-varenicline group compared with 31.8% (14/44) in the varenicline-only group, a 51% increase in abstinence among those offered e-cigarettes; however, the confidence interval (CI) was wide, including the possibility of no difference (risk ratio [RR]=1.51, 95%CI=0.91-2.64). The e-cigarette-varenicline group had 43% lower hazards of relapse from continuous abstinence than the varenicline-only group (hazards ratio [HR]=0.57, 95%CI=0.34-0.96). Attendance for 12 weeks was higher in the e-cigarette-varenicline than varenicline-only group (54.2% versus 36.4%; RR=1.49, 95%CI=0.95-2.47), but similar proportions of participants in both groups used varenicline daily for greater than or equal to 8 weeks after quitting (22.9% versus 22.7%; RR=1.01, 95%CI=0.47-2.20). Estimates were too imprecise to determine how adverse events differed by group. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence suggests offering e-cigarettes alongside varenicline to people receiving behavioural support may be more effective for smoking cessation than varenicline alone. Implications: Offering e-cigarettes to people quitting smoking with varenicline may help them remain abstinent from cigarettes, but the evidence is preliminary because our sample size was smaller than planned (caused by COVID-19 restrictions and a manufacturing recall). This meant our effect estimates were imprecise, and additional evidence is needed to confirm that providing e-cigarettes and varenicline together helps more people remain abstinent than varenicline alone.","output":"E-cigarettes With Varenicline Versus Varenicline for Smoking Cessation: A Pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease once thought to be a respiratory infection is now recognised as a multi-system disease affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, immune, and hematopoietic systems. An emerging body of evidence suggests the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms of varying patterns among some survivors. This study aimed to describe persistent symptoms in COVID-19 survivors and investigate possible risk factors for these persistent symptoms. METHODS: The study used a retrospective study design. The study population comprised of discharged COVID-19 patients. Demographic information, days since discharge, comorbidities, and persistent COVID-19 like symptoms were assessed in patients attending the COVID-19 outpatient clinic in Lagos State. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 15.0 software (StataCorp Texas) with significance placed at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 274 patients were enrolled in the study. A majority were within the age group > 35 to &#8804;49 years (38.3%), and male (66.1%). More than one-third (40.9%) had persistent COVID-19 symptoms after discharge, and 19.7% had more than three persistent COVID-like symptoms. The most persistent COVID-like symptoms experienced were easy fatigability (12.8%), headaches (12.8%), and chest pain (9.8%). Symptomatic COVID-19 disease with moderate severity compared to mild severity was a predictor of persistent COVID-like symptoms after discharge (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggests that patients who recovered from COVID-19 disease may still experience COVID-19 like symptoms, particularly fatigue and headaches.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study drawn from a national surveillance system with propensity score-matched analysis. All cases with suspected MIS-C were reported to the French National Public Health Agency. Confirmed MIS-C cases fulfilling the World Health Organization definition were included. The study started on April 1, 2020, and follow-up ended on January 6, 2021. Exposures: IVIG and methylprednisolone vs IVIG alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was persistence of fever 2 days after the introduction of initial therapy or recrudescence of fever within 7 days, which defined treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included a second-line therapy, hemodynamic support, acute left ventricular dysfunction after first-line therapy, and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit. The primary analysis involved propensity score matching with a minimum caliper of 0.1. Results: Among 181 children with suspected MIS-C, 111 fulfilled the World Health Organization definition (58 females [52%]; median age, 8.6 years [interquartile range, 4.7 to 12.1]). Five children did not receive either treatment. Overall, 3 of 34 children (9%) in the IVIG and methylprednisolone group and 37 of 72 (51%) in the IVIG alone group did not respond to treatment.

Portal vein embolization performed closer to the operation also could be protective, but worsening of portal hyper-perfusion is a major concern. We determined the hepatic hemodynamic effects of a portal vein embolization performed 24 hours prior to hepatic operation. METHODS An extended (90%) hepatectomy was performed in swine undergoing (portal vein embolization) or not undergoing (control) a portal vein embolization 24 hours earlier (n = 10/group). Blood tests, hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, hepatic function (plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green), liver histology, and volumetry (computed tomographic scanning) were assessed before and after the hepatectomy. Hepatocyte proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and hepatic gene expression also were evaluated. RESULTS Swine in the control and portal vein embolization groups maintained stable systemic hemodynamics and developed similar increases of portal blood flow (302  72% vs 486  92%, P = .13). Portal pressure drastically increased in Controls (from 9.4  1.3 mm Hg to 20.9  1.4 mm Hg, P < .001), while being markedly attenuated in the portal vein embolization group (from 11.4  1.5 mm Hg to 16.1  1.3 mm Hg, P = .061). The procedure also improved the preservation of the hepatic artery blood flow, liver function, and periportal edema. These effects occurred in the absence of hepatocyte proliferation or hepatic growth and were associated with the induction of the vasoprotective gene Klf2. CONCLUSION Portal vein embolization preconditioning represents a potential hepato-protective strategy for extended hepatic resections. Further preclinical studies should assess its medium-term effects, including survival. Our study also supports the relevance of hepatic hemodynamics as the main pathogenetic factor of post-hepatectomy liver failure.","output":"Preconditioning by portal vein embolization modulates hepatic hemodynamics and improves liver function in pigs with extended hepatectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Weaning parameters are commonly measured through an endotracheal tube in mechanically ventilated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure, however this practice has rarely been evaluated in tracheostomized patients. This study aimed to investigate changes in weaning parameters measured before and after tracheostomy, and to explore whether the data measured after tracheostomy were associated with weaning outcomes in difficult-to-wean patients. METHODS In a two-year study period, we enrolled orotracheally intubated patients who were prepared for tracheostomy due to difficult weaning. Weaning parameters were measured before and after the conversion to tracheostomy and compared, and the post-tracheostomy data were tested for associations with weaning outcomes. RESULTS A total of 86 patients were included. After tracheostomy, maximum inspiratory pressure (mean difference () = 4.4, 95% CI, 2.7 to 6.1, P<0.001), maximum expiratory pressure ( = 5.4, 95% CI, 2.9 to 8.0, P<0.001) and tidal volume ( = 33.7, 95% CI, 9.0 to 58.5, P<0.008) significantly increased, and rapid shallow breathing index ( = -14.6, 95% CI, -25.4 to -3.7, P<0.009) and airway resistance ( = -4.9, 95% CI, -5.8 to -4.0, P<0.001) significantly decreased. The patients who were successfully weaned within 90 days of the initiation of mechanical ventilation had greater increments in maximum inspiratory pressure (5.9 vs. 2.4, P = 0.04) and maximum expiratory pressure (8.0 vs. 2.0, P = 0.02) after tracheostomy than those who were unsuccessfully weaned. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the conversion from endotracheal tube to tracheostomy significantly improved the measured values of weaning parameters in difficult-to-wean patients who subsequently weaned successfully from the mechanical ventilator.

The pandemic attracted global attention with consequential multiple economic, social, and clinical studies. Among causes of poor clinical outcome of the disease are therapeutic challenges, leading to spirals of studies in search for better therapeutic alternatives. Despite the worsening circumstances of the pandemic, no drug has yet shown remarkable efficacy in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients in large-scale trials. Many potential therapeutic strategies, including the use of nucleotide analogs, chloroquine phosphate, arbidol, protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir), plasma, monoclonal antibodies, plastic antibodies based on Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), nanomaterials, vaccine, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have emerged with various degrees of successes. Remdesivir and dexamethasone have now been licensed based on the results of randomized controlled trials.

We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers along with 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC-I and II alleles respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. The vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, with triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations.

reduce cartilage loss via inhibition of the enzymatic cleavage of aggrecan (a key component of cartilage) S201086/GLPG1972 has been shown to reduce cartilage degradation in preclinical models of OA Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S201086/GLPG1972 in patients with knee OA Methods: ROCCELLA was a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study comprising a 5-week screening period, a 52-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week safety follow-up period (ClinicalTrials gov ID: ) Patients aged 40-75 years with knee OA and pain severity in the target knee of 40-90 mm on a visual analog scale at screening and baseline were included Target knees had predominant medial compartment disease, with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 or 3 and OARSI medial joint space narrowing (JSN) grade 1 or 2 Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to placebo or 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg S201086/GLPG1972 administered orally once daily Concomitant analgesics (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen) were permitted The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 in cartilage thickness of the central medial femorotibial compartment (cMFTC) of the target knee, as measured by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) and analyzed by a central reading facility Secondary efficacy endpoints included: change from baseline to week 52 in radiographic joint space width of the target knee (JSW;X-ray with central readout);patient-reported outcomes (including WOMAC scores, patient global assessment [PGA] score and pain score, both measured by visual analog scales);and safety outcomes A mixed-effects model for repeated measures (using all longitudinal observations at each post-baseline visit) was used for the primary analysis Results: Across 12 countries, 3319 patients were screened and 932 were included in the study Patients had a mean age of 62 9 years and the majority (69 3%) were women Baseline characteristics were similar across study groups (Table 1) Overall, 88 8% of knees were KL grade 3 and 67 3% were OARSI medial JSN grade 2 Patients experienced substantial cartilage loss;the mean (SD) change in cMFTC cartilage thickness was ?0 12 (0 27) mm from baseline to week 52 in the placebo group However, no statistically significant differences between treatment groups and placebo were observed for the primary endpoint of cMFTC cartilage thickness loss (placebo vs 75 mg, p = 0 165;vs 150 mg, p = 0 939;vs 300 mg, p = 0 682;Figure 1) These results were confirmed by sensitivity analyses assessing the

This study aimed to compare the histopathology between MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable cancers, emphasizing intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) and predominant Gleason pattern 4 subtype. METHODS This single-center retrospective study enrolled 153 consecutive patients with 191 lesions who underwent preoperative multiparametric MRI and subsequent radical prostatectomy. MRI/histopathological findings and area fractions of histological components (cancer cells, stroma, and luminal spaces) of MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable cancers were compared. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact, independent t, or Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS Overall, 148 (77%) and 43 (23%) cancers were MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable, respectively. MRI-detectable cancers were significantly larger than MRI-undetectable cancers (p = 0.03). The percentage of lesions in Grade Group 3 or higher was significantly higher among MRI-detectable cancers than among MRI-undetectable cancers (p = 0.02). MRI detectability of csPCa was associated with increases in relative area fractions of cancer cells (p < 0.001) and decreases in those of stroma (p < 0.001) and luminal spaces (p < 0.001) in prostate cancer (PCa) than the percentage of Gleason pattern 4 (p = 0.09). The percentage of lesions containing IDC-P was similar for MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable cancers (40% vs. 33%; p = 0.48). The distribution of cribriform gland subtypes was not significantly different between MRI-detectable and MRI-undetectable Gleason pattern 4 subtype cancers (p > 0.99). Contrarily, the ratio of fused gland subtype was significantly higher in MRI-detectable than in MRI-undetectable cancers (p = 0.03). Furthermore, the ratio of poorly-formed gland subtype was significantly higher in MRI-undetectable than in MRI-detectable cancers (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS MRI detectability of csPCa is strongly associated with the relative area fractions of cancer cells, stroma, and luminal spaces in PCa rather than conventional histopathological parameters.

While we are beginning to understand the association between EDS and psychological manifestations, it is critical that we further elucidate the relationship between the two. Understanding the correlation between EDS and mental health will better ensure swift diagnosis and effective treatment for patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to systematically examine and report the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the EDS population. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched on June 14, 2021 for articles published from January 2011 to June 2021. We included original, evidence-based, peer-reviewed journal articles in English that reported information on psychiatric disorders among EDS patients. Psychiatric disorders and psychological conditions were limited to those included in the \\"psychology\\" and \\"mental disorders\\" Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search terms defined by the National Library of Medicine. Publications identified utilizing this search strategy by M.K. were imported into the Covidence system, where they first underwent a title and abstract screening process by three independent reviewers (M.K., K.L., H.G.). During the full-text review, two independent reviewers read the full text of the questionable articles to assess their eligibility for inclusion. Studies were excluded if they did not meet our target objective or if they were not in English or if they were opinion pieces, conference abstracts, or review articles. Data were extracted from the shortlisted studies by reviewers. During the data extraction phase, the quality and risk of publication bias were assessed by two independent reviewers utilizing the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Study Quality Assessment Tools. Any disagreements in study selection, data extraction, or quality assessment were adjudicated via discussion between the two reviewers, utilizing a third reviewer as a decider if necessary. RESULTS: Out of 73 articles identified, there were no duplicates. A total of 73 records were screened, but only 40 articles were assessed in full text for eligibility. A total of 23 articles were ultimately included, which collectively discussed 12,298 participants. Ten (43.5%) of the included studies were cross-sectional in design, three (13.0%) were case reports, and three (13.0%) were retrospective chart reviews. The remaining seven (30.4%) articles were either case-control, cohort, qualitative, controlled observational, or validation studies. Twelve (52.2%) of the studies reported data on depression disorders, six of which reported prevalence data. Nine (39.1%) of the studies reported data on anxiety disorders, five of which reported prevalence data. Studies that reported nonprevalence data presented odds-ratio, mean scores on psychiatric evaluations, and other correlation statistics. Psychiatric disorders that were most reported in these articles were mood disorders (n=11), anxiety disorders (n=9), and neurodevelopmental disorders (n=7). Although the reports varied, the highest psychiatric prevalence reports in EDS patients involved language disorders (63.2%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (52.4%), anxiety (51.2%), learning disabilities (42.4%), and depression (30.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Although mood disorders were cited in more articles, the highest reported prevalence was for language disorders and ADHD.

Moreover, the proposed two-phase model is compared with a single-phase approach in which all stages are considered dependent on each other as parts of a centralized SC.

We present computational evidence that these viral families might utilize specific conserved polar residues to constitute an aqueous pore within the membrane-spanning region. We reconstruct an evolutionary history of these families and objectively establish the common origin of the M proteins of CoVs and Toroviruses. We also show that the divergent ORF3 clade (ORF3a/ORF3b/ORF3c/ORF5 families) represents a duplication stemming from the M protein in alpha- and beta-CoVs. By phyletic profiling of major structural components of primary nidoviruses, we present a hypothesis for their role in virion assembly of CoVs, ToroVs and Arteriviruses. The unification of diverse M/ORF3 ion channel families in a wide range of nidoviruses, especially the typical M protein in CoVs, reveal a conserved, previously under-appreciated role of ion channels in virion assembly and membrane budding.

Given the persistent nature of the pandemic, many HEIs have continued to deliver courses online and/or use a blended learning approach. However, there are concerns around differences in student access to digital learning resources while at home, including high quality broadband connectivity. This is important, since variation in connectivity may impact the type of online/blended model that faculty can deliver or constrain student engagement with online content. In this context, this paper combines national data on the domiciles of students enrolled in Irish HEIs with detailed spatial data on broadband coverage to estimate the number of higher education students at risk of poor access to high quality internet connectivity. Overall it finds that one-in-six students come from areas with poor broadband coverage, with large disparities by geography and by HEI. It also finds that students from the poorest broadband coverage areas are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. As a result, this paper recommends that HEIs use their detailed registration data to help identify and support at-risk students. In particular, the results suggest that some HEIs may need to prioritise access to campus facilities and services to less well-off students living in poor broadband coverage areas.

Despite this potential, only 15% of pediatric primary care clinicians reported using telemedicine as of 2016, with the majority identifying inadequate payment for these services as the largest barrier. The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in payment and regulations surrounding telehealth, allowing for integration into primary care pediatrics. OBJECTIVE: Due to limited use of telemedicine in primary care pediatrics prior to COVID-19, much is unknown about the role of telemedicine in pediatric primary care. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between practice-level telemedicine use within a large pediatric primary care network and practice characteristics, telemedicine visit diagnoses, in-person visit volume, child-level variation in telemedicine use and clinician attitudes towards telemedicine. METHODS: We analyzed electronic health record data from 45 primary care practices and administered a clinician survey to practice clinicians. Practices were stratified into tertiles based on rates of telemedicine use (low, intermediate, high) per 1000 patients per week during a two-week period (4/19-5/2/2020). By practice tertile, we compared (1) practice characteristics, (2) telemedicine visit diagnoses, (3) in-person visit rates to office, urgent care and emergency department, (4) child-level variation in telemedicine use and (5) clinician attitudes towards telemedicine across these practices. RESULTS: Across pediatric primary care practices, telemedicine visit rates ranged from 5 to 23 telemedicine visits per 1000 patients per week. Across all tertiles, the most frequent telemedicine visit diagnoses were mental health (28-36% of visits) and dermatologic (15-28%). Compared to low telemedicine use practices, high telemedicine use practices had fewer in-person office visits (10 vs. 16 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.005), but overall more total encounters (in-office and telemedicine: 28 vs. 22 visits per 1000 patients per week, P=0.006). Telemedicine use varied with child age, race and ethnicity, and recent preventive care, but no significant interactions existed between these characteristics and practice-level telemedicine use. Finally, clinician attitudes regarding the usability and impact of telemedicine did not vary significantly across tertiles. CONCLUSIONS: Across a network of pediatric practices, we identified significant practice-level variation in telemedicine use, with increased use associated with more varied telemedicine diagnoses, fewer in-person office visits, and increased overall primary care encounter volume. Thus in the context of the pandemic when underutilization of primary care was prevalent, higher practice-level telemedicine use supported pediatric primary care encounter volume closer to usual rates. Child-level telemedicine use differed by child age, race/ethnicity, and recent preventive care, building upon prior concerns about differences in access to telemedicine. However, increased practice-level use of telemedicine services was not associated with reduced nor worsened differences in utilization, suggesting further work is needed to promote equitable access to primary care telemedicine.","output":"Practice-level variation in telemedicine use in a pediatric primary care network during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the article a virus transmission model is constructed on a simplified social network. The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly distributed and undirected. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that at the end of the first epidemic wave, the infection was twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) and data assimilation approach to estimate the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty and to inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic, the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus biology, i.e. its reproduction number. In the controlled epidemic with low ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range forecasts. Virus transmission models with accurate social network models are thus essential for improving epidemics forecasting.","output":"Simulation of the COVID-19 epidemic on the social network of Slovenia: Estimating the intrinsic forecast uncertainty"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Alpha-tocopherol (&#945;T), the bioactive constituent of vitamin E, is essential for fertility and neurological development.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the impact of bio-potency-adjusted dietary all rac-&#945;T versus RRR-&#945;T, fed to dams, on the hippocampal gene expression in weanling mice. METHODS: Male/female pairs of C57BL/6J mice were fed AIN 93-G containing RRR-&#945;T (NAT) or all rac-&#945;T (SYN) at 37.5 or 75 IU/kg (n = 10/group) throughout gestation and lactation. Male pups were euthanized at 21 days. Half the brain was evaluated for the &#945;T concentration and stereoisomer distribution. The hippocampus was dissected from the other half, and RNA was extracted and sequenced. Milk &#945;T was analyzed in separate dams. RESULTS: A total of 797 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the hippocampi across the 4 dietary groups, at a false discovery rate of 10%. Comparing the NAT-37.5 group to the NAT-75 group or the SYN-37.5 group to the SYN-75 group, small differences in brain &#945;T concentrations (10%; P < 0.05) led to subtle changes (<10%) in gene expression of 600 (NAT) or 487 genes (SYN), which were statistically significant. Marked differences in brain &#945;T stereoisomer profiles (P < 0.0001) had a small effect on fewer genes (NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, 179; NAT-75 vs. SYN-75, 182). Most of the DEGs were involved in transcription regulation and synapse formation. A network analysis constructed around known vitamin E interacting proteins (VIPs) revealed a group of 32 DEGs between NAT-37.5 vs. SYN-37.5, explained by expression of the gene for the VIP, protein kinase C zeta (Pkcz).

Survey items were analyzed via descriptive statistics by question and correlates amongst burnout and satisfaction with telemedicine were examined via ANOVA with appropriate statistical software. Results The survey response rate was 40.8% (n = 223) with the majority of respondents in an attending-level role. We observed that musculoskeletal components of the exam were rated as the most reliable components of a telemedicine exam and 85.6% of survey respondents reported engaging the patient or patient caregiver to help conduct the virtual exam. However, 63.5% of providers reported not being able to elicit the information needed from a telemedicine visit to make a complete clinical assessment.

Engagement in PIU as an impulsive coping with mental distress may pose a long-lasting threat to develop anxiety and depressive disorders. The first aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of PIU and mental distress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students in Lithuania. The second aim was to test the hypothesis that PIU affects anxiety and depressive symptoms through the mediating role of impulsivity. Methods: The cross-sectional study was comprised of 619 university students (92.9% females and 7.1% males) with a mean age of 22  3 years who participated in an online survey from May to November, 2020. Participants completed the following scales: the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11. K-means cluster analysis and one-way multivariate analysis of variance were used for group comparison in terms of internet use time and habit change during COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the mediating effect of impulsivity in association between PIU and mental distress, while controlling for age. Results: In sum, 45.1% of the participants reported PIU and 38.1% had markedly expressed symptoms of anxiety while 43.6% of the students reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic 76% of the students reported at least moderate increase in their internet use time. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the group of frequent internet users. The results of the structural equational modeling analysis showed a statistically significant effect of PIU on subjective anxiety symptoms and the statistically significant effect of PIU on subjective depression symptoms, both mediated via impulsivity. Conclusions: During COVID-19 pandemic, PIU, anxiety and depression symptoms are highly prevalent among students. Findings also suggest that relationships between PIU, anxiety and depressive symptoms are mediated via impulsivity. These results underscore the importance of the inclusion of impulsivity factor in the studies analyzing longitudinal effects of PIU on mental distress during COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Impulsivity Mediates Associations Between Problematic Internet Use, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms in Students: A Cross-Sectional COVID-19 Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of vaccines, which prime the immune system to respond to future infections, has led to global declines in morbidity and mortality from dreadful infectious communicable diseases.

The purpose of this review was to characterise pain within the first post-operative week after transabdominal pre-peritoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal repair (TEP), and to identify patient-related predictors of early pain. METHODS A qualitative systematic review was conducted. Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane database were searched for studies on early pain (first week) after TAPP or TEP. RESULTS We included 71 eligible studies with 14,023 patients. Post-operative pain is most severe on day 0 and mainly on a level of 13-58 mm on a visual analogue scale and decreases to low levels on day 3. There seems to be no difference in pain intensity and duration when TEP and TAPP are compared. Deep abdominal pain (i.e. groin pain/visceral pain) dominates over superficial pain (i.e. somatic pain) and shoulder pain (i.e. referred pain) after TAPP. Predictors of early pain are young age and pre-operative high pain response to experimental heat stimulation. Furthermore, evidence supported early pain intensity as a predictive risk factor of chronic pain after laparoscopic groin hernia repair. CONCLUSION Early pain within the first week after TAPP and TEP is most severe on the first post-operative day, and the pain pattern is dominated by deep abdominal pain. Early post-operative pain is most intense in younger patients and can be predicted by pre-operative high pain response to experimental heat stimulation.","output":"Early pain after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Sepsis can be caused by a broad range of pathogens; however, bacterial infections represent the majority of sepsis cases. Up to 42% of sepsis presentations are culture negative, suggesting a non-bacterial cause. Despite this, diagnosis of viral sepsis remains very rare. Almost any virus can cause sepsis in vulnerable patients (e.g., neonates, infants, and other immunosuppressed groups). The prevalence of viral sepsis is not known, nor is there enough information to make an accurate estimate. The initial standard of care for all cases of sepsis, even those that are subsequently proven to be culture negative, is the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In the absence of definite diagnostic criteria for viral sepsis, or at least to exclude bacterial sepsis, this inevitably leads to unnecessary antimicrobial use, with associated consequences for antimicrobial resistance, effects on the host microbiome and excess healthcare costs. It is important to understand non-bacterial causes of sepsis so that inappropriate treatment can be minimised, and appropriate treatments can be developed to improve outcomes. In this review, we summarise what is known about viral sepsis, its most common causes, and how the immune responses to severe viral infections can contribute to sepsis.

Results A total of 13 studies including 19 pregnant females, 14 newborns, and 81 children and adolescents were identified. The ratio of male to female was 1 to 1.2 in children and adolescents patients aged 56 days to 17.5 years. Children under 12 years old accounted for 58.3% (28/48). Of the child patients, 34.0% (16/47) had close contact with patients with SARS. Fever (93.8%, 76/81) and cough (49.4%, 40/81) were the most common symptoms in children and adolescents with SARS infection, and 17.5% (11/63) occurred with shortness of breath or dyspnea. The positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV was 9.2% (14/48), and the positive ratio of serum antibody was 92.9% (13/14). Peripheral blood lymphocyte reduction was approximately 65.7% (44/67). Approximately 70.8% (51/72) unilateral and 29.2% (21/72) bilateral lesions were found by thoracic X-ray or CT scan. No child fatalities were reported. As of maternal patients, aged 23 to 44 years, 10 cases (52.6%) were infected during early and middle pregnancy, and 9 cases (47.4%) during late pregnancy. Fever (100.0%, 19/19) and cough (78.9%, 15/19) were the main clinical symptoms, and shortness of breath/dyspnea occurred in 36.8% (7/19) of infected pregnant females. The positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV was 50.0% (8/16), whereas the positive ratio of serum antibody was 93.3% (14/15). The ratios of thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and liver enzymes abnormalities were 38.9% (7/18), 61.1% (11/18) and 50.0% (3/6). All patients were identified for lesions by thoracic X-ray or CT scan examination. Seven cases were severe (36.8%). Five patients were treated with mechanical ventilation (26.3%).

Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms \\"Clinical features\\", \\"2019 novel coronavirus\\", \\"2019-nCoV\\", \\"COVID-19\\", or \\"SARS-Cov-2\\". Observational studies, case reports or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of SARS-Cov-2 viruses in stools were included. RESULTS A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3%-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension and GI haemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis. Fecal-oral transmission route is a potential risk for transmission. CONCLUSIONS GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Strengthening the recognition on abnormalities in digestive system of patients with COVID-19 is crucial for early identification and timely treatment, especially for those atypical patients.

The reliability of this claim was tested in patients with SO palsy confirmed by MRI demonstration of subnormal ipsilesional SO size. METHODS Quasi-coronal, surface coil MRI was performed in target-controlled central gaze to identify patients with a unilateral reduction in SO cross section indicative of palsy. Nine patients gave an unequivocal history or had markedly increased vertical fusional amplitudes indicative of congenital onset (mean age 38  16 years, SD). Seven patients had unequivocal acquired onset (age 47  14 years and symptom duration 5.4  4.8 years), including 2 with demonstrated trochlear Schwannoma and 5 with onset after severe head trauma. Fifteen patients had gradually progressive onset unequivocally not congenital yet not associated with any identifiable precipitating event (age 52  20 years and symptom duration 13  14 years). RESULTS Maximum SO cross section averaged 8.6  3.9 mm2 in congenital palsy, not significantly different from 11.3  3.5 mm2 in acquired palsy (P = 0.08) either unequivocally or progressively acquired, but significantly less than about 19 mm2 contralesionally in SO palsy (P < 10-4). Although mean central gaze HT was greater at 20.6  8.0 in 9 cases of congenital than that in 22 acquired cases at 11.4  6.8 (P = 0.002), HT was 8.4  16.3 less in upgaze than downgaze in congenital SO palsy and 3.7  11.2 less in acquired SO palsy. In congenital palsy, 33% of patients had HT greater in upgaze than downgaze while in 67% HT was greater in downgaze (by up to 42). In acquired SO palsy, HT was greater in upgaze than downgaze or equal to it in 8 cases (36%, P = 0.87, X2). In acquired SO palsy, HT was greater in upgaze than downgaze in 37% and greater in downgaze than upgaze in 59% of cases. The HT was equal in upgaze and centralgaze in no congenital and 3 acquired cases of SO palsy. Trends were similar in unequivocal acquired and progressive acquired (noncongenital) SO palsy (P > 0.4). CONCLUSIONS Hypertropia is not characteristically greater in upgaze than downgaze in congenital SO palsy proven by SO atrophy on MRI. In fact, average HT is greater in downgaze than upgaze in both acquired and congenital palsy, sometimes strikingly so in the latter. The finding of HT greater in upgaze than downgaze, or equal to it, does not reliably indicate that SO palsy is congenital, nor does maximum SO cross section.","output":"Vertical Comitance of Hypertropia in Congenital and Acquired Superior Oblique Palsy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although much is still unknown about the full effects of COVID-19, literature from the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (spring and summer 2020) supports a postviral immunologic reaction resulting in a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The purpose of this study was to report the rates of documented oral and oropharyngeal manifestations among these patients and to determine the association of these findings with other MIS-C symptoms. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of pediatric patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian. Patients fulfilling the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for MIS-C were included in this study. The documented signs, symptoms, and laboratory values were collected and compared with the presence of oral or oropharyngeal findings. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) age of MIS-C patients was 9.0 (5.0) years (range, 1.3-20.0 years), and there was no obvious sex difference (51.1% male, 48.9% female). With respect to oral findings, 23 patients (48.9%) had red or swollen lips, whereas only 5 (10.6%) had a strawberry tongue. Oral or oropharyngeal findings were associated significantly with the presence of systemic rash (P = .04) and conjunctivitis (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of oral or oropharyngeal changes may be an early indicator of MIS-C and should be considered suggestive of MIS-C in the setting of COVID-19 infection. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dental care providers may play an integral role both in the early detection of oral manifestations of MIS-C and in the identification of oral lesions in hospitalized patients with confirmed MIS-C.","output":"Oral manifestations of COVID-2019-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: a review of 47 pediatric patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain injury in meningitis occurs in part as a consequence of leukocyte migration and activation. Leukocyte integrins are pivotal in the inflammatory response by mediating adhesion to vascular endothelium and extracellular matrix proteins. We have demonstrated that moderate hypothermia early in the course of meningitis decreases leukocyte sequestration within the brain parenchyma. This study examines whether hypothermia alters neutrophil integrin expression in a rabbit model of bacterial meningitis. Prior to the induction of meningitis, peripheral blood samples were obtained and the neutrophils isolated. Sixteen hours after inducing group B streptococcal meningitis, animals were treated with antibiotics, IV fluids, and mechanically ventilated. Animals were randomized to hypothermia (32C33C) or normothermia conditions. After 10 hours of hypothermia or normothermia, neutrophils were isolated from the blood and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stained for 1 and 2 integrins, and analyzed using flow cytometry. Cerebral spinal fluid neutrophil 1 integrin expression was significantly decreased in hypothermic animals. Beta-1 integrins can assume a higher affinity or \\"activated\\" state following inflammatory stimulation. Expression of \\"activated\\" 1 integrins was also significantly decreased in hypothermic animals.

Its distinct pharmacologic properties, which have recently been attributed to the preferential activation of ?-arrestin over G proteins, make methadone a standard-of-care maintenance medication for opioid addiction. Although a recent biophysical study suggests that methadone stabilizes different MOR active conformations from those stabilized by classical opioid drugs or G protein-biased agonists, how this drug modulates the conformational equilibrium of MOR and what specific active conformation of the receptor it stabilizes is unknown. Here, we report the results of sub-millisecond adaptive sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a predicted methadone-bound MOR complex, and compare them with analogous data obtained for the classical opioid morphine and the G protein-biased ligand TRV130. The model, which is supported by existing experimental data, is analyzed using Markov State Models (MSMs) and transfer entropy analysis to provide testable hypotheses of methadone-specific conformational dynamics and activation kinetics of MOR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Opioid addiction has reached epidemic proportions in both industrialized and developing countries. Although methadone maintainance treatment represents an effective therapeutic approach for opioid addiction, it is not widely used as needed. In this study, we contribute an atomic-level understanding of how methadone exerts its unique function, in pursuit of more accessible treatments for opioid addiction. In particular, we present details of a methadone-specific active conformation of the -opioid receptor that has thus far eluded experimental structural characterization.","output":"Atomic-Level Characterization of the Methadone-Stabilized Active Conformation of -Opioid Receptor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma is increasing worldwide. While the treatment of initial stages of the disease is simple, the advanced disease frequently remains fatal despite novel therapeutic options . This requires identification of novel therapeutic targets in melanoma. Similarly to other types of tumours, the cancer microenvironment plays a prominent role and determines the biological properties of melanoma. Importantly, melanoma cell-produced exosomes represent an important tool of intercellular communication within this cancer ecosystem. We have focused on potential differences in the activity of exosomes produced by melanoma cells towards melanoma-associated fibroblasts and normal dermal fibroblasts. Cancer-associated fibroblasts were activated by the melanoma cell-produced exosomes significantly more than their normal counterparts, as assessed by increased transcription of genes for inflammation-supporting cytokines and chemokines, namely IL-6 or IL-8. We have observed that the response is dependent on the duration of the stimulus via exosomes and also on the quantity of exosomes. Our study demonstrates that melanoma-produced exosomes significantly stimulate the tumour-promoting proinflammatory activity of cancer-associated fibroblasts. This may represent a potential new target of oncologic therapy .

For the general public and for people with mental illnesses, this pandemic may cause mental/physical stress and major life impacts. PURPOSE This study was designed to explore the related changes in daily life and impacts on the well-being of a group of patients with chronic treatment-resistant depression (TRD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This study was a part of a long-term, follow-up study of a cohort of patients with TRD collected in 2018. All of the subjects who were diagnosed with major depression and fit the inclusion criteria were referred by the psychiatrists from two teaching hospitals. Structured interviews were used to collect data on physical and psychological changes during the pandemic period between January and May 2020. The researchers organized the key points by recording or note taking. Thematic analysis was used to summarize and classify themes and units. RESULTS The 116 respondents revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected their health in the biological, psychological, and social dimensions. The three emerging themes included: The threatening of homogeneity in the whole person's health, the interaction between bio-psycho-social aspects, and positive growth of individuals with TRD. Although the participants had confidence in the prevention strategies of the government related to COVID-19, they expressed feelings of distress and restlessness with regard to COVID-19-related news reports. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health of patients with TRD in both positive and negative ways.

Of the 27 patients with PCNSL, 21 had undergone ASCT at first complete remission (CR1). RESULTS: The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 80.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.9-92.9) and the 2-year overall survival (OS) rate was 80.1% (95% CI, 69.2%-92.7%) among all patients. The 2-year PFS and OS rate for patients with PCNSL in CR1 was 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 86.6%-100%), respectively. On univariate analysis of the patients with PCNSL, ASCT in CR1 was the only variable statistically significant for outcome (P = .007 for PFS; P = .008 for OS). Among patients with SCNSL or CNS relapse, the 2-year PFS and OS rate were comparable at 75.9% (95% CI, 59.5%-96.8%) and 75.3% (95% CI, 58.6%-98.6%), respectively.

METHODS: The irradiance levels (mW/cm2) of 26 LED LCUs from general dental practices and 207 LED LCUs from two dental hospitals were measured using a digital radiometer (Blue Phase II, Ivoclar, Vivadent, Amherst, NY). Ten LED light guide tips (Satelec Mini, Acteon, Merignac, France) were selected to evaluate the effect of chipping, contamination (tip debris), and use of protective sleeves and tips to sensor distance on irradiance (mW/cm2) using a MARC Resin Calibrator (Blue Light Analytics, Halifax, Canada). Homogeneity of the light output was evaluated using a laser beam profiler (SP620; Ophir-Spiricon, North Longan, UT, USA). Statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey test (&#945;=0.05) and linear regression with stepwise correlation tests. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the LCUs delivered irradiance output less than 500 mW/cm2. The condition of the light curing tips was poor, with 16% contaminated with resin debris, 26% damaged, and 10% both contaminated and damaged. The irradiance output was significantly reduced in contaminated (62%) and chipped (50%) light curing tips and when using protective sleeves (24%) (p<0.05).

Sixty-two 21-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into isolated and grouped groups. After 90 days of age, the rats from both groups underwent oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) for 20 weeks. All rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior and euthanized for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) diagnosis and measurement of inflammatory mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Social isolation stress increased the OSCC occurrence by 20.4% when compared to control. Isolated rats also showed higher tumor volume and cachexia than the grouped rats. Social isolation did not induce changes in the depressive-like behavior after carcinogenic induction. Tumors from stressed rats had increased levels of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, IL1-beta and MCP-1. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were significantly increased in the large tumors from isolated animals. Higher tumor levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL1-beta and MCP-1 were positively correlated with OSCC growth.

The inflammatory response regulates the immune status and mediates the progression of septic shock. In this study, we aim to identify the key immune-related genes (IRGs) of septic shock and explore their potential mechanism. Methods: Gene expression profiles of septic shock blood samples and normal whole blood samples were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Genotype-Tissue Expression Portal (GTEx). The differential expression genes (DEGs) and septic shock-specific immune-related genes (SSSIRGs) were evaluated and identified, along with the immune components by cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT, version x) algorithm. Additionally, in order to explore the key regulatory network, the relationship among SSSIRGs, upstream transcription factors (TFs), and downstream signaling pathways were also identified by Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and co-expression analysis. Moreover, the Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis was applied to find bioactive small molecules against the members of regulation network while Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Assay for Targeting Accessible-Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) data were used to validate the regulation mechanism of the network. Results: A total of 14,843 DEGs were found between 63 septic shock blood samples and 337 normal whole blood samples. Then, we identified septic shock-specific 839 IRGs as the intersection of DEGs and IRGs. Moreover, we uncovered the regulatory networks based on co-expression analysis and found 28 co-expression interaction pairs. In the regulation network, protein phosphatase 3, catalytic subunit, alpha isozyme (PPP3CA) may regulate late estrogen response, glycolysis and TNF signaling via NFB and HLA; Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) may be related to late estrogen response and HLA; and Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) may be associated with TNF signaling via NFB. And the regulation mechanisms between TFs and IRGs (TLR8, PPP3CA, and KRAS) were validated by ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings highlight the importance of reporting daily variation in staffing to improve understanding of the relationship between staffing and quality. They suggest that 2 facilities with the same average staffing achieve different quality of resident care and survey ratings in association with on the day-to-day variation in staffing. Measures of daily staffing may enhance the value of Nursing Home Care Compare for nursing homes and others engaged in quality improvement and consumers searching for high quality nursing homes.","output":"Daily Variation in Nursing Home Staffing and Its Association With Quality Measures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In January 2020, we identified two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients in a familial cluster with one person coming from Wuhan, China.

These changes have impacted individuals identity, including their sexual self-image and body image, yet research on perceptions of these changes is missing. This study reports on quantitative and qualitative data from an electronic survey with adults in the United States (N = 326) to examine these perceptions. Body appreciation did not significantly differ between demographic groups. Themes emerging from the qualitative results included changes in general self-image (becoming more restricted or disempowered), changes in sexual self-image (deepening, becoming more sexy/sexual, or less sexy/sexual), and changes in body image (positive, negative, and neutral). Our findings point to positive, negative, and neutral effects on sexual self-image and body image, implying that nuanced approaches are needed to understand how identity has transformed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Making Peace with Bodies and Sexual Selves: Changes during COVID-19 among Adults in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many deaths and economic disruptions across the world. Several studies have examined the effect of corresponding health risk factors in different places, but the problem of spatial heterogeneity has not been adequately addressed. The purpose of this paper was to explore how selected health risk factors are related to the pandemic infection rate within different study extents and to reveal the spatial varying characteristics of certain health risk factors. An eigenvector spatial filtering-based spatially varying coefficient model (ESF-SVC) was developed to find out how the influence of selected health risk factors varies across space and time. The ESF-SVC was able to take good control of over-fitting problems compared with ordinary least square (OLS), eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, with a higher adjusted R2 and lower cross validation RMSE. The impact of health risk factors varied as the study extent changed: In Hubei province, only population density and wind speed showed significant spatially constant impact;while in mainland China, other factors including migration score, building density, temperature and altitude showed significant spatially varying impact. The influence of migration score was less contributive and less significant in cities around Wuhan than cities further away, while altitude showed a stronger contribution to the decrease of infection rates in high altitude cities. The temperature showed mixed correlation as time passed, with positive and negative coefficients at 2.42 C and 8.17 C, respectively. This study could provide a feasible path to improve the model fit by considering the problem of spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity that exists in COVID-19 modeling. The yielding ESF-SVC coefficients could also provide an intuitive method for discovering the different impacts of influencing factors across space in large study areas. It is hoped that these findings improve public and governmental awareness of potential health risks and therefore influence epidemic control strategies.","output":"Using an Eigenvector Spatial Filtering-Based Spatially Varying Coefficient Model to Analyze the Spatial Heterogeneity of COVID-19 and Its Influencing Factors in Mainland China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small and medium-sized enterprises around the world play a key role in building economic growth and maintaining environmental sustainability.

The original empirical research was conducted in 2021 on a sample of 452 small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. The research was based on a questionnaire. The research allowed for the assessment of sustainable energy management by assessing the awareness of entrepreneurs, assessing the pro-ecological activities undertaken, and assessing the impact of pro-ecological activities on shaping the competitive advantages of enterprises in 2015C2020. The surveyed entrepreneurs considered the most important components of the companys competitive advantage and sustainable energy management to be those investments aimed at achieving a high inputCresult ratio in a short time. In order to review the pro-ecological activities in Poland against the background of international data, other research results in this area are presented. The cited data confirm the results of the conducted extensive survey research. In the case of many countries and SMEs, environmental awareness is relatively low.

This paper investigates the effect of concern about the i) local spread and ii) economic impact of COVID-19, on the change in the amount of food and necessities bought in twelve Sub-Sahara African countries. In addition, we examine if these effects are channeled through food worries. The study uses a unique survey dataset by GeoPoll collected in April 2020 (first round) and May 2020 (second round) and employs a multinomial logit and generalized structural equation models. We find significant effect of concern about COVID-19 on change in the package size of food and necessities bought, which is heterogeneous across gender group and rural-urban divide. Our results reveal that concerns of COVID-19 might be promoting stockpiling behavior among females and those with no food worries (due to having sufficient money or resources). This if not properly managed could in the medium to long-term affect the food supply chain, food waste and exacerbate food worries problem especially for already food deprived homes.

The analysis was guided by four overarching questions: 1) What were robots used for in the COVID-19 response? 2) When were they used? 3) How did different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics influence a country's innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often and for broader purposes. Finally, the dataset and analysis produces a broad set of implications that warrant further study and investigation. The results from this analysis are expected to be of value to the robotics and robotics policy community in preparing robots for rapid insertion into future disasters.","output":"An Analysis of International Use of Robots for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines digital technology trends that are influencing the current and future business practices of the food retail landscape, including transnational grocery stores and chain restaurants It describes trends in online food sales and meal delivery, and presents ethical concerns related to the use of digital technology in the food retail sector It concludes with examples of how food-system stakeholders are using digital technology to support healthy and sustainable diets, providing some insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the food retail sector Retailers are using the online experience to optimize search terms and website content, provide attractive images, offer promotional coupons that ensure the availability and speedy delivery of products to shoppers An AI-enabled payment platform provides a \\"unified shopping experience\\" for customers Retailers and restaurants in China are supported by technology firms, such as Alibaba, which has invested in facial-recognition start-up companies that scan customers' faces when making purchases This information is linked to a government and corporate digital surveillance system used to monitor the computer activities, behaviours and data content of Chinese citizens Digital technologies influence every sector of the global and national economies, including agriculture, food and beverage manufacturing, food retail and restaurants, finance, media and entertainment Digital technology is transforming how transnational food retailers and chain restaurants use e-commerce strategies and OFD services to reach customers","output":"How digital technology is transforming the food retail landscape"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the system design and setup of our digital twin of the social-ecological system urban beekeeping, with the aim to support agroecological methods in urban agriculture. The physical space consists of the bee populations, their beekeepers who are part of a beekeeping community, non-beekeepers who consume honey, organisational actors shaping rules and regulations and the environment. The virtual space is a multi-agent model, where autonomous agents can take actions and make decisions in partially observed Markov processes. To tie the physical and the virtual space, we embedded bee hives in an IoT environment and implemented an online documentation tool as a web application, where beekeepers take short notes about their work and observations. Bee hives are equipped with sensors, such as humidity, pressure and temperature sensors and a scale. Additionally, we pull data from the German weather service (Deutscher Wetter Dienst, DWD). In our system architecture, multiple levels on data fusion are performed, beginning with raw data quality estimation and sensor failure detection. On higher levels, states of entities are estimated, such as the health of a bee colony, and assessment made whether a state is normal or to be considered an anomaly. Finally on the highest level, we deal with the desires of our agents, how actions should be chosen in order to achieve or maintain desirable and rewarding world states. We hope to be able to refine our digital twin into a decision support tool for small-scale (bee) farmers and communal political actors that helps to reach desirable world states by predicting and simulating the effects of actions within the complex system of urban beekeeping.","output":"A Digital Twin of the Social-Ecological System Urban Beekeeping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 outbreak has substantially altered residents' training activities. While several new virtual learning programs have been recently implemented, the perspective of urology trainees regarding their usefulness still needs to be investigated. METHODS: A cross-sectional, 30-item, web-based Survey was conducted through Twitter from April 4th, 2020 to April 18th, 2020, aiming to evaluate the urology residents' perspective on smart learning (SL) modalities (pre-recorded videos, webinars, podcasts, and social media [SoMe]), and contents (frontal lessons, clinical case discussions, updates on Guidelines and on clinical trials, surgical videos, Journal Clubs, and seminars on leadership and non-technical skills). RESULTS: Overall, 501 urology residents from 58 countries completed the survey. Of these, 78.4, 78.2, 56.9 and 51.9% of them considered pre-recorded videos, interactive webinars, podcasts and SoMe highly useful modalities of smart learning, respectively. The contents considered as highly useful by the greatest proportion of residents were updates on guidelines (84.8%) and surgical videos (81.0%). In addition, 58.9 and 56.5% of responders deemed seminars on leadership and on non-technical skills highly useful smart learning contents. The three preferred combinations of smart learning modality and content were: pre-recorded surgical videos, interactive webinars on clinical cases, and pre-recorded videos on guidelines.

Results showing that sera from double vaccinated individuals have minimal neutralizing activity against Omicron may indicate that the higher rate of transmission is due to evasion from vaccine-induced immunity. However, there is little information about activation of recall responses to Omicron in vaccinated individuals. Methods: We measured inflammatory mediators, antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, and spike peptide-induced release of interferon gamma in whole blood in 51 vaccinated individuals infected with Omicron, in 14 infected with Delta, and in 18 healthy controls. The median time points for the first and second samples were 7 and 14 days after symptom onset, respectively. Findings: Infection with Omicron or Delta led to a rapid and similar increase in antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins and spike peptide-induced interferon gamma in whole blood. Both the Omicron and the Delta infected patients had a mild and transient increase in inflammatory parameters.
