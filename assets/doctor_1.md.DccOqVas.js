The goal of this study is to project the number of COVID19 infections and resulting severe outcomes, and the need for hospital capacity under social distancing, particularly, shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine for the State of Georgia. We developed an agent-based simulation model to project the infection spread. The model utilizes COVID19-specific parameters and data from Georgia on population interactions and demographics. The simulation study covered a seven and a half-month period, testing different social distancing scenarios, including baselines (no-intervention or school closure only) and combinations of shelter-in-place and voluntary quarantine with different timelines and compliance levels. The following outcomes are compared at the state and community levels: the number and percentage of cumulative and daily new symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; COVID19-related demand for hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. The results suggest that shelter-in-place followed by voluntary quarantine reduced peak infections from approximately 180K under no intervention and 113K under school closure, respectively, to below 53K, and delayed the peak from April to July or later. Increasing shelter-in-place duration from four to five weeks yielded 2C9% and 3C11% decrease in cumulative infection and deaths, respectively. Regardless of the shelter-in-place duration, increasing voluntary quarantine compliance decreased daily new infections from almost 53K to 25K, and decreased cumulative infections by about 50%. The cumulative number of deaths ranged from 6,660 to 19,430 under different scenarios. Peak infection date varied across scenarios and counties; on average, increasing shelter-in-place duration delayed the peak day by 6 days.

The amount of healthcare waste is increasing every day, and it is necessary to adequately dispose of this kind of waste. There are various treatments for healthcare waste disposal, of which incineration of healthcare waste is one of the solutions. This paper suggests a model for selection of the type of incinerators that best solve the problem of healthcare waste in secondary healthcare institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the selection of incinerators, extended sustainability criteria were applied. Basic sustainability criteria: environmental, economic, and social criteria, were extended with the technical criterion. To assess which of the incinerators best meets the needs for healthcare waste collection, multi-criteria decision-making was used. For this purpose, a combination of two MCDA methods was applied in this paper, namely full consistency method (FUCOM) and compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution (CRADIS). The FUCOM method was applied to determine the weights of the criteria, while the CRADIS method was applied to rank the alternatives. The best alternative of the six alternatives used is A2 (I8-M50), followed by alternative A1 (I8-M40), while the worst ranked alternative is A5 (I8-M100). These results were confirmed by applying the other six methods of multi-criteria analysis and the performed sensitivity analysis. The contribution of this paper is reflected through a new method of multi-criteria analysis that was used to solve decision-making problems. This method has shown simplicity and flexibility in operation and can be used in all problems when it is necessary to make a multi-criteria selection of alternatives.","output":"Evaluation and selection of healthcare waste incinerators using extended sustainability criteria and multi-criteria analysis methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Most acute stroke (AS) patients in the United States are initially evaluated at a primary stroke center (PSC) and a significant proportion requires transfer to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) for advanced treatment. A CSC typically accepts patients from multiple PSCs in its network, leading to capacity limits. This study uses a queueing model to estimate impacts on CSC capacity due to transfers from PSCs. Methods: The model assumes that the number of AS patients arriving at each PSC, proportion of AS patients transferred, and length of stay in the CSC Neurologic Intensive Care Unit (Neuro-ICU) by type of AS are random, while the transfer rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic AS patients are control variables. The main outcome measure is the\\"overflow\\"probability, namely, the probability of a CSC not having capacity (unavailability of a Neuro-ICU bed) to accept a transfer. Data simulations of the model, using a base case and an expanded case, were performed to illustrate the effects of changing key parameters, such as transfer rates from PSCs and CSC Neuro-ICU capacity on overflow capacity. Results: Data simulations of the model using a base case show that an increase of a PSC's ischemic stroke transfer rate from 15% to 55% raises the overflow probability from 30.62% to 36.13%. Further simulations of the expanded case show that to maintain an a priori CSC overflow probability of 30.62% when adding a PSC with a AS transfer rate of 15% to the network, other PSCs would need to decrease their transfer rate by 12.5% or the CSC Neuro-ICU would need to add 2 beds. Discussion: A queuing model can be used to estimate the effects of change in the size of a PSC-CSC network, change in AS transfer rates, or change in number of CSC Neuro-ICU beds of a CSC on its capacity on the overflow probability in the CSC.","output":"A Queueing Model of Patient Flow for Stroke Networks to Estimate Acute Stroke Transfer Capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objective: It is known that several viruses are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new worldwide spread virus that may act as a trigger for the autoimmune destruction of the -cells, as well, and thus lead to an increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes. Material and Methods: The Romanian National Organization for the Protection of Children and Adolescents with Diabetes (ONROCAD) has collected information regarding new cases of type 1 diabetes in children aged 0 to 14 years from all over the country since 1996 and has computed the incidence of type 1 diabetes in this age group. Results: We observed a marked increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 16.9%, from 11.4/100,000 in 2019 to 13.3/100,000 in 2020, much higher compared to previous years (mean yearly increase was 5.1% in the period 1996C2015 and 0.8% in the interval 2015C2019). The proportion of newly diagnosed cases was significantly higher in the second half of 2020 compared to the second half of the previous years (57.8 vs. 51%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: All these aspects suggest the role that SARS-CoV-2 could have in triggering pancreatic autoimmunity. To confirm this, however, collecting information from larger populations from different geographical regions, monitoring the incidence curves over a period of several years, and gathering background information on COVID-19 and/or data on COVID-19 specific antibodies are needed.","output":"Increased Incidence of Type 1 Diabetes during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Romanian Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endocytosis is a fundamental process occurring in all eukaryotic cells. Live cell imaging of endocytosis has helped to decipher many of its mechanisms and regulations. With the pulsed-pH (ppH) protocol, one can detect the formation of individual endocytic vesicles (EVs) with an unmatched temporal resolution of 2 s. The ppH protocol makes use of cargo protein (e.g., the transferrin receptor) coupled to a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, such as superecliptic pHluorin (SEP), which is brightly fluorescent at pH 7.4 but not fluorescent at pH <6.0. If the SEP moiety is at the surface, its fluorescence will decrease when cells are exposed to a low pH (5.5) buffer. If the SEP moiety has been internalized, SEP will remain fluorescent even during application of the low pH buffer. Fast perfusion enables the complete exchange of low and high pH extracellular solutions every 2 s, defining the temporal resolution of the technique. Unlike other imaging-based endocytosis assays, the ppH protocol detects EVs without a priori hypotheses on the dynamics of vesicle formation. Here, we explain how the ppH protocol quantifies the endocytic activity of living cells and the recruitment of associated proteins in real time. We provide a step-by-step procedure for expression of the reporter proteins with transient transfection, live cell image acquisition with synchronized pH changes and automated analysis. The whole protocol can be performed in 2 d to provide quantitative information on the endocytic process being studied.","output":"Imaging endocytic vesicle formation at high spatial and temporal resolutions with the pulsed-pH protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront an urgent need for the rapid development of highly efficacious vaccines, particularly in light of the ongoing emergence of multiple variants of concern.

Moreover, our plant-expressed RBD was readily detected by IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies from naturally infected convalescent, vaccinated, or convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We further demonstrate that RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor was efficiently neutralized by antibodies from sera of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent and partially and fully vaccinated individuals.

METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed on 388 cats entering the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals animal shelter in Auckland, New Zealand between 7 February 2014 and 30 May 2014. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat and tested for FIV antibody and FeLV antigen using a commercial point-of-care ELISA. Information on the signalment and health status of the cat at the time of entry was also recorded. Blood and saliva samples from a subset of cats were tested for FIV and FeLV proviral DNA using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS Of the 388 cats in the study sample, 146 (37.6%) had been relinquished by owners, 237 (62.4%) were strays, and 5 (1.3%) were of unknown origin. Overall, 53/388 (13.7%) cats tested positive for FIV antibodies and 4/388 (1.0%) were positive for FeLV antigen. Stray cats had a higher FIV seroprevalence than relinquished cats (42/237 (17.8%) vs. 11/146 (7.5%); p=0.008). Of 53 cats that were FIV-seropositive, 51 (96%) tested positive for FIV proviral DNA using PCR testing of blood. Of these 51 cats, 28 (55%) were positive by PCR testing of saliva. Of the four cats that were FeLV antigen-positive by ELISA, two (50%) were positive for FeLV proviral DNA by PCR testing of blood. The odds of a cat being seropositive for FIV were greater for intact compared to desexed cats (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.6-7.4) and for male compared to female cats (OR=6.5; 95% CI=3.2-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The seroprevalence for FIV was 14% among cats entering an animal shelter in Auckland, whereas the prevalence of FeLV antigen-positive cats was only 1%. These findings suggest differences in the transmission dynamics of each virus in free-roaming cat populations in New Zealand. Our study also highlights the potential role of desexing cats in reducing transmission of FIV. However, further data from first-opinion veterinary practices are required to confirm that these findings may be generalised to the wider domestic cat population in New Zealand.","output":"Prevalence and risk factors for cats testing positive for feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus infection in cats entering an animal shelter in New Zealand."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide, governments have reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic with emergency orders and policies restricting rights to movement, assembly, and education that have impacted daily lives and livelihoods in profound ways.

The presence and transmission of PRRSV by boar semen has been demonstrated by using a swine bioassay. In this assay, 4- to 8-week-old pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with semen from PRRSV-infected boars. Seroconversion of these piglets indicated the presence of PRRSV in semen. Seroconversion in gilts has also been demonstrated following artificial insemination with semen from PRRSV-infected boars. These methods of detecting PRRSV in boar semen are time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable and sensitive PCR assay to directly detect PRRSV in boar semen. Primers from open reading frames 1b and 7 of the PRRSV genome were used in nested PCRs. Virus was detected at concentrations as low as 10 infectious virions per ml in PRRSV-spiked semen. Specificity was confirmed by using a nested PCR and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The primers did not react with related arteriviruses or other swine viruses. The PCR assay showed good correlation with the swine bioassay, and both methods were superior to virus isolation. To consistently identify PRRSV in boar semen, the cell fraction was separated by centrifugation at 600 x g for 20 min, a lysis buffer without a reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol) was used, and nondiluted and 1:20-diluted cell fractions were evaluated by PCR.

Patients and methods In a double-blind multicentre Phase 3 study, patients received prophylactic liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) at 5 mg/kg intravenously or placebo twice weekly in a 2:1 random allocation during remission-induction treatment. The primary endpoint was the development of proven or probable IFD. Secondary endpoints included those focused on the safety and tolerability of prophylactic L-AMB. Results Three hundred and fifty-five patients from 86 centres in Europe and South America received at least one dose of L-AMB ( n = 237) or placebo ( n = 118). Rates of proven and probable IFD assessed independently were 7.9% (18/228) in the L-AMB group and 11.7% (13/111) in the placebo group ( P = 0.24). Rates of possible IFD were 4.8% (11/228) in the L-AMB and 5.4% (6/111) in the placebo group ( P = 0.82). The remission-induction phase was a median of 22 days for both groups. Overall mortality was similar between the groups: 7.2% (17/237) for L-AMB and 6.8% (8/118) for placebo ( P = 1.00). Hypokalaemia and creatinine increase were significantly more frequent with L-AMB. Conclusions The IFD rate among adult patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed ALL was 11.7% in the placebo group, and was not significantly different in patients receiving L-AMB, suggesting that the L-AMB regimen studied is not effective as prophylaxis against IFD. The IFD rate appears higher than previously reported, warranting further investigation. Tolerability of L-AMB was what might be expected.

Endotracheal intubation is frequently needed in these patients with a risk of delay, and early predictors of failure may help clinicians to decide early. We aimed to identify factors associated with intubation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with different noninvasive oxygenation techniques. DESIGN Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial. SETTING Twenty-three ICUs. PATIENTS Patients with a respiratory rate greater than 25 breaths/min and a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than or equal to 300 mm Hg. INTERVENTION Patients were treated with standard oxygen, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen, or noninvasive ventilation. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Respiratory variables one hour after treatment initiation. Under standard oxygen, patients with a respiratory rate greater than or equal to 30 breaths/min were more likely to need intubation (odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.13-6.75; p = 0.03). One hour after high-flow nasal cannula oxygen initiation, increased heart rate was the only factor associated with intubation. One hour after noninvasive ventilation initiation, a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than or equal to 200 mm Hg and a tidal volume greater than 9 mL/kg of predicted body weight were independent predictors of intubation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.62-11.16; p = 0.003 and adjusted odds ratio, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.22-8.06; p = 0.02, respectively). A tidal volume above 9 mL/kg during noninvasive ventilation remained independently associated with 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure breathing spontaneously, the respiratory rate was a predictor of intubation under standard oxygen, but not under high-flow nasal cannula oxygen or noninvasive ventilation. A PaO2/FIO2 below 200 mm Hg and a high tidal volume greater than 9 mL/kg were the two strong predictors of intubation under noninvasive ventilation.","output":"Predictors of Intubation in Patients With Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure Treated With a Noninvasive Oxygenation Strategy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hand hygiene is one of the effective measures for reducing the transmission of infections. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing ethanol or isopropanol are considered efficient alternatives to handwashing with water and soap. Despite being effective against a broad-spectrum of microbes, fining an effective alternative to the alcohol-based hand sanitizers became a necessity owning to the limitations associated with their use, such as skin dryness, irritant contact dermatitis, and intoxication upon their accidental ingestion. Furthermore, in certain circumstances when the demand for alcohol exceeds the supply, like in the current COVID19 pandemic, formulating an effective non-alcoholic hand sanitizer would be a potential solution. Therefore, in this study, a non-alcoholic hand sanitizer containing benzalkonium chloride (BKC) as an active ingredient was prepared and evaluated as a less irritant and more persistent hand sanitizer gel. The hand gel was characterized by pH, viscosity, and spreadability. Results showed that this product has low viscosity, high spreadability and pH of 6.3, which is less likely to cause skin irritation. The antibacterial assessment (zone of inhibition) of the BKC-based hand sanitizer demonstrated antibacterial activities against nine out of eleven gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains, while the acceptability study on ten participants showed no signs of skin irritation nor redness upon its application.

DESIGN: A scoping review and content analysis of online media reports. SETTING: WHO European region. METHODS: A scoping review of media reports and publications and a search of other grey literature (published from 1 January to 17 September 2020). Primary and secondary outcome measures included measures implemented by governments, public services and non-governmental and civil organisations to prevent or respond to VAWC during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our study found that in 52 of the 53 member states there was at least one measure undertaken to prevent or respond to VAWC during the pandemic. Government-led or government-sponsored measures were the most common, reported in 50 member states. Non-governmental and other civil society-led prevention and response measures were reported in 40 member states. The most common measure was the use of media and social media to raise awareness of VAWC and to provide VAWC services through online platforms, followed by measures taken to expand and/or maintain helpline services for those exposed to violence. CONCLUSION: The potential increase in VAWC during COVID-19-imposed restrictions and lockdowns resulted in adaptations and/or increases in prevention and response strategies in nearly all member states.

In extraction-based testing, limited extraction reagents and required proprietary instrumentation may pose a bottleneck for labs. As a solution, ChromaCode developed a Direct Extraction protocol for the HDPCR? SARS-CoV-2 Assay, distributed in accordance with the guidance on Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency, Section IV.C., which allows for the processing of specimens without an extraction system. In lieu of an extraction system, the Direct Extraction protocol uses a thermal cycler to lyse and inactivate specimens which are directly added to the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). METHODS: The Limit of Detection (LoD), Clinical Performance, and effect of Interfering Substances was determined for the Direct Extraction protocol. The LoD was established on 6 PCR platforms with dilutions of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus spiked into residual, negative nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) matrix. Clinical performance was assessed with 48 positive and 50 negative frozen retrospective samples using the Direct Extraction protocol compared to an external Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) comparator assays (cobas? Liat? SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B assay and the Hologic Panther Fusion? SARS-CoV-2 Assay respectively) on three PCR platforms. The Direct Extraction protocol was evaluated for performance in the presence of 13 potentially interfering substances that can be present in a respiratory specimen. RESULTS: The LoD of the Direct Extraction protocol ranges from 1000 C 3000 genomic equivalents (GE)/mL. The clinical performance of the assay was 95.8% positive agreement (95% CI of 84.6% - 99.3%) and 100% negative agreement (95% CI of 90.9% - 100% or 91.1% C 100%) across all three PCR platforms tested. The viral target was detected at 3X LoD for all interferents tested. CONCLUSION: The Direct Extraction protocol of ChromaCodes SARS-CoV-2 Assay is a sensitive test that eliminates the need for sample extraction and performs very well against traditional extraction-based workflows. The inclusion of this protocol can reduce costs, reliance on extraction systems, and time associated with extraction-based protocols.

Studies investigating clinical dental activities that generate aerosol using duplicate independent screening. Data extraction by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias assessed through contamination measurement tool sensitivity assessment. STUDY SELECTION: A total eighty-three studies met the inclusion criteria and covered: ultrasonic scaling (USS, n = 44), highspeed air-rotor (HSAR, n = 31); oral surgery (n = 11), slow-speed handpiece (n = 4); air-water (triple) syringe (n = 4), air-polishing (n = 4), prophylaxis (n = 2) and hand-scaling (n = 2). Although no studies investigated respiratory viruses, those on bacteria, blood-splatter and aerosol showed activities using powered devices produced greatest contamination. Contamination was found for all activities, and at the furthest points studied. The operators torso, operators arm and patients body were especially affected. Heterogeneity precluded inter-study comparisons but intra-study comparisons allowed construction of a proposed hierarchy of procedure contamination risk: higher (USS, HSAR, air-water syringe, air polishing, extractions using motorised handpieces); moderate (slow-speed handpieces, prophylaxis, extractions) and lower (air-water syringe [water only] and hand scaling). CONCLUSION: Gaps in evidence, low sensitivity of measures and variable quality limit conclusions around contamination for procedures. A hierarchy of contamination from procedures is proposed for challenge/verification by future research which should consider standardised methodologies to facilitate research synthesis.

Digital content positively influenced performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Sexual knowledge had a statistically significant and positive influence on effort expectancy. Finally, openness had a statistically significant and positive influence on performance expectancy. The significant exceptions were that effort expectancy was not found to predict teacher readiness, and performance expectancy was not found to influence teacher readiness. The reasons for these non-significant correlations were briefly discussed and more studies on this topic are called to investigate these unexpected outcomes in more detail.

Usually, it involves the lymph nodes and extranodal tissues such as the lungs, skin, and other soft tissues. Its presentation by extending into different organs such as the liver, lungs, bones, spleen, and thyroid is rare. Thus, involvement of other organs is very rare as we found in a 54-year-old male patient, a known case of hypertension and end-stage renal disease who was on hemodialysis, who presented to the emergency department with a history of generalized weakness and weight loss of about 20 kg for two months. The tumor cells are positive for CD45, CD30, CD15, MUMi, and Ki-67 (80%) and negative for CD20, PAX-5, CD79a, CD3, CD5, CD10, BCL6, BCL2, EMA, ALK-1, and CD138. The patient was hypoglycemic and hypercalcemic and was managed accordingly. The patient was evaluated, and the third assessment showed that hypoglycemia was resolved due to dexamethasone.

We analyse Riffing the Archive: Building a Relation by MARIE ANTOINETTE (MA), an artist duo from Portugal, and their collaboration with the Barn, a multi-art centre in Banchory, Scotland, during the coronavirus pandemic in 2021. douard Glissant, a Martinique-born poet and philosopher, underpins both MAs practice and our analysis. We draw on the key concepts of his relational philosophy, including archipelago, opacity, and disaffiliation, to clarify how MA work, what they have offered the Barn and what they can offer to other art organisations seeking innovation and organisational learning. MAs nuanced approach, informed by Glissant, reconfigures the relationship between the artists and the art organisation and challenges existing assumptions through discontinuous and new thinking, while building a non-confrontational relationship with the Barn. It contributes to both organisational studies and arts research by highlighting the significance of MAs approach to organisational innovation.","output":"Learning Arts Organisations: Innovation through a Poetics of Relation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The macroeconomic uncertainty created by COVID-19 is hard to measure The situation demands simultaneous policy intervention in terms of public health infrastructure and livelihood Along with the global community, India too has announced its initial dose of fiscal and monetary policy responses However, more fiscal-monetary policy coordination is required to scale up the policy response to the emerging crisis Innovative sources of financing the deficit, including money financing of fiscal programmes, a variant of helicopter money, need to be explored ? 2020 Economic and Political Weekly All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 and macroeconomic uncertainty: Fiscal and monetary policy response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Traditional networks are designed to be hard on the outside and soft on the inside. It is this soft inside which has made the traditional perimeter model laughable to attackers, who can easily breach a network and run away with the data without even having to deal with the hardened perimeter. The zero-trust security model, created by John Kindervag in 2010, addresses the security flaws of the traditional perimeter model and asserts that all network traffic on the inside should not be trusted by default. Other core principles of zero trust include verification and continuous monitoring of all communication, as well as encryption of all data in transit and data at rest, since the goal of zero trust is to focus on protecting data. Although the zero-trust model was created in 2010, with some of the associated security practices existing even before that, many healthcare organisations are still choosing to focus primarily on securing the perimeter instead of focusing on the vulnerabilities within them. The current COVID-19 pandemic which healthcare providers are struggling with further highlights the need for improvements to security within the network perimeter, as many healthcare providers and vaccine developers are still using vulnerable, outdated legacy systems which could become compromised and indirectly have a detrimental effect on patient care. Legacy systems which are technologically limited, as well as medical devices which cannot be controlled or managed by network administrators, create boundaries to transitioning to a zero-trust architecture. It is challenges like this that have been explored during the research phase of this project in order to gain a better understanding of how a health organisation can adopt zero-trust practices despite the limitations of their current architecture. From the information gathered during this research, a framework was developed to allow a health organisation to transition to a more secure architecture based on the concept of zero-trust. Aspects of the proposed framework were tested in Cisco Modelling Labs (CML), and the results were evaluated to ensure the validity of some of the recommendations laid out in the framework. The main objective of this research was to prove that if a host within the local area network (LAN) were to be compromised, the damage would be limited to that host and would not spread throughout the rest of the network. This was successful after the qualitative research performed in CML. One of the other takeaways from testing the framework in CML was that medical devices could be secured by placing firewalls directly in front of them. This placement of firewalls may seem like an unorthodox approach and was shown to increase latency, but the blocking of all unnecessary traffic on the rest of the network will result in a performance boost and should balance it out in a real-world application. ? 2021 by the authors.

METHODS: We examined 112 neonates. Inclusion criteria were: Saturations greater than 88%, and heart rates between 100C205 beats per minute. MEASUREMENTS: We assessed several neurodevelopmental factors as part of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), 4th edition, such as asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR), motor maturity, response to sensory stimuli, habituation, and state regulation. Initial assessment parameters such as APGAR score and umbilical cord arterial pH were used to assess neonates. RESULTS: We found a strong correlation between the presence of the sucking reflex and umbilical cord arterial pH (r = 0.32; p = 0.018981). Umbilical cord arterial pH was also correlated with the presence of asymmetric tonic neck reflex (r = 0.27; p = 0.047124), cost of attention (r = 0.31; p = 0.025381) and general motor maturity (r = 0.34; p = 0.011741). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the sucking reflex may be affected in infants with low umbilical cord arterial pH values. Practitioners and parents can use the NBAS to help determine neurodevelopmental factors and outcomes in preterm infants, possibly leading to safer and more effective feeding practices and interventions.","output":"Impact of umbilical cord arterial pH, gestational age, and birth weight on neurodevelopmental outcomes for preterm neonates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India reported over 10 million COVID-19 cases and 149,000 deaths in 2020.

It is reasonable to expect that if HCQ can prevent or reduce the adverse effects of influenza, it may also reduce the effects of COVID-19 in humans. The objective of this study was to test whether HCQ can prevent or reduce the risk and severity of influenza. MethodsThis is an observational cohort study using medico-administrative data from Quebec. Patients included had at least one emergency department (ED) visit in 2012 or 2013, with a prior diagnosis of chronic conditions, and were admissible to the public drug insurance plan. Two sub-cohorts were considered depending on reasons for ED visit: other than influenza or pneumonia (primary prevention) and influenza or pneumonia (secondary prevention). ResultsIn the primary prevention analysis (n=417,353), patients taking HCQ (n=3,659) had an increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia in the following year compared to those who did not (5.2% vs. 2.9%; adjusted OR=1.25, p=0.0079). In the secondary prevention analysis (n=27,152), patients taking HCQ (n=392), compared to those who did not had a modest and non-significant increased risk of hospitalization for pneumonia after 30 days (25.8% vs. 22.6%; adjusted OR=1.14, p=0.3177). InterpretationBased on the assumption that HCQ has similar effects on the COVID-19 as those observed on influenza, we can infer that it will not have positive effects on COVID-19. We should therefore act cautiously before initiating prospective interventional studies on the use of HCQ to reduce adverse effects of COVID-19.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): an observational cohort study in primary and secondary prevention of pneumonia in an at-risk population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Initially, children were thought to be spared from disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

All MIS-C patients had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with intact neutralization capability. Cytokine profiling identified elevated signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1), and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, and CCL28). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of non-classical monocytes, and subsets of NK and T lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected tissues. Finally, profiling the autoantigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal, and immune-cell antigens.

As influential information sources, mainstream news media have a unique opportunity to use their platform to debunk and educate the public about misinformation. Despite evidence lending support to the potential for mainstream news media to play a larger role in combating misinformation in society, empirical explorations of how they have contributed to the management of misinformation remain scant. This study aims to address these major gaps in research by investigating how mainstream news dailies gatekeep and correct COVID-19 related misinformation in Singapore. The content of 164 news articles published by the mainstream news dailies in Singapore from January 1 to April 30, 2020 on COVID-19 misinformation was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Results show that the two main types of misinformation, fabricated and reconfigured misinformation, were covered almost equally by mainstream news media. Misinformation related to science and health were most frequently reported, followed by scams, and government policy. Statistically significant differences were found between how mainstream news media corrected the various types and topics of misinformation. Significant differences were also found within the various types, topics, and corrections of misinformation across the early stages of the pandemic. Taken together, these findings shed light on the critical role of mainstream news media as public education tools to correct misinformation during public health crises. From a theoretical perspective, these findings contribute to the understanding of media misinformation gatekeeping, and misinformation correction.

Concerns include potential side effects caused by the antigen itself and safety of viral DNA and RNA delivery vectors. The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which might cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine complemented with VSV G, VSVG-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients, and protected transgenic K18-hACE2 mice from COVID-19-like disease.

It also caused an increase in new paid subscriptions. We find similar results for the blocking of 19 piracy sites in 2013. However, blocking a single site in 2012 caused no increase in usage of legal sites but instead caused users to increase visits to other unblocked piracy sites and VPN sites. We find evidence that increased search and learning costs associated with piracy drive the effectiveness of blocking multiple sites rather than just one primary site.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether differential testing by age group explains observed variation in incidence. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Persons diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and those tested for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: Test volumes from the Ontario Laboratories Information System, number of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases from the Integrated Public Health Information System, and population figures from Statistics Canada. Demographic and temporal patterns in incidence, testing rates, and test positivity were explored using negative binomial regression models and standardization. Sources of variation in standardized ratios were identified and test-adjusted standardized infection ratios (SIRs) were estimated by metaregression. RESULTS: Observed disease incidence and testing rates were highest in the oldest age group and markedly lower in those younger than 20 years; no differences in incidence were seen by sex. After adjustment for testing frequency, SIRs were lowest in children and in adults aged 70 years or older and markedly higher in adolescents and in males aged 20 to 49 years compared with the overall population. Test-adjusted SIRs were highly correlated with standardized positivity ratios (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.95]; P < 0.001) and provided a case identification fraction similar to that estimated with serologic testing (26.7% vs. 17.2%). LIMITATIONS: The novel methodology requires external validation. Case and testing data were not linkable at the individual level.

METHODS: In this study mobile and fixed-site measurements of aerosol particle concentrations in the ambient air in one of the busiest streets in Lublin, a mid-sized city in Central Europe (Poland) during the COVID-19 lockdown in the spring of 2020 were performed. Based on the measurements particle doses received by road users during different times of the day were assessed. The obtained results were compared with corresponding pre-COVID-19 measurements also performed in the spring which were available only from 2017. RESULTS: During lockdown the mass concentration of traffic-related submicrometer PM(1) particles and number concentration of ultrafine PN(0.1) particles was significantly reduced. This resulted in a decrease of doses inhaled by road users as well as of particle doses deposited in their respiratory tracks. The greatest reductions of respectively over 2 times and over 5 times were observed during the day for total particles and traffic-related particles. Smaller reductions indicating the existence of relatively intensive non-traffic emissions were reported at night. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial decrease in traffic intensity in the city caused by lockdown restrictions resulted in a significant reduction in the concentration of vehicle-generated particles in the ambient air.

This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase images from Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI as a risk factor of the intrahepatic distant recurrence of early stage HCC following radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS A total of 132 patients who underwent preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI followed by initial RFA were retrospectively analyzed. Post-RFA intrahepatic distant recurrence, which excluded the hypervascularization of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules detected by preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, was evaluated according to the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. RESULTS Intrahepatic distant recurrence rates following RFA were higher in patients with non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (1-year: 22.5%, 2-year: 52.1%, 5-year: 89.1%) compared with in patients without non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (1-year: 7.0%, 2-year: 28.8%, 5-year: 48.7%). The presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules was associated with markedly increased cumulative recurrence rates of both identical and different subsegment intrahepatic distant recurrence, being an independent risk factor for post-RFA identical and different subsegment intrahepatic distant recurrence (identical: HR = 2.365, P = 0.027; different: HR = 3.276, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION The presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase images from Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI obtained prior to RFA is an important predictive factor of intrahepatic distant recurrence following RFA of HCC.","output":"Presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on Gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Article impact statement: The optimism permeating biological conservation should be recalibrated considering the future that present times portend.","output":"Conservation optimism and reckoning with the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to evergrowing importance of understanding flow of bio-fluids in Lab-on-CD based systems, we investigate the flow behaviour of power-law fluids in the rotating electroosmotic flow through a polyelectrolyte grafted (soft) narrow channel. We use an in-house numerical code to solve the governing transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. The effect of fluid rheology on the shear stress distribution is also discussed. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","output":"Rotating electroosmotic flow of power-law fluid through polyelectrolyte grafted microchannel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Objectives: To describe the clinical characteristics and clinical course of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases (ADs) compared to the general population. (2) Methods: We used information available in the nationwide Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, which retrospectively compiles data from the first admission of adult patients with COVID-19. We selected all patients with ADs included in the registry and compared them to the remaining patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during admission, readmission, and subsequent admissions, and secondary outcomes were a composite outcome including the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), or death, as well as in-hospital complications. (3) Results: A total of 13,940 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included, of which 362 (2.6%) had an AD. Patients with ADs were older, more likely to be female, and had greater comorbidity. On the multivariate logistic regression analysis, which involved the inverse propensity score weighting method, AD as a whole was not associated with an increased risk of any of the outcome variables. Habitual treatment with corticosteroids (CSs), age, Barthel Index score, and comorbidity were associated with poor outcomes. Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were associated with a decrease in mortality in patients with AD.

The lockdown impacted several aspects of life including the economy. Food security became a growing concern for many households. AIM The aim of the study was to explore the diet diversity of urban households in India during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS Information regarding socioeconomic status (SES), family size and information regarding availability and access to food were gathered from 450 households. Diet diversity was assessed using a 69-item food frequency questionnaire. Food variety scores (FVS) were computed for individual food groups and overall. RESULTS The majority of the households (86.4%) belonged to the upper-middle or upper SES. Households did not experience any constraints in accessibility and availability of food except the meat group. Overall, 84% of the households had low FVS for most of the food groups except for sugar and milk and milk products. The household SES score was positively associated with the milk FVS (B = 0.039, p = 0.020) and negatively with the fat FVS (B = -0.062, p < 0.001). The number of adults (B = 6.773, p < 0.001) in the household positively predicted the FVS of cereal, vegetable, fruit, fat and total FVS. CONCLUSIONS The higher SES households in urban India did not experience food insecurity. Despite this, their poor diet diversity is a serious cause for concern, especially in the wake of the evolving pandemic. This highlights the need to promote consumption of a diverse variety of foods.","output":"Diet diversity of urban households in India during the COVID-19 lockdown."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with infection and pneumonia related to SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are available.

Methods This research used a cross-sectional descriptive design with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis involving secondary data acquired from a report by the Provincial Health Office of Central Java, recorded up to 13 December 2020. Results The results showed that the highest frequencies of death cases were contributed from 60 years group (n=1897 patients; 43.52%) and the male (n=2497 patients; 57.28%) group. The case fatality rate (CFR) rose with age, and the highest CFR was recorded in the elderly (17.95%), males (7.60%), in Pati District (17.45%), while entrepreneur (14.64%) was the highest reported job. Furthermore, the eldest group (60 years) and males were more susceptible to die, with ORs 5.49 (95%CI: 5.15-5.86) and 1.61 (95%CI: 1.51-1.71), sequentially.

This method was applied to Bacillus subtilis cultures, in which the lipopeptide antibiotic fengycin as well as the polyketide antibiotic bacillaene were produced. The automated harvesting and collection in a custom-built glass body called flounder was repeated several hundred times. The fengycin concentration in the fractions was found to be four times higher than in the culture centrifugate. Of the overall fengycin, 50% (w/w) were recovered after 300 cycles, 95% (w/w) after 800 harvesting cycles. A separation of fengycin from the less surface-active bacillaene could be achieved due to stronger surface activity of fengycin. The ratio of partition coefficients of fengycin and bacillaene was nine times higher compared to foam fractionation. A stepwise increase of the equilibrium surface tension in the centrifugate from 29 to 33 mN/m indicated a fractionated separation of different surface-active substances. The utilization of cell containing culture broth instead of centrifugate had only slight effects on separation efficiency.

Health professions education frequently uses collaborative small group work to practice therapeutic reasoning. This pilot study compared the impact of a web-based/mobile tool for collaborative case work and discussion to usual practice on student perceptions and performance on questions designed to test therapeutic knowledge and reasoning. METHODS: In a therapeutics course that includes case-based workshops, student teams of 3 to 4 were randomly assigned to usual workshop preparation (group SOAP sheet) or preparation using the Practice Improvement using Virtual Online Training (PIVOT) platform. PIVOT was also used in the workshop to review the case and student responses. The next week, groups crossed over to the other condition. Students rated favorability with the preparatory and in-workshop experiences and provided comments about the PIVOT platform via a survey. Student performance on examination items related to the 2 workshop topics was compared. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven students (94%) completed post-workshop surveys after both workshops. The majority of students (57%) preferred using the PIVOT platform for workshop collaboration. Favorability ratings for the in-workshop experience did not change significantly from first to second study week, regardless of sequence of exposure. There was no relationship between examination item scores and the workshop platform the students were exposed to for that content (P = .29). Student responses highlighted the efficiency of working independently before collaborating as a group and the ability to see other students thought processes as valuable aspects of PIVOT. Students expressed frustration with the PIVOT user interface and the lack of anonymity when discussing their answers in the workshop. CONCLUSION: A web-based/mobile platform for student team collaboration on therapeutic reasoning cases discussed in small group settings yielded favorable ratings, examination performance comparable to standard approaches, and was preferred by a majority of students.

In this domain, learning algorithms must not only be able to handle massive volumes of rapidly arriving data, but also adapt themselves to potential emerging changes. The phenomenon of the evolving nature of data streams is known as concept drift. While there is a plethora of methods designed for detecting its occurrence, all of them assume that the drift is connected with underlying changes in the source of data. However, one must consider the possibility of a malicious injection of false data that simulates a concept drift. This adversarial setting assumes a poisoning attack that may be conducted in order to damage the underlying classification system by forcing adaptation to false data. Existing drift detectors are not capable of differentiating between real and adversarial concept drift. In this paper, we propose a framework for robust concept drift detection in the presence of adversarial and poisoning attacks. We introduce the taxonomy for two types of adversarial concept drifts, as well as a robust trainable drift detector. It is based on the augmented Restricted Boltzmann Machine with improved gradient computation and energy function. We also introduce Relative Loss of Robustness - a novel measure for evaluating the performance of concept drift detectors under poisoning attacks. Extensive computational experiments, conducted on both fully and sparsely labeled data streams, prove the high robustness and efficacy of the proposed drift detection framework in adversarial scenarios.","output":"Adversarial Concept Drift Detection under Poisoning Attacks for Robust Data Stream Mining"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) in dentists.

While these assembly intermediates are essential for maturation and quality control, how they form, and how their structure promotes quality control remains unknown. To address these questions, we determined the structure of an 80S-like ribosome assembly intermediate to an overall resolution of 3.4 ?. The structure, validated by biochemical data, resolves a large body of previously paradoxical data and illustrates how assembly and translation factors cooperate to promote the formation of an interface that lacks many mature subunit contacts but is stabilized by the universally conserved Dim1. We also show how Tsr1 enables this interface by blocking the canonical binding of eIF5B to 40S subunits, while maintaining its binding to 60S. The structure also shows how this interface leads to unfolding of the platform, which allows for temporal regulation of the ATPase Fap7, thus linking 40S maturation to quality-control during ribosome assembly.","output":"An open interface in the pre-80S ribosome coordinated by ribosome assembly factors Tsr1 and Dim1 enables temporal regulation of Fap7"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A new coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 by the WHO, has rapidly spread around the world since its first reported case in late December of 2019 from Wuhan, the People's Republic of China. As of mid-April 2020, this virus has affected more than 180 countries and territories, infecting more than 1,650,000 individuals and causing over 100,000 deaths. With approximately 20 million new cases globally per year, cancer affects a substantial portion of the population. Individuals affected by cancer are more susceptible to infections owing to coexisting chronic diseases (cardiovascular, pulmonary, and diabetes), overall poor health status, and systemic immunosuppressive states caused by both cancer and the anticancer treatment. As a consequence, patients with malignancies, especially those with lung cancer who develop coronavirus disease 2019, experience more difficult outcomes. A recent multicenter study carried out by the Hubei Anti-Cancer Association has also documented that patients with lung cancer had an increased risk of death, intensive care unit requirement, risk of presenting severe or critical symptoms, and use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Here, we present two representative cases of patients with lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 without respiratory compromise and with atypical and severe skin manifestations-findings that could be influenced by the long-term use of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody.","output":"Atypical Skin Manifestations During Immune Checkpoint Blockage in Coronavirus Disease 2019-Infected Patients With Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: (1) To catalogue and map all singing for health and wellbeing groups in the Republic of Ireland (ROI); (2) determine how they prioritise health outcomes; (3) understand what they consider success; and (4) identify gaps in provision. METHODS: A novel mixed-methods survey was distributed electronically through SING Ireland (the Choir Association of Ireland), artsandhealth.ie, and to 2736 potential stakeholders with links to singing for health and wellbeing and singing on social prescription (SSP) from October 2020 to April 2021. Thematic analysis was used to analyse four open-ended survey questions. RESULTS: A total of 185 singing for health and wellbeing groups were identified, with varied representation in each of the ROIs 26 counties. 35 groups were noted to have links to SSP. Gaps in provision for clinical and individual populations and for SSP were identified. Six themes related to the success of group singing for health and wellbeing programmes were determined: fostering and funding social and community connections; the people and the approach; enjoyment and atmosphere; musical and personal growth, programmatic structure and musical content; and the impact of Covid. CONCLUSION: The first-ever national mapping of group singing for health and wellbeing in the ROI, and one of few internationally, this study may serve as a roadmap for gathering information about existing singing for health and wellbeing provision and identifying geographical and clinical gaps internationally.

Single access laparoscopy has recently gained interest, but single access laparoscopic splenectomy has not been reported to date. It has the possible benefits of less pain, faster recovery, better cosmesis, with theoretically similar costs to that of traditional trocars. METHODS A case is presented and the surgical technique of single access laparoscopic splenectomy is detailed. RESULTS The patient is an otherwise healthy 24-year-old male with medically refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and a platelet count of 15 000. A splenectomy was performed using a single incision laparoscopic technique. The patient was placed in a right lateral decubitus position, and a 2.5-cm left upper quadrant incision was made. A multi-instrument flexible single incision port was used that held 3 trocars. A standard splenectomy was performed through this port. A linear stapler was used to transect the splenic hilum. The procedure time was just over 2 hours. The patient did well, was happy with his incision, and was discharged with a platelet count of 108 000.

In March 2020, Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, in partnership with city and state public health agencies, municipal leaders, and homeless service providers, developed and implemented a citywide COVID-19 care model for this vulnerable population. Components included symptom screening at shelter front doors, expedited testing at pop-up sites, isolation and management venues for symptomatic people under investigation and for people with confirmed disease, quarantine venues for asymptomatic exposed people, and contact investigation and tracing. Real-time disease surveillance efforts in a large shelter outbreak of COVID-19 during the third week of operations illustrated the need for several adaptations to the care model to better respond to the local epidemiology of illness among people experiencing homelessness. Symptom screening was de-emphasized given the high number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections discovered during mass testing; contact tracing and quarantining were phased out under the assumption of universal exposure among the sheltered population; and isolation and management venues were rapidly expanded to accommodate a surge in people with newly diagnosed COVID-19. During the first 6 weeks of operation, 429 of 1297 (33.1%) tested people were positive for COVID-19; of these, 395 people were experiencing homelessness at the time of testing, representing about 10% of the homeless adult population in Boston.

METHOD: The data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. RESULTS: Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p < 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p < 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p < 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups.

Recent studies have suggested that GLP-1-based drugs exert beneficial effects in chronic, as well as acute, lung injury rodent models.

Importantly, these effects were virtually absent in GLP-1R(?/?) mice. A well-known function of GLP-1 and GLP-based drugs in pancreatic -cells is the attenuation of high-glucose stimulated expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TxNIP), a key component of inflammasome. LPS-challenged lungs showed elevated TxNIP mRNA and protein expression, which was attenuated by liraglutide treatment in a GLP-1R-dependent manner. Hence, our observations suggest that GLP-1R is essential in mediating beneficial effects of liraglutide in acute lung injury, with the inflammasome component TxNIP as a potential target.","output":"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor mediates the beneficial effect of liraglutide in an acute lung injury mouse model involving the thioredoxin-interacting protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Vaccine safety surveillance is important because it is related to vaccine hesitancy, which affects vaccination rate. To increase confidence in vaccination, the active monitoring of vaccine adverse events is important. For effective active surveillance, we developed and verified a machine learning-based active surveillance system using national claim data. METHODS: We used two databases, one from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which contains flu vaccination records for the elderly, and another from the National Health Insurance Service, which contains the claim data of vaccinated people. We developed a case-crossover design based machine learning model to predict the health outcome of interest events (anaphylaxis and agranulocytosis) using a random forest. Feature importance values were evaluated to determine candidate associations with each outcome. We investigated the relationship of the features to each event via a literature review, comparison with the Side Effect Resource, and using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation method. RESULTS: The trained model predicted each health outcome of interest with a high accuracy (approximately 70%). We found literature supporting our results, and most of the important drug-related features were listed in the Side Effect Resource database as inducing the health outcome of interest. For anaphylaxis, flu vaccination ranked high in our feature importance analysis and had a positive association in Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. Although the feature importance of vaccination was lower for agranulocytosis, it also had a positive relationship in the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. CONCLUSION: We developed a machine learning-based active surveillance system for detecting possible factors that can induce adverse events using health claim and vaccination databases.

No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the disease was indicated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. METHODS: The efficacy assessment of the different treatments was performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: After the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3 of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials. Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial. Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of other immune therapies were not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the supportive therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study objective was to determine COVID-19 VH among Mexican outpatients with RMDs and validate the COVID-19 VH questionnaire. This cross-sectional study was developed in three steps. Step 1 consisted of translation/cultural adaptation of the Oxford-COVID-19-VH questionnaire. Step 2 consisted of pilot testing and questionnaire feasibility, content, construct and criterion validity, reliability (internal consistency and temporal stability) and questionnaire sensitivity to change. Step 3 consisted of VH phenomenon quantification in patients from two metropolitan tertiary-care-level centers. Step 1 followed ISPOR-task-force recommendations. Patients who participated in step 2 (n = 50 for pilot testing/feasibility and n = 208 for questionnaire validation [91 in test-retest and 70 in questionnaire-sensitivity to change]) and step 3 (n = 600) were representative outpatients with RMDs. The seven-item COVID-19 VH questionnaire was found feasible, valid (experts' agreement 80%; a 1-factor structure accounted for 60.73% of the total variance; rho = 0.156, p = .025 between COVID-19 VH questionnaire and score from the Spanish version of the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale; and lower questionnaire scores in patients who reported 5 years-previous influenza vaccination), reliable (Cronbach's  = 0.889, intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.933 and 95% confidence interval = 0.898-0.956) and sensitive to change (effect size = 1.17 and 0.86, respectively, in patients who decreased [n = 34] and increased [n = 31] questionnaire-score after intervention).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We queried the COVID-19 Research Network, a multinational database using the TriNetX network, to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The main end point of the study was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 14,712 patients were included, of whom 6387 (43%) were men. Men were older (mean age, 55.017.7 years vs 51.117.9 years; P<.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, nicotine dependence, and heart failure but a lower prevalence of obesity. Before propensity score matching (PSM), all-cause mortality rate was 8.8% in men and 4.3% in women (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.87 to 2.46; P<.001) at a median follow-up duration of 34 and 32 days, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival was significantly lower in men than in women (73% vs 86%; log-rank, P<.001). After PSM, all-cause mortality remained significantly higher in men than in women (8.13% vs 4.60%; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.11; P<.001). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in men than in women (74% vs 86%; log-rank, P<.001). The cumulative probability of survival remained significantly lower in propensity score-matched men than in women after excluding patients younger than 50 years and those who were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker medications on admission. CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19 infection, men had a significantly higher mortality than did women, and this difference was not completely explained by the higher prevalence of comorbidities in men.","output":"Sex Differences in Case Fatality Rate of COVID-19: Insights From a Multinational Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This final analysis of a long-term extension (LTE) study assessed the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of peficitinib (ASP015K), a pan-Janus kinase inhibitor, in Asian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients had previously completed the 12-week phase 2b (RAJ1), or 52-week phase 3 (RAJ3 and RAJ4) peficitinib studies in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and received oral peficitinib 50 or 100 mg/day. Dose increase to 150 mg/day or reduction to 50 mg/day was permitted. Efficacy endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20/50/70 response rates, 28-joint Disease Activity Score with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP), and ACR components. Safety endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and incidence rates (IRs) of adverse events of special interest per 100 patient-years (PY). RESULTS: Overall, 843 patients received peficitinib for a mean 32.0 months (maximum 85.2 months), and most (64.4%) received peficitinib 100 mg/day as a maximum dose. Respective ACR20/50/70 response rates were maintained from baseline (week 0 of LTE; 71.6, 52.1, and 34.7%) to end of treatment (78.7, 63.3, and 44.1%); continuous improvements in ACR components and DAS28-CRP were observed from the baselines of preceding studies and throughout the LTE. Overall, 796/843 (94.4%) patients experienced TEAEs; most were severity grade 1/2. Most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (47.0%) and herpes zoster (17.3%). Drug-related TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 140 (16.6%) patients, and IRs (95% confidence interval) per 100 PY of serious infections, herpes zoster-related disease, and malignancies were 2.7 (2.1, 3.4), 7.3 (6.2, 8.6), and 1.2 (0.9, 1.8), respectively. Two deaths occurred during the study; one each from diffuse large B cell lymphoma and pneumonia, which were, respectively considered probably and possibly related to study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in effectiveness variables were maintained during this long-term study of peficitinib in Asian patients with RA; peficitinib was generally well tolerated over a mean 32 months duration.

Current literature does not indicate a relationship between pediatric diabetes and risk of developing MIS-C. Here, we report a case of pediatric type 2 diabetes (T2D) with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe multi-organ dysfunction with SARS-CoV-2 serology positivity. Clinical Case: A 13-year-old African American female with obesity (Body Mass Index >99(th) %) and poorly controlled T2D (HbA1c 12.8%) presented to the emergency department for one week of sore throat, headache, and abdominal pain. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was confirmed by PCR. The next day, she was found unconscious at home. She was diagnosed with DKA and was directly admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. IV insulin and aggressive fluid resuscitation were initiated and her DKA resolved over the next 72 hrs. However, she exhibited continued altered mental status with slurred speech and significant respiratory distress requiring respiratory support. Due to the severe presentation and multi-organ involvement, a multi-disciplinary care team was formed. Further workup confirmed acute respiratory distress syndrome with pneumonia; severe acute kidney injury (AKI, creatinine of 4.56 mg/dL); presumed myocarditis (ST elevation on EKG, troponin 4.47 ng/mL, BNP 129.8 pg/mL); punctuate intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the splenium of the corpus callosum; transaminitis (AST 188 u/L, ALT 100 u/L); pancreatitis (amylase 651 u/L, lipase >9500 u/L); thrombocytopenia with consumptive coagulopathy (platelet 81 X 10(3)/L, d-dimer 5.91 mcg FEU/mL), increased inflammatory markers (ESR 53 mm/hr, ferritin 127 ng/mL), and positive SARS-CoV-2 serology. A presumed diagnosis of MIS-C was made per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition and she was started on dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). While consideration was given to the possibility of acute COVID-19 infection in combination with DKA, she was not a candidate for remdesivir due to AKI. On day 12, she developed new dysarthria, dyspraxia and behavioral changes. Encephalopathy workup was negative (CSF Encephalopathy autoimmune panel negative, NMDA receptor negative) and she was restarted on dexamethasone and IVIG. She was discharged on day 28. Conclusion: There is a paucity of literature of MIS-C associated with COVID-19 in the pediatric diabetes. Our case highlights several novel aspects of MIS-C with concurrent poorly controlled diabetes and DKA, including severe central nervous system manifestations and prolonged hospitalization. Further studies are warranted to elucidate an association between pediatric diabetes and MIS-C and to develop guidelines for management of MIS-C in poorly controlled pediatric diabetes.","output":"A Case of Severe MIS-C in Pediatric Diabetes: Complications of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Publisher Summary The achievement of robust and regulated protein production in mammalian cells is a complex process that requires careful consideration of many factors, including transcriptional and translational control elements, RNA processing, gene copy number, mRNA stability, the chromosomal site of gene integration, potential toxicity of recombinant proteins to the host cell, and the genetic properties of the host.

According to the specific purposes, the specific lab thickness and direction can be selected. This technology can better show organs, such as blood vessels, arteries, veins, and bronchi and so forth, from different directions, which could bring more intuitive and comprehensive results for doctors in the diagnosis of related diseases. However, in this traditional projection technology, the details of the small projected target are not clearly visualized when the projected target is not much different from the surrounding environment, which could lead to missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new technology that can better and clearly display the angiogram. However, to the best of our knowledge, research in this area is scarce. To fill this gap in the literature, in the present study, we propose a new method based on the hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) to synthesize the projection image. We first adopted the U-net to obtain feature or enhanced images to be projected; subsequently, the RBF neural network performed further synthesis processing for these data; finally, the projection images were obtained. For experimental data, in order to increase the robustness of the proposed algorithm, the following three different types of datasets were adopted: the vascular projection of the brain, the bronchial projection of the lung parenchyma, and the vascular projection of the liver. In addition, radiologist evaluation and five classic metrics of image definition were implemented for effective analysis.

However, commercial reagents for neutralizing antibodies were developed after the anti- severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies. Therefore, some laboratories did not perform neutralizing antibody testing services due to multiple factors. OBJECTIVE.-: To find a fast, accurate, and economical alternative for the detection of neutralizing antibodies for the development of COVID-19 screening programs. DESIGN.-: The response and correlation of three antibodies (anti-spike protein (S) neutralizing antibody, total anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibody, and anti-RBD IgG) was determined by observing the dynamics in 61 participants for 160 days post vaccination. RESULTS.-: The levels of neutralizing and anti-RBD IgG antibodies reached their peak values on day 42 post vaccination (120.75 IU/mL and 14.38 signal-to-cutoff ratio [S/CO], respectively). The total antibody levels peaked at 138.47 S/CO on day 35 post vaccination. The strongest correlation was found between neutralizing and anti-RBD IgG antibody levels (r = 0.894, P < .001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for total antibody levels for the prediction of seropositivity for neutralizing antibodies was 0.881 (P < .001) and that for anti-RBD IgG antibody levels was 0.937 (P < .001).

Given the absence of data to address concerns related to SARS-CoV-2 infection while on these agents in an evidence-based manner, a Pediatric Dermatology COVID-19 Response Task Force (PDCRTF) was assembled to offer time-sensitive guidance for clinicians. METHODS A survey was distributed to an expert panel of 37 pediatric dermatologists on the PDCRTF to assess expert opinion and current practice related to three primary domains of systemic therapy: initiation, continuation, and laboratory monitoring. RESULTS Nearly all respondents (97%) reported that the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their decision to initiate immunosuppressive medications. The majority of pediatric dermatologists (87%) reported that they were pausing or reducing the frequency of laboratory monitoring for certain immunosuppressive medications. In asymptomatic patients, continuing therapy was the most popular choice across all medications queried. The majority agreed that patients on immunosuppressive medications who have a household exposure to COVID-19 or test positive for acute infection should temporarily discontinue systemic and biologic medications, with the exception of systemic steroids, which may require tapering. CONCLUSIONS The ultimate decision regarding initiation, continuation and laboratory monitoring of immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic requires careful deliberation, consideration of the little evidence available, and discussion with families. Consideration of an individual's adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, risk of exposure, and the potential severity if infected must be weighed against the dermatological disease, medication, and risks to the patient of tapering or discontinuing therapies.","output":"Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Inflammatory Skin Diseases in Children: Expert-Consensus-Based Guidance for Clinical Decision Making During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hong Kong is a major international travel hub and a densely populated city geographically adjacent to Mainland China.

Clinical and laboratory follow-up were performed on days 0, 7 and 14. Deep tracheal aspiration samples were examined for bacterial and viral pathogens by multiplex PCR, and standard bacteriological culture method. RESULTS The etiological identification rate in 50 patients for bacteria, viruses and mixed virus-bacteria combination by PCR were 62%, 4%, 32%, respectively and 60% in 55 patients by bacterial culture method. Streptococcus pneumoniae concomitant with Haemophilus influenzae (36%) and rhinovirus (16%) was very common, whereas atypical pathogens (only Mycoplasma pneumoniae) were rare (6%). Rhinovirus was the most common viral agent (20%). Recently identified viruses, human coronavirus HKU1 and human bocavirus were not detected except for human metapneumovirus (one case). There was no significant difference in terms of mean age, immune status, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP) values, hospitalization duration and CURB-65 score between bacterial and mixed viral-bacterial detections.

Results: The bacteria count for six Ni-Cr alloy disc-shaped specimens were recorded as 40, 10, 8, 6, 5, and 4 CFU/ml, respectively. Intensity of the colonies were found to be lower in other groups. 5 CFU/ml were detected on a single PMMA sample in the control group, and 40 CFU/ml were detected on one of the dental ceramic sample. No MTB uptake was observed on any sample in the 2% glutaraldehyde and 5% NaOCl disinfectant study groups. In alcohol-based disinfectant group, 1 CFU/ml was observed on Ni-Cr alloy sample. The effect of prosthetic materials used in this experimental study were not statistically significant on the CFU (p = 0.293). However, the disinfectants use was statistically significant on the number of colonies (p = 0.004). Conclusion: NaOCl and glutaraldehyde appeared to be more effective than alcohol-based disinfectant in removing MTB from Ni-Cr alloy, PMMA and dental ceramic surfaces.","output":"Evaluating the Efficacy of Chemical Disinfectants on Contaminated Dental Materials Contaminated by An Airborne Disease Tuberculosis Similar to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Telemedicine is a rapidly growing healthcare sector that can improve access to care for underserved populations and offer flexibility and convenience to patients and clinicians alike. However, uncertainty about insurance coverage and reimbursement policies for telemedicine has historically been a major barrier to adoption, especially among physicians in private practice (the majority of practicing allergists). RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 public health emergency has highlighted the importance of telehealth as a safe and effective healthcare delivery model, with governments and payers rapidly expanding coverage and payment in an effort to ensure public access to healthcare in the midst of an infectious pandemic. This comprehensive review of updated telemedicine coverage and payment policies will include a tabular guide on how to appropriately bill and optimize reimbursement for telemedicine services. This review of current trends in telemedicine coverage, billing, and reimbursement will outline the historical and current state of telemedicine payment policies in the USA, with special focus on recent policy changes implemented in light of COVID-19. The authors will also explore the potential future landscape of telehealth coverage and reimbursement beyond the resolution of the public health emergency.","output":"Telemedicine Pays: Billing and Coding Update"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the interest in facial detection grows, especially during a pandemic, solutions are sought that will be effective and bring more benefits. This is the case with the use of thermal imaging, which is resistant to environmental factors and makes it possible, for example, to determine the temperature based on the detected face, which brings new perspectives and opportunities to use such an approach for health control purposes. The goal of this work is to analyze the effectiveness of deep-learning-based face detection algorithms applied to thermal images, especially for faces covered by virus protective face masks. As part of this work, a set of thermal images was prepared containing over 7900 images of faces with and without masks. Selected raw data preprocessing methods were also investigated to analyze their influence on the face detection results. It was shown that the use of transfer learning based on features learned from visible light images results in mAP greater than 82% for half of the investigated models. The best model turned out to be the one based on Yolov3 model (mean average precisionmAP, was at least 99.3%, while the precision was at least 66.1%).

The purpose of this review is to explore whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and its related pathophysiological mechanisms. Based on the high thrombosis rate and frequent strokes of COVID-19 patients, combined with related laboratory indicators and pathological results, the discussion is mainly from two aspects: nerve invasion and endothelial dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade the CNS through blood-borne and neuronal retrograde pathways, causing cerebrovascular diseases. In addition, the endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 is almost certain.

Patient choice was considered in the holistic trial design so that patients were not denied either the essential oil or antiemetics. Patients rated nausea 0 to 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale at symptom onset and within 60 minutes of the intervention. RESULTS: Only three subjects enrolled in the antiemetic arm; thus this arm was eliminated from analysis, resulting in 100 evaluable patients.

Significant HbDCMAP coherence indicated cerebral pressure passivity. CBV changes were measured as the spectral power of total hemoglobin (S(HbT)) at the ventilator frequency. A regression model tested whether S(HbT) predicts cerebral pressure passivity and/or death/brain injury, controlling for birth gestational age and other factors.

These drugs are docked onto the three-dimensional structure of the nsp12 protein of SARS-CoV-2, which controls the polymerization process. Hence, it is considered one of the primary therapeutic targets for coronaviruses. Sofosbuvir is a drug that is currently used for HCV treatment; therefore, HCV RdRp is used as a positive control protein target. The protein dynamics are simulated for 100 ns, while the binding is tested during different dynamics states of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, the drug-protein complexes are further simulated for 20 ns to explore the binding mechanism. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as a target with the active form of sofosbuvir as a ligand demonstrates binding effectiveness. One of the FDA-approved antiviral drugs, such as sofosbuvir, can help us in this mission, aiming to limit the danger of COVID-19.

By utilizing this system, we achieve hypoxia-specific expression of two therapeutically relevant cargo elements: the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) suicide gene and the CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease. Using an expression vector containing five copies of the HRE derived from the vascular endothelial growth factor gene, we are able to show high transgene expression in cells in a hypoxic environment, similar to levels achieved using the cytomegalovirus (CMV) and CBh promoters.

Interestingly, Emergency Department (ED) referrals for reasons other than Covid-19 seem to have declined steeply. In the present paper, we aimed to verify how the Covid-19 outbreak changed ED referral pattern. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients referred to the ED of a University Hospital in Northern Italy from 1st March to 13th April 2020. We compared the following data with those belonging to the same period in 2019: number of EDs accesses, rate of hospital admission, frequencies of the most common causes of ED referral, priority codes of access. RESULTS: The number of ED referrals during the Covid-19 outbreak was markedly reduced when compared to the same period in 2019 (3059 vs. 5691;-46.3%). Conversely, the rate of hospital admission raised from 16.9% to 35.4% (p<0.0001), with a shift toward higher priority codes of ED admission. In 2020, we observed both a reduction of the number of patients referred for both traumatic (513, 16.8% vs. 1544, 27.1%; &#967;2=118.7, p<0.0001) and non-traumatic (4147 vs. 2546) conditions. Among the latter, suspected Covid-19 accounted for 1101 (43.2%) accesses. CONCLUSIONS: The Covid-19 pandemic completely changed the pattern of ED referral in Italy, with a marked reduction of the accesses to the hospitals. This could be related to a limited exposure to traumas and to a common fear of being infected during EDs in-stay. This may limit the misuse of EDs for non- urgent conditions, but may also delay proper referrals for urgent conditions.","output":"Pattern of emergency department referral during the Covid-19 outbreak in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is lasting longer than expected, which has a huge impact on the economy and on personal life.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eye movement of a total of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean age of 31.849.0 years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y- coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focussing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time of focussing on the periorbital region and increased also the number of repeated eye fixations during the interval of visual stimulus presentation.

Thirty male albino rats weighing \\"190-200 g\\" were divided randomly into three groups (10 each): control, MA-induced OA, and MA-induced OA + dpdo. In MA-induced OA rat, the tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factors, reactive oxygen species, as well as all the mitochondrial markers such as mitochondria membrane potential, swelling mitochondria, cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and serum oxidative/antioxidant status (malondialdehyde level and activities of myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase) are elevated. Also, the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), levels of ATP, the level of glutathione (GSH), and thiol were markedly diminished in the MA-induced OA group compared to the normal control rats.

The present study was aimed to cheminformatically analyse the binding potential of artesunate and azadirachtin with various reactive moieties of Gephyrin E, to reduce malaria scourge. With molecular dynamics (MD), binding free energy estimation and binding affinity of artesunate and azadirachtin to Gephyrin E was done. GRIP docking was done to study the interactions of these test ligands with Gephyrin E (6FGC). MD simulation gave insights to structural changes upon binding of artesunate and azadirachtin in the ligand-binding pocket of Gephyrin E. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were calculated. From the estimation, azadirachtin had a total binding energy of ?36.97 kcal/mol; artesunate had a binding energy of ?35.73 kcal/mol. The GRIP docking results provided a clearer evidence that artesunate has comparatively better binding affinity to Gephyrin E than azadirachtin, and the critical binding sites (in activity order) were cavity 3, 2, 8, and 6 for artesunate while for azadirachtin, it was cavity 6, 3, 8, and 2.

We show that optimally allocating such bailouts on a financial network in order to maximize a variety of social welfare objectives of this form is a computationally intractable problem. We develop approximation algorithms to optimize these objectives and establish guarantees for their approximation rations. Then, we incorporate multiple fairness constraints in the optimization problems and establish relative bounds on the solutions with versus without these constraints.

One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. RESULTS: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter >4cm or thickness >6mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients with ultrathick melanoma (>6mm) increased from 6.9% in the initial study group to 21.9%, 30.2%, and 30.2% at 1, 2, and 3 months. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival both decreased by 14.4% in patients treated after a potential delay of 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment of SCC and melanoma in the current lockdown situation in Spain, we can expect to see to a considerable increase in large and thick SCCs and melanomas.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the activation of the cGAS-STING axis is critical for antitumor immunity. The downstream cytokines regulated by cGAS-STING, especially type I IFNs, serve as bridges connecting innate immunity with adaptive immunity. Accordingly, a growing number of studies have focused on the synthesis and screening of STING pathway agonists. However, chronic STING activation may lead to a protumor phenotype in certain malignancies. Hence, the cGAS-STING signaling pathway must be orchestrated properly when STING agonists are used alone or in combination.

VDD among African-Americans, diabetics, hypertensive, and aged populations possibly explain the higher death rate, aggravated by cocooning. Vitamin D is pleiotropic, mediating bone metabolism, calcium homeostasis, and immune functions, whereas VDD is associated with inflammatory reactions and immune dysfunction, predisposing individuals to severe infections. Vitamin D modulates innate and adaptive immunity via the expression of genes that code antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). And the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)14, the co-receptor for epidermal toll-like receptor (TLR)4. AMPs stimulate TLR2 in macrophages, increasing the conversion of vitamin D into its active form by cytochrome P450 27B1. Antiviral properties of vitamin D-induced AMPs can shift the polarization of the adaptive immune response from helper T cells (Th)1 to the more regulatory Th2 responses that suppress immune over-reactivity by preventing cytokine storm, which is already demonstrated during the Spanish flu episode. Vitamin D induces antiviral effects by both direct and indirect mechanisms via AMPs, immunomodulation, the interplay between major cellular and viral elements, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, variation of genetic and epigenetic factors. The crosstalk between vitamin D and intracellular signaling pathways may operate as a primary regulatory action on viral gene transcription. VDD may increase the likelihood of infection with enveloped viruses, including retrovirus, hepatitis, and dengue.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can spread from individuals with presymptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic infections, the reopening of societies and the control of virus spread will be facilitated by robust population screening, for which virus testing will often be central. After infection, individuals undergo a period of incubation during which viral titers are too low to detect, followed by exponential viral growth, leading to peak viral load and infectiousness and ending with declining titers and clearance. Given the pattern of viral load kinetics, we model the effectiveness of repeated population screening considering test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and speed of reporting and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity.

The use of 0.25 ng/mL as a reference decreased the odds of antibiotic treatment by 67% (95%CI: 43C81%) and 91% (95%CI: 56C98%), respectively. Procalcitonin showed lower AUC for the prediction of LRTI and pneumonia (0.6, 95%CI: 0.53C0.66, and 0.63, 95%CI: 0.56C0.7, respectively), with a moderately high NPV in the latter case (83%, 95%CI: 79.3C86.1%). Procalcitonin use may decrease the antibiotic frequency in hospitalized influenza cases both in terms of antibiotic administration and continuation. Procalcitonin concentrations may suggest bacterial suprainfections at lower concentrations than in adults, and a focus on its rule-out value is of special interest.","output":"Low Levels of Procalcitonin Are Related to Decreased Antibiotic Use in Children Hospitalized Due to Influenza"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are the cornerstone of infectious disease outbreak response in the absence of effective pharmaceutical interventions. Outbreak strategies often involve combinations of NPIs that may change according to disease prevalence and population response. Little is known with regard to how costly each NPI is to implement. This information is essential to inform policy decisions for outbreak response. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap in existing literature, we conducted a systematic review on outbreak costings and simulation studies related to a number of NPI strategies, including isolating infected individuals, contact tracing and quarantine, and school closures. METHODS: Our search covered the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, studies published between 1990 and 24 March 2020 were included. We included studies containing cost data for our NPIs of interest in pandemic, epidemic, and outbreak response scenarios. RESULTS: We identified 61 relevant studies. There was substantial heterogeneity in the cost components recorded for NPIs in outbreak costing studies. The direct costs of NPIs for which costing studies existed also ranged widely: isolating infected individuals per case: US$141.18 to US$1042.68 (2020 values), tracing and quarantine of contacts per contact: US$40.73 to US$93.59, social distancing: US$33.76 to US$167.92, personal protection and hygiene: US$0.15 to US$895.60. CONCLUSION: While there are gaps and heterogeneity in available cost data, the findings of this review and the collated cost database serve as an important resource for evidence-based decision-making for estimating costs pertaining to NPI implementation in future outbreak response policies.

The induction of oxygen therapy is commonly considered for either treating or preventing hypoxia. Therefore, the concept of different types of hypoxia should be understood, particularly in terms of their mechanism, as the effect of oxygen therapy principally varies by the physiological characteristics of hypoxia. Oxygen molecules must be constantly delivered to all cells throughout the human body and utilized effectively in the process of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which is necessary for generating energy through the formation of adenosine triphosphate. If the oxygen availability at the cellular level is inadequate for sustaining the metabolism, the condition of hypoxia which is characterized as heterogeneity in tissue oxygen tension may develop, which is called dysoxia, a more physiological concept that is related to hypoxia. In such hypoxic patients, repetitive measurements of the lactate level in blood are generally recommended in order to select the adequate therapeutic strategy targeting a reduction in lactate production. Excessive oxygen, however, may actually induce a hyperoxic condition which thus can lead to harmful oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species, possibly resulting in cellular dysfunction or death. In contrast, the human body has several oxygen-sensing mechanisms for preventing both hypoxia and hyperoxia that are employed to ensure a proper balance between the oxygen supply and demand and prevent organs and cells from suffering hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. Thus, while the concept of hyperoxia is known to have possible adverse effects on the lung, the heart, the brain, or other organs in various pathological conditions of critically ill patients, and no obvious evidence has yet been proposed to totally support liberal oxygen supplementation in any subset of critically ill patients, relatively conservative oxygen therapy with cautious monitoring appears to be safe and may improve the outcome by preventing harmful oxidative stress resulting from excessive oxygen administration. Given the biological effects of oxygen molecules, although the optimal target levels remain controversial, unnecessary oxygen administration should be avoided, and exposure to hyperoxemia should be minimized in critically ill patients.","output":"Biological effects of the oxygen molecule in critically ill patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral genome sequencing has guided our understanding of the spread and extent of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes are usually sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs of individual patients to track viral spread. Recently, RT-qPCR of municipal wastewater has been used to quantify the abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in several regions globally. However, metatranscriptomic sequencing of wastewater can be used to profile the viral genetic diversity across infected communities. Here, we sequenced RNA directly from sewage collected by municipal utility districts in the San Francisco Bay Area to generate complete and nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The major consensus SARS-CoV-2 genotypes detected in the sewage were identical to clinical genomes from the region. Using a pipeline for single nucleotide variant calling in a metagenomic context, we characterized minor SARS-CoV-2 alleles in the wastewater and detected viral genotypes which were also found within clinical genomes throughout California. Observed wastewater variants were more similar to local California patient-derived genotypes than they were to those from other regions within the United States or globally. Additional variants detected in wastewater have only been identified in genomes from patients sampled outside California, indicating that wastewater sequencing can provide evidence for recent introductions of viral lineages before they are detected by local clinical sequencing.

METHODS: A proforma based qualitative study was carried out at the Nurses Training Centre of PAF Hospital and Fazaia Medical College, Islamabad, from January to March 2020. After approval, a semi-structured proforma with open and closed ended questions was administered, in English and Urdu. The results were analyzed by comparative numbers and percentages for each question and descriptive responses were grouped in recurring themes and analyzed for content and their constructive value. RESULTS: Out of 85 nursing cadets, the proforma could be administered to 61(M=38(62.3%) and F=23(37.7%). Most were FSc with 26% graduates. Majority of the female students main reason for joining was to serve humanity, unlike most males. According to gender many responses were interestingly different. Majority of females thought male doctors were better (86%). Only 36% said the doctors were sincere in care of patients. Most thought that we needed to improve patient counseling. Most thought the seniors treated them unfairly, but bullying was negligible. They wanted the senior HPs to improve their attitudes and ensure adequate equipment in the wards. They were worried about personal security from patients and relatives. Dedicated mental health services to deal with stress of witnessing every day misery and death was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Doctors need to improve their counseling skills and should talk more to the patients and their relatives. They should acknowledge the nursing students and improve teamwork.

METHOD This was an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial conducted at three academic medical centers. Participants were 139 outpatients with persistent symptoms of major depression after an 8-week open-label trial of escitalopram (phase 1), randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive adjunctive ziprasidone (escitalopram plus ziprasidone, N=71) or adjunctive placebo (escitalopram plus placebo, N=68), with 8 weekly follow-up assessments. The primary outcome measure was clinical response, defined as a reduction of at least 50% in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). The Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAM-A) and Visual Analog Scale for Pain were defined a priori as key secondary outcome measures. RESULTS Rates of clinical response (35.2% compared with 20.5%) and mean improvement in HAM-D total scores (-6.4 [SD=6.4] compared with -3.3 [SD=6.2]) were significantly greater for the escitalopram plus ziprasidone group.

The analytical model coupled machine learning methods, such as multiple layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes (NB), to process the hybrid patterns of four arrhythmia symptoms for AI computation.

As a validation, the predicted total number of infected was close to that found in serosurveys; more importantly, the inferred probability of detection strongly correlated with the number of daily tests per inhabitant, with 50% detection achieved with 0.003 daily tests per inhabitants. Most of the decline in transmission was explained by the reductions in transmissibility (social distancing), which avoided 10 millions deaths in the regions studied over the first four months of 2020. In contrast, symptom-based testing and isolation of positive cases was not an efficient way to control the spread of the disease, as a large part of transmission happens before symptoms and only a small fraction of infected individuals was typically detected. The latter is explained by the limited number of tests available, and the fact that increasing test capacity often increases the probability of detection less than proportionally. Together these results suggest that little control can be achieved by symptom-based testing and isolation alone.","output":"Estimating the global reduction in transmission and rise in detection capacity of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in early 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anxiety and depression, as well as stress, are well\\\\known problems observed across the world, particularly among students. This study intends to identify the level of anxiety, depression, and stress among university students and determine its association with their sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: The primary data were collected from 351 students with the help of a self\\\\administrated questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic information and contains the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale\\\\21 Items (DASS\\\\21) instrument over the period December 8, 2019CJanuary 23, 2020. The  (2) test is employed to find the association between the status of stress, anxiety, and depression level with selected sociodemographic variables, and confirmatory factor analysis is used to find interrelationships between DASS items. RESULTS: The results illustrate that no students have an extremely severe level of stress. However, the majority have a mild or moderate level of stress and it is associated with sex and residence (urban or rural). More than 40% of students have extremely severe anxiety. Results reveal that gender, residence (urban or rural), and family type of the students are linked with the anxiety level. The results also suggest that the type of accommodation of the students, their family type, and birth order are related to their depression level at a 5% level of significance. The findings also disclose that female students have more levels of depression, stress, and anxiety than their counterparts. CONCLUSION: Considering the finding, the authors think that the university authority should pay a need for greater interest to the mental well\\\\being of students to enhance their quality of life. Given the harmful impacts of stress on academic performance and health, university administrators should be incorporating anxiety, stress, and depression management training in orientation activities.","output":"Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among students of Jahangirnagar University in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this two-study research using latent profile analysis (LPA), we investigated intra-individual combinations of conscientiousness, autonomy, self-regulation, and extraversion.

We previously analyzed antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in several hundred healthy individuals, stratified by previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the full-length spike protein (PMC8183627, PMC7235504), we found strong responses to infection and a robust neutralizing antibody response to vaccination. We compare these results to data from individuals diagnosed with LC undergoing different types of cancer treatment. Methods: This is an ongoing, prospective, control-matched longitudinal cohort study of 750 LC patients in all stages with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination, comparing SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers at baseline (time of enrollment) and at 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-month intervals. We examine the quality, magnitude, and duration of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers against the full-length spike protein compared to the matched (age, tobacco history, sex and ethnicity) HC cohort. Types of Analysis and Data Reporting: ELISAs are performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory using an FDA-approved antibody assay along with other well-established, research-grade assays. We hypothesized that LC patients have a weaker antibody response to SARS-Cov-2 infection and/or vaccination due to cancer or its treatment compared to matched HCs. The non-parametric KruskalCWallis test was used to test this hypothesis. If confirmed, a tailored vaccination program would be necessary to ensure immune protection in patient with LC. Results: 111 LC patients have been enrolled to date;with 78 receiving at least one vaccination and 33 unvaccinated. Median age is 69, with 58% female. 39 patients were fully vaccinated (defined as 14+ days after second vaccination). Partially vaccinated (after 1st vaccine dose) LC patients had a lower median antibody level than partially vaccinated HCs (p=0.01). Fully vaccinated LC patients had substantial antibody titers but a lower median antibody level than fully vaccinated HCs (p=0.01) with a subset not raising large antibody titers. Especially important were the 30% of partially vaccinated LC patients who did not develop neutralizing antibodies. To date, there were no significant differences in median antibody levels in LC patients by gender, smoking status, age (< or > 65 years old), or treatment (with or without chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, or targeted therapy). Conclusion: While most (70%+) of LC patients mounted a good antibody response to vaccination, a subgroup had significantly lower anti-spike antibody/neutralizing levels compared to controls. Further studies are required to evaluate the role of further boost vaccinations in this patient population with a particular focus on patients not producing neutralizing antibodies to further understand the lack of response. We will continue to analyze the effect of systemic anti-cancer therapies as more data becomes available.

We sought to explore the narratives of women with breast cancer across the illness trajectory to understand their experiences from diagnosis to accessing and undergoing cancer treatments to inform the development of cancer care. METHODS: A nested, exploratory study adopting a qualitative approach. We conducted in-depth face-to-face interviews with women living with advanced breast cancer in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We purposively sampled participants by age, education and marital status. All interviews were transcribed verbatim with thematic analysis used to identify, analyse and report patterns and themes within the data. FINDINGS: Four main themes were derived: 1) Early experiences, prior to accessing health care; 2) Navigating the system to access treatment; 3) Enduring chemotherapy and advancing disease, with crucial family support; 4) Seeking normalcy and belief in treatment. From initial symptoms through to undergoing treatments, the experience of participants was punctuated by barriers and challenges. DISCUSSION: Presentation delays were driven by dismissing initial symptoms, seeking alternative medicines, and fear of surgery. Access to healthcare required participants to contend with long-distance travel to facilities, tiered and convoluted referral processes, and adverse effects and financial impact of treatments. Individual determination, belief in God, and the role of families were critical throughout the disease trajectory.

What might initially be conceived as a simplified donorCrecipient process, the intricacies of donor plasma, IV immunoglobulins, and monoclonal antibody modality applications are becoming more apparent. Key targets of such treatment have largely focused on virus neutralization and the specific viral components of the attachment Spike protein and its constituents (e.g., receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain). The cumulative laboratory and clinical experience suggests that beneficial protective and treatment outcomes are possible. Both a dose- and a time-dependency emerge. Lesser understood are the concepts of bioavailability and distribution. Apart from direct antigen binding from protective immunoglobulins, antibody effector functions have potential roles in outcome. In attempting to mimic the natural but variable response to infection or vaccination, a strong functional polyclonal approach attracts the potential benefits of attacking antigen diversity, high antibody avidity, antibody persistence, and protection against escape viral mutation. The availability and ease of administration for any passive immunotherapy product must be considered in the current climate of need.

Given the variability of human genetics, immunity, and disease, and given the nuances of the virus and its potential for change, passive immunotherapy can be developed that will be effective for some but not all patients.

Survival time was right-censored at 28 days of follow-up. ResultsAmong 757,210 patients with COVID-19 included in the study, 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Patients with diabetes had a 49% higher relative risk of death than those without diabetes (Cox proportional-hazard ratio; 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The relative risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age (P=0.004). The hazard ratios were 1.66 (1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (1.12-1.16) in hospitalized patients. The 28-day survival for inpatients with and without diabetes was, respectively, 73.5% and 85.2% for patients 20-39 years of age; 66.6% and 75.9% for patients 40-49 years of age; 59.4% and 66.5% for patients 50-59 years of age; 50.1% and 54.6% for patients 60-69 years of age; 42.7% and 44.6% for patients 70-79 years of age; and 38.4% and 39.0% for patients 80 years of age or older.

The COVID-19 reopening in Denmark included regulations introducing frequent hand washing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if frequent hand washing increases the incidence of ICD in children. METHODS We conducted an observational study in Denmark during the reopening of schools and daycare facilities for children aged 0-12 years (April 22nd to May 1st 2020). A questionnaire was sent out to parents in four municipalities consisting of 20 questions about frequency of hand washing, use of hand sanitiser, symptoms of ICD, atopic dermatitis, allergy and predispositions. RESULTS The study included 6,273 children. In children without any prior symptoms of dermatitis, 42.4% experienced ICD (dry, red and itchy skin) due to increased hand hygiene. Schoolchildren had a 1.5 times greater relative risk of developing ICD than preschool children. Frequency of hand washing was a strong risk factor, whereas this was not the case for alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Hand washing 7-10 times/day and >10 times/day increased the relative risk by 1.83 and 2.23 times, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A higher frequency of hand washing during the COVID-19 reopening increased the incidence of ICD in children. Hand hygiene is essential in our fight against novel coronavirus, but prophylactic initiatives are important to reduce the possible long-term consequences of ICD in children.

The diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication. This dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host, resulting in substantial change in virulence. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes inapparent or mild enteritis in cats, but a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), can arise through mutation of FECV to FIP virus (FIPV). The pathogenesis of FIP is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T cells, features shared by some other coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. The increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs, but no such measures are yet available. Previously, we have reported the inhibitors that target 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP is 100% fatal once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent. We found that antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated. Antiviral treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or less of treatment. Significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in cats. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of FIP. These findings may provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in animals and humans.","output":"Reversal of the Progression of Fatal Coronavirus Infection in Cats by a Broad-Spectrum Coronavirus Protease Inhibitor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo: Introduo: A pandemia causada pelo novo coronavrus (Covid-19) promoveu mudan?as em todo o mundo, gerando modificaes na estrutura organizacional do ensino superior.

Our aim was to investigate whether use of a smartphone application would shorten the duration from admission to reperfusion therapy in patients with hyper-acute ischemic stroke. METHODS: Enrolled were acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent reperfusion therapy (intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV t-PA) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT)) at our hospital between October 2012 and September 2018. We divided the patients into two groups based on the date of availability on smartphones of communication-type medical application: (1) Control group, conventional communication prior to September 2015, and (2) App group, communication via the smartphone app from October 2015 onwards. We compared door-to-image time (DIT), image-to-needle time (INT), door-to-needle time (DNT) for thrombolysis, and DIT, image-to-puncture time (IPT), and door-to-puncture time (DTP) for thrombectomy between the groups. RESULTS: We retrospectively enrolled 139 patients (68% male; median age, 69 years; median NIHSS score, 7) who were assigned into the App group (n = 86) and Control group (n = 53). Of the overall patients, 109 underwent IV t-PA (IV t-PA alone, 79 patients), and 63 underwent MT (MT alone, 30 patients), and 33 patients underwent combined IV t-PA and MT. There was no significant difference in DIT between the App and Control groups (23 min vs. 22 min, p = 0.493). DNT, DPT, INT, and IPT were significantly shorter in the App group than in the Control group (DNT, 62 min for the App group vs. 72 min for Control group, p = 0.038; INT, 42 vs. 48 min, p = 0.009; DPT, 106 vs. 129 min, p = 0.046; IPT, 89 vs. 117 min, p = 0.004).

Pharmacotherapy is one of the most common strategies to reduce neck pain in patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the real-world pattern of drugs prescribed for patients with neck pain in the USA. METHODS: Data on individuals who reported current neck pain in the 2009-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and with a history of persistent pain for at least 6 weeks or 3 months were extracted from the NHANES database. Those included in the study were divided into three groups based on the duration of pain: the without neck pain group (Group A); subacute group (Group B) with a history of 6 weeks of neck pain; and the chronic neck pain group (Group C) with a history of 3 months of neck pain. The use and duration of medication prescribed for Group A, B, and C patients were compared. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that opioid use was significantly more prevalent in the subacute and chronic neck pain group than in the without neck pain group (Group A) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.07-8.52 and aOR 7.00, 95% CI 4.32-11.33, respectively). The factors strongly associated with higher opioid use included older age, low education level, and low family income. In the chronic neck group, opioids, followed in decreasing order of frequency by acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs, were the most common analgesics used in combination with other analgesics. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the data shows that the long-term excessive use of opioids and the underutilization of other analgesics are two major issues in the treatment of neck pain in the USA. Possible improvements include improved education of patients by healthcare professionals on the use of opioids and more consideration given to non-pharmacotherapy options. Our results reveal the potential problem in pharmacotherapy choices for neck pain treatment and may help improve the current clinical practice in the USA and other countries.","output":"Real-World Evidence in Prescription Medication Use Among U.S. Adults with Neck Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Education is an important component of every healthcare system.

However, the efficacy of the positively-charged ACP is inhibited by elevated levels of negatively-charged cell-surface components which trap the peptides and prevent their contact with the cell membrane. Consequently, this decreases ACP-mediated membrane pore formation and cell lysis. Negatively-charged heparan sulphate (HS) and chondroitin sulphate (CS) have been shown to inhibit the cytotoxic effect of ACPs. In this study, we propose a strategy to promote the broad utilization of ACPs. In this context, we developed a drug repositioning pipeline to analyse transcriptomics data generated for four different cancer cell lines (A549, HEPG2, HT29, and MCF7) treated with hundreds of drugs in the LINCS L1000 project. Based on previous studies identifying genes modulating levels of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) HS and CS at the cell surface, our analysis aimed at identifying drugs inhibiting genes correlated with high HS and CS levels. As a result, we identified six chemicals as likely repositionable drugs with the potential to enhance the performance of ACPs. The codes in R and Python programming languages are publicly available in https://github.com/ElyasMo/ACPs_HS_HSPGs_CS.

To improve prediction accuracy of cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data, a new hybrid prediction model based on gradient-based optimizer variational mode decomposition (GVMD), extreme learning machine (ELM), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), named GVMD-ELM-ARIMA, is proposed. To solve the problem of selecting the [Formula: see text] value and the penalty factor [Formula: see text] in variational mode decomposition (VMD), this paper proposes gradient-based optimizer variational mode decomposition (GVMD), which realizes the self-adaptive determination of [Formula: see text] value and [Formula: see text] value. Firstly, GVMD decomposes the cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data into some intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual component (IMFr). Secondly, IMFs are predicted by ELM. Then, IMFr is predicted by ARIMA. Finally, the final prediction results are obtained by reconstructing the prediction result of IMFs and IMFr. The cumulative COVID-19 confirmed data of the United States, India and Russia is used to verify its effectiveness. Taking the United States as an example, compared with the average MAPE, RMSE and MAE of the single model, the average MAPE of the hybrid model is reduced by 47.27%, the average RMSE is reduced by 44.50%, and the average MAE is reduced by 55.34%.

Despite its ubiquity, a lack of definitive scientific understanding of the etiology, natural history, and biochemistry of seromas remains. We endeavored to create and examine seromas in a rat model in the setting of commonly used biologic implants and to examine the role of quilting sutures/mechanical fixation in mitigating seroma development. METHODS Female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to either Quilting or Nonquilting groups then subdivided into one of 3 porcine dermal implant groups (Permacol Surgical Implant, Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix, or XCM Biologic Tissue Matrix) or control group. A 5-cm midline back incision was made, the skin reflected and the latissimus dorsi muscle resected bilaterally. Implants were sutured into the surgical bed using a running suture. The skin of nonquilted rats was closed with a running subcuticular suture. Quilted rats underwent placement of absorbable quilting sutures spaced 2 cm apart between the skin and underlying implant or muscle before skin closure. Postoperatively, rats were monitored for seroma formation with fluid aspirated as needed. At 28 or 90 days, rats were euthanized. Seroma and implants were examined grossly and under light microscopy. RESULTS Of nonquilted rats, 42/54 (78%) developed seromas compared with 19/46 (41%) of quilted rats (P < 0.05), defined by bursa cavity present at necropsy. When a biologic implant was present, 28/35 (80%) of nonquilted rats developed seromas compared with 12/33 (36%) of quilted rats (P < 0.05). In the control group, 14/19 (74%) of nonquilted rats developed seromas compared with 7/13 (54%) of quilted rats. This difference was not statistically significant. Bursa presence was confirmed histologically in all cases, with no difference in bursa character seen between groups. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms a reliable rat model of seroma formation, with most of the rats exhibiting at least subclinical seromas. There was no difference in seroma formation rate in the presence of biologic implants, and no differences in bursa character between implants. Mechanical fixation with quilting sutures decreased seroma rate significantly in all subgroups.

Methods: The retrospective study included 7 critical COVID-19 patients with acro-ischemia in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, from Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2020. The clinical and laboratory data before and during the ICU stay were analyzed. Results: The median age of 7 patients was 59 years and 4 of them were men. Three patients were associated with underlying comorbidities. Fever, cough, dyspnea and diarrhea were common clinical symptoms. All patients had acro-ischemia presentations including finger/toe cyanosis, skin bulla and dry gangrene. D-dimer, fibrinogen and fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) were significantly elevated in most patients. Prothrombin time was prolonged in 4 patients. D-dimer and FDP levels progressively elevated consistent with COVID-2019 exacerbation. Four patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was administrated in 6 patients, which reduced D-dimer and FDP rather than improved clinical symptoms. Five patients died finally and the median time from acro-ischemia to death was 12 days. Conclusions: Coagulation parameters should be monitored closely in critical COVID-2019 patients.

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed three abnormal nodules in the right upper and middle lung lobes and synchronous triple primary cancer was suspected. Before we could assess the patient for surgery, she developed a persistent fever. A second chest CT scan revealed newly emerged subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGO) in the right lung. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and hospitalized. She was treated for COVID-19 (Clinical Trial: jRCTs031200196) and discharged in a satisfactory condition 10 days later. A right upper and middle bilobectomy was performed 60 days after the patients initial COVID-19 diagnosis without any complications. Histopathological examination of the nodules identified synchronous triple primary lung cancer. The subpleural right upper and middle lung lobe tissue showed peribronchial lymphocyte infiltration and interstitial thickening. However, immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 were both negative. In this case, bilobectomy for triple primary lung cancer was performed safely after COVID-19 pneumonia.

It is shown that with the same basic reproduction number R 0 in the beginning of epidemic, its further progression depends on the ratio between the two groups. Therefore, fitting the data in the beginning of epidemic and the determination of R 0 are not sufficient to predict its long time behaviour. Available data on the Covid-19 epidemic allows the estimation of the proportion of the HT and LT groups. Estimated structure of the population is used for the investigation of the influence of vaccination on further epidemic development. The result of vaccination strongly depends on the proportion of vaccinated individuals between the two groups. Vaccination of the HT group acts to stop the epidemic and essentially decreases the total number of infected individuals at the end of epidemic and the current maximal number of infected individuals while vaccination of the LT group only acts to protect vaccinated individuals from further infection.","output":"Epidemic Progression and Vaccination in a Heterogeneous Population.

To investigate its inactivation mechanism, the denaturation of spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by sodium dodecyl sulphateCpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition to spike proteins, fragmentation of ribonucleic acids in SARS-CoV-2 was investigated by real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). As a result, both spike proteins and RNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 virus were damaged by the Cu(x)O/TiO(2) photocatalyst even under dark condition and were further damaged under white fluorescent bulb illumination. Based on the present antiviral mechanism, the Cu(x)O/TiO(2) photocatalyst will be effective in inactivating other potential mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of the Determinants of Oral Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Wheezing Asthmatic Youth (DOORWAY) study, a prospective cohort study of children (aged 1-17 years) presenting to the emergency department with moderate or severe exacerbations. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by RT-PCR for 27 respiratory pathogens. We investigated the association between pathogens and both exacerbation severity (assessed with the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure) and treatment failure (hospital admission, emergency department stay >8 hours, or relapse) of a standardized severity-specific treatment. Logistic multivariate regressions were used to estimate average marginal effects (absolute risks and risk differences [RD]). RESULTS Of 958 participants, 61.7% were positive for 1 pathogen (rhinovirus was the most prevalent [29.4%]) and 16.9% experienced treatment failure. The presence of any pathogen was not associated with higher baseline severity but with a higher risk of treatment failure (20.7% vs 12.5%; RD = 8.2% [95% confidence interval: 3.3% to 13.1%]) compared to the absence of a pathogen. Nonrhinovirus pathogens were associated with an increased absolute risk (RD) of treatment failure by 13.1% (95% confidence interval: 6.4% to 19.8%), specifically, by 8.8% for respiratory syncytial virus, 24.9% for influenza, and 34.1% for parainfluenza. CONCLUSIONS Although respiratory pathogens were not associated with higher severity on presentation, they were associated with increased treatment failure risk, particularly in the presence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and parainfluenza. This supports influenza prevention in asthmatic children, consideration of pathogen identification on presentation, and exploration of treatment intensification for infected patients at higher risk of treatment failure.","output":"Respiratory Viruses and Treatment Failure in Children With Asthma Exacerbation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chest X-ray is a golden standard for the diagnosis and severity assessment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, it cannot be used as routine examination of CAP in children. The present study aims to investigate the roles of prealbumin (PA) in CAP in children and further determine the usefulness of PA in diagnosis and severity assessment of CAP in children. This was a retrospective analysis of 174 cases of hospitalized children with CAP. The following indicators were recorded: vital sign, inflammatory indexes, PA, and respiratory pathogens immunoglobulin M antibody test results. A total of 33 healthy children were selected as the control group. The results of laboratory tests between CAP and control groups were compared. CAP group was further divided into mild CAP and severe CAP groups, and vital signs and laboratory examination results of 2 groups were compared. The total positive rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this study was 27.4%, and there was no significant difference in different seasons (P = 0.356). Compared with controls, there was no significant difference between procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in CAP group (P = 0.355, 0.061). The white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the CAP group were significantly higher than those in control group, and PA was significantly lower than that in the control group (all P < 0.05). In the traditional cutoff value (<170 mg/L), the sensitivity of PA for the diagnosis of CAP was 0.847, which was significant higher than traditional inflammatory indicators. Moreover, it was found that PA was an independent protective factor for CAP in children based on multivariate analysis (odds ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.956C0.993; P = 0.008). PA level in severe CAP group was significantly lower than in mild CAP group (P = 0.001). With a cutoff value of 125 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of PA for the severity assessment of CAP were 0.703 and 0.714, respectively. Combined with traditional inflammatory markers, PA may improve the diagnostic efficacy of CAP in children. PA can be used as a reference marker to complement the chest X-rays for severity assessment of children CAP.","output":"Valuable hematological indicators for the diagnosis and severity assessment of Chinese children with community-acquired pneumonia: Prealbumin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We construct a novel index of households macroeconomic environment (HOME) based on the data from 22 high-income European countries between 2002 Q1 and 2018 Q4.

This article reviews the beneficial effects of gaseous ozone, its influence on quality and biochemical changes, foodborne human pathogens, and spoilage microorganisms, and discusses research needs with an emphasis on fruits. Ozone may induce synthesis of a number of antioxidants and bioactive compounds by activating secondary metabolisms involving a wide range of enzymes. Disparities exist in the literature regarding the impact of gaseous ozone on quality and physiological processes of fresh produce, such as weight loss, ascorbic acid, and fruit ripening. The disparities are complicated by incomplete reporting of the necessary information, such as relative humidity and temperatures at which ozone measurement and treatment were performed, which is needed for accurate comparison of results among studies. In order to fully realize the benefits of gaseous ozone, research is needed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of gaseous ozone in inhibiting ripening, influence of relative humidity on the antimicrobial efficacy, interaction between ozone and the cuticle of fresh produce, ozone signaling pathways in the cells and tissues, and so forth.

Yet, the majority of analytics being developed were targeted at state- and national-level policy decisions, with little availability of actionable information to support tactical and operational decision making and execution at the hospital level. To fill this gap, we developed a multi-method framework leveraging a parsimonious design philosophy that allows for rapid deployment of high-impact predictive and prescriptive analytics in a time-sensitive, dynamic, data-limited environment, such as a novel pandemic. The product of this research is a workload prediction and decision support tool to provide mission-critical, actionable information for individual hospitals. Our framework forecasts time-varying patient workload and demand for critical resources by integrating disease progression models, tailored to data availability during different stages of the pandemic, with a stochastic network model of patient movements among units within individual hospitals. Both components employ adaptive tuning to account for hospital-dependent, time-varying parameters that provide consistently accurate predictions by dynamically learning the impact of latent changes in system dynamics. Our decision support system is designed to be portable and easily implementable across hospital data systems for expeditious expansion and deployment. This work was contextually grounded in close collaboration with IU Health, the largest health system in Indiana, which has 18 hospitals serving over one million residents.

The Coronavirus pandemic, which is deeply shaking the world, has revealed the importance of this diagnosis even more. During the pandemic, it has become the focus of researchers to differentiate symptoms from similar diseases such as influenza. Among these symptoms, the difference in cough sound played a distinctive role in research. Clinical data collected under the supervision of doctors in a reliable environment were used as the dataset consisting of 16 subjects suspected of COVID-19 with a specific patient demographic. Using the polymerase chain reaction test, the suspected subjects were divided into two groups as negative and positive. The negative and positive labels represent the patients with non-COVID and with a COVID-19 cough, respectively. Using the 3D plot or waterfall representation of the signal frequency spectrum, the salient features of the cough data are revealed. In this way, COVID-19 can be differentiated from other coughs by applying effective feature extraction and classification techniques. Power spectral density based on short-time Fourier transform and mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) were chosen as the efficient feature extraction method.

In this study, a computational method to evaluate the human TLR 7/8-stimulating ability of single-stranded RNA virus genomes based on their human TLR 7/8-stimulating trimer compositions was used to analyze 1,002 human coronavirus genomes. RESULTS: The human TLR 7/8-stimulating potential of coronavirus genomic (positive strand) RNAs followed the order of NL63-CoV > HKU1-CoV >229E-CoV ? OC63-CoV > SARS-CoV-2 > MERS-CoV > SARS-CoV. These results suggest that among these coronaviruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher ability to evade the human TLR 7/8-mediated innate immune response.

As of Mid-June 2021, over 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomesequences have been deposited in the GISAID database from Bangladesh which were extracted and categorized into two waves. By analyzing these genome sequences, it was discovered that the wave-2 samples had a significantly greater average rate of mutation/sample (30.79%) than the wave-1 samples (12.32%). Wave-2 samples also had a higher frequency of deletion, and transversion events. During the first wave, the GR clade was the most predominant but it was replaced by the GH clade in the latter wave.

However, the impact of the postoperative chemotherapy (postCTX) component on overall survival (OS) is not well defined. METHODS: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) 2006C2014 was queried for patients who received preoperative chemotherapy (preCTX) and resection for gastric cancer. Analysis was performed to identify factors influencing receipt of postCTX. The impact of postCTX on OS was evaluated in propensity-matched groups. RESULTS: Among 3449 patients who received preCTX and resection for gastric cancer, 1091 (31.6%) received postCTX. Independent predictors of receiving postCTX were diagnosis after 2010 (odds ratio [OR] 1.985), distal tumor location (OR 1.348), and 15 or more lymph nodes examined (OR 1.214). Predictors of not receiving postCTX were older age (OR 0.985), comorbidity score higher than 1 (OR 0.592), and black race (OR 0.791). After propensity-matching (1091 per group), the median OS was 56.8 months for those who did receive postCTX versus 52.5 months for those who did not (p = 0.131). Subset analysis according to tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, number of lymph nodes evaluated, T and N class, and AJCC stage identified an improvement in OS for the patients with N1 disease who received postCTX compared with those who did not (79.6 vs 41.3 months; p = 0.025). However, no other subgroup had a significant survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Additional postCTX was administered to a minority of patients who received preCTX and gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and its influence on OS appeared to be limited.

Their purpose is to advise healthcare professionals on how to ethically allocate scarce medical resources. One challenging feature of the pandemic has been the large numbers of patients needing mechanical ventilatory support. Guidelines have paradigmatically focused on the question of what doctors should do if they have fewer ventilators than patients who need respiratory support: which patient should get the ventilator? There is, however, an important higher level allocation problem. Namely, how are we to ethically distribute newly obtained ventilators across hospitals: which hospital should get the ventilator(s)? In this paper, we identify a set of principles for allocating newly obtained ventilators across hospitals. We focus particularly on low and middle income countries, who frequently have limited pre-existing intensive care capacity, and have needed to source additional ventilators. We first provide some background. Second, we argue that the main population healthcare aim during the COVID-19 pandemic should be to save the most lives. Next, we assess a series of potential heuristics or principles that could be used to guide allocation: allocation to the most densely populated cities, random allocation, allocation based on the ratio of patients to ICU personnel, prioritisation in terms of intrahospital mortality, prioritisation of younger populations, and prioritisation in terms of population mortality. We conclude by providing a plausible ranking of the principles, while noting a number of epistemological challenges, in terms of how they best further the aim of increasing the probability of saving the most lives.","output":"Ethical heuristics for pandemic allocation of ventilators across hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A dynamical approach is proposed to discriminate between reactive (rES) and nonreactive (nES) enzyme-substrate complexes taking the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) as an important example.

The computed fractions of reactive enzyme-substrate complexes along MD trajectories well correlate with the findings of recent experimental studies on the substrate specificity of Mpro. The results of our simulations demonstrate the role of the theory level used in QM subsystems for a proper description of the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine residue in Mpro.

IL-6 inhibitors are actively used to neutralize and prevent the cytokine storm. Olokizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody belonging to the G4/Kappa immunoglobulin isotype that selectively binds to human IL-6 and effectively neutralizes it. AIM To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Artlegia (olokizumab) for the treatment of subjects with a disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus in a real-world clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS The analysis included data of 610 subjects aged 55.0812.68 years who received olokizumab at a single dose of 160 mg/mL 0.4 mL subcutaneously as a preemptive anti-inflammatory therapy. The comparison group included 511 subjects aged 55.2311.23 years who received standard therapy without IL-6 inhibitors. Control Endpoints: 1. Positive clinical changes on Day 7. 2. Changes in the CRP levels on Days 1, 2, and 7. 3. Duration of oxygen therapy. 4. Number of days in hospital. 5. Number of adverse events. 6. Disease outcome. RESULTS If a cytokine storm occurs, immune regulatory events will trigger the development of either a protective immune response or an exacerbated inflammatory response. The use of preemptive anti-inflammatory therapy has both a short-term and, most importantly, a long-term effect on the T and B parts of the immune process. These aspects definitely require further research and observation. CONCLUSION The use of olokizumab to treat the new COVID-19 coronavirus disease has demonstrated a positive effect on clinical and laboratory parameters. Primarily, it affects the severity of clinical parameters by improving the general condition already on the first day of observation, and decreasing body temperature to normal values. The changes in the C-reactive protein levels show a significant effect of the IL-6 inhibitor on the systemic inflammatory response.","output":"[Experience of olokizumab use in COVID-19 patients]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The FEBS Journal announces the winners and runners-up of its COVID-19 Creative Communication Competition in which entrants were asked to depict 'post-lockdown lab life'.","output":"Announcing the winners of our COVID-19 Creative Communication Competition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 2020 outbreak, a large body of data has been provided on general management and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

This study assessed 3044 COVID-19 patients at 41 referral hospitals across Italy from February 3rd to May 8th 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, treatment, and outcomes including death were assessed. During the study period, 697 patients (22.9%) were transferred to intensive care units, and 351 died in IMU (death rate 14.9%). At admission, factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were age (OR 2.46, p = 0.000), productive cough (OR 2.04, p = 0.000), pre-existing chronic heart failure (OR 1.58, p = 0.017) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.17, p = 0.048), the number of comorbidities (OR 1.34, p = 0.000) and polypharmacy (OR 1.20, p = 0.000). Of note, up to 40% of elderly patients did not report fever at admission. Decreasing PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission was strongly inversely associated with survival. The use of conventional oxygen supplementation increased with the number of pre-existing comorbidities, but it did not associate with better survival in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100.

Epidemics usually occur when health systems are unprepared. During an unexpected epidemic, health authorities engage in damage control, fear drives action, and the desire to understand the threat is greatest. As humanity recovers, policy-makers seek scientific expertise to improve their preparedness to face future events. Global spread of disease is exemplified by the spread of yellow fever from Africa to the Americas, by the spread of dengue fever through transcontinental migration of mosquitos, by the relentless influenza virus pandemics, and, most recently, by the unexpected emergence of Ebola virus, spread by motorbike and long haul carriers. Other pathogens that are remarkable for their epidemic expansions include the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers and hantavirus diseases carried by rodents over great geographic distances and the arthropod-borne viruses (West Nile, chikungunya and Zika) enabled by ecology and vector adaptations. Did we learn from the past epidemics? Are we prepared for the worst? The ultimate goal is to develop a resilient global health infrastructure. Besides acquiring treatments, vaccines, and other preventive medicine, bio-surveillance is critical to preventing disease emergence and to counteracting its spread. So far, only the western hemisphere has a large and established monitoring system; however, diseases continue to emerge sporadically, in particular in Southeast Asia and South America, illuminating the imperfections of our surveillance. Epidemics destabilize fragile governments, ravage the most vulnerable populations, and threaten the global community. Pandemic risk calculations employ new technologies like computerized maintenance of geographical and historical datasets, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Next Generation sequencing, and Metagenomics to trace the molecular changes in pathogens during their emergence, and mathematical models to assess risk. Predictions help to pinpoint the hot spots of emergence, the populations at risk, and the pathogens under genetic evolution. Preparedness anticipates the risks, the needs of the population, the capacities of infrastructure, the sources of emergency funding, and finally, the international partnerships needed to manage a disaster before it occurs. At present, the world is in an intermediate phase of trying to reduce health disparities despite exponential population growth, political conflicts, migration, global trade, urbanization, and major environmental changes due to global warming. For the sake of humanity, we must focus on developing the necessary capacities for health surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and pandemic response.","output":"Global Spread of Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses: Predicting Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Natural SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits strong protection against reinfection with the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. However, the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant harbors multiple mutations that can mediate immune evasion. We estimated effectiveness of prior infection in preventing reinfection (PES) with Omicron and other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Qatar. METHODS: PES was estimated using the test-negative, case-control study design, employing a methodology that was recently investigated and validated for derivation of robust estimates for PES. Cases (PCR-positive persons with a variant infection) and controls (PCR-negative persons) were exact-matched by sex, 10-year age group, nationality, and calendar time of PCR test, to control for known differences in the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qatar. RESULTS: PES against symptomatic reinfection was estimated at 90.2% (95% CI: 60.2-97.6) for Alpha, 84.8% (95% CI: 74.5-91.0) for Beta, 92.0% (95% CI: 87.9-94.7) for Delta, and 56.0% (95% CI: 50.6-60.9) for Omicron. Only 1 Alpha, 2 Beta, 0 Delta, and 2 Omicron reinfections progressed to severe COVID-19. None progressed to critical or fatal COVID-19. PES against hospitalization or death due to reinfection was estimated at 69.4% (95% CI: -143.6-96.2) for Alpha, 88.0% (95% CI: 50.7-97.1) for Beta, 100% (95% CI: 43.3-99.8) for Delta, and 87.8% (95% CI: 47.5-97.1) for Omicron. CONCLUSIONS: Protection afforded by prior infection in preventing symptomatic reinfection with Alpha, Beta, or Delta is robust, at about 90%.

On November 17, 2020, 26,092 healthcare workers from the Central Denmark Region and on December 15, 2020, 9,664 from the Capitol Region of Denmark were invited to a second round of daily questionnaires, and were followed until April and March 30, 2021, respectively.ResultsIn total, 12,328 (38.0%) and 9,664 (24.4%) healthcare workers participated in the first round of the study, respectively in the Central Denmark Region and the Capital Region of Denmark. One fifth (20.3% and 20.6% respectively), reported that they did not use the recommended PPE at least once during the study. Forgetfulness (26.1% and 27.3%, respectively) and time constrains (23.1% and 21.1%, respectively) were the primary causes for not using the recommended PPE.

In this study, we present an integrated computational-experimental approach leading to the discovery of peptide ligands that provide HCP LRVs on par with Protein A. First, the screening of 60,000 peptide variants was performed using a high-throughput search algorithm to identify sequences that ensure IgG affinity binding. Select sequences WQRHGI, MWRGWQ, RHLGWF, and GWLHQR were then negatively screened in silico against a panel of model HCPs to ensure the selection of peptides with high binding selectivity. Candidate ligands WQRHGI and MWRGWQ were conjugated to chromatographic resins and characterized by isothermal binding and breakthrough assays to quantify static and dynamic binding capacity (Qmax and DBC10%), respectively. The resulting Qmax were 52.6 mg of IgG per mL of adsorbent for WQRHGI and 57.48 mg/mL for MWRGWQ, while the DBC10% (2 minutes residence time) were 30.1 mg/mL for WQRHGI and 36.4 mg/mL for MWRGWQ.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation between February 12 and March 2, 2020. All patients were followed until death or March 28, and all survivors were followed for at least 30 days. RESULTS: For 36 hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the mean age was 69.4 (10.8) years, and 30 patients (83.3%) were men. Twenty-two (61.1%) patients received PIRRT (PIRRT group), and 14 cases (38.9%) were managed with conventional strategy (non-PIRRT group). There were no differences in age, sex, comorbidities, complications, treatments, and most of the laboratory findings. During the median follow-up period of 9.5 (interquartile range 4.3-33.5) days, 13 of 22 (59.1%) patients in the PIRRT group and 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients in the non-PIRRT group died.

Previous reviews have summarized social media uses for a specific health purpose such as health interventions, health campaigns, medical education, and disease outbreak surveillance. The most recent comprehensive review of social media uses for health purposes, however, was conducted in 2013. A systematic review that covers various health purposes is needed to reveal the new usages and research gaps that emerge in recent years. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a systematic review of social media uses for health purposes that have been identified in previous studies. METHODS: The researchers searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2006 and 2020 in 12 databases covering medicine, public health, and social science. After coding the articles in terms of publication year, journal area, country, method, social media platform, and social media use for health purposes, the researchers provided a review of social media use for health purposes identified in these articles. RESULTS: This study summarized 10 social media uses for various health purposes by health institutions, health researchers and practitioners, and the public. CONCLUSIONS: Social media can be used for various health purposes. Several new usages have emerged since 2013 including advancing health research and practice, social mobilization, and facilitating offline health-related services and events. Research gaps exist regarding advancing strategic use of social media based on audience segmentation, evaluating the impact of social media in health interventions, understanding the impact of health identity development, and addressing privacy concerns.","output":"Social Media Use for Health Purposes: Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning algorithms are becoming more and more useful in many fields of science, including many areas where computational methods are rarely used. High-performance Computing (HPC) is the most powerful solution to get the best results using these algorithms. HPC requires various skills to use. Acquiring this knowledge might be intimidating and take a long time for a researcher with small or no background in information and communications technologies (ICTs), even if the benefits of such knowledge is evident for the researcher. In this work, we aim to assess how a specific method of introducing HPC to such researchers enables them to start using HPC. We gave talks to two groups of non-ICT researchers that introduced basic concepts focusing on the necessary practical steps needed to use HPC on a specific cluster. We also offered hands-on trainings for one of the groups which aimed to guide participants through the first steps of using HPC. Participants filled out questionnaires partly based on Kirkpatricks training evaluation model before and after the talk, and after the hands-on training. We found that the talk increased participants self-reported likelihood of using HPC in their future research, but this was not significant for the group where participation was voluntary. On the contrary, very few researchers participated in the hands-on training, and for these participants neither the talk, nor the hands-on training changed their self-reported likelihood of using HPC in their future research. We argue that our findings show that academia and researchers would benefit from an environment that not only expects researchers to train themselves, but provides structural support for acquiring new skills.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study through a telephone survey was performed in 156 patients (143 for primary and 13 for revision) included in the TKR and RKR surgical waiting list before March 2020. Contact of each patient with COVID-19, stress and anxiety, perceived pain, and function were obtained in the interviews, and also the preference of each patient to have re-scheduled surgery (early or late). Finally, we registered their response (acceptance or refusal) when surgery was effectively re-scheduled. RESULTS: 88 out of 156 patients waiting for knee replacement (76/143 of those waiting for TKR, 12/13 of those waiting for RKR) declared themselves ready for surgery in less than 1 month. When re-scheduled, 115 patients underwent surgery and 41 refused. Significantly different preferences were found for age (more prone to surgery if under 65), revision surgery (more readily available), pain (7.9  1.7/10 in NRS in those undergoing surgery, 5.6  2.3/10 in those refusing, p = 0.000), or COVID-19 diagnosis, but not other close contact with COVID-19, comorbidities, stress, or anxiety. A logistic regression model confirmed that revision surgery (OR 9.33), perceived severe pain (OR 5.21), and age under 65 years (OR 5.82) were significantly associated with patient preference. The probability of patients over 65 to prefer early surgery reached 60% only with pain at or above 9/10. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical timing preferences for knee replacement vary between patients older than 65 years (immediate surgery only when pain is intense) and younger patients (immediate surgery no matter the amount of pain). Even if COVID-19 severely stroke our population, the need for knee replacement stood in the young population and even in the aged population at risk for COVID when pain was important.

METHODS Localized PCa patients (N=431) within one year of treatment completion were randomized to receive educational booklets or PROGRESS + educational booklets. Surveys completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months assessed patient characteristics; functional quality of life and coping (primary outcomes); and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, marital communication; secondary outcomes). Intent-to-treat and as-treated analyses were completed to assess change in outcomes from baseline to 6 months using linear mixed effects regression models. RESULTS In the intent-to-treat analyses, participants randomized to the intervention group had improved diversion coping (i.e., healthy redirection of worrying thoughts about their cancer), but more difficulties in marital communication (ps<.05). However, PROGRESS usage was low among those randomized to the intervention group (38.7%). The as-treated analyses found PROGRESS users reported fewer practical concerns but had worse positive coping compared to PROGRESS non-users (ps<.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest PROGRESS may improve certain aspects of adaptive coping among PCa survivors that use the website, but does not adequately address the remaining coping and psychosocial domains. Additional research is needed to better understand the gaps in intervention delivery contributing to low engagement and poor improvement across all domains of functional quality of life and adaptive coping.

First, we assessed the spatial distribution of opioid-related indicators in a geographic information system (GIS). Next, we used a novel regression-weighted ranking approach with mean standardized covariates and an opioid-involved overdose mortality outcome to calculate county-level vulnerability scores. Finally, we examined accessibility to opioid use disorder treatment services and opioid response programs at the census tract-level (n = 1511) using two-step floating catchment area analysis. Opioid-related emergency department visit rate, opioid-related arrest rate, chronic hepatitis C virus infection rate, opioid prescription rate, unemployment rate, and percent of female-led households were independently and positively associated with opioid-involved overdose mortality (p < 0.05).

Further, the clinical course of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) was investigated representatively for severe vascular and semi-urgent traumatic conditions that present with a wide variety of symptoms. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of neuro-emergencies among all neurosurgical admissions remained similar but a larger proportion presented through the emergency department than through the outpatient clinic or by referral (*p = 0.009).

Patients with spinal emergencies presented 48 h later (*p = 0.001) despite comparable symptom severity. For aSAH, the number of cases, aSAH grade, aneurysm localization, and treatment modality did not change but strikingly, elderly patients with cSDH presented less frequently, with more severe symptoms (*p = 0.046), and were less likely to reach favorable outcome (*p = 0.003) at discharge compared with previous years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pandemic-related restrictive measures and reallocation of resources, patients with neuro-emergencies should be encouraged to present regardless of the severity of symptoms because deferred presentation may result in adverse outcome.

The SAG1 virus-like particles (SAG1-VLPs) were expressed by Sf9 cells, and their expression was confirmed through cloning, RT-PCR analysis, and western blot method. The immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of SAG1-VLPs were assessed by the antibody response, cytokine analysis, neutralization activity, splenocyte assay, and survival rates through a mouse model. In particular, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA were markedly increased after immunization, and the survival rates of T. gondii were strongly inhibited by the immunized sera. Furthermore, the immunization of SAG1-VLPs effectively decreased the production of specific cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-, after parasite infection. In particular, the immunized group showed strong activity and viability compared with the non-immunized infection group, and their survival rate was 75%. These results demonstrate that SAG1-VLP not only has the immunogenicity to block T. gondii infection by effectively inducing the generation of specific antibodies against T. gondii, but is also an effective antigen delivery system for preventing toxoplasmosis. This study indicates that SAG1-VLP can be effectively utilized as a promising vaccine candidate for preventing or inhibiting T. gondii infection.","output":"Immunogenicity and Protective Effect of a Virus-Like Particle Containing the SAG1 Antigen of Toxoplasma gondii as a Potential Vaccine Candidate for Toxoplasmosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is the most threatened wild feline in the world.

Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.","output":"Antibodies at work in the time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is prevalent throughout the world and has caused major economic losses to the pig industry.

In this study, a series of nsp10 mutants were constructed and analysed for functional sites of different enzymic activities. We found that nsp10 could bind both ssDNA and dsDNA, and this binding activity could be inactivated by mutations at Cys25 and His32. These two mutations also abolished unwinding activity without affecting ATPase activity. In addition, substitution of Ala227 by Ser eliminated helicase activity, whilst substitution by Val enhanced unwinding activity.

We describe the occurrence of an outbreak among HCWs and attempt to characterize at-risk exposures to improve future infection control interventions. METHODS: This study included an index case and all HCW contacts. All contacts were screened for MERS-CoV using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: During the study period in 2015, the index case was a 30-year-old Filipino nurse who had a history of unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoVCpositive case on May 15, 2015, and had multiple negative tests for MERS-CoV. Weeks later, she was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and MERS-CoV infection. A total of 73 staff were quarantined for 14 days, and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken on days 2, 5, and 12 postexposure. Of those contacts, 3 (4%) were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV. An additional 18 staff were quarantined and had MERS-CoV swabs. A fourth case was confirmed positive on day 12. Subsequent contact investigations revealed a fourth-generation transmission. Only 7 (4.5%) of the total 153 contacts were positive for MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: The role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission is complex. Although most MERS-CoVCinfected HCWs are asymptomatic or have mild disease, fatal infections can occur and HCWs can play a major role in propagating health care facility outbreaks. This investigation highlights the need to continuously review infection control guidance relating to the role of HCWs in MERS-CoV transmission in health care outbreaks, especially as it relates to the complex questions on definition of risky exposures, who to test, and the frequency of MERS-CoV testing; criteria for who to quarantine and for how long; and clearance and return to active duty criteria.","output":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission among health care workers: Implication for infection control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the international medical education community in unprecedented ways. The restrictions imposed to control the spread of the virus have upended our routines and forced us to reimagine our work structures, educational programming and delivery of patient care in ways that will likely continue to change how we live and work for the foreseeable future. Yet, despite these interruptions, the pandemic has additionally sparked a transformative impulse in some to actively engage in critical introspection around the future of their work, compelling us to consider what changes could (and perhaps should) occur after the pandemic is over.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) originate from decondensed chromatin released to immobilize pathogens, and they can trigger immunothrombosis. We studied the connection between NETs and COVID-19 severity and progression. We conducted a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients (n = 33) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 17). We measured plasma myeloperoxidase (MPO)-DNA complexes (NETs), platelet factor 4, RANTES, and selected cytokines. Three COVID-19 lung autopsies were examined for NETs and platelet involvement. We assessed NET formation ex vivo in COVID-19 neutrophils and in healthy neutrophils incubated with COVID-19 plasma. We also tested the ability of neonatal NET-inhibitory factor (nNIF) to block NET formation induced by COVID-19 plasma. Plasma MPO-DNA complexes increased in COVID-19, with intubation (P < .0001) and death (P < .0005) as outcome. Illness severity correlated directly with plasma MPO-DNA complexes (P = .0360), whereas Pao2/fraction of inspired oxygen correlated inversely (P = .0340). Soluble and cellular factors triggering NETs were significantly increased in COVID-19, and pulmonary autopsies confirmed NET-containing microthrombi with neutrophil-platelet infiltration. Finally, COVID-19 neutrophils ex vivo displayed excessive NETs at baseline, and COVID-19 plasma triggered NET formation, which was blocked by nNIF. Thus, NETs triggering immunothrombosis may, in part, explain the prothrombotic clinical presentations in COVID-19, and NETs may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.","output":"Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to immunothrombosis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved. The mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty, BNT162b2; BNT) and the vector vaccine from AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, ChAdOx1; AZ) have been widely used. mRNA vaccines induce high antibody and T cell responses, also to SARS-CoV-2 variants, but are costlier and less stable than the slightly less effective vector vaccines. For vector vaccines, heterologous vaccination schedules have generally proven more effective than homologous schedules. METHODS: In the HEVACC three-arm, single-blinded, adaptive design study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04907331), participants between 18 and 65 years with no prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a first dose of AZ or BNT were included. The AZ/AZ and the AZ/BNT arms were randomized (in a 1:1 ratio stratified by sex and trial site) and single-blinded, the third arm (BNT/BNT) was observational. We compared the reactogenicity between the study arms and hypothesized that immunogenicity was higher for the heterologous AZ/BNT compared to the homologous AZ/AZ regimen using neutralizing antibody titers as primary endpoint. FINDINGS: This interim analysis was conducted after 234 participants had been randomized and 254 immunized (N=109 AZ/AZ, N=115 AZ/BNZ, N=30 BNT/BNT). Heterologous AZ/BNT vaccination was well tolerated without study-related severe adverse events. Neutralizing antibody titers on day 30 were statistically significant higher in the AZ/BNT and the BNT/BNT groups than in the AZ/AZ group, for B.1.617.2 (Delta) AZ/AZ median reciprocal titer 75.9 (99.9% CI 58.0 - 132.5), AZ/BNT 571.5 (99.9% CI 396.6 - 733.1), and BNT/BNT 404.5 (99.9% CI 68.3 - 1024). Similarly, the frequency and multifunctionality of spike-specific T cell responses was comparable between the AZ/BNT and the BNT/BNT groups, but lower in the AZ/AZ vaccinees. INTERPRETATION: This study clearly shows the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous AZ/BNT vaccination and encourages further studies on heterologous vaccination schedules.

Using the example of New Jerseys Crisis Standard of Care policy, we describe how dominant rationing guidance compounds for many Black patients prior unfair structural disadvantage, chiefly due to the way creatinine and life expectancy are typically considered. We outline six possible policy options towards a more just approach: improving diversity in decision processes, adjusting creatinine scores, replacing creatinine, dropping creatinine, finding alternative measures, adding equity weights and rejecting the dominant model altogether. We also contrast these options with making no changes, which is not a neutral default, but in separate need of justification, despite a prominent claim that it is simply based on objective medical knowledge. In the regrettable absence of fair federal guidance, hospital and state-level policymakers should reflect on which of these, or further options, seem feasible and justifiable. Irrespective of which approach is taken, all guidance should be supplemented with a monitoring and reporting requirement on possible disparate impacts.

Despite the multiple studies examining the validity of this hypothesis, evidence is still inconclusive, and the debate remains unsolved. In addition, relatively few studies have focused their attention on developing or emerging economies, where levels of inequality tend to be the highest in the world. This work examines the statistical association between income inequality and self-rated health status in Colombia, a highly unequal Latin American country. METHODS: To explore whether this association is present in the general population or whether it is only confined to the bottom of the income distribution, we use data from the 2011C2019 National Quality of Life Survey. Multiple probit estimations are considered for testing the robustness of the IIH. RESULTS: Evidence favouring the IIH was found, even after controlling for individual income levels, average regional income, and socioeconomic characteristics. The link between income inequality and the probability of reporting poor health seems to be present across all income quintiles. However, the magnitude of such association is considerably smaller when using inequality measures with relatively greater sensitivity to income differences among the rich. CONCLUSIONS: The association between regional income inequality and individual's self-rated health status in Colombia is not only confined to low-income individuals but extends across all socioeconomic strata. This association is robust to the income inequality measure implemented, the income-unit of analysis, and changes in the sample. It is suggested that reducing income disparities can potentially contribute to improving individual's health.

The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (JulyCNovember 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas' policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence. Clarification of roles and responsibilities within the public health system would reduce duplication and maintain credibility.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and proportion were used to demonstrate: (1) the longitudinal growth of nurse workforce; (2) the diversity of nurse workforce in gender, age, work experience and education level; and (3) the distribution of nurse workforce among provinces, ruralCurban areas and hospital/community settings. The Gini coefficient and Theil L index were used to measure the inequality trends of nurse workforce. RESULTS: The total number of nurses increased from 1.3 million to 4.1 million and the density increased from 1 to 2.94 per 1000 population over 2003C2018. The nurses to physician ratio changed from 0.65:1 to 1.14:1. The majority of the nurse workforce was female, under 35 years old, with less than 30 years of work experience, with an associates degree and employed within hospitals. Central and eastern regions had more nurses and there were 5.08 nurses per 1000 population in urban areas while less than two in rural areas in 2018. The Gini coefficient and between-provincial Theil index experienced a consistent decline. Within-province inequality accounted for overall inequality has risen from 52.38% in 2010 to 71.43% in 2018 suggested that the differences of distribution are mainly reflected in urban and rural areas. CONCLUSION: Chinese nurse workforce has been changed significantly in the past 15 years that may be associated with the reformations of policy, nursing education in China. Our study suggests current features in the nurse workforce and can be used to strengthen future health services.","output":"Trends, composition and distribution of nurse workforce in China: a secondary analysis of national data from 2003 to 2018"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 outbreak affects almost all sectors of farmers life. The lockdown policy has resulted in limited movement of farmers in carrying out social and economic activities. This study aims to identify those difficulties for horticultural farmers households during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze its impact on household income. We had carried out an online household survey, for data collection by interviewing 86 horticulture farmers, who were randomly sampled in two horticulture production centers in Tanah Datar District. We found that almost 50% of farmers are having difficulty accessing agricultural inputs during the pandemic, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. This happened because of implementing a lockdown policy., which disrupts farmers smooth access to farm inputs. However, although almost half of the farmers have difficulty accessing farm inputs, the regression results show that the COVID-19 outbreak does not significantly affect household income. Based on our research, 96.5% of farmers were still farming and 55.8% of them were still working in the fields as usual. The difficulty for horticultural farmers households during the Covid-19 outbreak was increasing household expenditure such as for communication, health, education, and social/religion. They have to use household savings to overcome.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on horticultural farming in Tanah Datar Regency of West Sumatra Province, Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing public health emergency. The pathogenesis and complications advanced with infection mainly involve immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy relies on immune modulation, reducing infectivity and inflammation. Given the interplay of infection and immune-inflammatory axis, the natural products received attention for preventive and therapeutic usage in COVID-19 due to their potent antiviral and anti-immunomodulatory activities. Recently, Echinacea preparations, particularly E. purpurea, have been suggested to be an important antiviral agent to be useful in COVID-19 by modulating virus entry, internalization and replication. In principle, the immune response and the resultant inflammatory process are important for the elimination of the infection, but may have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may play a role in the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. Considering the pharmacological effects, therapeutic potential, and molecular mechanisms of Echinacea, we hypothesize that it could be a reasonably possible candidate for targeting infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19 with recent recognition of cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) mediated mechanisms of bioactive components that make them notable immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed. We do hope that Echinacea could be a candidate agent for immunomodulation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","output":"Can Echinacea be a potential candidate to target immunity, inflammation, and infection - The trinity of coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Greece, a nationwide lockdown to mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was imposed on March 23, 2020. As by the end of April the first epidemic wave is waning, it is important to assess the infection attack rate and quantify the impact of physical distancing. We implemented a survey to assess social mixing patterns before the epidemic and during lockdown. We estimated R0 from surveillance data and assessed its decline as a result of physical distancing based on social contacts data. We applied a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to estimate the infection attack rate and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). As multiple social distancing measures were implemented simultaneously (schools/work/leisure), we assessed their overall impact as well as their relative contribution. R0 was estimated 2.38 (95%CI: 2.01,2.80). By April 26th, the infection attack rate was 0.12% (95% CrI: 0.06%,0.26%) and the IFR 1.12% (95% CrI: 0.55%,2.31%). During lockdown, daily contacts were reduced by 86.9% and the effective reproduction number reached 0.46 (95% CrI: 0.35,0.57). The reduction in R0 attributed to lockdown was 81.0% (95% CrI: 71.8%,86.0%) whereas the reduction attributed to each measure separately ranged between 10%-24%. We assessed scenarios with less disruptive social distancing measures as well as scenarios where measures are partially lifted after lockdown. This is the first impact assessment of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in a European country. It suggests that only multiple measures implemented simultaneously could reduce R0 below 1.

Likewise, biotechnological applications, such as nucleic acid detection, DNA amplification, and gene cloning, require high specificity in DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases. However, errors in DNA polymerization (such as mis-incorporation and mis-priming) can significantly jeopardize the specificity. Herein, we report our discovery that the specificity of DNA enzymatic synthesis can be substantially enhanced (up to 100-fold higher) by attenuating DNA polymerase kinetics via the phosphorothioate dNTPs. This specificity enhancement allows convenient and sensitive nucleic acid detection, polymerization, PCR, and gene cloning with complex systems (such as human cDNA and genomic DNA). Further, we found that the specificity enhancement offered higher sensitivity (up to 50-fold better) for detecting nucleic acids, such as COVID-19 viral RNAs.

The Lund-Mackay score (LMS) measures radiographic disease severity for CRS but poorly correlates with symptom scores. The association between LMS and health care utilization in CRS patients has not yet been investigated. The study aimed to assess the association between health care utilization and CRS radiographic severity using LMS. Methods: CRS patients enrolled in a clinical registry were evaluated. Nasal endoscopy findings and LMS were recorded for patients with sinus CT imaging. Patient symptom scores, demographic characteristics, and health care utilization measures were collected. The relationship between these factors and LMS was examined. Results: A total of 556 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 45.3 years, 53.4% were male, and 41.7% had nasal polyps. There was no difference in sex, smoking history, 22-item Sino-nasal Outcome Test scores, or past medical history factors between patients with high (8, n = 410) and low (<8, n = 146) LMS. Among high LMS patients, 73.7% underwent endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to 55.5% with low LMS (P < .01), and a greater percentage of patients had nasal polyps (49.3% vs 20.5%, P < .01). On multivariable logistic regression, high LMS patients used fewer antibiotic courses (OR: 0.68 [0.51-0.91]), but were more likely to be managed with ESS (OR: 2.28 [1.41-3.73]), and have nasal polyps (OR: 2.11 [1.16-3.93]) compared to low LMS patients. There was no significant difference in the number of steroid courses, over the counter pill use, provider visits, work/school days missed, or symptom duration between the two LMS groups. Conclusion: CRS patients with severe radiographic disease are more likely to have nasal polyps, undergo ESS, and take fewer antibiotic courses.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of serological testing in COVID-19 by providing summary sensitivity and specificity estimates with time from symptom onset. METHODS: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and PubMed was performed up to May 13, 2020. All English language, original peer-reviewed publications reporting the diagnostic performance of serological testing vis--vis virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. RESULTS: Our search yielded 599 unique publications. A total of 39 publications reporting 11 516 samples from 8872 human participants met eligibility criteria for inclusion in our study. Pooled percentages of IgM and IgG seroconversion by Day 7, 14, 21, 28 and after Day 28 were 37.5%, 73.3%, 81.3%, 72.3% and 73.3%, and 35.4%, 80.6%, 93.3%, 84.4% and 98.9%, respectively. By Day 21, summary estimate of IgM sensitivity was 0.872 (95% CI: 0.784-0.928) and specificity 0.973 (95% CI: 0.938-0.988), while IgG sensitivity was 0.913 (95% CI: 0.823-0.959) and specificity 0.960 (95% CI: 0.919-0.980). On meta-regression, IgM and IgG test accuracy was significantly higher at Day 14 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) compared to other methods.

However, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) changed usual surgical practices following advice to minimise laparoscopic surgery, and instead favouring conservative management, or open surgery for AA. METHOD: In this study, we compared the management of 50 patients with suspected/confirmed AA during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic at a district general hospital (DGH) with our usual practices, against 50 patients admitted with suspected/confirmed AA during a similar time period, one year prior to the pandemic. RESULTS: Demographics of patients in both groups were comparable with median age of 34 in the pandemic vs 32.5 in the pre-pandemic group. 74% of patients in the pandemic group (PG) underwent imaging to confirm appendicitis, compared to 58% of patients in the pre-pandemic group (PPG). 64% of PG patients were treated conservatively, compared to 8% in PPG patients. Outcomes demonstrated re-attendance events of 12% in the PG, as compared to 10% in the PPG, although the follow up period was longer in the PPG. Despite a significantly smaller number of patients managed surgically during the pandemic, 27% of patients undergoing appendicectomies had post-operative complications in the PG, as compared to 7% in the PPG.

In particular, contact tracing mobile apps provide a means for governments to manage both health and economic concerns. However, public reception of these apps is paramount to their success, and global uptake rates have been low. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to identify the characteristics of individuals or factors potentially associated with voluntary downloads of a contact tracing mobile app in Singapore. METHODS: A cohort of 505 adults from the general community completed an online survey. As the primary outcome measure, participants were asked to indicate whether they had downloaded the contact tracing app TraceTogether introduced at the national level. The following were assessed as predictor variables: (1) participant demographics, (2) behavioral modifications on account of the pandemic, and (3) pandemic severity (the number of cases and lockdown status). RESULTS: Within our data set, the strongest predictor of the uptake of TraceTogether was the extent to which individuals had already adjusted their lifestyles because of the pandemic (z=13.56; P<.001). Network analyses revealed that uptake was most related to the following: using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significantly associated with app downloads. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to introduce contact tracing apps could capitalize on pandemic-related behavioral adjustments among individuals. Given that a large number of individuals is required to download contact tracing apps for contact tracing to be effective, further studies are required to understand how citizens respond to contact tracing apps.

In order to identify such cleavages within the ORF1 polyprotein mediated by 3CLpro, the proteinase was expressed in bacteria, purified and used in trans cleavage assays with polyprotein fragments lacking the 3CLP domain as targets. The proteinase was expressed as a polyprotein fragment which was able to process during expression in bacterial cells, releasing mature 3CLpro. A histidine (His(6)) tag was introduced close to the C-terminus of the proteinase to aid purification. Processing demonstrated by the tagged proteinase was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme indicating that the site chosen for the tag was permissive. From these studies we were able to demonstrate trans cleavages consistent with the use of most of the previously predicted or identified sites within the open reading frame of gene 1.

However, to date, no research has systematically examined factors that shape peoples vaccine fatigue. To bridge the research gap, this study aims to investigate the antecedents that cause or catalyze peoples vaccine fatigue. METHODS: A narrative literature review was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO to identify factors that shape peoples vaccine fatigue. The search was completed on December 6, 2021, with a focus on scholarly literature published in English. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles were reviewed and analyzed. Vaccine fatigue was most frequently discussed in the context of infectious diseases in general at the pre-vaccination stage. Vaccine fatigue has been identified in the general public, the parents, and the doctors. Overall, a wide range of antecedents to vaccine fatigue has been identified, ranging from the frequency of immunization demands, vaccine side effects, misconceptions about the severity of the diseases and the need for vaccination, to lack of trust in the government and the media. CONCLUSION: Vaccine fatigue is peoples inertia or inaction towards vaccine information or instruction due to perceived burden and burnout.

To date, a limited number of studies have concentrated on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with different genders, clinical classification, and with or without basic diseases. AIM: To study the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hengyang (China) and provide a reliable reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: From January 16 to March 2, 2020, a total of 48 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Hengyang, and those cases were included in this study. The diagnostic criteria, clinical classification, and discharge standard related to COVID-19 were in line with the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) released by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in pharyngeal swab specimens was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. All the data were imported into the excel worksheet and statistically analyzed by using SPSS 25.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 48 cases of COVID-19 were collected, of which 1 was mild, 38 were moderate, and 9 were severe. It was unveiled that there were 31 (64.6%) male patients and 17 (35.4%) female patients, with a female-to-male ratio of 1.82:1.

The main symptoms were fever [43 (89.6%) of 48], cough and expectoration [41 (85.4%)], fatigue [22 (45.8%)], and chills [22 (45.8%)]. Other symptoms included poor appetite [13 (27.1%)], sore throat [9 (18.8%)], dyspnea [9 (18.8%)], diarrhea [7 (14.6%)], dizziness [5 (10.4%)], headache [5 (10.4%)], muscle pain [5 (10.4%)], nausea and vomiting [4 (8.3%)], hemoptysis [4 (8.3%)], and runny nose [1 (2.1%)]. The numbers of peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils were significantly reduced in the majority of the patients. The levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, blood glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (-GT), myoglobin (MB), and creatine kinase (CK) were increased in 64.6%, 44.7%, 43.2%, 37.0%, 29.5%, 22.9%,20.8%, 21.6%, 13.6%, and 12.8% of patients, respectively. The incidence of ALT elevation in male patients was remarkably higher than that in females (P < 0.01), while the incidences of AST, CK, and blood glucose elevations in severe patients were remarkably higher than those in moderate patients (P < 0.05, respectively). Except for the mild patients, chest computed tomography showed characteristic pulmonary lesions.

Using a study of US adults in late March 2020, we measure how often people witness correction, correct others, or are corrected themselves, using the case of COVID-19 misinformation on social media. Descriptively, our results suggest that all three experiences related to correction on social media are relatively common and occur across partisan divides. Importantly, a majority of those who report seeing misinformation also report seeing it corrected, and a majority of those who report sharing misinformation report being corrected by others. Those with more education are more likely to engage in correction, and younger respondents are more likely to report all three experiences with correction. While experiences with correction are generally unrelated to misperceptions about COVID-19, those who correct others have higher COVID-19 misperceptions. ?

The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95  0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06  1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

However, the mortality rate of an entire country throughout the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to determine the hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients receiving venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO) and veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) therapy. Secondary objectives are the chronological development of mortality during the pandemic, the analysis of comorbidities, age and complications. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient data from January 2020 to September 2021 of all hospitals in Germany were analysed. PARTICIPANTS: All COVID-19-positive patients who received ECMO therapy were analysed according to the appropriate international statistical classification of diseases and related health problem codes (ICDs) and process key codes (OPSs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the hospital mortality. RESULTS: In total, 4279 COVID-19-positive patients who received ECMO therapy were analysed. Among 404 patients treated with VA-ECMO and 3875 treated with VV-ECMO, the hospital mortality was high: 72% (na=a291) for VA-ECMO and 65.9% (na=a2552) for VV-ECMO. A total of 43.2% (na=a1848) of all patients were older than 60ayears with a hospital mortality rate of 72.7% (na=a172) for VA-ECMO and 77.6% (na=a1301) for VV-ECMO. CPR was performed in 44.1% (na=a178) of patients with VA-ECMO and 16.4% (na=a637) of patients with VV-ECMO. The mortality rates widely varied from 48.1 to 84.4% in individual months and worsened from March 2020 (59.2%) to September 2021 (78.4%). CONCLUSION: In Germany, a large proportion of elderly patients with COVID-19 were treated with ECMO, with an unacceptably high hospital mortality. Considering these data, the unconditional use of ECMO therapy in COVID-19 must be carefully considered and advanced age should be considered as a relative contraindication.","output":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019: A nationwide cohort analysis of 4279 runs from Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Highly urbanized and industrialized Asansol Durgapur industrial belt of Eastern India is characterized by severe heat island effect and high pollution level leading to human discomfort and even health problems However, COVID-19 persuaded lockdown emergency in India led to shut-down of the industries, traffic system, and day-to-day normal work and expectedly caused changes in air quality and weather The present work intended to examine the impact of lockdown on air quality, land surface temperature (LST), and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) of Asansol Durgapur industrial belt Satellite images and daily data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) were used for analyzing the spatial scale and numerical change of air quality from pre to amid lockdown conditions in the study region Results exhibited that, in consequence of lockdown, LST reduced by 4 02oC, PM10 level decreased from 102 to 18g/m3 and AHF declined from 116 to 40W/m2 during lockdown period Qualitative upgradation of air quality index (AQI) from poor to very poor state to moderate to satisfactory state was observed during lockdown period To regulate air quality and climate change, many steps were taken at global and regional scales, but no fruitful outcome was received yet Such lockdown (temporarily) is against economic growth, but it showed some healing effect of air quality standard","output":"Effects of lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak on air quality and anthropogenic heat in an Industrial belt of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacillus subtilis is a widely distributed aerobic Gram-positive species of bacteria.

The primary end-point was all-cause mortality aiming to produce a mortality risk score calculator. The median age was 68 years (IQR 52-79), and 59.5% were male. Most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (46.8%) and dyslipidemia (35.8%). A relevant heart or lung disease were depicted in 20%.

Data on CVD prevalence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and sequelae in survivors is limited. Aim of this prospective study carried out on consecutive unselected COVID-19 population, was to assess: 1) CVD occurrence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 2) persistence or new onset of CVD at one-month and one-year follow-up. METHODS: Over 30 days n = 152 COVID-19 patients underwent cardiovascular evaluation. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG), Troponin and echocardiography were integrated by further tests when indicated. Medical history, arterial blood gas, blood tests, chest computed tomography and treatment were recorded. CVD was defined as the occurrence of a new condition during the hospitalization for COVID-19. Survivors attended a one-month follow-up visit and a one-year telephone follow-up. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (28%) experienced a wide spectrum of CVD with acute myocarditis being the most frequent. Death occurred in 32 patients (21%) and more frequently in patients who developed CVD (p = 0.032). After adjustment for confounders, CVD was independently associated with death occurrence. At one-month follow-up visit, 7 patients (9%) presented persistent or delayed CVD. At one-year telephone follow-up, 57 patients (48%) reported persistent symptoms. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular evaluation in COVID-19 patients is crucial since the occurrence of CVD in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common (28%), requires specific treatment and increases the risk of in-hospital mortality.

METHODS: The aim of the study was to determine the effects of post-hospital clinic (POSH) and telephone (TPOSH) follow-up provider visits versus no visit on 30-day readmission. We used a retrospective cohort design based on data from 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2019 on adult patients (n = 213,513) discharged home from 15 Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Completion of POSH or TPOSH provider visits within 7 days of discharge was the exposure and all-cause 30-day inpatient and observation stay readmission was the primary outcome. We used matching weights to balance the groups and Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model to assess for readmission risk. RESULTS: Unweighted all-cause 30-day readmission rate was highest for patients who completed a TPOSH (17.3%) followed by no visit (14.2%), non-POSH (evaluation and management visits that were not focused on the hospitalization: 13.6%) and POSH (12.6%) visits. The matching weighted models showed that the effects of POSH and TPOSH visits varied across patient subgroups. For high risk (LACE 11+) medicine patients, both POSH (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.85, P < .001) and TPOSH (HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99, P = .03) were associated with 23 and 9% lower risk of 30-day readmission, respectively, compared to no visit. For medium to low risk medicine patients (LACE< 11) and all surgical patients regardless of LACE score or age, there were no significant associations for either visit type with risk of 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Post-hospital telephone follow-up provider visits had only modest effects on 30-day readmission in high-risk medicine patients compared to clinic visits. It remains to be determined if greater use and comfort with virtual visits by providers and patients as a result of the pandemic might improve the effectiveness of these encounters.","output":"Association between post-hospital clinic and telephone follow-up provider visits with 30-day readmission risk in an integrated health system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OVID-19 is a world-wide disease that has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

Although stay-at-home orders should help to slow the spread of contagious diseases (like COVID-19) by reducing person-to-person contact outside a household, these orders are only effective if people actually stay at home. This study uses data on the mobility of (anonymized) smartphones within states before and after the enactment of stay-at-home orders to understand the effects of stay-at-home orders on mobility. The dataset contains over ten million observations on the movements of smartphones across all states within the US, which allows for an analysis of compliance with stay-at-home orders without worrying about the potential for self-reporting biases. By using a quasi-experimental method, this study overcomes biases that can come from comparing pre and post policy trends (due to unmeasured differences across states). The results from a difference-in-difference analysis suggest that stay-at-home orders are associated with a 4.6% increase in the percent of smartphones that remained at home during the late spring of 2020 across the US. Although there is a statistically significant difference across states with and without stay-at-home orders, it is important to note that the average percent of smartphones that remained at home was 40% in stay-at-home states compared to 36% in states without stay-at-home orders. The results also show that penalties (jail time and fines) had no significant effect on compliance with stay-at-home orders (considering all states with such orders), while compliance with stay at home orders in Republican controlled states was 5.3% lower than in Democratic controlled states. Further, states with higher population densities had the highest percent of smartphones that remained at home after stay-at-home orders went into effect (at 45%). Overall, the results in this paper suggest that stay-at-home orders had a small but significant impact on mobility, while also suggesting that studies of individual behaviors and choices will be necessary to understand when and why people may be more or less willing to shelter at home during a global pandemic. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Compliance with Stay-at-Home Orders During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review While solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at the highest risk for severe complications and increased mortality from COVID19 disease, their vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 remains challenging due to fear of immune-mediated adverse events and suboptimal immune response.

Bupi Yichang Pill (BPYCP), a traditional Chinese formula for the treatment of dysentery and diarrhea, exhibits potential anti-inflammatory activities in treating various kinds of inflammation. However, its anti-inflammatory effect on colitis and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. PURPOSE: To explore the protective role and underlying immunomodulatory effects of BPYCP in the treatment of UC. METHODS: The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) free-drinking method induced UC in C57BL/6 mice, and BPYCP was orally administrated at a dosage of 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 g/kg/day. Throughout the experimental period, the effects of BPYCP on DSS-induced clinical symptoms and disease activity index (DAI) were monitored and analyzed. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological injury of the colon. Flow cytometry was used to detect the levels of Tfh cells, Tfh cell subpopulations, and memory Tfh cells. ELISA, Western blot, and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of inflammatory cytokines and Tfh cell-related biomarkers. RESULTS: Medium and high dosages of BPYCP effectively alleviated DSS-induced experimental colitis with increased body weight, survival rate and colonic length, and decreased DAI, colonic weight, and colonic index, as well as less ulcer formation and inflammatory cell infiltration, increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-6, and TNF-?. Moreover, BPYCP administration significantly decreased the percentage of Tfh cells and the expression of Tfh markers ICOS, PD-1 and Bcl-6 in the mesenteric lymph nodes of colitis mice. In addition, BPYCP treatment obviously decreased the percentages of Tfh1, Tfh17 and Tem-Tfh cells and upregulated Tfr cells in colitis mice. However, there were no significant regulatory effects of BPYCP on Tfh cell response in normal mice.

However, it is unclear where to target policy solutions. We estimated excess returns (the extent to which a firms profits are higher than expected given the risk associated with their investments) for manufacturers and middlemen in the pharmaceutical supply chain to determine who is making excessive profits. Excess returns were calculated as the difference between return on invested capital and the expected returns given risk, which is known as the weighted average cost of capital. We compared excess returns for manufacturers and middlemen to the average for S&P 500 companies. We find that both manufacturers and middlemen have higher excess returns in 2013C2018 compared with the S&P 500.

The problem of underrepresentation in clinical research persists today. In light of the considerable COVID-19 disparities observed, this study sought to assess the race reporting and representation among COVID-19 therapeutic studies published to date. Methods: All published COVID-19 treatment-related clinical research studies with study participants in the United States were identified. For each study, the date published, treatment investigated, study design, race/ethnicity of participants, sample size and study site were recorded. For each study site, the race/ethnicity demographics of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases were identified utilizing online publicly available department of public health data. Results: Six studies (n = 3, observational; n = 3, randomized clinical trial) have been published to date with participants in the United States. A subset (n = 4) reported race/ethnicity data in the publication. Black patients were underrepresented in all studies relative to the affected population in the cities in which the studies took place. Conclusions: Given that racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 disease burden and outcomes have emerged in the United States, it is essential that all investigators uniformly report race/ethnicity data as well as attempt, in earnest, to obtain representativeness among study participants in order to ensure that we do not develop a further widening of the treatment gap during this pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 disparities: An urgent call for race reporting and representation in clinical research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients presenting to general practitioners (GPs) with new bowel symptoms can be difficult to assess since symptoms are poor predictors of pathology.

The new coronavirus pandemic made it clear that infectious diseases are able to significantly influence morbidity and mortality data of countries in the 21st century, too. There are many complex and profound socio-economic consequences of the restrictions in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. This epidemic also resulted in an economic crisis with multiple effects on the economy and society. It is said that spatiality has a determinative role in the geographical spreading of the pandemic and on regional differences of the economic crisis. The scope of this paper is to compare the most important features and regional inequalities of the epidemic waves in Hungary based on epidemiological data. Besides statistical analysis, the study examines short-, medium- and long-term effects of the pandemic on health and health care, too. The literature review presents some regional features of the coronavirus epidemic, and it also defines the role of this pandemic on non-communicable diseases for the future. The used content-analysis investigates the Hungarian restrictions and their regional relevance. The main results of our research show that there are marked differences between the three epidemic waves in Hungary based on the number of confirmed cases and regional inequalities regarding restrictions. There was a longer interim period during the summer between the two epidemic waves of spring and autumn of 2020. On the other hand, the longer improving tendency of the second wave suddenly stopped in mid-February 2021 resulting in a third epidemic wave in Hungary. The first wave was a flat curve while the second wave resulted in an epidemic plateau. The third wave started during the decreasing process of the second wave. The first wave was more linked to geographical (Budapest capital city and Pest county) and institutional (hospitals, nursing homes) hotspots, however in the second and third wave nation-wide infection ranges became more determinative. The results of our research call the attention to the regional relevance of restrictions regarding the pandemic. When this paper was finished, on the 4th of March 2021, the pandemic did not end yet in Hungary, so its evaluation can not be complete at this time.

Thus, we hypothesized that eRNA released from dying cells under AH activates TF via the TLR3-ERK1/2-AP1 pathway, leading to VT. Animals were exposed to stimulate hypoxia for 0C24 h at standard temperature and humidity. RNaseA and DNase1 were injected immediately before exposure. TLR3 gene silencing was performed through in vivo injection of TLR3 siRNA. 80 g/kg BW of isolated eRNA and eDNA were injected 6 h prior to sacrifice. Antigens of TF pathway were determined by ELISA and TF activity by a chromogenic assay. AH exposure significantly induced release of SI markers i.e. eRNA, eDNA, HMGB1 and upregulated TLR3, ERK1/2 (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), AP1 (Activator Protein-1) and TF, whereas RNaseA pre-treatment diminished the effect of AH, thus inhibiting TF expression as well as activity during AH. Hence, we propose a possible mechanism of AH-induced TF activation and thrombosis where RNaseA can become the novel focal point in ameliorating therapy for AH induced thrombosis.","output":"Hypoxia induced up-regulation of tissue factor is mediated through extracellular RNA activated Toll-like receptor 3-activated protein 1 signalling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and extent of early diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion reversal after endovascular therapy and to determine whether early reversal is sustained or transient. METHODS MRI with DWI perfusion imaging was performed before (DWI 1) and within 12 hours after (DWI 2) endovascular treatment; follow-up MRI was obtained on day 5. Both DWIs were coregistered to follow-up MRI. Early DWI reversal was defined as the volume of the DWI 1 lesion that was not superimposed on the DWI 2 lesion. Permanent reversal was the volume of the DWI 1 lesion not superimposed on the day 5 infarct volume. Associations between early DWI reversal and clinical outcomes in patients with and without reperfusion were assessed. RESULTS A total of 110 patients had technically adequate DWI before endovascular therapy (performed median [interquartile range], 4.5 [2.8-6.2] hours after onset); 60 were eligible for this study. Thirty-two percent had early DWI reversal >10 mL; 17% had sustained reversal. The median volume of permanent reversal at 5 days was 3 mL (interquartile range, 1.7-7.0). Only 2 patients (3%) had a final infarct volume that was smaller than their baseline DWI lesion. Early DWI reversal was not an independent predictor of clinical outcome and was not associated with early reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS Early DWI reversal occurred in about one third of patients after endovascular therapy; however, reversal was often transient and was not associated with a significant volume of tissue salvage or favorable clinical outcome.","output":"Early diffusion-weighted imaging reversal after endovascular reperfusion is typically transient in patients imaged 3 to 6 hours after onset."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CASE: A 60-year-old woman with avascular necrosis of the right humeral head underwent anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA); however, recurrent posterior dislocation occurred 13 months postoperatively.

To gain traction as an effective health communication tool, SAS videos must demonstrate their potential to engage a diverse and global audience. In this study, we evaluate engagement with a SAS video about the consumption of added sugars, which is narrated by a child (a nonthreatening character), a mother (a neutral layperson), or a physician (a medical expert). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) assess whether engagement with the sugar intervention video differs by narrator type (child, mother, physician) and trait proneness to reactance and (2) assess whether the demographic characteristics of the participants (age, gender, education status) are associated with different engagement profiles with the sugar intervention video. METHODS: In December 2020, after 4013 participants from the United Kingdom completed our randomized controlled trial, we offered participants assigned to the placebo arms (n=1591, 39.65%) the choice to watch the sugar intervention video (without additional compensation) as posttrial access to treatment. We measured engagement as the time that participants chose to watch the 3.42-minute video and collected data on age, gender, education status, and trait reactance proneness. Using ordinary least squares regression, we quantified the association of the demographic characteristics and trait reactance proneness with the sugar video view time. RESULTS: Overall, 66.43% (n=1047) of the 1576 participants in the 2 placebo arms voluntarily watched the sugar intervention video. The mean view time was 116.35 (52.4%) of 222 seconds. Results show that view times did not differ by narrator (child, mother, physician) and that older participants (aged 25-59 years, mean = 125.2 seconds) watched the sugar video longer than younger adults (aged 18-25 years, mean = 83.4 seconds). View time remained consistent across education levels. Participants with low trait reactance (mean = 119.3 seconds) watched the intervention video longer than high-trait-reactance participants (mean = 95.3 seconds), although this association did not differ by narrator type. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants in our study voluntarily watched more than half of the sugar intervention video, which is a promising finding. Our results suggest that SAS videos may need to be shorter than 2 minutes to engage people who are young or have high trait proneness to reactance. We also found that the choice of narrator (child, mother, or physician) for our video did not significantly affect participant engagement.

Moreover, only a small minority of those we reached by phone were able and willing to pass the phone to a household member of the opposite gender, when prompted (with no statistically significant difference between pass rates for women and men). This low immediate pass rate, in combination with low female pickup, led to fewer women respondents. As such, we recommend that researchers dedicate time and resources to taking appointments and making call-backs to reach more women. We also show that the use of female enumerators improves households willingness to participate in women-centred surveys, and call for more investment into female enumerator teams.","output":"Patchy signals: capturing womens voices in mobile phone surveys of rural India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has been embroiled in a new epidemic known as COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020. Most countries and territories around the world are affected by the disease, and some cities have become known as epicenters due to high outbreak. The similarity of these cities can be examined within the Geographic Information System (GIS), based on various criteria. This study investigated the similarities between the eight cities of Wuhan, Tehran, Bergamo, Madrid, Paris, Daegu, New York, and Berlin in terms of the COVID-19 situation (target) in those locations based on socio-economic factors, weather, and demographic criteria. First, the factor and target layers were prepared in ArcGIS ? 10.6 software. For socio-economic data (such as: supermarkets, hospitals, metro stations etc.), the distance maps were classified with a fuzzy membership function. Weather and demographic criteria were also stored in the tables after normalization in the range of zero to one. In next step, the similar cities were identified using the similarity model and different distance metrics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Minkowski, Mahalanobis, Chebyshev, and Correlation). The results were aggregated using the Copeland method, due to the different outcomes of each metric. The most similar city was identified for each selected city and its similarity level was determined based on the criteria. Results indicated that pairs of similar cities are: Wuhan-Berlin, Tehran-Berlin, Daegu-Wuhan, Bergamo-Madrid, Paris-Mardid, and New York-Paris with a minimum and maximum similarity rate of 82.85% and 92.36%. For similar cities, the most similar factors among the socio-economic criteria are the distance from bus and metro stations;among weather, criteria are humidity and pressure;and among demographic criteria are male and female population ratios, literacy ratio, death ratio from asthma and cancer with a minimum and maximum difference of 0% and 64.94%.","output":"An Approach for Measuring Spatial Similarity Among COVID-19 Epicenters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is variable and ranges from asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, moderately severe and severe disease. A small proportion might develop severe disease and may have cytokine storm. One of the therapeutic options to treat such cases is Tocilizumab (TCZ). In this study, we present cases of severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids and discuss the treatment responses. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of severe COVID-19 cases treated with TCZ and glucocorticoids. The case series examined the characteristics and outcome of those patients. RESULTS: This study included 40 Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed patients who received TCZ and glucocorticoids. The mean age of the included patients was 57.55 (Standard deviation 12.86) years. There were 34 (85%) males, 19 (47.5%) were obese (BMI >30), 13 (32.5%) over weight, and five (12.5%) normal weight. The mean days from positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to admission was 1.641 (3.2) days. Of the patients, 18 (45%) had diabetes mellitus, 14 (35%) had hypertension. The mean days from hospital admission to ICU was 1.8 (2.6), 20 (50%) required mechanical ventilation, 39 (97.5%) had received prone position, seven (17.5%) had renal replacement therapy, 13 (32.5%) required inotropes, four (10%) had plasmapheresis, one (2.5%) had intravenous immunoglobulin, all patients received steroid therapy, and the majority 31 (77.5%) did not receive any anti-viral therapy. Of all the patients, six (15%) died, 28 (70%) were discharged and six (15%) were still in hospital. CONCLUSION: The overall mortality rate was lower than those cited in meta-analysis.

Among coronaviruses, the main protease (Mpro) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (-9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro was found to be 0.517 ? and 0.817 ? between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro. Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.","output":"Unravelling lead antiviral phytochemicals for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme through in silico approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a severe pandemic infectious virus that enters into healthy cells of a living body COVID-19 virus makes copies in the organs of the host body by multiplying itself which ultimately leads to the death of some healthy cells and therefore weakens the immune system In a mild stage, it mainly affects the respiratory tract and leads to pneumonia, organ failure, and death reaching the last stage This paper focused on the early detection of the COVID-19 patient based on the positive symptoms of the disease In this paper, the COVID-19 Remedies (CURE) scheme is proposed based on machine learning prediction models for the treatment of COVID patients For experimental results, the performance analysis of the CURE scheme is evaluated on the Python platform which is tested using the Kaggle dataset from Johns Hopkins University ? 2021 CEUR-WS All rights reserved","output":"CURE: An effective covid-19 remedies based on machine learning prediction models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The world continues in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic. Widespread public health measures and travel restrictions have dampened viral spread but outbreaks are expected as restrictions are raised. This study was carried out in order to devise an approach that may help to predict deaths based on upsurges (spikes or waves) of cases. Methods Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to August 2020 was obtained from the Our World In Data website. For the purposes of more detailed analysis, in addition to total global data, three countries were chosen for sub analysis: Italy, Germany and the United States. Results Delay to death (days) were as follows: World: 20.6 (95% CI: 8.4-32.8); USA: 19.8 (95% CI: 9.3-30.4); Germany: 18.8 (95% CI: 6.1-31.6); Italy: 2.4 (95% CI -10.2-15.0). Discussion Countries may be able to contain viral resurgence by adhering to WHO advice for reopening from restrictions/lockdowns. However, outbreaks are almost inevitable and deaths are to be expected approximately 20 days after rises in cases.

In this study, national-specific and region-specific data sets from Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom were used to explore the effect of temperature, absolute humidity and diurnal temperature range (DTR) on COVID-19 transmission. From February 1st to November 1st, a 7-day COVID-19 case doubling time (Td), meteorological factors with cumulative 14-day-lagged, government response index and other factors were fitted in the distributed lag nonlinear models. The overall relative risk (RR) of the 10th and the 25th percentiles temperature compared to the median were 0.0074 (95% CI: 0.0023, 0.0237) and 0.1220 (95% CI: 0.0667, 0.2232), respectively. The pooled RR of lower (10th, 25th) and extremely high (90th) absolute humidity were 0.3266 (95% CI: 0.1379, 0.7734), 0.6018 (95% CI: 0.4693, 0.7718) and 0.3438 (95% CI: 0.2254, 0.5242), respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of household food insecurity and its influencing factors among low-income people in Bangladesh during the lockdown of COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted through face-to-face interviews from 500 low-income households during the countrywide COVID-19 lockdown. A pretested, structured and validated questionnaire was used to collect socioeconomic characteristics, household income conditions, and food accessibility. Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and Dietary Diversity Score (DDS) were used to measure food insecurity. Multinomial logistic regression models were estimated to evaluate and predict risk factors that influence food insecurity. RESULTS: The study found that above 67% of households was mild-to-moderate food insecure while 23% experienced severe food insecurity. Significantly, 88%, 97.4%, and 93.4% of the households had anxiety and uncertainty, inadequate quality, and inadequate quantity of food, respectively.

However, CS requires high computational time for reconstructing MR images from sparse k-space data, which restricts its usage for high speed online reconstruction and wireless communications. Another major challenge is removal of Rician noise from magnitude MR images which changes the image characteristics, and thus affects the clinical usefulness. The work carried out so far predominantly models MRI noise as a Gaussian type. The use of advanced noise models primarily Rician type in CS paradigm is less explored. In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct MR images with high speed and visual quality from noisy sparse k-space data. The proposed algorithm employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to denoise MR images corrupted with Rician noise. To extract local features, the algorithm exploits signal similarities by processing similar patches as a group. An imperative reduction in the run time has been achieved as the CNN has been trained on a GPU with Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding framework making it suitable for online reconstruction. The CNN based reconstruction also eliminates the necessity of optimization and prediction of noise level while denoising, which is the major advantage over existing state-of-the-art-techniques. Analytical experiments have been carried out with various undersampling schemes and the experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and consistent peak signal to noise ratio even at 20-fold undersampling. High undersampling rates provide scope for wireless transmission of k-space data and high speed reconstruction provides applicability of our algorithm for remote health monitoring.","output":"Sparse MR Image Reconstruction Considering Rician Noise Models: A CNN Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer survivors (BCSs) experience body image concerns following treatment.

Self-compassion-based meditations are also efficacious in reducing BID in non-BCS populations. This parallel, double-blind pilot randomised controlled trial aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of MyCB, with and without an additional meditation component, on BID and related psychological outcomes in BCSs. The trial was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (#ACTRN12619001693112). METHODS: BCSs were randomly allocated to MyCB (n = 39), MyCB + Meditation (MyCB + M) (n = 17) or an expressive writing (EW) active control arm (n = 23). The primary outcome was BID. Secondary outcomes were body appreciation, affect (positive and negative), psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress) and self-compassion (state and trait). Assessments were completed online at baseline, post-intervention and 1-month. RESULTS: Adherence to the MyCB writing (45%) and meditation (50%) was modest, and acceptability was high for both MyCB and MyCB + M. Intent to treat linear mixed model analyses indicated: Post-intervention C state self-compassion and positive affect increased for MyCB compared to EW; 1-month: BID scores decreased across all conditions; trait self-compassion increased and anxiety decreased for MyCB + M compared to MyCB and EW.

SETTING: Veteran's Health Administration in Northern California Participants Community-dwelling older Veterans receiving care at VA Palo Alto Geriatrics clinic. Veterans had a mean age of 85.7 (SD = 6.8) and 72.1% had cognitive impairment. INTERVENTION: Veterans with face-to-face appointments were converted to video or telephone visits to mitigate exposure to community spread of COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-two patient evaluations and 80 clinician feedback evaluations were completed. This provided information on satisfaction, care access during pandemic, and travel and time savings. RESULTS: Of the 62 scheduled appointments, 43 virtual visits (69.4%) were conducted. Twenty-six (60.5%) visits were conducted via video, 17 (39.5%) by telephone. Virtual visits saved patients an average of 118.6 minutes each. Patients and providers had similar, positive perceptions about telehealth to in-person visit comparison, limiting exposure, and visit satisfaction. After the telehealth appointment, patients indicated greater comfort with using virtual visits in the future. Thirty-one evaluations included comments for qualitative analysis. We identified 3 main themes of technology set-up and usability, satisfaction with visit, and clinical assessment and communication. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic that has limited the ability to safely conduct inperson services, virtual formats offer a feasible and acceptable alternative for clinically-complex older patients. Despite potential barriers and additional effort required for telehealth visits, patients expressed willingness to utilize this format.

Although, many subsidy models have been applied to accelerate renewable energy investment decisions. However, it is important to develop a new model to ensure the sustainability of the renewable energy supply network under disruptions on both the supply and demand sides due to hazardous events. This study investigates different subsidy models (renewable credit, supplier subsidy, and retailer subsidy) to find a win-win subsidy model for sustainable energy supply under disruption risks. The objective is to determine the optimal capacity of renewable energy added to the grid, the optimal wholesale price of the power plant, and the optimal retail price of the aggregator under different subsidy models to maximize the economic, social, and environmental benefits of the whole network. A novel scenario-based robust fuzzy optimization approach is proposed to capture the uncertainties of business-as-usual operations (e.g., some relevant costs and demand) and hazardous events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). The proposed model is tested in a case study of the Vietnamese energy market. The results show that for a high negative impact level of hazardous events on the supply side, the renewable credit and supplier subsidy models should be considered to recovery the renewable energy market. Further, the proposed approach has a better performance in improving the power plant's robust profit for most of the hazard scenarios than the robust optimization model.","output":"COVID-19: Government subsidy models for sustainable energy supply with disruption risks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To generate evidence on the current situation of hospital care (emergency, inpatient and outpatient), for managing children presenting with diarrhea and pneumonia at 13 district hospitals in India.

INTERVENTION: None. METHODS: An assessment was done across 13 district hospitals in four states by a group or trained assessors using an adapted quality assurance tool developed by Government of India where each aspect of care was scored (maximum score 5). Emergency services and triage, case management practices, laboratory support, and record maintenance for diarrhea and pneumonia were assessed. RESULTS: Separate diarrhea treatment unit was not earmarked in any of the DHs surveyed. Overall score obtained for adequate management of diarrhea and pneumonia was 2 and 2.2 which were poor. Pediatric beds were 6.8% of the total bed strength against the recommended 8C10%. There was a 65 percent shortfall in the numbers of medical officers in position and 48 percent shortfall of nurses. There were issues with availability and utilization of drugs and equipment at appropriate places with cumulative score of 2.8. Triage for sick children was absent in all the facilities.

METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of 1,459 health care professionals. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, the Sense of Coherence Scale and Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire were distributed and analysed with descriptive and multiple linear regression methods. RESULTS: High levels of work engagement, especially in the dedication dimension, of sense of coherence, in particular in the meaningfulness dimension, and psychological distress were obtained. Significant correlations (p < .001) were identified between all the variables. CONCLUSIONS: Work engagement and sense of coherence correlated positively with each other and both negatively with psychological distress. So, health care professionals, despite presenting psychological distress, perceive their work satisfactorily and positively despite the severity of the situation and the harsh conditions.

We aimed to describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and to investigate the potential risk factors for COVID-19 severity. METHOD: 1,663 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital between January 14, 2020, and February 28, 2020 were included in the present study. Demographic information, exposure history, medical history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, severity of COVID-19 and laboratory findings on admission were collected from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between potential risk factors with COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: In the present study, the majority (79%) of 1,663 COVID-19 patients were aged over 50 years old. A total of 2.8% were medical staff, and an exposure history of Huanan seafood market was document in 0.7%, and 7.4% were family infection. Fever (85.8%), cough (36.0%), fatigue (23.6%) and chest tightness (11.9%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. As of February 28, 2020, of the 1,663 patients included in this study, 26.0% were discharged, 10.2% were died, and 63.8% remained hospitalized. More than 1/3 of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Most (99.8%) patients had abnormal results Chest CT, and the most common manifestations of chest CT were local patchy shadowing (70.7%) and ground-glass opacity (44.8%). On admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 51.1% of the patients, mononucleosis in 26.6%, and erythrocytopenia in 61.3%. Most of the patients had increased levels of C-reactive protein (80.4%) and D-dimer (64.4%). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had more obvious abnormal laboratory results related to inflammation, coagulation disorders, liver and kidney damage (all P <0.05). Older age (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83), leukocytosis (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83), and increased creatine kinase (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83) on admission were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: Timely medical treatment and clear diagnosis after the onset might be beneficial to control the condition of COVID-19. Severe patients were more likely to be to be elder, and tended to have higher proportion of comorbidities and more prominent laboratory abnormalities. Older age, leukocytosis, and increased creatine kinase might help clinicians to identify severe patients with COVID-19.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 1663 hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a single-center experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Repeat COVID-19 molecular testing can lead to positive test results after negative tests and to multiple positive test results over time. The association between positive tests and infectious virus is important to quantify. METHODS: A two months cohort of retrospective data and consecutively collected specimens from COVID-19 patients or patients under investigation were used to understand the correlation between prolonged viral RNA positive test results, cycle threshold (Ct) values and growth of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm virus genotype in patients with prolonged viral RNA detection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to assess the rate of false negative COVID-19 diagnostic tests. RESULTS: In two months, 29,686 specimens were tested and 2,194 patients received repeated testing. Virus recovery in cell culture was noted in specimens with SARS-CoV-2 target genes Ct value average of 18.8  3.4. Prolonged viral RNA shedding was associated with positive virus growth in culture in specimens collected up to 20 days after the first positive result but mostly in individuals symptomatic at time of sample collection. Whole genome sequencing provided evidence the same virus was carried over time. Positive tests following negative tests had Ct values higher than 29.5 and were not associated with virus culture. ddPCR was positive in 5.6% of negative specimens collected from COVID-19 confirmed or clinically suspected patients.

While veno-venous extracorporeal life support (V-V ECLS) is used as respiratory support, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) may be required for severe cardiac dysfunction. This systematic review summarizes the available literature regarding MCS use rates, disease drivers for MCS initiation, and MCS outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: PubMed/EMBASE were searched until October 14, 2021. Articles including adults receiving ECLS for COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome was the rate of MCS use. Secondary outcomes included mortality at follow-up, ECLS conversion rate, intubation-to-cannulation time, time on ECLS, cardiac diseases, use of inotropes, and vasopressors. RESULTS: Twenty-eight observational studies (comprising both ECLS-only populations and ECLS patients as part of larger populations) included 4218 COVID-19 patients (females: 28.8%; median age: 54.3 years, 95%CI: 50.7-57.8) of whom 2774 (65.8%) required ECLS with the majority (92.7%) on V-V ECLS, 4.7% on veno-arterial ECLS and/or Impella, and 2.6% on other ECLS. Acute heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest were reported in 7.8%, 9.7%, and 6.6% of patients, respectively. Vasopressors were used in 37.2%. Overall, 3.1% of patients required an ECLS change from V-V ECLS to MCS for heart failure, myocarditis, or myocardial infarction. The median ECLS duration was 15.9 days (95%CI: 13.9-16.3), with an overall survival of 54.6% and 28.1% in V-V ECLS and MCS patients. One study reported 61.1% survival with oxy-right ventricular assist device. CONCLUSION: MCS use for cardiocirculatory compromise has been reported in 7.3% of COVID-19 patients requiring ECLS, which is a lower percentage compared to the incidence of any severe cardiocirculatory complication.

Patients with moderately depressed GCS who do not trigger the highest level activation are at risk for adverse outcomes, potentially from delayed time to intervention. The study objective was to define the impact of time to first CT Head (CTH) on outcomes among blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS. METHODS: Patients from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) databank (2013C2016) with first ED GCS 9C12 were included. Transfers, penetrating mechanisms, death < 24 h, AIS = 6 in any body region, and patients with severe associated injuries were excluded. Study groups were defined by time to first CTH after ED arrival: immediate ( 1 h) vs. delayed (1C6 h). Primary outcomes were time to neurosurgical intervention and time to ED discharge. RESULTS: After exclusions, 4997 patients were identified. Of these, 79% (n = 3,954) underwent immediate CTH and 21% (n = 1,043) had delayed CTH. Median GCS was 11 [10C12] in both groups and there was no difference in median Head AIS (4 [3C4] vs. 4 [3C4], p = 0.586). Time to craniotomy and ICP monitor insertion were longer in the delayed group (4.2 h [3.0C7.6] vs. 3.1 h [2.1C8.7], p = 0.001; and 5.7 h [3.8C13.0] vs. 4.4 h [2.6C12.0], p = 0.008), as was time in the ED (4.3 h [2.7C6.5] vs. 2.1 h [1.2C3.7], p < 0.001). There was no difference in need for craniotomy (11% vs. 10%, p = 0.287), need for ICP monitor (12% vs. 12%, p = 0.899), or mortality (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.160). On multivariate analysis, age > 65 (OR 2.813, p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (OR 2.934, p < 0.001), ED intubation (OR 1.486, p = 0.001), and Head AIS scores of 4 (OR 1.884, p < 0.001) and 5 (OR 6.729, p < 0.001) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH for blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS decreases time to intervention and reduces ED time. A protocol to shorten time to CTH may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals.","output":"The impact of delayed time to first CT head in traumatic brain injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, the World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) as a pandemic and declared it as Public Health Emergency of International Concern As on 29 March 2020, the novel corona virus 2019 (COVID-19) has affected 199 countries and territories, causing 683,536 positive cases and 32,139 deaths This pandemic can transform into an extremely destructive form if we still do not take it seriously In the present study, we propose a generalized SEIR model of COVID-19 to study the behaviour of its transmission under different control strategies In the model, all possible cases of human-to-human transmission are taken care and its reproduction number is formulated to analyse the accurate transmission dynamics of the coronavirus outbreak Optimal control theory is applied in the model to pretend the impact of various intervention strategies, including voluntary quarantine, isolation of infected individuals, improving an individual's immunity, and hospitalisation Also, the effect of control strategies on the model is analysed graphically by simulatin'g the model numerically [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Mathematics & Mathematical Sciences is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Control Strategies to Curtail Transmission of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the identification of viruses at the start of the 20th century, detecting their presence has presented great challenges.

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies.","output":"Mining the physical infrastructure: Opportunities, barriers and interventions in promoting structural components reuse."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, human coronaviruses (hCoVs) have been identified as causative agents of severe acute respiratory tract infections. Two more hCoV outbreaks have since occurred, the most recent being SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical presentation of SARS and MERS is remarkably similar to COVID-19, with hyperinflammation causing a severe form of the disease in some patients. Previous studies show that the expression of the SARS-CoV E protein is associated with the hyperinflammatory response that could culminate in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially fatal complication. This immune-mediated damage is largely caused by a cytokine storm, which is induced by significantly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, which are partly mediated by the expression of the SARS-CoV E protein. The interaction between the SARS-CoV E protein and the host protein, syntenin, as well as the viroporin function of SARS-CoV E, are linked to this cytokine dysregulation. This review aims to compare the clinical presentation of virulent hCoVs with a specific focus on the cause of the immunopathology.

METHOD: A total of 2115 subjects from 34 provinces in China were evaluated. A questionnaire was designed, which covers demographic characteristics, knowledge of COVID-19, and factors that influenced anxiety during the outbreak to test public awareness and determine the impact of the outbreak on people's lives. In addition, a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) scale was utilized to assess anxiety levels during the outbreak. Lastly, the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify factors associated with levels of public anxiety. RESULTS: A majority of respondents reported high levels of awareness of COVID-19. A total of 1107 (52.3%), 707 (33.4%), 154 (7.3%), and 147 (7%) respondents exhibited no, mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety, respectively. Results of the chi-square test and multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that respondents (a) with no college education, (b) are unaware of neighbors who may have been infected, (c) who spent considerable time collecting information and browsing negative information related to the virus, (d) are unhealthy, and (e) displayed low levels of awareness of the transmission routes were highly likely to be anxious. CONCLUSION: During the outbreak, the majority of people exhibited high levels of awareness and knowledge regarding preventive measures from COVID-19.

METHODS: This study primarily adopted a quantitative approach using an online survey. However, participants were also encouraged to provide qualitative comments in response to open-ended questions. The survey was distributed to radiography and radiotherapy academic departments, which received a response rate of 29%. RESULTS: The findings identify some important considerations. On the one hand some participants reported teaching PM on their programmes (24%, n = 16), whereas 30% (n = 20) did not. Importantly, the remaining academics (46%) were either unsure or did not know what PM was. This finding, coincided with qualitative commentary, highlights some discrepancies linked to knowledge and understanding of PM within higher education and highlights areas where academics may need additional support. CONCLUSION: This article concludes by recognizing the challenges of delivering PM by some academics.

We also argued that political factors can interact with such threats. Moreover, we hypothesised that certain factors dealing with the concepts of social capital and civic culture can help inhibit negative opinions about the effectiveness of democracy. To test these hypotheses, we analysed public opinion data collected in Italy between April and July 2020 using a Rolling Cross-Section survey design. The data showed that evaluations of democracy became more negative with social proximity to the disease and with individual perceived vulnerability, understood in health and economic terms.

Considering the severity of the disease and the lack of active treatments, 14 patients with Covid-19 and severe lung inflammation received inhaled adenosine in the attempt to therapeutically compensate for the oxygen-related loss of the endogenous adenosineA2A adenosine receptor (A2AR)-mediated mitigation of the lung-destructing inflammatory damage. This off label-treatment was based on preclinical studies in mice with LPS-induced ARDS, where inhaled adenosine/A2AR agonists protected oxygenated lungs from the deadly inflammatory damage. The treatment was allowed, considering that adenosine has several clinical applications. PATIENTS AND TREATMENT: Fourteen consecutively enrolled patients with Covid19-related interstitial pneumonitis and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio<300 received off-label-treatment with 9 mg inhaled adenosine every 12 hours in the first 24 hours and subsequently, every 24 days for the next 4 days. Fifty-two patients with analogue features and hospitalized between February and April 2020, who did not receive adenosine, were considered as a historical control group. Patients monitoring also included hemodynamic/hematochemical studies, CTscans, and SARS-CoV2-tests. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated with no hemodynamic change and one case of moderate bronchospasm. A significant increase (> 30%) in the PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio was reported in 13 out of 14 patients treated with adenosine compared with that observed in 7 out of52 patients in the control within 15 days. Additionally, we recorded a mean PaO(2)/FiO(2)-ratio increase (215  45 vs. 464  136, P = 0.0002) in patients receiving adenosine and no change in the control group (21075 vs. 25085 at 120 hours, P>0.05). A radiological response was demonstrated in 7 patients who received adenosine, while SARS-CoV-2 RNA load rapidly decreased in 13 cases within 7 days while no changes were recorded in the control group within 15 days. There was one Covid-19 related death in the experimental group and 11in the control group.

Here, we identify a novel disease mechanism of NPC which may be its Achilles' heel that makes it susceptible to immunotherapy. CD137 is a potent costimulatory receptor on activated T cells, and CD137 agonists strongly enhance anti-tumor immune responses. A negative feedback mechanism prevents overstimulation by transferring CD137 from T cells to CD137 ligand (CD137L)-expressing antigen presenting cells (APC) during cognate interaction, upon which the CD137-CD137L complex is internalized and degraded. We found ectopic expression of CD137 on 42 of 122 (34.4%) NPC cases, and that CD137 is induced by the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein (LMP) 1. CD137 expression enables NPC to hijack the inbuilt negative feedback mechanism to downregulate the costimulatory CD137L on APC, facilitating its escape from immune surveillance. Further, the ectopically expressed CD137 signals into NPC cells via the p38-MAPK pathway, and induces the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and Laminin ?32. As much as ectopic CD137 expression may support the growth and spread of NPC, it may be a target for its immunotherapeutic elimination. Natural killer cells that express a CD137-specific chimeric antigen receptor induce death in CD137+ NPC cells, in vitro, and in vivo in a murine xenograft model.

FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy, as well as elemental analyses, were used to confirm their molecular structures. Mesomorphic and optical investigations of the prepared homologues were also conducted using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM). The DSC and POM characterization revealed that all of the synthesized sulphonic acid members are monomorphic, exhibiting a pure smectic A (SmA) mesophase with enantiotropic properties. Moreover, all compounds in the group have high thermal transition temperatures. The terminal electron-withdrawing group CSO(3)H plays a considerable role in the stabilization of the molecule, which in return resulted in high thermal SmA stability. Furthermore, the experimental data relating to the mesophase behavior were substantiated via computational studies using the DFT approach. In addition, the terminal CSO(3)H moiety has an essential impact on the thermal and physical parameters of possible geometries.

Careful selection of voice outcome measures is required to ensure that they are adequate for purpose and are psychometrically sound to detect the treatment effect. This article aims to critically evaluate the literature for voice outcome measures that are used for patients with UVFP. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS Nine databases were searched for UVFP treatment studies published since 2003 (n = 2,484 articles). These articles and their references were screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria, including population characteristics, treatment, voice outcomes, and study findings. Data from the included articles was extracted and appraised with respect to multidimensionality, timing, selection rationale, validity, reliability, and responsiveness to change of the voice outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 29 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. These studies showed considerable variability in the rationale, selection, and application of voice outcome measures for reporting the treatment effect for patients with UVFP.

To remedy these deficiencies we introduce the first class of optimal robust location estimators based on discretely sampled functional data. The proposed method is based on M-type smoothing spline estimation with repeated measurements and is suitable for both commonly and independently observed trajectories that are subject to measurement error. We show that under suitable assumptions the proposed family of estimators is minimax rate optimal both for commonly and independently observed trajectories and we illustrate its highly competitive performance and practical usefulness in a Monte-Carlo study and a real-data example involving recent Covid-19 data.","output":"Robust optimal estimation of location from discretely sampled functional data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED A large number of infectious diseases are believed to be transmitted between people via large droplets and by airborne routes. An understanding of evaporation and dispersion of droplets and droplet nuclei is not only significant for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases but also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. How far droplets can move is related to how far droplet-borne diseases can transmit. A simple physical model is developed and used here to investigate the evaporation and movement of droplets expelled during respiratory activities; in particular, the well-known Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets is revisited considering the effect of relative humidity, air speed, and respiratory jets. Our simple model considers the movement of exhaled air, as well as the evaporation and movement of a single droplet. Exhaled air is treated as a steady-state non-isothermal (warm) jet horizontally issuing into stagnant surrounding air. A droplet is assumed to evaporate and move in this non-isothermal jet. Calculations are performed for both pure water droplets and droplets of sodium chloride (physiological saline) solution (0.9% w/v). We calculate the droplet lifetimes and how droplet size changes, as well as how far the droplets travel in different relative humidities. Our results indicate that a droplet's size predominately dictates its evaporation and movement after being expelled. The sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are determined under different conditions. The maximum horizontal distances that droplets can reach during different respiratory activities are also obtained. Our study is useful for developing effective prevention measures for controlling infectious diseases in hospitals and in the community at large. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Our study reveals that for respiratory exhalation flows, the sizes of the largest droplets that would totally evaporate before falling 2 m away are between 60 and 100 microm, and these expelled large droplets are carried more than 6 m away by exhaled air at a velocity of 50 m/s (sneezing), more than 2 m away at a velocity of 10 m/s (coughing) and less than 1 m away at a velocity of 1 m/s (breathing). These findings are useful for developing effective engineering control methods for infectious diseases, and also for exploring the basic transmission mechanisms of the infectious diseases. There is a need to examine the air distribution systems in hospital wards for controlling both airborne and droplet-borne transmitted diseases.","output":"How far droplets can move in indoor environments--revisiting the Wells evaporation-falling curve."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural ecosystems, which operate as a sink, play an important role in determining the concentration of CO(2) in the atmosphere and have a large storage capacity, assisting in mitigation of problem that has a negative impact on the human population. Forests are one of the most important carbon sinks in the terrestrial ecosystem, with the best example being the Western Himalaya, where healthy and sustainable vegetation is prized. Standard methodology was adopted for assessing the different parameters of carbon related information to enumerate the status of carbon storage and its trend in sustaining the ecosystem of the area. The current research displays the annual increment and carbon dynamics in various vegetation components and levels. Trees, shrubs, and herbs help to fix atmospheric carbon in a variety of forms, including AGC, BGC, and TC. The concentration of carbon-fixing potential was measured on an annual and seasonal basis, with herbs having the highest mean annual increment, followed by shrubs and trees. Pinus wallichiana had the largest annual carbon stock change among trees, followed by Cedrus deodara, Picea smithiana, and Abies pindrow. P. wallichiana topped the increase percentage with 60.58%, followed by C. deodara 33.35%, P. smithiana 5.61%, and A. pindrow 0.45%.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these environments correspond to epidemiological risk from contacts and the social construction of risk by communication within networks of friends. Understanding when, and under which circumstances, each modality of influence can foster the widespread adoption of protective behaviours is critical for shaping useful, practical public health messaging that will best enhance the public response. Methods: We use a multiplex network approach to explore how information from both physical contact and social communication networks is driving a mitigating behavioural response to disease risk. Findings: We show that maintaining focus on awareness of risk in each individuals physical layer contacts promotes the greatest reduction in disease spread, but only when an individual is aware of the symptoms of a non-trivial proportion of their physical contacts (approximately 20% or more). Information from the communication layer was less useful when these connections matched less well with physical contacts and contributed little in combination with accurate information from the physical layer. Interpretation: We conclude that maintaining social focus on local outbreak status will allow individuals to structure their perceived social norms appropriately and respond more rapidly when risk increases.

We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay's target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4a?a?102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested.

Deaths from T2DM among Latinx American population are also more compared to other ethnicities. This disparity underlines the importance of understanding the cultural considerations of T2DM disease presentation and management in Latinx communities, including risk factors, socioeconomic variables, and other social determinants of health such as access to care. There are various modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for the development of T2DM, regardless of race. Staple foods in the diet of Latinx American communities, such as tortillas, rice, and beans, can cause spikes in blood sugar levels and can lead to obesity, which predisposes patients to develop T2DM.

Bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was found in all patients. Superimposed acute bronchopneumonia was present in 11 of 14 (78.6%) patients and was considered the major cause of death in 2 patients.

Seeking for the input data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only. Two approaches are used to obtain the nucleotide sequences; In the first one, chunks of equal length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a space. RankCfrequency distributions are studied in both cases. The defined nucleotide sequences are signs comparable to a certain extent to syllables or words as seen from the nature of their rankCfrequency distributions. Within the first approach, the Plya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length, and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the classification. We also observed that the fifth most frequent nucleotide sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the classification of diseases caused by RNA viruses with respect to severity and contagiousness.","output":"On the Verge of Life: Distribution of Nucleotide Sequences in Viral RNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 spreads easily between people who are in close contact, or through coughs and sneezes.

Disordered proteins represent an important class of antigen in a wide range of human pathogens, and, contrary to widespread belief, they are frequently targets of protective antibody responses. Importantly, disordered epitopes appear invariably to be linear epitopes, rendering them ideally suited to incorporation into a peptide vaccine. Nonetheless, the conformational properties of disordered antigens, and hence their recognition by antibodies, frequently depend on the interactions they make and the context in which they are presented to the immune system. These effects must be considered in the design of an effective vaccine.

COVID-19 is an unprecedented disaster that has disrupted lives worldwide and led to a rise in the incidence of mental health disorders. Given the widespread economic devastation due to COVID-19, many RA patients, already susceptible to mental illness, maybe at an increased risk of inaccessibility to medical care, accentuated stress, and consequent worsening of existent mental health disorders, or the onset of new mental health disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or depression. The objective of this review is to assess if there is an increased risk of mental health disorders in patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has bridged the transition to remote chronic care in the pandemic period, though certain accessibility and technological challenges are to be addressed. Decreased access to care amid lockdowns and a proposed triggering of disease activity in patients with autoimmune disorders may potentially herald a massive spike in incidence or flares of patients diagnosed with RA in the coming months. Such a deluge of cases may be potentially devastating to an overburdened healthcare system. Rheumatologists may need to prepare for this eventuality and explore techniques to provide adequate care during these challenging times. The authors found that there is a significant association between the adverse impact on the mental health of RA patients and the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: A large multi-ethnic sample of 6838 participants aged 50 years old (mean age 62.4  8.3 years) from West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study was analyzed. We categorized all participants into four groups: (a) comorbid anxiety and depression symptomology (CAD), (b) anxiety only, (c) depression only, or (d) neither depression nor anxiety. Different variables like anthropometry measures, life styles, chronic disease and blood test were collected. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). GDS-15 scores 5 indicate depression. Anxiety status was assessed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) instrument and the scores 5 was considered as having anxiety. Different variables like anthropometry measures, life styles, cognitive function and chronic disease comorbidities were collected and serum parameters were tested. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity was done to compare between those with the mental outcomes and without. RESULTS: The proportions of CAD, anxiety and depression were 9.0%, 12.8% and 10.6% respectively with ethnic diversity. The 'comorbid' group shown greater frequency of being female, having a lower educational level, higher prevalence of being single/divorced/widowed, drinking alcohol and smoking, more chronic disease profile and cognitive decline compared with individuals with only one disorder.

Although there are many retrospective studies to present clinical aspects of the COVID-19, still the involvement of the musculoskeletal system has not been deeply investigated. OBJECTIVE To classify the symptoms of musculoskeletal system in COVID-19 patients, to evaluate myalgia, arthralgia and physical/mental fatigue, to assess handgrip muscle strength, and to examine the relationship of these parameters with the severity and laboratory values of the disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study was performed at the IUC-Cerrahpa?a Pandemic Clinic. Hospitalized 150 adults with laboratory and radiological confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to WHO interim guidance were included in the study. Data were recorded from May 15,2020, to June 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographic data, comorbidities, musculoskeletal symptoms, laboratory findings and CT scans were recorded. To determine the disease severity 2007 idsa/ats guidelines for community acquired pneumonia was used. Myalgia severity was calculated by numerical rating scale (NRS). Visual analog scale and Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) were used for fatigue severity determination. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured by Jamar hand dynamometer. RESULTS 103 patients (68.7%) were nonsevere and 47 patients (31.3%) were severe. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue (133 [85.3%]), followed by myalgia (102 [68.0%]), arthralgia (65 [43.3%]) and back pain (33 [22.0%]). Arthralgia, which was mostly notable at wrist (25 [16.7%]), ankle (24 [16.0%]) and knee (23 [15.3%]) joints, showed significant correlation with disease severity. There was severe myalgia according to NRS regardless of disease severity. The physical fatigue severity score was significantly higher in severe cases, whereas no relationship was found with mental fatigue score. Female patients with severe infection had lower grip strength with a mean value of 18.26 kg (P= .010) in dominant hand, whereas no relationship was found between disease severity and grip strength in male patients, but the mean values in both genders and in decades appears below the specified normative values. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and lymphocyte count were significantly correlated with lower grip strength. LDH, C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer levels were above the normal range in patients with myalgia, arthralgia and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Musculoskeletal symptoms are quite common aside from other multi-systemic symptoms in patients with COVID-19. Arthralgia, which is related to the disease severity, should be considered apart from myalgia. COVID-19 patients have severe ischemic myalgia regardless of the disease activity. Although there is a muscle weakness in all patients, the loss of muscle function is related with the disease activity especially in women. Muscular involvement in coronavirus disease is a triangle of myalgia, physical fatigue, and functional impairment.","output":"Assessment of Musculoskeletal Pain, Fatigue and Grip Strength in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality.

In the bivariate analysis, fatigue (P = .04, OR of 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85\\\\1.00), hypertension (P = .07, OR of 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00\\\\1.07), and dyspnea (P = .08, OR of 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00\\\\1.09) showed a statistically significant relationship with increases in mortality. In multivariate regression analysis, an independent association was only found between hypertension and mortality (P = .035; AOR of 1.064; CL: 1.004\\\\1.127).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of adult and paediatric patients with the diagnosis of IIM. SIGLEC1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry and was compared with Physician Global Assessment or Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale disease activity scores. Mann Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic curves were used for cross-sectional data analysis (n=96), two-level mixed-effects linear regression model for longitudinal analyses (n=26, 110 visits). Response to treatment was analysed in 14 patients within 12 months, using Wilcoxon test. SIGLEC1 was compared with interferon-stimulated gene 15/MxA status by immunohistochemical staining of muscle biopsies (n=17). RESULTS: 96 patients with adult (a) and juvenile (j) dermatomyositis (DM, n=38), antisynthetase syndrome (AS, n=19), immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM, n=8), inclusion body myositis (IBM, n=9) and overlap myositis (n=22) were included. SIGLEC1 distinguished significantly between active and inactive disease with an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI 0.83 to 1) in DM and correlated with disease activity longitudinally (aDM: standardised beta=0.54, p<0.001; jDM: standardised beta=?0.70, p<0.001). Response to treatment in DM was associated with a decreasing SIGLEC1 (p<0.01, Wilcoxon test). SIGLEC1 was found upregulated in 8 of 19 patients with AS, 2 of 9 patients with IBM but not in IMNM.

In places where there is a shortage of specialist doctors and radiologists, there is need for a system that can direct patients to advanced health centers by pre-diagnosing COVID-19 from X-ray images. Also, smart computer-aided systems that automatically detect COVID-19 positive cases will support daily clinical applications. The study aimed to classify COVID-19 via X-ray images in high precision ratios with pre-trained VGG19 deep CNN architecture and the YOLOv3 detection algorithm. For this purpose, VGG19, VGGCOV19-NET models, and the original Cascade models were created by feeding these models with the YOLOv3 algorithm. Cascade models are the original models fed with the lung zone X-ray images detected with the YOLOv3 algorithm. Model performances were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation according to recall, specificity, precision, f1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC analysis performance metrics. While the accuracy of the Cascade VGGCOV19-NET model was 99.84% for the binary class (COVID vs. no-findings) data set, it was 97.16% for the three-class (COVID vs. no-findings vs. pneumonia) data set. The Cascade VGGCOV19-NET model has a higher classification performance than VGG19, Cascade VGG19, VGGCOV19-NET and previous studies. Feeding the CNN models with the YOLOv3 detection algorithm decreases the training test time while increasing the classification performance. The results indicate that the proposed Cascade VGGCOV19-NET architecture was highly successful in detecting COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who delivered at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC from April 8, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Starting April 8, 2020, universal testing for COVID-19 infection was initiated for all women admitted to labor and delivery. Women who declined universal testing were excluded. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed based on American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force definitions.1 Maternal demographics, clinical characteristics, and labor and delivery outcomes were examined. Neonatal outcomes were also collected. Laboratory values from admission were evaluated. Our primary outcome was the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among women who tested positive for COVID-19. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was compared between women who tested positive for COVID-19 and women who tested negative. RESULTS Of the 1,008 women included in the analysis, 73 (7.2%) women tested positive for COVID-19, of which 12 (16.4%) were symptomatic at the time of admission. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 34.2% among women who tested positive for COVID-19 and 22.9% women who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for race, antenatal aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and body mass index >30, the risk of developing any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 1.58 [0.91-2.76]).

The effect of delaying biopsies of suspicious prostate mpMRI lesions is uncertain and clinically relevant during the COVID-19 crisis. We evaluated the association between biopsy delay time and pathologic findings on subsequent prostate biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval we reviewed the medical records of 214 patients who underwent image-guided transperineal fusion biopsy of the prostate biopsy between 2017 and 2019. Study outcomes included clinically significant (ISUP grade group 2) and any prostate cancer on biopsy. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between biopsy delay time and outcomes while adjusting for known predictors of cancer on biopsy. RESULTS: The study cohort included 195 men with a median age of 68. Median delay between mpMRI and biopsy was 5 months, and 90% of patients had a 8 months delay. A significant association was found between PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies and shorter delay time. Delay time was not associated with clinically significant or any cancer on biopsy. A higher risk of significant cancer was associated with older age (P = 0.008), higher PSA (0.003), smaller prostate volume (<0.001), no previous biopsy (0.012) and PI-RADS 5 lesions (0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that under current practice, where men with PI-RADS 5 lesions and no previous biopsies undergo earlier evaluation, a delay of up to 8 months between imaging and biopsy does not affect biopsy findings.

The changing trends of genetic variations in SARS-CoV-2 strains over time and country were subsequently identified. In addition, viral genotype mapping and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify the variation features of SARS-CoV-2. Results showed that 57.89% of genetic variations involved in ORF1ab, most of which (68.85%) were nonsynonymous. Haplotype maps and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that amino acid variations in ORF1ab (p.5828P > L and p.5865Y > C, also NSP13: P504L and NSP13: Y541C) were the important characteristics of such clade. Furthermore, these variants showed more significant aggregation in the United States (P = 2.92E-66, 95%) than in Australia or Canada, especially in strains from Washington State (P = 1.56E-23, 77.65%).

It infects more than 90% of human population and induces various lymphomas. Development of specific targeted therapies is very critical for treatment of EBV-induced lymphomas, but it remains a great challenge. In this review, we introduced the current progress of EBV-specific therapies and the promising approaches that can be developed as novel targeted therapies, which involve protective or therapeutic strategies to target these lymphomas on different levels. This work will provide new insights into the development of new targeted therapies against EBV-associated lymphomas. ABSTRACT: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the first human tumor virus identified that can transform quiescent B lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. EBV can establish asymptomatic life-long persistence and is associated with multiple human malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as infectious mononucleosis. Although EBV-associated lymphomagenesis has been investigated for over 50 years, viral-mediated transformation is not completely understood, and the development of EBV-specific therapeutic strategies to treat the associated cancers is still a major challenge. However, the rapid development of several novel therapies offers exciting possibilities to target EBV-induced lymphomas. This review highlights targeted therapies with potential for treating EBV-associated lymphomas, including small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapy, cell therapy, preventative and therapeutic vaccines, and other potent approaches, which are novel strategies for controlling, preventing, and treating these viral-induced malignances.","output":"Targeted Therapies for Epstein-Barr Virus-Associated Lymphomas"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought new uncertainties to stateCsociety relations in urban China Arguably, Chinas containment of the pandemic can largely be attributed to the states effective, but controversial, governance of society At the grassroots level of Chinese cities, local state shequ (communities centred on the Residents Committees) have played a vital role in terms of both surveillance and service provision However, rather than establishing an intimate relationship with civil society as the state intended, the latters handling of the pandemic resulted in contested views on the extent to which the state should intervene in society This article engages with the ongoing debate on stateCsociety relations, and argues that in urban China we are now seeing the advance of the state ?

ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg?1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells.

The study also considered the influence of factors such as technical assistance, rural financing, and membership in cooperatives or class entities on efficiency measures. It was estimated stochastic production frontiers for regions intensively using and not using biological control, considering potential selection bias. Results demonstrate that areas with intensive use of biological pest management have a 0.863 technical efficiency score, while this score is 0.823 for nonintensive areas. This means that the intensive regions would be closer to their efficiency frontiers. Additionally, technical assistance and membership in cooperative or class entities increase efficiency by 6 and 2.5%, respectively. It can be concluded that the intensive adoption of biological control can raise the productive performance of the Brazilian agricultural sector. Therefore, it must be highlighted the importance of formulating joint policies (e.g., credit+rural extension) for the adoption of biological control to be a feasible option to promote the sustainable development of the Brazilian agricultural sector.","output":"Impacts of the use of biological pest control on the technical efficiency of the Brazilian agricultural sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, the key technology of interferometric microwave thermometer is studied, the research can be applied to the temperature measurement of human body and subcutaneous tissue.

The results show that when input power is 7 dBm, the detection sensitivity can reach 176.54 mV/dBm and the temperature resolution of the microwave radiometer can reach 0.4 K. Correction algorithm is designed to improve the accuracy of temperature measurement. After correction, the phase error is reduced from 40 to 1.4 and when temperature changes 0.1 C, the voltage value changes obviously. Step-by-step calibration and overall calibration are used to calibrate the device. Inversion algorithm can determine the relationship between physical temperature and output voltage. The mean square error of water temperature inversion by multiple linear regression algorithm is 0.607 and that of BP neural network algorithm is 0.334.

Anticipatory planning for birth rates is important for health care systems and government agencies to accurately estimate size of economy and model working and/or aging populations. Objective: To use projection modeling based on electronic health care records in a large US university medical center to estimate changes in pregnancy and birth rates prior to and after the COVID-19 pandemic societal lockdowns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included all pregnancy episodes within a single US academic health care system retrospectively from 2017 and modeled prospectively to 2021. Data were analyzed September 2021. Exposures: Pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was number of new pregnancy episodes initiated within the health care system and use of those episodes to project birth volumes. Interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the degree to which COVID-19 societal changes may have factored into pregnancy episode volume. Potential reasons for the changes in volumes were compared with historical pregnancy volumes, including delays in starting prenatal care, interruptions in reproductive endocrinology and infertility services, and preterm birth rates. Results: This cohort study documented a steadily increasing number of pregnancy episodes over the study period, from 4100 pregnancies in 2017 to 4620 in 2020 (28a?284 total pregnancies; median maternal [interquartile range] age, 30 [27-34] years; 18a?728 [66.2%] White women, 3794 [13.4%] Black women; 2177 [7.7%] Asian women). A 14% reduction in pregnancy episode initiation was observed after the societal shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (risk ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.92; P < .001). This decrease appeared to be due to a decrease in conceptions that followed the March 15 mandated COVID-19 pandemic societal shutdown. Prospective modeling of pregnancies currently suggests that a birth volume surge can be anticipated in summer 2021. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study using electronic medical record surveillance found an initial decline in births associated with the COVID-19 pandemic societal changes and an anticipated increase in birth volume. Future studies can further explore how pregnancy episode volume changes can be monitored and birth rates projected in real-time during major societal events.","output":"Use of Electronic Medical Records to Estimate Changes in Pregnancy and Birth Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 was first reported as an unknown group of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei province of China in late December of 2019.

The golden treatment against the invasive spread of COVID-19 is done by identifying and isolating the infected patients, and as a result, fast diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical issue. The common laboratory test for confirming the infection of COVID-19 is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). However, these tests suffer from some problems in time, accuracy, and availability. Chest images have proven to be a powerful tool in the early detection of COVID-19. In the current study, a hybrid learning and optimization approach named CovH2SD is proposed for the COVID-19 detection from the Chest Computed Tomography (CT) images. CovH2SD uses deep learning and pre-trained models to extract the features from the CT images and learn from them. It uses Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters. Transfer learning is applied using nine pre-trained convolutional neural networks (i.e. ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and DenseNet169).

They conducted meta-analysis where appropriate and provide recommendations based on compilation from real-time/interim therapeutic guidelines. They then advise on how to navigate and advance the evidence in the current context of uncertainty and urgency and provide expert opinion on suggested framework. EXPERT OPINION: Current evidence does not support a clear role for pharmacotherapy in COVID-19. While promising signals have been found through limited number of RCTs, these must be interpreted with caution. Without proper protection from bias and confounding we risk exposing patients to treatments where the potential for benefit is at best unclear, yet the potential for harm from adverse effects is high leading to a trade-off dilemma in decision making. Advancing the evidence requires a coordinated effort to design and conduct robust trials and to systematically synthesize and critically evaluate findings.

We review the existing literature regarding the function of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system in the female and male reproductive systems to postulate the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 regarding fertility. Because of the presence of ACE2 in the ovaries, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt ovarian function and hence oocyte quality. Higher expression of ACE2 in the endometrium with age and during the secretory phase raises concern about increased susceptibility to infection during periods of high ACE2 expression. The possibility of vertical transmission and the presence of ACE2 in the placenta and during pregnancy are also discussed. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen is controversial, but impaired semen quality has been found in men with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Evidence of orchitis and hormonal changes seen in male coronavirus disease 2019 infection may lead to infertility.

However, some positions that present complex conservation patterns across vertebrates stray from this paradigm. Here, we analyzed the association between complex conservation patterns and the pathogenicity of SNVs in the 115 disease-genes that had sufficient variant data. We show that conservation is not a one-rule-fits-all solution since its accuracy highly depends on the analyzed set of species and genes. For example, pairwise comparisons between the human and 99 vertebrate species showed that species differ in their ability to predict the clinical outcomes of variants among different genes using conservation. Furthermore, certain genes were less amenable for conservation-based variant prediction, while others demonstrated species that optimize prediction. These insights led to developing EvoDiagnostics, which uses the conservation against each species as a feature within a random-forest machine-learning classification algorithm. EvoDiagnostics outperformed traditional conservation algorithms, deep-learning based methods and most ensemble tools in every prediction-task, highlighting the strength of optimizing conservation analysis per-species and per-gene.

Understanding the mechanisms that promote cross-recognition by T cells induced by seasonal coronaviruses will be critical for future predictions on the role of pre-existing immunity in protection against severe disease. We demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein induces an immunodominant response in HLA-B7+ COVID-19-recovered individuals that is also readily detectable in unexposed donors. This immunodominant response is driven by a single N-encoded epitope that displays a high degree of conservation with the homologous region in circulating coronaviruses. We show that T cell-mediated cross-reactivity can be detected towards the circulating OC43/HKU-1 coronaviruses, but not the 229E or NL63 coronaviruses, due to different peptide conformations. This cross-reactivity is driven by private T cell receptor repertoires with a bias for TRBV27 and a long CDR3b loop in unexposed and COVID-19-recovered individuals. Together, our findings demonstrate the basis of pre-existing immunity to a conserved and highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 epitope driven by cross-reactive memory T cells, suggesting long-lived protective immunity.Funding: This work was supported by generous donations from the QIMR Berghofer COVID 19 appeal, and financial contributions from Monash University, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO, AISNE ECR grants), Australian Research Council (ARC), National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), and the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF).

Activated platelets and neutrophils may be playing a decisive role during the thromboinflammatory phase of COVID-19 so, in addition, we introduce and validate a novel marker, the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR).Two thousand and eighty-eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted at any of the hospitals of HM Hospitales group in Spain, from March 1 to June 10, 2020, were categorized according to the primary outcome of in-hospital death.Baseline values, as well as the rate of increase of the four ratios analyzed were significantly higher at hospital admission in patients who died than in those who were discharged (p<0.0001). In multivariable logistic regression models, NLR (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08, p=0.00035) and NPR (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.12 to 1.36, p<0.0001) were significantly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality.According to our results, hemogram-derived ratios obtained at hospital admission, as well as the rate of change during hospitalization, may easily detect, primarily using NLR and the novel NPR, patients with COVID-19 at high risk of in-hospital mortality.","output":"Hemogram as marker of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Delirium is a common neurocognitive disorder in hospital settings, characterised by fluctuating impairments in attention and arousal following an acute precipitant.

DESIGN: Cross sectional, online survey. SETTING: Online survey was conducted from September 2020 to November 2020 in the general population. PARTICIPANTS: Australian residents working from home for at least 2 days a week at some time in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographics, caring responsibilities, working from home arrangements, work-related technology, workCfamily interface, psychosocial and physical working conditions, and reported stress and musculoskeletal pain. RESULTS: 924 Australians responded to the online questionnaire. Respondents were mostly women (75.5%) based in Victoria (83.7%) and employed in the education and training and healthcare sectors. Approximately 70% of respondents worked five or more days from home, with only 60% having a dedicated workstation in an uninterrupted space. Over 70% of all respondents reported experiencing musculoskeletal pain or discomfort. Gendered differences were observed; men reported higher levels of family to work conflict (3.161.52 to 2.941.59, p=0.031), and lower levels of recognition for their work (3.751.03 to 3.961.06, p=0.004), compared with women. For women, stress (2.940.92 to 2.660.88, p<0.001) and neck/shoulder pain (4.502.90 to 3.512.84, p<0.001) were higher than men and they also reported more concerns about their job security than men (3.011.33 to 2.781.40, p=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence from the current study suggests that working from home may impact employees physical and mental health, and that this impact is likely to be gendered. Although further analysis is required, these data provide insights into further research opportunities needed to assist employers in optimising working from home conditions and reduce the potential negative physical and mental health impacts on their employees.","output":"Working from home in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional results from the Employees Working From Home (EWFH) study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The length of the published glycoprotein (G) gene sequences of avian metapneumovirus subtype-C (aMPV-C) isolated from domestic turkeys and wild birds in the United States (1996C2003) remains controversial. To explore the G gene size variation in aMPV-C by the year of isolation and cell culture passage levels, we examined 21 turkey isolates of aMPV-C at different cell culture passages. The early domestic turkey isolates of aMPV-C (aMPV/CO/1996, aMPV/MN/1a-b, and 2a-b/97) had a G gene of 1,798 nucleotides (nt) that coded for a predicted protein of 585 amino acids (aa) and showed >97% nt similarity with that of aMPV-C isolated from Canada geese. This large G gene got truncated upon serial passages in Vero cell cultures by deletion of 1,015 nt near the end of the open reading frame. The recent domestic turkey isolates of aMPV-C lacked the large G gene but instead had a small G gene of 783 nt, irrespective of cell culture passage levels. In some cultures, both large and small genes were detected, indicating the existence of a mixed population of the virus. Apparently, serial passage of aMPV-C in cell cultures and natural passage in turkeys in the field led to truncation of the G gene, which may be a mechanism of virus evolution for survival in a new host or environment.","output":"Glycoprotein gene truncation in avian metapneumovirus subtype C isolates from the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous factors have been identified to influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral population of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2(+) swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers from the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were collected in AprilCMay 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%) among the consensus sequences. Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to healthcare workers. This difference was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values obtained at the diagnostic tests, which did not differ between the two groups. The most common nucleotide changes of intrahost SNVs in both groups were consistent with APOBEC and ADAR activities. Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Moreover, the presence of metastasis, either in general or specifically in the lung, was not associated with intrahost diversity among cancer patients. Cancer patients carried significantly higher numbers of minor variants compared to non-cancer counterparts. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 diversity in especially vulnerable patients will shed light onto the understanding of the basis of COVID-19 different outcomes in humans.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 genomic analyses in cancer patients reveal elevated intrahost genetic diversity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health surveillance (PHS) is at a tipping point, where the application of novel processes, technologies, and tools promise to vastly improve efficiency and effectiveness.

While random DNA breaks are typically repaired both by deletion and by inversion at approximately equal proportions, V(D)J and class switch recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene overwhelmingly delete intervening sequences to yield productive rearrangement.

Integrating CRISPR knockout and chemical perturbation screening we here identify the Snf2-family helicase-like ERCC6L2 as one such factor. We show that ERCC6L2 promotes double-strand break end-joining and facilitates optimal CSR in mice. At the cellular levels, ERCC6L2 rapidly engages in DNA repair through its C-terminal domains. Mechanistically, ERCC6L2 interacts with other end-joining factors and plays a functionally redundant role with the XLF end-joining factor in V(D)J recombination. Strikingly, ERCC6L2 controls orientation-specific joining of broken ends during CSR, which relies on its helicase activity.

However, the increased susceptibility of this population to COVID-19 is unclear. We outline several underlying mechanisms that may explain the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity. Obesity has an adverse effect on respiratory physiology because increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue can interfere with lung expansion, resulting in reduced lung compliance. Further, fat accumulation in the soft tissue of the pharynx can increase inspiratory resistance, and obesity may be associated with sleep apnea. Obesity is associated with several defects in cell-mediated immunity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Impaired adipocyte-mediated immune function results in chronically high leptin levels, low adiponectin levels, and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Reduced physical activity can impair several steps of the immune response to viruses. Obesity also promotes a hypercoagulable state, leading to severe consequences. These factors may synergistically play a role in promoting the severity of the disease in obese individuals. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which obesity contributes to the severity of COVID-19 is important for developing more effective treatments.","output":"Susceptibility of the obese population to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Virtual care is transforming the nature of healthcare, particularly with the accelerated shift to telehealth and virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of the current study was to measure predictors of objective ad libitum energy intake at a laboratory-based, post-exercise test-meal in adolescents ranging in weight status from overweight to severe obesity. We hypothesized that appetitive states, rather than appetitive traits, would be the strongest predictors of energy intake at a post-exercise test-meal, after controlling for body size. At Baseline, 30 adolescents (ages 10C16 years, 50% female (F), 43% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 83% with obesity (OB)) completed state and trait appetite measures and an ad libitum dinner meal following intensive exercise. Nineteen of those participants (47% F, 32% NHW, 79% OB) completed identical assessments two years later (Year 2). Energy intake (kcal) at each time point was adjusted for fat-free mass index (i.e., body size). Adjusted energy intake was reliable from Baseline to Year 2 (ICC = 0.84). Multiple pre-meal appetite ratings were associated with test-meal energy intake. In stepwise linear regression models, pre-meal prospective food consumption was the strongest and only significant predictor of test-meal energy intake at both Baseline (R(2) = 0.25, p = 0.005) and Year 2 (R(2) = 0.41, p = 0.003).

This questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services. METHODS AND RESULTS: The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation, a UK HF patient charity. 'Survey Monkey' was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the Pumping Marvellous Foundation 's online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (outpatient hospital and community HF clinics). There were 1050 responses collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60 years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID-19 (mean 7  2.5 on anxiety scale of 0 to 10) compared with anxiety regarding HF (6.1  2.4; P < 0.001). Anxiety was higher amongst patients aged &#8804;60 years about HF (6.3  2.2 vs. 5.9  2.5 in those aged >60 years; P = 0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3  2.3 vs. 6.7  2.6 those aged >60 years; P < 0.001). Sixty-five per cent of respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or postponement) during the lockdown period.

Given the limited availability of quantitative norovirus data to input to QMRA models, some studies have applied a conversion factor to estimate norovirus exposure based on measured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations. We conducted a review of peer-reviewed publications to identify the concentrations of noroviruses and FIB in raw, secondary-treated, and disinfected wastewater. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the ratios of norovirus-FIB pairs in each wastewater matrix and the variables that significantly impact these ratios. Norovirus-to-FIB ratios were found to be significantly impacted by the norovirus genotype, month of sample collection, geographic location, and the extent of wastewater treatment. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of using a FIB-to-virus conversion factor in QMRA and found that the choice of conversion ratio has a great impact on estimated health risks. For example, the use of a conversion ratio previously used in the World Health Organization Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater predicted health risks that were significantly lower than those estimated with measured norovirus concentrations used as inputs. This work emphasizes the gold standard of using measured pathogen concentrations directly as inputs to exposure assessment in QMRA. While not encouraged, if one must use a FIB-to-virus conversion ratio to estimate norovirus dose, the ratio should be chosen carefully based on the target microorganisms (i.e., strain, genotype, or class), prevalence of disease, and extent of wastewater treatment.","output":"Systematic review of the relative concentrations of noroviruses and fecal indicator bacteria in wastewater: considerations for use in quantitative microbial risk assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Bladder cancer is the third most common urological malignancy affecting Australians, with key modifiable risk factors.

Lack of knowledge among healthcare providers (HCPs) about diseases such as COVID-19 may delay the diagnosis, disease spread, and produce poor infection control practices. Hence, this systematic review aimed to summarize the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of HCPs toward COVID-19 during the first months of the pandemic. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020191742). A relevant article search was performed on EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and the Google Scholar database. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The median percentage of HCPs with good KAP was computed. Results: Twenty studies involving 12,072 HCPs were included in the review process. Median percentages of 75.8% (IQR: 69.3C87.7%), 74.6% (IQR: 54.4C74.6), and 79.8% (IQR: 67.0C79.8%) of HCPs had good knowledge, and positive attitude and practice, respectively. Although the reported risk factors were inconsistent among studies, age, gender, level of education, experience, infection prevention training, and sources of information were associated with knowledge of HCPs. In addition, being elderly, having a high level of education, absence of chronic illness, and good knowledge and practice were significantly associated with the attitude of HCPs. Further, types of profession, experience, age, level of education, use of personnel protective equipment, and gender were significantly associated with the practice of HCPs. Conclusions: Approximately, three-fourths of HCPs had good knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 during the first months of the pandemic, although the percentage of HCPs was inconsistent in different study settings. In addition, associated factors of KAP were inconsistent among studies; hence, stake holders should target locally identified risk factors to design relevant education packages and infection prevention training to halt the rapid transmission of COVID-19.

Method: We used a mixture of inductive and deductive coding, based on the Job DemandsCResources Model, to identify the job demands (aspects of the job that can be physically or psychologically costly) and job resources (aspects of the job that can buffer the effects of job demands and promote achievement and growth) teachers reported experiencing across the three time points. Results: Generally, teachers MHWB seemed to have declined throughout the pandemic, especially for primary school leaders. Six job demands contributed negatively to teachers MHWB (i.e., uncertainty, workload, negative perception of the profession, concern for others wellbeing, health struggles, and multiple roles) and three job resources contributed positively to their MHWB (i.e., social support, work autonomy, and coping strategies). Conclusions: Policymakers and practitioners can support teachers MHWB by engaging in more collaborative communication and ensuring greater accessibility to sources of social support.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are among this group, and CLL-directed therapies are discussed as potential COVID-19-severity modifying agents. So far, the published data and clinical experience in treatment of COVID-19 patients with CLL are still scarce. Therefore, we aimed at retrospectively analyzing factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection course in patients with CLL. ABSTRACT: Background. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become the cause of a worldwide pandemic, and its clinical infection course in patients with hematological malignancies may be severe. Methods. We performed a retrospective study on 188 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (CLL) with COVID-19 infection. Results. At the time of infection 51 patients (27.1%) were treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), 46 (24.5%) with anti-CD20 antibodies while 37 patients (19.7%) received venetoclax. In total, 111 patients (59.0%) required hospitalization and 50 patients (26.5%) died due to COVID-19. Patients with poor performance status (ECOG >1; p = 0.02), advanced age (>65 years; p = 0.04), low hemoglobin concentration (10 g/dl; p = 0.0001), low platelets (<100  109/L; p = 0.003), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH; p = 0.014) had an increased risk of death due to COVID-19. Neither CLL treatment status (treatment na?ve vs. treated) nor the type of CLL-directed treatment had impact on the SARS-CoV-2 related risk of death. The multivariate survival analysis showed that advanced age (p = 0.009) and low platelet count (p = 0.0001) were associated with significantly shorter patients overall survival. Conclusions. SARS-CoV-2 infection in CLL patients is associated with poor outcome regardless of administered CLL-directed treatment.","output":"Outcome of SARS-CoV-2-Infected Polish Patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Telemedicine offers an excellent opportunity to provide continuing health care for those in need during local/global pandemics and disasters.

During the early phase, a nationwide lockdown in the form of a curfew was imposed which helped mitigate the spread of the virus. However, due to several lapses, there was a threat of community transmission; this was swiftly brought under control through ongoing government interventions. Thus, strict social/physical distancing measures enforced by the government, together with an increase in testing capacity, prevented widespread community transmission. Strictly containing the outbreaks as and when they were identified made it easier to bring the spread under control through contact tracing.

By ablating NEMO, M pro induces the death of human brain endothelial cells and a microvascular pathology in mice that is similar to what we find in the brain of COVID-19 patients. Importantly, the inhibition of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 3, a mediator of regulated cell death, blocks the vessel rarefaction and disruption of the blood-brain barrier due to NEMO ablation.

Through simulation, it is found that the filtration performance of a cylindrical structure is better than that of a plate structure under all simulation conditions. For particles larger than 1 m, the shortest theoretical length of the dust collecting plate required for the cylindrical structure is 34% shorter than that for the plate structure. For 0.1 m particles, the filtration efficiency of the cylindrical structure is nearly 20~30% (the maximum value is 29.76%) higher than that of the plate structure, while the air velocity is 1.5 m/s~2.5 m/s. The resistance of the cylindrical micro-electrostatic filter is only half of that of the combined plate type micro-electrostatic filter, indicating that the cartridge structure has enormous energy-saving potential. The introduction of the quality factor further proves that the integrated filtration performance of the cartridge micro-electrostatic filter is better.

Amid the outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID-19) in January 2020, strict policies were in place to restrict people's movement, bringing about steep reductions in pollution activities and notably lower ambient concentrations of primary pollutants. In this study, we report hourly measurements of fine particulate matter (i.e., PM2.5) and its comprehensive chemical speciation, including elemental and molecular source tracers, at an urban site in Shanghai spanning a period before the lockdown restriction (BR) (1 to 23 Jan. 2020) and during the restriction (DR) (24 Jan. to 9 Feb. 2020). The overall PM2.5 was reduced by 27% from 56.2  40.9 (BR) to 41.1  25.3 g m-3 (DR) and the organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 was similar, averaged at 5.45  2.37 (BR) and 5.42  1.75 gC m-3 (DR). Reduction in nitrate was prominent, from 18.1 (BR) to 9.2 g m-3 (DR), accounting for most of the PM2.5 decrease. Source analysis of PM2.5 using positive matrix factorization modeling of comprehensive chemical composition, resolved nine primary source factors and five secondary source factors. The quantitative source analysis confirms reduced contributions from primary sources affected by COVID-19, with vehicular emissions showing the largest drop, from 4.6 (BR) to 0.61 g m-3 (DR) and the percentage change (-87%) in par with vehicle traffic volume and fuel sale statistics (-60% to -90%). In the same time period, secondary sources are revealed to vary in response to precursor reductions from the lockdown, with two sources showing consistent enhancement while the other three showing reductions, highlighting the complexity in secondary organic aerosol formation and the nonlinear response to broad primary precursor pollutants. The combined contribution from the two secondary sources to PM2.5 increased from 7.3  6.6 (BR) to 14.8  9.3 g m-3 (DR), partially offsetting the reductions from primary sources and nitrate while their increased contribution to OC, from 1.6  1.4 (BR) to 3.2  2.0 gC m-3 (DR), almost offset the decrease coming from the primary sources.

The wide prevalence, high death counts and rapid emergence of new variants urge for establishment of research infrastructure to facilitate rapid development of efficient therapeutic modalities and preventive measures. In agreement with this, five SARS-CoV2 strains (ILS01, ILS02, ILS03, ILS15 and ILS24) of four different clades (19A, 19B, 20A and 20B) were isolated from patient swab samples collected during the 1st COVID-19 wave in Odisha, India. The viral isolates were adapted to in-vitro cultures and further characterized to identify strain specific variations in viral growth characteristics. All the five isolates showed substantial amount of virus induced CPE however ILS03 belonging to 20A clade displayed highest level of CPE. Time kinetics experiment revealed spike protein expression was evident after 16th hours post infection in all five isolates. ILS03 induced around 90% of cytotoxicity. Further, the susceptibility of various cell lines (human hepatoma cell line (Huh-7), CaCo2 cell line, HEK-293T cells, Vero, Vero-E6, BHK-21, THP-1 cell line and RAW 264.7 cells) were assessed. Surprisingly, it was found that the human monocyte cells THP-1 and murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 were permissive to all the SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The neutralization susceptibility of viral isolates to vaccine-induced antibodies was determined using sera from individuals vaccinated in the Government run vaccine drive in India. The micro-neutralization assay suggested that both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines were equally effective (100% neutralization) against all of the isolates. The whole genome sequencing of culture adapted viral isolates and viral genome from patient oropharyngeal swab sample suggested that repetitive passaging of SARS-CoV2 virus in Vero-E6 cells did not lead to emergence of many mutations during the adaptation in cell culture. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the five isolates clustered to respective clades.

With no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral treatments available to prevent dengue infection, dengue is considered a major public health problem in subtropical and tropical regions. The virus, like other enveloped viruses, uses the hosts cellular enzymes to synthesize its structural (C, E, and prM/M) and nonstructural proteins (NS1C5) and, subsequently, to glycosylate these proteins to produce complete and functional glycoproteins. The structural glycoproteins, specifically the E protein, are known to interact with the hosts carbohydrate receptors through the viral proteins N-glycosylation sites and thus mediate the viral invasion of cells. This review focuses on the involvement of dengue glycoproteins in the course of infection and the virus exploitation of the hosts glycans, especially the interactions between host receptors and carbohydrate moieties. We also discuss the recent developments in antiviral therapies that target these processes and interactions, focusing specifically on the use of carbohydrate-binding agents derived from plants, commonly known as lectins, to inhibit the progression of infection.","output":"Glycosylation of dengue virus glycoproteins and their interactions with carbohydrate receptors: possible targets for antiviral therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Before 2020, mental disorders were leading causes of the global health-related burden, with depressive and anxiety disorders being leading contributors to this burden. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has created an environment where many determinants of poor mental health are exacerbated. The need for up-to-date information on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 in a way that informs health system responses is imperative. In this study, we aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders globally in 2020. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of data reporting the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and published between Jan 1, 2020, and Jan 29, 2021. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, preprint servers, grey literature sources, and consulted experts. Eligible studies reported prevalence of depressive or anxiety disorders that were representative of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a pre-pandemic baseline. We used the assembled data in a meta-regression to estimate change in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders between pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic (using periods as defined by each study) via COVID-19 impact indicators (human mobility, daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, and daily excess mortality rate). We then used this model to estimate the change from pre-pandemic prevalence (estimated using Disease Modelling Meta-Regression version 2.1 [known as DisMod-MR 2.1]) by age, sex, and location. We used final prevalence estimates and disability weights to estimate years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. FINDINGS: We identified 5683 unique data sources, of which 48 met inclusion criteria (46 studies met criteria for major depressive disorder and 27 for anxiety disorders). Two COVID-19 impact indicators, specifically daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and reductions in human mobility, were associated with increased prevalence of major depressive disorder (regression coefficient [B] 09 [95% uncertainty interval 01 to 18; p=0029] for human mobility, 181 [79 to 283; p=00005] for daily SARS-CoV-2 infection) and anxiety disorders (09 [01 to 17; p=0022] and 138 [107 to 170; p<00001]. Females were affected more by the pandemic than males (B 01 [01 to 02; p=00001] for major depressive disorder, 01 [01 to 02; p=00001] for anxiety disorders) and younger age groups were more affected than older age groups (?0007 [C0009 to ?0006; p=00001] for major depressive disorder, ?0003 [C0005 to ?0002; p=00001] for anxiety disorders). We estimated that the locations hit hardest by the pandemic in 2020, as measured with decreased human mobility and daily SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, had the greatest increases in prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. We estimated an additional 532 million (448 to 629) cases of major depressive disorder globally (an increase of 276% [251 to 303]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such that the total prevalence was 31529 cases (27225 to 36545) per 100 000 population. We also estimated an additional 762 million (643 to 906) cases of anxiety disorders globally (an increase of 256% [232 to 280]), such that the total prevalence was 48024 cases (41082 to 55886) per 100 000 population. Altogether, major depressive disorder caused 494 million (336 to 687) DALYs and anxiety disorders caused 445 million (302 to 625) DALYs globally in 2020. INTERPRETATION: This pandemic has created an increased urgency to strengthen mental health systems in most countries. Mitigation strategies could incorporate ways to promote mental wellbeing and target determinants of poor mental health and interventions to treat those with a mental disorder. Taking no action to address the burden of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders should not be an option.

These measures carry a high economic and social cost, and might have little effect on COVID-19 epidemics if there are many more cases resulting from local transmission compared with imported cases. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which imported cases contribute to local transmission under different epidemic conditions. METHODS: To inform decisions about international travel restrictions, we calculated the ratio of expected COVID-19 cases from international travel (assuming no travel restrictions) to expected cases arising from internal spread, expressed as a proportion, on an average day in May and September, 2020, in each country. COVID-19 prevalence and incidence were estimated using a modelling framework that adjusts reported cases for under-ascertainment and asymptomatic infections. We considered different travel scenarios for May and September, 2020: an upper bound with estimated travel volumes at the same levels as May and September, 2019, and a lower bound with estimated travel volumes adjusted downwards according to expected reductions in May and September, 2020. Results were interpreted in the context of local epidemic growth rates. FINDINGS: In May, 2020, imported cases are likely to have accounted for a high proportion of total incidence in many countries, contributing more than 10% of total incidence in 102 (95% credible interval 63-129) of 136 countries when assuming no reduction in travel volumes (ie, with 2019 travel volumes) and in 74 countries (33-114) when assuming estimated 2020 travel volumes. Imported cases in September, 2020, would have accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 106 (50-140) of 162 countries and less than 1% in 21 countries (4-71) when assuming no reductions in travel volumes. With estimated 2020 travel volumes, imported cases in September, 2020, accounted for no more than 10% of total incidence in 125 countries (65-162) and less than 1% in 44 countries (8-97). Of these 44 countries, 22 (2-61) had epidemic growth rates far from the tipping point of exponential growth, making them the least likely to benefit from travel restrictions. INTERPRETATION: Countries can expect travellers infected with SARS-CoV-2 to arrive in the absence of travel restrictions. Although such restrictions probably contribute to epidemic control in many countries, in others, imported cases are likely to contribute little to local COVID-19 epidemics. Stringent travel restrictions might have little impact on epidemic dynamics except in countries with low COVID-19 incidence and large numbers of arrivals from other countries, or where epidemics are close to tipping points for exponential growth. Countries should consider local COVID-19 incidence, local epidemic growth, and travel volumes before implementing such restrictions.

Real-world data on trends in remdesivir use may elucidate its benefits and place in therapy. METHODS: Hospitalized Veterans with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that were treated with remdesivir at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center from May 2020 to April 2021 were included. Monthly trends in remdesivir treatment, as well as patient characteristics and clinical outcomes among patients treated with remdesivir, were assessed with joinpoint regression to calculate average monthly percent change and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 30,333 Veterans were hospitalized with a positive PCR test over the study period, and 13,639 were treated with remdesivir (45%). Throughout the study period, the proportion of Veterans treated with remdesivir increased significantly (4.5% per month, 95% CI 0.5%-8.6%) and median time to remdesivir initiation decreased significantly (12% per month, 95% CI -15.8% to -8.0%). Though demographic characteristics of Veterans treated with remdesivir remained stable, including age, race, and obesity, improvement in clinical outcomes were observed, including median length of hospital stay which decreased by 6.5% per month (95% CI -9.1% to -3.8%), intensive care admissions which decreased by 4.6% per month (95% CI -6.3% to -2.8%) and inpatient mortality which decreased by 6.3% per month (95% CI -9.4% to -3.1%). By April 2021, most patients initiated remdesivir on the day of admission, and the inpatient mortality rate decreased to 7.9% from 19.2% in May 2020. CONCLUSION: Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, utilization of remdesivir increased while initiation of remdesivir occurred earlier in the hospital admission, with concurrent reductions in length of hospital stay, intensive care admissions, and inpatient mortality.

Rather than framing Covid-19 as a massive shift from normal (face-to-face) to abnormal (virtual) delivery modes, I propose that its impact both continues and alters assumptions about what constitutes proper university education, and both perpetuates and disrupts what is noticed, valued and supported in conventional teaching and learning processes. To do this, I will focus on two themes in current HE practices in the UK, as examples of what such an approach can open-up to view. This starts from the already existing tensions, complexities and contradictions as to what should constitute appropriate teacher and student behaviours and settings, and how this normality is often being perceived as being lost because of the pandemic. By engaging with existing literature about longer-term patterns of inequalities in access and inclusion across physical and virtual HE learning environments, I hope to show some underlying problems in how student competency is being evidenced in virtual as compared to physical space and some ways the pandemic has exposed the unevenness of diverse student and staff relationships to space, time and technologies and the differential impacts on their educational experiences.","output":"Exploring Inequalities in the Social, Spatial and Material Practices of Teaching and Learning in Pandemic Times"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the pace of science.

Considering advances in imaging modalities and adjuvant therapies, the role of SLNB in early breast cancer needs to be re-evaluated. METHODS: The NAUTILUS trial is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial involving clinical stage T1-2 and N0 breast cancer patients receiving breast-conserving surgery. Axillary ultrasound is mandatory before surgery with predefined imaging criteria for inclusion. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy or needle aspiration of a suspicious node is allowed. Patients will be randomized (1:1) into the no-SLNB (test) and SLNB (control) groups.

We describe and compare testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and hospital admission, receipt of intensive care and mortality rates related to COVID-19 for people with a recent history of homelessness versus community-dwelling people as of July 31, 2020. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between Jan. 23 and July 31, 2020, using linked health administrative data among people who either had a recent history of homelessness or were dwelling in the community. People were included if they were eligible for provincial health care coverage and not living in an institutionalized facility on Jan. 23, 2020. We examined testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and complication outcomes of COVID-19 (hospital admission, admission to intensive care and death) within 21 days of a positive test result. Extended multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in 3 time periods: preshutdown (Jan. 23CMar. 13), peak (Mar. 14CJune 16) and reopening (June 17CJuly 31). RESULTS: People with a recent history of homelessness (n = 29 407) were more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in all 3 periods compared with community-dwelling people (n = 14 494 301) (preshutdown adjusted HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22C2.11; peak adjusted HR 2.95, 95% CI 2.88C3.03; reopening adjusted HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.39C1.51). They were also more likely to have a positive test result (peak adjusted HR 3.66, 95% CI 3.22C4.16; reopening adjusted HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15C2.71). In the peak period, people with a recent history of homelessness were over 20 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 20.35, 95% CI 16.23C25.53), over 10 times more likely to require intensive care for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 10.20, 95% CI 5.81C17.93) and over 5 times more likely to die within 21 days of their first positive test result (adjusted HR 5.73, 95% CI 3.01C10.91).

However, a majority of the previous data came from large institutional centers with high academic output. We aimed to explore the association between patients characteristics, hematological parameters, and outcomes in admitted persons with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at our community hospital in an inner city. Methods This study is a retrospective chart review designed to evaluate the potential associations between demographic and clinical characteristics of our patient population and their outcomes when testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study population included patients hospitalized in the Saint Francis Medical Center from January 2020 to September 2020. This pilot study included 50 out of the 275 hospitalized patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during this timeframe. Data collection from the patients chart included age, sex, comorbidities, admission complete blood cell count, and use of Remdesivir, steroids, and plasma. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Results In this pilot study, there was an overall mortality rate of 32% (16 out of 50 patients). Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 3 points or above was present in 87.5% of the patients in the mortality group versus 41.1% in patients who survived (p = 0.0021). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between males and females after adjusting for other variables with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.19 (95% CI 0.02-1.80, p = 0.09). There were no statically significant differences in mortality between Caucasians, non-Hispanic, Black, and Latinx patients (p = 0.466). Admission platelets were lower in the mortality group with a mean of 157.7  43.23 (Thou/ul) versus 250.06  93.95 (Thou/ul) in the survivors (p = 0.0005). Admission white blood cell count in the mortality group was lower than the survivor group with an average of 5.93  2.58 (Thou/ul) versus 9.3  4.14 (Thou/ul) (p = 0.0039), respectively. The plasma D-dimer level of 3 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent unit (FEU) or higher was associated with increased mortality. There was no association of C-reactive protein (CRP) with mortality (p = 0.93 and p = 0.54, respectively); however, the CRP level revealed an association with ICU admission (p = 0.03). The use of steroids, Remdesivir, and plasma did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality, ICU admission, or sepsis in our study. Conclusion In this study, older age, higher CCI, and plasma D-dimer level of 3 mg/L FEU or higher were associated with higher mortality among COVID-19 patients. White blood cell count and platelet count were significantly lower in the mortality group in comparison to the survivor group. However, there was no statistical difference in lymphocyte count between the mortality group and the survivor group.

Hence, they require adequate palliative care education. However, there is only limited insight into how final-year nursing students perceive palliative care education in undergraduate nursing programs. This study aimed to describe nursing students perspectives of the development needs of palliative care education. An additional two aims emerged based on the collected data, namely, to describe the preferred education for palliative care and the factors which promote or hinder palliative care learning during undergraduate nursing studies. METHODS: The research was guided by a descriptive qualitative approach and applied inductive content analysis. The frequencies (f) of identified codes (reduced expressions) were counted to show the noteworthiness of each category in relation to the entirety. The participants were final-year nursing students (n = 766) who had participated in a national survey. RESULTS: The inductive content analysis identified three unifying categories. The first was Development needs and views of palliative care education (f = 524), which consisted of the main categories the need to develop palliative care education (f = 414) and meaning of palliative care and its education (f = 110). Secondly Preferred types of palliative care education (f = 1379), including the main categories teaching contents in palliative care education (f = 905), teaching methods for palliative care learning (f = 393), and placement of palliative care studies (f = 81). Thirdly The facilitators and barriers to palliative care learning (f = 401), consisting of the main categories factors facilitating palliative care learning (f = 66) and barriers to palliative care learning (f = 335). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides detailed information about nursing students perspectives of palliative care education and its development needs. Hence, the results are relevant to decision-makers who want to develop undergraduate nursing curricula. This study highlights that palliative care education should be developed by ensuring that all students have equal access to palliative care education provided by highly competent teachers. Possibilities for clinical placements or visits to palliative care units during the education should also be improved. The participating students felt unprepared to provide high-quality palliative care even though they responded that palliative care is an important topic in their nursing studies.

The disease spectrum varies from asymptomatic detection to severe disease. Data on community versus hospitalized cases are limited. We aim to evaluate and compare the epidemiological and clinical characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases primarily diagnosed in the ambulatory setting and compare their illness presentation. METHODS: We are prospectively enrolling a longitudinal cohort of laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 subjects and their close contacts. Suspect cases are defined as anyone who developed fever and/or Covid-19 like-symptoms in the post-Covid-19 era without proven SARS-CoV-2 detection. We consented and interviewed subjects over the phone to capture detailed sociodemographic data, medical and social histories, and clinical characteristics of the illness. RESULTS: From March 20 to June 16, 2020, 463 subjects were enrolled (Figure 1). Of those, 178 were SARS-CoV-2 positive [164 adults and 13 pediatric (< 18 years) cases] and 192 were COVID-19 suspected (111 adults and 78 pediatric cases). Adult confirmed cases were more likely to be Hispanic and have an underlying medical condition but less likely to be white compared to suspected cases (Table 1). Pediatric confirmed cases were more likely to be Hispanic and have smoke exposure, but less likely to have a travel history compared to suspected cases (Table 1). Both adult and pediatric confirmed subjects had fatigue, headache and cough as the most common symptoms reported. Cough, muscle aches and chest tightness were more likely to be reported in pediatric confirmed than suspected cases; whereas loss of taste, smell and appetite, diarrhea and fever  100.4 were documented more often in adult confirmed than suspected cases (Figure 2).

METHODS: A cross sectional analysis of patients who completed a televisit at our urology practice (summer 2020) was performed. A Likert-based satisfaction telephone survey was offered to patients within 7 days of their televisit. Patient demographics, televisit modality (telephone vs video), and outcomes of the visit (eg follow-up visit scheduled, orders placed) were retrospectively abstracted from each chart and compared between the telephone and video cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate variables associated with satisfaction while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 269 patients were analyzed. 73% (196/269) completed a telephone televisit. Compared to the video cohort, the telephone cohort was slightly older (mean 58.8 years vs. 54.2 years, P = .03). There were no significant differences in the frequency of orders placed for medication changes, labs, imaging, or for in-person follow-up visits within 30 days between cohorts. Survey results showed overall 84.7% patients were satisfied, and there was no significant difference between the telephone and video cohorts.

However, there are insufficient data about the effect of hyperglycemia on COVID-19 prognosis in non-diabetic patients. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between random blood glucose levels measured at the time of diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease in non-diabetic patients. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective cohort of non-diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from 11 March to 30 May 2020 in the Turkish Ministry of Health database was investigated. The patients were stratified into three groups according to blood glucose levels which were <100 mg/dL in group-1, in the range of 100C139 mg/dl in group-2, and the range of 140C199 mg/dl in group-3. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the groups. The primary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: A total of 12,817 non-diabetic patients (median age [IQR]: 44 [25] years, females: 50.9%) were included. Patients in group-2 (5%) and group-3 (14%) had higher mortality rates than patients in group-1 (2.1%). The rates of hospitalization, hospital stays longer than 8 days, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay more than 6 days, and mechanical ventilation were also significantly higher in group-3 patients. Likewise, glucose levels in the range of 140C199 mg/dL were an independent associate of mortality and composite of ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation.

The treatment of ARDS to date is focused on the prevention of further iatrogenic damage of the lung rather than the treatment of the initial inflammatory process. Several preclinical studies have revealed a beneficial effect of iloprost on the control of pulmonary inflammation, and in a small number of patients with ARDS, iloprost treatment resulted in improved oxygenation. Therefore, we plan to conduct a large multicenter trial to evaluate the effect of iloprost on ARDS. METHODS: The Therapeutic Iloprost during ARDS trial (ThIlo trial) is a multicenter, randomized, single blinded, clinical phase II trial assessing the efficacy of inhaled iloprost for the prevention of the development and progression of ARDS in critically ill patients. One hundred fifty critically ill patients suffering from acute ARDS will be treated either by nebulized iloprost or NaCl 0.9% for 5 days. Blood samples will be drawn at defined time points to elucidate the serum levels of iloprost and inflammatory markers during treatment. Mechanical ventilation will be standardized. In follow-up visits at days 28 and 90 as well as 6 months after enrollment, functional status according to the Barthel Index and a health care-related questionnaire, and frailty (Vulnerable Elders Survey) will be evaluated. The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation, defined as the ratio of PaO(2)/FiO(2). Secondary endpoints include 90-day all-cause mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores during the study period up to day 90, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator-associated pneumonia, delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, and discharge localization. The study will be conducted in three university ARDS centers in Germany. DISCUSSION: The results of the ThIlo trial will highlight the anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on early inflammatory processes during ARDS, resulting in the improvement of outcome parameters in patients with ARDS.

Despite their growing presence, they have largely been left out of HF research and interventions. This systematic review was aimed to 1) describe utilization patterns of HCWs by adults with HF, 2) examine the effect of HCWs on HF outcomes, and 3) review HF interventions that involve HCWs. Methods Five electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Library [Wiley], CINAHL [EBSCO], and AgeLine [EBSCO]) were searched from inception through August 4, 2017. The yield was screened using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two authors independently reviewed references and a third reviewer acted as an arbitrator when needed. Data were extracted from articles that met the inclusion criteria. The Downs and Black checklist was used for quality assessment. Due to study heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Results Of the 7,032 studies screened, 13 underwent full-text review, and six met the inclusion criteria. Two descriptive studies found that adults with HF who live alone and have functional and cognitive deficits utilize HCWs. While three retrospective cohort studies examined the association between having an HCW post-HF hospitalization and readmission rates, their findings were conflicting. One quasi-experimental study found that an HCW-delivered educational intervention improved HF patients' self-care abilities. Overall, despite some significant findings, the studies assessed were of poor-to-fair quality (Downs and Black score range: 10-16 [28 total points]), with most lacking methodological rigor. Conclusion Although HCWs are quite common, the literature on these paraprofessionals in HF is limited.

Currently, the reliability of CTP is hampered by varying results between different post-processing software packages. The purpose of this study is to compare ischemic core volumes estimated by IntelliSpace Portal (ISP) and syngo.via with core volumes as estimated by RAPID. METHODS Thirty-five CTP datasets from patients in the MR CLEAN trial were post-processed. Core volumes were estimated with ISP using default settings and with syngo.via using three different settings: default settings (method A); additional smoothing filter (method B); and adjusted settings (method C). The results were compared with RAPID. Agreement between methods was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Accuracy for detecting volumes up to 25 mL, 50 mL, and 70 mL was assessed. Final infarct volumes were determined on follow-up non-contrast CT. RESULTS Median core volume was 50 mL with ISP, 41 mL with syngo.via method A, 20 mL with method B, 36 mL with method C, and 11 mL with RAPID. Agreement ranged from poor (ISP: ICC 0.41; method A: ICC 0.23) to good (method B: ICC 0.83; method C: ICC 0.85). The bias (1.8 mL) and limits of agreement (-27, 31 mL) were the smallest with syngo.via with additional smoothing (method B).

He was treated with an IV dextrose bolus but had recurrent hypoglycemia requiring a continuous dextrose infusion. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, acute hepatitis (elevated liver enzymes), and acute kidney injury (elevated serum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL). Other labs: elevated TSH 8.44 uIU/mL, normal AM cortisol 16.4 ug/dl. A 5.1 cm mass was discovered in the left lung with bilateral nodules, biopsi revealed SCC of unclear origin (either lung or metastatic disease from prior tongue cancer). He was malnourished from prior cancer related dysphagia and nutritional supplements were added. Despite this and improvement in liver and kidney function, he had persistent hypoglycemia. He became hypoglycemic within 4-hrs while performing a 72-hr fast with labs: serum glucose 45 mg/dL, insulin &lt 2 uU/mL, c-peptide &lt 0.1 ng/mL, proinsulin &lt 4 pmol/L, beta hydroxybutyrate 0.17 mmol/L, IGF1 &lt 16 ng/mL (ref: 50 - 317), IGF2 147 ng/mL (ref: 267-616), negative hypoglycemia panel and insulin antibody. This was consistent with a paraneoplastic hypoglycemia known as non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH). To discontinue the dextrose infusion, he was started on prednisone 20 mg daily titrated up to 60 mg daily, intermittent tube feeds and palliative chemotherapy. With this, hypoglycemia improved, and the dextrose infusion was discontinued. Unfortunately, he had ischemic bowel perforation leading to cardiac arrest and death. Discussion: Our patient had NICTH as suggested by the 72-hr fast (non-insulin mediated hypoglycemia, IGF2/IG1 ratio &gt 10) and the presence of a tumor. It is mediated by tumor-produced IGF-2 causing increased glucose utilization, decreased gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and ketogenesis. Curiously, IGF-2 may not be elevated if the tumor produces a partially processed big IGF-2 for which there is no commercial assay. Instead, an IGF2/IGF1 ratio close to or more 10 is indicative of NICTH. Mesenchymal and hepatic tumors are the most common cause of this rare entity with an incidence of one per million people years. A literature search showed very few reports of SCC-mediated-NICTH, with one case of esophageal SCC. Our patients primary tumor was undetermined (lung vs tongue) - but in either case this could be a novel association. A multidisciplinary approach is required centered around the tumor (surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation). High dose prednisone 30 to 60 mg daily can be used in the interim as it decreases IGF-2 but is not always successful. Recombinant hGH and glucagon are alternatives or can be combined with steroids. In summary IGF2/IGF1 ratio should be calculated, palliative tumor directed therapy should be initiated with prednisone and supplemental nutrition as adjuncts.","output":"A Case of Paraneoplastic Hypoglycemia From Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Undetermined Primary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention has implemented an active comprehensive surveillance project of acute respiratory infections in adults in Shanghai, including influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI).

CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients who report high levels of perceived injustice are at greater risk for experiencing psychological distress. The relationship between perceived injustice and depression may vary as a function of satisfaction with care. Addressing issues of perceived injustice in the psychosocial and rehabilitative care of cancer patients may support the early identification of those at risk of significant psychological distress and enhance intervention success. Implications for policy and practice in healthcare are discussed.

We administrated an anonymous questionnaire, which explored the emotional experience, the demographic factors linked to a COVID-19-related stress syndrome, the patients perception about the adequacy of clinical undertaking from the hospital and the resilience. We analyzed 324 questionnaires. There were no significant differences in prevalence of psychological distress among the whole cohort; however, PLWOD were calmer, less troubled, and more serene than PLWH. Moreover, PLWH smoked more, ate more, and gained more weight than PLWOD. Most patients didnt feel lonely and continued to take pleasure from their activities. No differences in resilience were found between the groups. In the whole cohort lower levels of resilience were found in patients that were unemployed, with history of psychological disorders and in those who experienced more feelings of anger, anxiety and concern.

This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.","output":"Patient and surgeon experiences with video visits in plastic surgery-toward a data-informed scheduling triage tool."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, new evidence for the photodegradation reactions of acetaminophen (AC) is reported by photoluminescence (PL), Raman scattering and FTIR spectroscopy.

It varies over time, since it is a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from ones circumstances, mood, or relationships with others. Since emotions vary over time, it is important to understand and analyze them appropriately. Existing works have mostly focused well on recognizing basic emotions from human faces. However, the emotion recognition from cartoon images has not been extensively covered. Therefore, in this paper, we present an integrated Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach that deals with recognizing emotions from cartoon images. Since state-of-works do not have large amount of data, we collected a dataset of size 8 K from two cartoon characters: Tom & Jerry with four different emotions, namely happy, sad, angry, and surprise. The proposed integrated DNN approach, trained on a large dataset consisting of animations for both the characters (Tom and Jerry), correctly identifies the character, segments their face masks, and recognizes the consequent emotions with an accuracy score of 0.96. The approach utilizes Mask R-CNN for character detection and state-of-the-art deep learning models, namely ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and VGG 16 for emotion classification. In our study, to classify emotions, VGG 16 outperforms others with an accuracy of 96% and F1 score of 0.85.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. Fifty professionally active nurses were recruited from various psychiatric facilities and asked to fill out a set of questionnaires: the authors' survey on sociodemographic data, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS), the revised version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-R), and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Linear regression models were constructed to predict the AIS, CESD-R and MBI-GS dimensions scores, with the CAS score as a predictor. The models were adjusted for sex, marital status, place of residence, length of service and working hours per week. Results: A rise in the CAS score was associated with rises in the CESD-R, MBI Exhaustion and MBI Cynicism scores. The effects were of similar size regardless of whether models were adjusted or unadjusted. Unadjusted and adjusted models predicting AIS total scores and MBI-Efficacy score were not fit to empirical data. In these models, the CAS score was not found to be significantly associated with the AIS and MBI-Efficacy scores.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated ovarian cancer patients who underwent HIPEC following complete cytoreductive surgery performed during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in three different centers specializing in gynecological oncology. All patients who underwent cytoreduction plus HIPEC for a primary, interval, and recurrent surgery were evaluated. Primary outcomes was postoperative 30-day morbidity and mortality. The secondary outcome was infection of patient and/or related staff with COVID-19 during the perioperative or early postoperative period. RESULTS: We performed a total of 35 HIPEC procedures during the pandemic: 15 (42.9%) patients underwent primary/interval surgery, while 20 (57.1%) patients had recurrent disease. Grade 3-4 complications occurred in one patient (2.9%) (chronic renal failure), while mortality did not occur in any patient. Neither the patients nor related staff were infected with the coronavirus during the perioperative or early postoperative period. One patient, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia on postoperative day 80 died from the infection. Another patient died on postoperative day 85 due to progressive ovarian cancer, a disorder in vital functions, and organ failure.

Consequently, countries have adopted physical distance measures in an attempt to mitigate the uncontrolled spread of the virus. A critical question for policymakers to inform evidence-based practice is if and how physical distance measures slowed the propagation of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic. Methods This study aims to quantify the effects of physical distance mitigation measures on the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from John Hopkins University on confirmed cases and testing data from the Our World in Data were used in an interrupted time series analysis to estimate the effects of physical distance measures on the growth rates of the pandemic in 12 countries of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Findings We found that physical distance measures produced a significant decrease in the growth rates of the COVID-19 pandemic in five countries (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Malaysia, and South Korea). The test-positivity rate was significant in understanding the slowing growth rate of COVID-19 cases caused by the mitigation measures, as it provides important context that is missing from analysis based only on confirmed case data. Interpretation Physical distance interventions effectively slowed the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study could inform infectious disease mitigation policies based on physical distance measures by quantifying the differential health outcomes of a pandemic with and without physical distance interventions.","output":"On the impact of early non-pharmaceutical interventions as containment strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Since 2017 more than 50% of UK doctors have undertaken a 'Foundation 3 (F3) Year' training break after completing their Foundation Programme (the first two years following graduation), rather than immediately enter specialty training. The reasons for, and consequences of, the growing F3 trend are largely unknown. This scoping review presents the current evidence and identifies future research in this field. METHODS Following Arksey and O'Malley's guidelines, 12 databases and three UK-based national post-graduate organisation websites were searched for articles published in English (final searches January 2020). Multiple search terms were used to capture articles relating to the 'F3' time-period, including 'post-foundation' or 'pre-specialty' training. Title, abstract and full-paper screening selected articles reporting any aspect of F3, including within a wider context (e.g., postgraduate training breaks), and then underwent mixed methods analysis . RESULTS Of 4766 articles identified, 45 were included. All articles were published after 2009; 14/45 (31.1%) were published in 2019. 27 articles reported research, the remainder were opinion/commentaries. Specific personal (including demographic), professional and organisational factors, particularly the UK post-graduate training structure, are associated with undertaking an F3. The majority of F3 training breaks last 1 year and involve working (clinically or non-clinically) and/or travel. The decision to undertake an F3 is made either prior to, or during, foundation training. Evidence regarding the impact of F3 on healthcare service provision was limited but evenly balanced. CONCLUSIONS In summarising the existing F3 evidence, this review has highlighted important issues including healthcare workforce equality and diversity, training pathway inflexibility and the effect of negative early-career experiences on subsequent career decisions. More research is needed to understand the financial impact of training-breaks on healthcare service provision, how training programmes must adapt to retain more trainees, and the long-term effects of training breaks, such as F3, on subsequent career progression.","output":"The F3 phenomenon: Early-career training breaks in medical training.

The objective of this study was to describe the PK/PD relationship of chloroquine and its major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, in a P. vivax volunteer infection study. We analyzed data from 24 healthy subjects who were inoculated with blood-stage P. vivax malaria and administered a standard treatment course of chloroquine. The PK of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine was described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The relationship between plasma and whole blood concentrations of chloroquine and P. vivax parasitemia was characterized by a PK/PD delayed response model, where the equilibration half-lives were 32.7 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) 27.4-40.5) for plasma data and 24.1 hours (95% CI 19.0-32.7) for whole blood data. The estimated parasite multiplication rate was 17 folds per 48 hours (95% CI 14-20) and maximum parasite killing rate by chloroquine was 0.213 hour-1 (95% CI 0.196-0.230), translating to a parasite clearance half-life of 4.5 hours (95% CI 4.1-5.0) and a parasite reduction ratio of 400 every 48 hours (95% CI 320-500). This is the first study that characterized the PK/PD relationship between chloroquine plasma and whole blood concentrations and P. vivax clearance using a semimechanistic population PK/PD modeling.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: From March 13 to April 22, 2020, we collected on a computerized and anonymized database, medical records, laboratory data and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection (RT-PCR and/or CT-scan). Patients were followed up until April 22, 2020 or until death or discharge. We have considered for statistical analysis, LFT abnormalities with levels greater than two times the upper limit of normal. Composite endpoint included admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, severe radiologic injury and death to define disease severity. RESULTS: Among 281 patients (median age 60 years) with COVID-19, 102 (36.3%) had abnormal LFT. Hypertension (45.6%) and diabetes (29.5%) were the main comorbidities. 20.2% were taken liver-toxic drugs at the admission and 27.4% were given drugs known to induce hepatic cytolysis during hospitalization. Patients with elevated levels of ALT or AST were significantly more severe with a higher rate of admission to ICU (40.0% vs 6.0%, pa?<a? 0.0001), and global mortality (26.7% vs 12.1%, pa?=a? 0.03).

SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe respiratory disease and death in humans, highlighting the need for effective antiviral therapies. The RNA synthesis machinery of SARS-CoV-2 is an ideal drug target and consists of non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), which is directly responsible for RNA synthesis, and numerous co-factors that are involved in RNA proofreading and 5 capping of viral mRNAs. The formation of the 5 cap-1 structure is known to require a guanylyltransferase (GTase) as well as 5 triphosphatase and methyltransferase activities. However, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA capping remains poorly understood. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase nsp12 functions as a GTase. We characterise this GTase activity and find that the nsp12 NiRAN (nidovirus RdRP-associated nucleotidyltransferase) domain is responsible for carrying out the addition of a GTP nucleotide to the 5 end of viral RNA via a 5 to 5 triphosphate linkage. We also show that remdesivir triphosphate, the active form of the antiviral drug remdesivir, inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 GTase reaction as efficiently as RNA polymerase activity.

Coronaviruses encode an RNA polymerase which, in combination with other viral proteins, is responsible for synthesising capped viral mRNA. mRNA cap synthesis requires a guanylyltransferase enzyme; here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 guanylyltransferase is located in the viral RNA polymerase, and we identify the protein domain responsible for guanylyltransferase activity. Furthermore we demonstrate that remdesivir triphosphate, the active metabolite of remdesivir, inhibits both the guanylyltransferase and RNA polymerase functions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase.

The genome of the coronaviruses is a linear, nonsegmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 30 kb. The evolution of these viruses occurs through some features: the flexibility of the genome including a high number of potentially non-essential genes, the demonstrated ability of the coronaviruses to establish persistent infections, the quasi-species structure of the viral population, the ability to undergo RNA mutations, deletions and recombinations at a high frequency. Two epidemiologic pictures of human coronavirus infections have to be distinguished: as suggested by a few epidemiologic studies, the classical coronaviruses, including HCoVs 229E, OC43, and NL63 are distributed worldwide and would circulate during seasonal outbreaks.

Transdisciplinary sustainability research and networked knowledge-to-action approaches are critical parts of this change. The effective application of such approaches still puzzles social actors (individuals and networks) willing to act in more transformative ways. We conducted twelve participatory network mapping activities to assess the perception of high-level federal government institutional entrepreneurs on the structure and dynamics of an emerging socio-political arena for marine spatial planning (MSP) in Brazil. Our informants, mostly cognizant of their own intra-governmental structures, anticipate the MSP arena to remain self-enclosed, with changes only occurring within the federal government structures in the coming years. Their perceptions were largely conservative, narrow, and unambitious and therefore unfit to generate regime transformations. The limited awareness of response capacities beyond the federal government potentially leads to the endurement of the low performance already present in the MSP arena. Results from the participatory network mapping informed a five-step functional ocean governability analysis pointing to key potential contributions to support a critical turn in MSP: 1. envision situated interactional narratives to leverage regime shifts; 2. build a shared understanding of and anticipating transformative coevolutionary dynamics; 3. build awareness of the potential synergies among disparate but innovative area-based responses; 4. specify inter-network-based limitations and the necessary changes underpinning potential leaps in performance levels of ocean governance orders; 5. make power asymmetries explicit to stir structurally tailored strategic action by less influential groups.

In the political arena, several countries have postponed elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other countries, including Malawi, went ahead with their planned elections. Malawi held a presidential election at a time when the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing rapidly. In this paper, we assess the effect of the perceived risk of catching COVID-19 on willingness to vote in the Malawi presidential election that was held on 23 June 2020. Turn out in this election was ten percentage points lower than in the general elections that were held a year earlier. The paper draws on a nationally representative survey of adult Malawians (n = 1155). In our main analysis, we use instrumental variables to account for potential endogeneity. We find that nearly two thirds of Malawians thought that they were likely to catch COVID-19 at some point. Notwithstanding the COVID-19 risk, 86% of the country's citizens were willing to vote. Our analysis shows that an individual's perceived risk of catching COVID-19 is associated with a lower likelihood of voting (? = - 0.096; p < 0.05). This suggests that voter turnout in Malawi's fresh presidential election may have been highly affected by the perceived risk of catching COVID-19.

We reason that variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied whether the rs4804803 SNP was associated with a susceptibility to dengue fever (DF) and/or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) through genotyping analysis in a Taiwanese cohort. We generated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from individuals with AA or AG genotype of rs4804803 to study the viral replication and immune responses for functional validation. A total of 574 DNA samples were genotyped, including 176 DF, 135 DHF, 143 other non-dengue febrile illnesses (OFI) and 120 population controls. A strong association between GG/AG genotypes of rs4804803 and risk of DHF was found when compared among DF, OFI and controls (p = 0.004, 310(?5) and 0.001, respectively). The AA genotype was associated with protection against dengue infection compared with OFI and controls (p = 0.002 and 0.020, respectively). Moreover, MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype with a higher cell surface DC-SIGN expression had a significantly higher TNF, IL-12p40, and IP-10 production than those with AA genotype in response to dengue infection. However, the viral replication in MDDCs with AG genotype was significantly lower than those with AA genotype. With both genotypes, MDDCs revealed an increase in viral replication following the addition of anti-IP-10 neutralizing antibody.

Computational data showed that estradiol interacted more strongly with the main protease active site. In the presence of calcitriol, the binding energy of the spike protein to ACE2 was increased, and transferring Apo to Locked S conformer of spike trimer was facilitated.

In homozygous and heterozygous transgenic mice, but not controls, intense VEGF immunoreactivity was scattered throughout the retina at postnatal days 5-7 (P5-7), just after the onset of inflammatory cell infiltration. VEGF staining in the retina remained widespread, but weak from P9-15. Beginning at P15, the intensity of VEGF immunoreactivity achieved a second peak, which it maintained through adulthood. This peak coincided with significant retinal destruction due to massive inflammation. The onset of BRB breakdown coincided with the upregulation of VEGF (P5-7) and widespread BRB breakdown was demonstrated from about P9. From P9-12, aggregates of cells positive for Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin-B4, a marker for vascular endothelial cells, formed on the retinal surface. These cells migrated into the retina at P12-15 with the more superficial cells forming a network of vessels and the deeper cells remaining in small clusters, thus demonstrating that NV occurs much later than BRB breakdown. Non-transgenic FVB/N mice, which undergo retinal degeneration beginning at about P9, also demonstrate the latter peak of VEGF upregulation and the accompanying BRB breakdown, but not the early upregulation. VEGF immunostaining of transgenic and non-transgenic mouse retinas was eliminated by pre-incubation of the VEGF antibodies with VEGF peptide. The data suggest that the early peak of VEGF upregulation (P5-7) and its accompanying BRB breakdown is due to IL-1beta expression and is likely to be dependent on inflammatory cell infiltration.

During the early months of the pandemic, there was substantial uncertainty about whether the large number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization would exceed healthcare system capacity. This uncertainty created an urgent need for accurate predictions about the number of COVID-19 patients requiring inpatient and ventilator care at the local level. In this work, we develop a Bayesian Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Ventilated-Recovered (SIHVR) model to predict the burden of COVID-19 at the healthcare system level. The Bayesian SIHVR model provides daily estimates of the number of new COVID-19 patients admitted to inpatient care, the total number of non-ventilated COVID-19 inpatients, and the total number of ventilated COVID-19 patients at the healthcare system level. The model also incorporates county-level data on the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and county-level social distancing metrics, making it locally customizable. The uncertainty in model predictions is quantified with 95% credible intervals. The Bayesian SIHVR model is validated with an extensive simulation study, and then applied to data from two regional healthcare systems in South Carolina. This model can be adapted for other healthcare systems to estimate local resource needs.","output":"A Bayesian Susceptible-Infectious-Hospitalized-Ventilated-Recovered Model to Predict Demand for COVID-19 Inpatient Care in a Large Healthcare System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To achieve the mission of personalized medicine, centering on delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right dose, therapeutic drug monitoring solutions are necessary. In that regard, wearable biosensing technologies, capable of tracking drug pharmacokinetics in noninvasively retrievable biofluids (e.g., sweat), play a critical role, because they can be deployed at a large scale to monitor the individuals' drug transcourse profiles (semi)continuously and longitudinally. To this end, voltammetry-based sensing modalities are suitable, as in principle they can detect and quantify electroactive drugs on the basis of the target's redox signature. However, the target's redox signature in complex biofluid matrices can be confounded by the immediate biofouling effects and distorted/buried by the interfering voltammetric responses of endogenous electroactive species. Here, we devise a wearable voltammetric sensor development strategy-centering on engineering the molecule-surface interactions-to simultaneously mitigate biofouling and create an \\"undistorted potential window\\" within which the target drug's voltammetric response is dominant and interference is eliminated. To inform its clinical utility, our strategy was adopted to track the temporal profile of circulating acetaminophen (a widely used analgesic and antipyretic) in saliva and sweat, using a surface-modified boron-doped diamond sensing interface (cross-validated with laboratory-based assays, R 2  0.94). Through integration of the engineered sensing interface within a custom-developed smartwatch, and augmentation with a dedicated analytical framework (for redox peak extraction), we realized a wearable solution to seamlessly render drug readouts with minute-level temporal resolution.

Several recent reports have described a series of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Some of these have been identified as variants of concern (VOCs), including alpha (B.1.1.7, Clade GRY), beta (B.1.351, Clade GH), gamma (P.1, Clade GR), and delta (B.1.617.2, Clade G). VOCs are likely to have some effect on transmissibility, antibody evasion, and changes in therapeutic or vaccine effectiveness. However, the physiological and virological understanding of these variants remains poor. We demonstrated that these four VOCs exhibited differences in plaque size, thermal stability at physiological temperature, and replication rates. The mean plaque size of beta was the largest, followed by those of gamma, delta, and alpha. Thermal stability, evaluated by measuring infectivity and half-life after prolonged incubation at physiological temperature, was correlated with plaque size in all variants except alpha. However, despite its relatively high thermal stability, alphas small plaque size resulted in lower replication rates and fewer progeny viruses. Our findings may inform further virological studies of SARS-CoV-2 variant characteristics, VOCs, and variants of interest.

Its rapid spread has overwhelmed populations in all corners of Latin-American countries resulting in individual psychological reactions that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE : This study reports on demographics, self-reported psychological disturbance and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic for the Peruvian population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses an online survey with snowball sampling that was conducted after the state of emergency was declared in Per (on April 2 nd ). The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used to identify somatic symptoms, incidence of anxiety/ insomnia, social dysfunction and depression and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) mapped personal strategies to address recent stress. RESULTS : 434 self-selected participants ranging in age from 18 to 68 years old (ME =33.87) completed the survey. The majority of participants were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), well-educated (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), employed (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). 40.8% reported psychological problems, expressing fear of coronavirus infection (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that women developed more somatic symptoms (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and greater anxiety/insomnia (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84) than men. Depression and social dysfunction were equally likely at any age. Educational status was protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (acceptance and social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems;passive strategies (such as denial, self-distraction, self-blame, disconnection, and emotional discharge) are more commonly reported. CONCLUSION: This study provides a better understanding of psychological disorders occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Peruvian population.

METHODS Thirteen subjects were tested before and after a vibration condition, and before and after a resting control condition. Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in dorsiflexion was measured. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was superimposed during MVCs to assess cortical voluntary activation (VATMS), motor-evoked potential amplitude (MEP) and cortical silent period length (CSP). MEP and CSP were also measured during 50 and 75 % MVC contractions. Spinal excitability was investigated by mean of H-reflex. RESULTS There were no vibration effects on MVC (p = 0.805), maximal EMG activity (p = 0.653), VATMS (p = 1), and CSP (p = 0.877). Vibration tended to decrease MEP amplitude (p = 0.117).

Hollow Prussian nanospheres have attracted much attention due to excellent near-infrared photothermal conversion effect and drug-loading capability within an empty cavity. However, to date, the hollow Prussian nanospheres have been prepared by a complex procedure or in organic media, and their shell thickness and size cannot be controlled. Thus, a simple and controllable route is highly desirable to synthesize hollow Prussian nanospheres with controllable parameters. Materials and Methods: Here, in our designed synthesis route, the traditional FeCl3 precursor was replaced with Fe2O3 nanospheres, and then the Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles were engineered into hollow-structured PB (HPB) nanospheres through an interface reaction, where the Fe2O3 colloidal template provides Fe3+ ions. The reaction mechanism and control factors of HPB nanospheres were systematically investigated. Both in vitro and in vivo biological effects of the as-synthesized HPB nanospheres were evaluated in detail. Results: Through systematical experiments, a solvent-mediated interface reaction mechanism was put forward, and the parameters of HPB nanospheres could be easily adjusted by growth time and template size under optimal water and ethanol ratio. The in vitro tests show the rapid and remarkable photothermal effects of the as-prepared HPB nanospheres under NIR laser irradiation (808 nm). Meanwhile, HPB nanospheres also demonstrated a high DOX loading capacity of 440 mg g-1 as a drug carrier, and the release of the drug can be regulated by the heat from PB shell under the exposure of an NIR laser. The in vivo experiments confirmed the outstanding performance of HPB nanospheres in photothermal/chemo-synergistic therapy of cancer. Conclusion: A solvent-mediated template route was developed to synthesize hollow Prussian blue (HPB) nanospheres in a simple and controllable way. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the as-synthesized HPB nanospheres as a promising candidate due to their low toxicity and high efficiency for cancer therapy.","output":"Hollow Prussian Blue Nanospheres for Photothermal/Chemo-Synergistic Therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To improve understanding of transition from viral infection to viral clearance, and antibody response in pediatric patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective analysis of children tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunoglobulin G antibody at a quaternary-care, free-standing pediatric hospital between March 13, 2020, and June 21, 2020, included 6369 patients who underwent PCR testing and 215 patients who underwent antibody testing. During the initial study period, testing focused primarily on symptomatic children; the later study period included asymptomatic patients who underwent testing as preadmission or preprocedural screening. We report the proportion of positive and negative tests, time to viral clearance, and time to seropositivity. RESULTS: The rate of positivity varied over time due to viral circulation in the community and transition from targeted testing of symptomatic patients to more universal screening of hospitalized patients. Median duration of viral shedding (RT-PCR positivity) was 19.5 days and time from RT-PCR positivity to negativity was 25 days. Of note, patients aged 6 through 15 years demonstrated a longer time of RT-PCR positivity to negativity, compared with patients aged 16 through 22 years (median 32 vs 18 days, P = .015). Median time to seropositivity, by chemiluminescent testing, from RT-PCR positivity was 18 days, whereas median time to reach adequate levels of neutralizing antibodies (defined as comparable with 160 titer by plaque reduction neutralization testing) was 36 days. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients demonstrated a prolonged period of viral shedding after infection with SARS CoV-2. It is unknown whether this correlates with persistent infectivity. Only 17 of 33 patients demonstrated adequate neutralizing antibodies during the time frame of specimen collection. It remains unknown whether immunoglobulin G antibody against spike structured proteins correlates with immunity, and how long antibodies and potential protection persist.","output":"Kinetics of Viral Clearance and Antibody Production Across Age Groups in Children with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To improve spatial resolution, current clinical shoulder cross-sectional imaging studies reduce the field of view of the shoulder, excluding the medial scapula border and preventing glenoid version measurement according to the Friedman method. Purpose: To evaluate a method to accurately and reliably measure glenoid version on cross-sectional shoulder images when the medial scapula border is not included in the field of view, and to establish measurements equivalent to the Friedman method. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Sixty-five scapulae underwent computed tomography (CT) scanning with an optimal shoulder CT-positioning protocol. Glenoid version was measured on CT images of the full scapula using the Friedman method. We developed a measurement method (named the Robertson method) based on the glenoid vault version from partial scapula images, with a correction angle subtracted from the articular-surface-glenoid vault measurement. Comparison with the Friedman method defined the accuracy of the Robertson method. Three observers tested inter- and intraobserver reliability of the Robertson method. Accuracy was statistically evaluated with t tests and reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The statistical distribution of glenoid version was similar to published data,-0.5  3 [mean  SD]. The initial measurement using the Robertson method resulted in a more retroverted angle compared with the Friedman method, and a correction angle of 7 was then applied. After this adjustment, the difference between the 2 methods was nonsignificant (0.1  4; P > .65). Reliability of the Robertson method was excellent, as the interrater ICC was 0.77, the standard error of measurement (SEM) was 1.1 with P < .001. The intrarater ICC ranged between 0.84 and 0.92, the SEM ranged between 0.9 and 1.2 with P < .01. Conclusion: A validated glenoid version measurement method is now available for current clinical shoulder CT protocols that reliably create Friedman-equivalent values.

This paper explores patient perceptions of non-attendance among those experiencing poverty in a rural U.S county to better inform providers to the context in which their patients make attendance-related decisions. METHODS: Using a grounded theory approach, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 U.S. low-income adults in the rural Western U.S. who recurrently missed primary care appointments. We also used a questionnaire to assess individual characteristics related to health, resiliency, personal mastery, medical mistrust, life chaos, and adverse childhood experiences. RESULTS: Participants identified 3 barriers to attending appointments: appointment disinterest, competing demands, and insufficient systems. Appointment disinterest stemmed from physical and mental health issues, misalignment between needs and treatment, and comfort with the provider. Competing demands included family responsibilities, employment, and relationships. Finally, participants reported that current scheduling and transportation systems were helpful but insufficient. To provide further context, participants also reported low overall health, moderate levels of medical mistrust, life chaos, and mastery, moderate to low resilience, and very a high number of adverse childhood experiences.

The aim was to establish standardized tractography of language pathways as a predictor of language outcome in clinical neurosurgery. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed 50 surgical cases of patients with left perisylvian, diffuse gliomas. Standardized preoperative Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI)-based tractography of the 5 main language tracts (Arcuate Fasciculus [AF], Frontal Aslant Tract [FAT], Inferior Fronto-Occipital Fasciculus [IFOF], Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus [ILF], Uncinate Fasciculus [UF]) and spatial analysis of tumor and tracts was performed. Postoperative imaging and the resulting resection map were analyzed for potential surgical injury of tracts. The language status was assessed preoperatively, postoperatively and after 3 months using the Aachen Aphasia Test and Berlin Aphasia Score. Correlation analyses, two-step cluster analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyze associations of tractography results with language outcome after surgery. RESULTS: In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), new aphasic symptoms were detected 3 months after surgery. The preoperative infiltration of the AF was associated with functional worsening (cc = 0.314; p = 0.019). Cluster analysis of tract injury profiles revealed two areas particularly related to aphasia: the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (TPO; temporo-parietal AF, middle IFOF, middle ILF) and the temporal stem/peri-insular white matter (middle IFOF, anterior ILF, temporal UF, temporal AF).

Vero cells were used in antiviral assays, submitted to ZIKV and CHIKV, and treated with different concentrations of C. cervicornis extract or dolastane.

However, the isolated dolastane showed a more significant and promising inhibitory effect (EC(50) = 0.95 M for ZIKV and 1.3 M for CHIKV) when compared to both the crude extract and ribavirin, which was used as control. Also, the dolastane showed a very potent virucidal activity against CHIKV and was able to inhibit around 90% of the virus infectivity at 10 M. For the ZIKV, the effects were somewhat lower, although interesting, at approximately 64% in this same concentration. Further, we observed that both the extract and the dolastane were able to inhibit the replication of ZIKV and CHIKV at different times of addition post-infection, remaining efficient even if added after 8 hours post-infection, but declining soon after. A synergistic effect using sub-doses of the extract and isolates was associated with ribavirin, inhibiting above 80% replication even at the lowest concentrations.

Further examination demonstrated that poly(A) tail binding by the N protein negatively regulates translation of coronaviral RNA and host mRNA both in vitro and in cells. Although the N protein can interact with PABP and eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), the poor interaction efficiency between the poly(A)-bound N protein and eIF4E may explain the observed decreased translation efficiency. In addition to interaction with translation factor eIF4G, the N protein is able to interact with coronavirus nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9), a replicase protein required for replication. The study demonstrates interactions among the poly(A) tail, N protein, and PABP both in vitro and in infected cells. Of the interactions, binding of the poly(A) tail to N protein decreases the interaction efficiency between the poly(A) tail and eIF4E, leading to translation inhibition. The poly(A)-dependent translation inhibition by N protein has not been previously demonstrated and thus extends our understanding of coronavirus gene expression.IMPORTANCE Gene expression in coronavirus is a complicated and dynamic process. In this study, we demonstrated that coronavirus N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail with high affinity, establishing N protein as a PABP. We also show how the interplay between coronavirus 3' poly(A) tail, PABP, and N protein regulates gene expression of the coronavirus and host cell. Of the interactions, poly(A) tail binding by the N protein negatively regulates translation, and to our knowledge, this inhibition of translation by binding of the N protein to poly(A) tail has not been previously studied. Accordingly, the study provides fundamental molecular details regarding coronavirus infection and expands our knowledge of coronavirus gene expression.","output":"Interplay between the Poly(A) Tail, Poly(A)-Binding Protein, and Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein Regulates Gene Expression of Coronavirus and the Host Cell."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Metal ions and other elements play many different critical roles in all biological processes. They can be especially important in high concentrations for the functioning of organisms living in seawater. It is important to understand how much the concentrations of different trace elements in such organisms can be higher than in seawater. Some marine organisms capable of rapid recovery after different injuries are fascinating in this regard. Sea cucumbers Eupentacta fraudatrix can completely restore all organs and the whole body within several weeks after their division into two parts. Here, for the first time, a comparison of the content of different elements in seawater, sea cucumber, and its very stable multiprotein complex (2000 kDa) was performed using two-jet plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Among the 18 elements we found in sea cucumbers, seawater contained only six elements in detectable amounts, and their content decreased in the following order: Mg > Ca > B > Sr  Si > Cr (0.13-930 g/g of seawater). The content of these elements in sea cucumbers was higher compared with seawater (-fold): Ca (714) > Sr (459) > Cr (75) > Si (42)> B (12) > Mg (6.9). Only four of them had a higher concentration in the protein complex than in seawater (-fold): Si (120.0) > Cr (31.5) > Ca (9.1) > Sr (8.8). The contents of Mg and B were lower in the protein complex than in seawater. The content of elements additionally found in sea cucumbers decreased in the order (g/g of powder) of P (1100) > Fe (47) > Mn (26) > Ba (15) > Zn (13) > Al (9.3) > Mo (2.8) > Cu (1.4) > Cd (0.3), and in the protein complex, in the order of P (290) > Zn (51) > Fe (23) > Al (14)  Ni (13) > Cu (7.5) > Ba (2.5)  Co (2.0)  Mn (1.6) > Cd (0.7) >Ag (0.2).

This prospective study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of catheter removal on postoperative day (POD) 2 versus POD 4 after LRP and its impact on urinary continence outcomes. METHODS One hundred and thirteen patients underwent LRP and were prospectively randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 57) had the urinary catheter removed on POD 2 while group 2 (n = 56) had the catheter removed on POD 4. The urine loss ratio (ULR) was defined as the weight of urine loss in the pad divided by the daily micturition volume. Continence was defined as a pad-free status. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in clinical features between groups 1 and 2. Acute urinary retention (AUR) after catheter removal occurred in 21 patients (18.6%) (13 (22.8%) in group 1 and 8 (14.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.244). The first-day mean ULR values were 1.16  4.95 in group 1 and 1.02  3.27 in group 2 (p = 0.870). The last-day mean ULR values were 0.57  1.60 in group 1 and 2.78  15.49 in group 2 (p = 0.353).

In AUR cases, continence rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 0, 23.1, 38.5, and 54.5% in group 1 and 37.5, 75.0, 87.5, and 87.5% in group 2 (p = 0.017, 0.020, 0.027, and 0.127, respectively). A multivariate analysis identified AUR after catheter removal on POD 2 as the only predictive factor for incontinence 6 and 9 months after LRP (p = 0.030 and 0.018, respectively).

Innovative approaches are needed to address gaps in retention in treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Mobile health (mHealth) approaches have shown improvement in engagement in care and associated clinical outcomes for a variety of chronic diseases, but mHealth tools designed specifically to support patients treated with MOUD are limited. METHODS: Following user-centered development and testing phases, a multi-feature smartphone application called HOPE (Heal. Overcome. Persist. Endure) was piloted in a small cohort of patients receiving MOUD and at high risk of disengagement in care at an office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) clinic in Central Virginia. Outcomes were tracked over a six-month period following patient enrollment. They included retention in care at the OBOT clinic, usage of various features of the application, and self-rated measures of mental health, substance use, treatment and recovery. RESULTS: Of the 25 participants in the HOPE pilot study, a majority were retained in care at 6 months (56%). Uptake of bi-directional features including messaging with providers and daily check-ins of mood, stress and medication adherence peaked at one month, and usage persisted through the sixth month. Patients who reported that distance to clinic was a problem at baseline had higher loss to follow up compared to those without distance as a reported barrier (67% vs 23%, p = 0.03). Patients lost to in-person clinic follow up continued to engage with one or more app features, indicating that mHealth approaches may bridge barriers to clinic visit attendance. Participants surveyed at baseline and 6 months (N = 16) scored higher on scales related to overall self-control and self-efficacy related to drug abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: A pilot study of a novel multi-feature smartphone application to support OUD treatment showed acceptable retention in care and patient usage at 6 months.

This study examines the effects of a mixed-nutrient or high-fat liquid meal on the postprandial stimulation of GLP-1 and PYY following gastric bypass or equivalent hypocaloric diet. METHODS Total PYY and active GLP-1 were measured fasting and at multiple points after standardized mixed-nutrient and high-fat liquid meals in two matched groups of obese subjects. The meal stimulation tests were performed before and 14.6  3.3 days after gastric bypass (GBP, n = 10) and before and after a 7-day hypocaloric liquid diet matching the post-GBP diet (control, n = 10). RESULTS Mixed-nutrient and high-fat postprandial GLP-1 levels increased following GBP (mixed-nutrient peak: 85.0  28.6-323  51 pg/ml, P < 0.01; high-fat peak: 81.8  9.6-278  49 pg/ml, P < 0.01), but not after diet (mixed-nutrient peak: 104.4  9.4-114.9  15.8 pg/ml, P = NS; high-fat peak: 118.1  16.4-104.4  10.8 pg/ml, P = NS). The postprandial PYY response also increased after GBP but not diet, though the increase in peak PYY did not reach statistical significance (GBP mixed-nutrient peak: 134.8  26.0-220.7  52.9 pg/ml, P = 0.09; GBP high-fat peak: 142.1  34.6-197.9  12.7 pg/ml, P = 0.07; diet mixed-nutrient peak: 99.8  8.0-101.1  13.3 pg/ml, P = NS; diet high-fat peak: 105.0  8.8-103.1  11.8 pg/ml, P = NS). The postprandial GLP-1 response was not affected by the macronutrient content of the meal.

A phase 1 clinical trial was done in Mali, west Africa, to assess the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of a three-dose regimen of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) Vaccine (a metabolically active, non-replicating, whole malaria sporozoite vaccine) against homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) and natural P falciparum infection. METHODS: We recruited healthy non-pregnant adults aged 18-50 years in Dongubougou, Mali, and surrounding villages (Banambani, Toubana, Torodo, Sirababougou, Zorokoro) for an open-label, dose-escalation pilot study and, thereafter, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled main trial. Pilot study participants were enrolled on an as-available basis to one group of CHMI infectivity controls and three staggered vaccine groups receiving: one dose of 45  105, one dose of 9  105, or three doses of 18  106 PfSPZ via direct venous inoculation at approximately 8 week intervals, followed by homologous CHMI 5 weeks later with infectious PfSPZ by direct venous inoculation (PfSPZ Challenge). Main cohort participants were stratified by village and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three doses of 18  106 PfSPZ or normal saline at 1, 13, and 19 week intervals using permuted block design by the study statistician. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability of at least one vaccine dose; the secondary outcome was vaccine efficacy against homologous PfSPZ CHMI (pilot study) or against naturally transmitted P falciparum infection (main study) measured by thick blood smear. Combined artesunate and amodiaquine was administered to eliminate pre-existing parasitaemia. Outcomes were analysed by modified intention to treat (mITT; including all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product; safety and vaccine efficacy) and per protocol (vaccine efficacy). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02627456. FINDINGS: Between Dec 20, 2015, and April 30, 2016, we enrolled 56 participants into the pilot study (five received the 45  105 dose, five received 9  105, 30 received 18  106, 15 were CHMI controls, and one withdrew before vaccination) and 120 participants into the main study cohort with 60 participants assigned PfSPZ Vaccine and 60 placebo in the main study. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities post-vaccination in all dosing groups were few, mainly mild, and did not differ significantly between vaccine groups (all p>005). Unexpected severe transaminitis occured in four participants: one participant in pilot phase that received 18  106 PfSPZ Vaccine, one participant in main phase that received 18  106 PfSPZ Vaccine, and two participants in the main phase placebo group. During PfSPZ CHMI, approximately 5 weeks after the third dose of 18  106 PfSPZ, none of 29 vaccinees and one of 15 controls became positive on thick blood smear; subsequent post-hoc PCR analysis for submicroscopic blood stage infections detected P falciparum parasites in none of the 29 vaccine recipients and eight of 15 controls during CHMI. In the main trial, 32 (58%) of 55 vaccine recipients and 42 (78%) of 54 controls became positive on thick blood smear during 24-week surveillance after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy (1-hazard ratio) was 051 per protocol (95% CI 020-070; log-rank p=00042) and 039 by mITT (004-062; p=0033); vaccine efficacy (1-risk ratio) was 024 per-protocol (002-041; p=0031) and 022 mITT (001-039; p=0041).

A study focused on the early COVID-19 pandemic consequences on mental health found that participants reporting a current mental disorder were experiencing the greatest psychological impact, followed by those reporting a past mental disorder [2]. We hypothesize that having suffered or suffering from a depressive or anxiety disorder at that time can lead to maladaptive responses during the pandemic and social restrictions. Aims of the study: To describe the psychological impact among patients with a current or past diagnosis of Common Mental Disorders (CMD;anxiety and depressive disorders) after six months of the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 1. To explore risk and protective factors associated with a Severe Psychological Impact (SPI). Methods: Cross-sectional survey. A self-reported online test was completed by the participants during the pandemic from October 14th to November 8th, 2020, from all over the Spanish territory. From the sample (N=5900), 1122 (19.02%) reported suffering from CMD in the past or at the moment the study was conducted (mean ageSD=46.01 14.12 years) The Spanish version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used to evaluate the maladaptive psychological responses. Psychological impact in CMD was classified according to the number of maladaptive responses in the DASS-21 scale, considering: mild (1 response), moderate (2 responses) and severe (3 responses). Statistical analyses: Chi-square, t-student test (IBM SPSS version 24 was used for data analyses). The p-value was set at <0.05. Results: Women represented 70.1% of the sample. Approximately half of the participants were married or were living with a cohabiting partner (55.8%). Most of the responders had completed university studies (69.6%). From the sample, 1240 participants (21%) had a somatic disease (12% hypertension and 10.8% chronic respiratory disease). 16.1% increased their alcohol consumption and 14.1% increased their tobacco consumption. CMD reported the highest psychological impact on Depressive DASS-21 subscale (59.5% 2=206.6, p<0.001), followed by Stress subscale (38.6, 2= 482.2, p<0.001) and Anxiety subscale (31.3, 2= 204.7, p<0.001). According to copying strategies, a high percentage of patients with CMD reported being able to enjoy leisure time (88.1%). Reading or listening to music were the most frequent activities (87.8%). 20.7% of the sample showed a SPI. Considering the statistically significant variables, a logistic regression analysis was obtained. On the one hand, older age (B=-0.03, OR=0.972, p<0.001), male sex (B=-0.6, OR=0.55, p=0.008), university studies (B=-0.43, OR=0.652, p=0.008) and being able to enjoy leisure time (B=-1.1, OR=0.341, p<0.001) were protective factors of SPI. On the other hand, having a somatic illness (B=0.59, OR=1.797, p<0.001) and the increase in tobacco use (B=0.58, OR=1.778, p=0.005) were factors associated with SPI. Conclusions: This study illustrates the psychological impact in CMD after half-year of the COVID-19 outbreak. Being young, a woman, suffering from somatic illness, and not having a university education are risk factors for SPI. However, being able to enjoy leisure time is the main protective factor against a SPI in CMD.

RESULTS: All patients presented with various main complaints such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. An increase in D-dimer value was found in all cases, with an increase of 4C5 times from the upper limit of normal. All patients were evaluated with the IMPROVE-VTE and PADUA thrombotic risk assessment models. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin LMWH intensive dosage was given to four patients. However, one patient was not given thromboprophylaxis because of the high risk of bleeding. All cases were not given long-term thromboprophylaxis after the patients were discharged from the hospital. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients can be considered to give thromboprophylaxis unless contraindicated. Thromboprophylaxis is preferable to use LMWH with a dose adjusted to the severity of COVID-19.

Key findings include: 1) differential expression of HSD17B isoforms among tissues (HSD17B1 high in the chorioallantois, while HSD17B2 is the dominant form in the endometrium) 2) a novel isoform with homology to SULT1A1 is the predominant sulfotransferase transcript in the chorioallantois; and 3) nuclear estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) and progesterone (PGR) expression is minimal to nonexistant in the chorioallantois and pregnant endometrium. Additionally, several hypotheses have been formed, including the possibility that the 45-day chorioallantois is able to synthesize steroids de novo from acetate and that horses utilize glucuronidation to clear estrogens from the endometrium during estrous, but not during pregnancy. In summary, these findings represent an in-depth look at equine steroid-related transcripts through gestation, providing novel hypotheses and future directions for equine endocrine research.","output":"New insights in equine steroidogenesis: an in-depth look at steroid signaling in the placenta"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development and use of digital health technology have increased during the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected. OBJECTIVE: To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease. STUDY DESIGN: We describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison). CONCLUSION: We report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease.

Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing 'red zones' need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS In all Italian provinces, a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities.

METHODS We used a case-control study design, where we analyzed the bacterial composition of 10 failed ACL reconstructions and compared it to 10 native ACL's harvested during total knee arthroplasty. The IBIS Universal Biosensor was used to determine the nature of bacteria on ACL specimens, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to visualize bacteria in a subset of cases. RESULTS Bacteria are present in failed ACL reconstructions. Bacteria are present in ACL's harvested during total knee arthroplasty, but the nature of the species differs significantly between experimental and control sets. Twelve genera were detected in the experimental set (in both allografts and autografts), and in four samples multiple species were detected.

The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.218.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ?=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care.

Recent studies confirm that natural selection is the dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, which favors mutations that strengthen viral infectivity. We demonstrate that vaccine-breakthrough or antibody-resistant mutations provide a new mechanism of viral evolution. Specifically, vaccine-resistant mutation Y449S in the spike (S) protein receptor-bonding domain (RBD), which occurred in co-mutation [Y449S, N501Y], has reduced infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 but can disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus. By tracing the evolutionary trajectories of vaccine-resistant mutations in over 1.9 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reveal that the occurrence and frequency of vaccine-resistant mutations correlate strongly with the vaccination rates in Europe and America. We anticipate that as a complementary transmission pathway, vaccine-resistant mutations will become a dominating mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 evolution when most of the worlds population is vaccinated. Our study sheds light on SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission and enables the design of the next-generation mutation-proof vaccines and antibody drugs.","output":"The evolution of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 evolution revealing vaccine-resistant mutations in Europe and America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, social media has promptly become an essential communication tool for institutions and organizations to generate and disseminate information as well as building effective dialogue with the public. In this regard, it was vital for technoparks like many other organizations to effectively manage their social media accounts in order to inform and communicate with their stakeholders. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate how technoparks in Turkey used their social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) during the first three months of the Covid-19 pandemic to facilitate dialogic communication with stakeholders, and to present the quality index of technoparks in terms of dialogic communication in social media management. In line with this aim, a content analysis of social media profiles maintained by 70 active technoparks examines the use of dialogic features originally developed in Dialogic Communication Theory. Results indicate that technoparks could not fully utilize the dialogic features of the social media platforms and that they mostly preferred to manage their social media platforms to disseminate information, which means they were away from dialogue.

It has been proposed that the environmental and immune pressures associated with different contexts of infection have different consequences for the associated bacterial populations, affecting drug susceptibility and the emergence of resistance. However, there is little concrete evidence for this model. We prospectively collected sputum samples from 18 newly diagnosed and treatment-na?ve patients with tuberculosis and sequenced 795 colony-derived Mtb isolates. Mutant accumulation rates varied considerably between different bacilli isolated from the same individual, and where high rates of mutation were observed, the mutational spectrum was consistent with reactive oxygen species-induced mutagenesis. Elevated bacterial mutation rates were identified in isolates from HIV-negative but not HIV-positive individuals, suggesting that they were immune-driven. These results support the model that mutagenesis of Mtb in vivo is modulated by the host environment, which could drive the emergence of variants associated with drug resistance in a host-dependent manner.","output":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates carry mutational signatures of host immune environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The obstruction of traffic between France and UK due to efforts to rein in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), together with the recent, week-long blockade of the Suez Canal, underline how interconnected and thus vulnerable the world has become.

The objective of this study was to assess the changes in lecture methods and lab materials used in anatomy courses that ran between May-August (T1) and August-December (T2) 2020 responding to Covid-19 restrictions. Materials/Methods A survey was distributed to anatomy educators through professional associations from June-November 2020. Respondents indicated (1) their institution;(2) programs taught (professional health (PH), medicine (MED), or undergraduate (UG));(3) course type (integrated or stand-alone);(4) percentage of lab time before and during Covid-19 that utilized cadaveric, plastic, and/or other teaching materials;and (5) lecture format. Institutions were classified as public or private via institution websites. Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction compared responses before and during Covid-19 across programs, course type, and institution. Data are presented as percent increase (+value) or decrease (-value). Alpha&lt;5%. Results T1 and T2 received 67 and 191 responses, respectively. During T1 and T2, cadaver use decreased in PH (-58% stand-alone (-58% and private (-49% P=0.033). During T1 and T2, use of other teaching materials increased in PH (+1180% stand-alone (+920% and private (+1233% & +667%, P&lt;0.001) and public (+415% & +400%, P&lt;0.001) institutions.

Therefore, the medical records of all bitches that were spayed using a laparoscopic single port ovariectomy with an operating laparoscope between November 2007 and November 2014 were reviewed. A minimum follow-up period of 12 months was required for study inclusion. One hundred and thirty two adult, healthy, femal dogs were included in our study. The information collected included breed, bodyweight, age at ovariectomy and postoperative complications detected during follow-up 9-14 days after surgery. Furthermore, an electronic questionnaire was implemented, and the owners of the dogs were asked to report on long-term complications and to retrospectively evaluate postoperative pain and overall satisfaction. Sixty-two different and mixed breed dogs with weights ranging from 1.9 to 50 kg and ages ranging from 0.5 to 10.8 years were included. Short-term complications were detected in 21 out of 132 cases, mostly at the surgical site (15.9 per cent). According to our questionnaire (n=65), 10 dogs developed urinary incontinence categorised as a major complication (15.4 per cent). The owner's evaluated pain score was less than 300 on a 1000-unit visual analogue scale for 56 out of 65 dogs (86.2 per cent) and less than 500 in 63 dogs (96.9 per cent). The dog owners' satisfaction rate was 95.3 per cent (87.5 per cent evaluated the surgery as excellent and 7.8 per cent as good). Altogether, our study suggests that single port access using an operating laparoscope for ovariectomy has minor complication rates comparable to other laparoscopic techniques but has the advantages of a low postoperative pain level as evaluated by the owner and a very high owner's satisfaction rate.","output":"Postoperative complications and owner assessment of single portal laparoscopic ovariectomy in dogs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS To determine the symptomatic and prognostic differences resulting from a novel diagnostic pathway based on cardiac computerized tomography (CT) compared with the traditional exercise stress electrocardiography test (EST) in stable chest pain patients. METHODS AND RESULTS A prospective randomized controlled trial compared selected patient outcomes in EST and cardiac CT coronary angiography groups. Five hundred patients with troponin-negative stable chest pain and without known coronary artery disease were recruited. Patients completed the Seattle Angina Questionnaires (SAQ) at baseline, 3, and 12 months to assess angina symptoms. Patients were also followed for management strategies and clinical events. Over the year 12 patients withdrew, resulting in 245 in the EST cohort and 243 in the CT cohort. There was no significant difference in baseline demographics. The CT arm had a statistical difference in angina stability and quality-of-life domains of the SAQ at 3 and12 months, suggesting less angina compared with the EST arm. In the CT arm, there was more significant disease identified and more revascularizations. Significantly, more inconclusive results were seen in the EST arm with a higher number of additional investigations ordered. There was also a longer mean time to management. There were no differences in major adverse cardiac events between the cohorts. At 1 year in the EST arm, there were more Accident and Emergency (A&E) attendances and cardiac admission. CONCLUSION Cardiac CT as an index investigation for stable chest pain improved angina symptoms and resulted in fewer investigations and re-hospitalizations compared with EST.

RESULTS We observed exceptional correlation profiles (r > 0.700, p < 10-5 in most cases) of RBC osmotic fragility in the ensemble of samples, as well as in subgroups characterized by distinct genetic backgrounds (sex, beta-thalassemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) and storage strategies (additive solutions, whole blood, RBC concentrates). The mean corpuscular fragility (MCF) of fresh and stored RBCs at each storage time significantly correlated with the MCF of stored RBCs measured at all subsequent time points of the storage period (e.g., MCF values of storage day 21 correlated with those of storage days 28, 35 and 42). A similar correlation profile was also observed between the osmotic hemolysis of fresh/stored RBCs before and following in vitro reconstitution in plasma from healthy controls or beta-thalassemia patients.

The etiology is hypothesized to be related to thrombotic vasculopathy based on lesional biopsy specimen findings, but the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy is not completely understood. Here, we present a case of a retiform purpuric patch on the sacrum/buttocks in a hospitalized patient prior to subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19 and an eventual fatal disease course. Two lesional biopsy specimens at different time points in the disease course revealed thrombotic vasculopathy, despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Detailed histopathologic evaluation using immunohistochemical markers suggest the etiology of the vasculopathy involves both persistent complement activation and platelet aggregation, which possibly promote ongoing thrombus formation. This case highlights that sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may be a presenting sign of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and may represent an ominous sign supporting a future severe disease course. In addition, biopsy specimen findings at separate time points demonstrate that cutaneous vasculopathy may persist despite adequate systemic anticoagulation, possibly due to the combination of persistent complement and platelet activation. Finally, occlusive thrombi in sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may contribute to future ulceration and significant cutaneous morbidity in patients who survive COVID-19.","output":"Development of sacral/buttock retiform purpura as an ominous presenting sign of COVID-19 and clinical and histopathologic evolution during severe disease course"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main focus of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is pulmonary complications through virus-related neurological manifestations, ranging from mild to severe, such as encephalitis, cerebral thrombosis, neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and delirium.

Here, we combine high-throughput promoter activity measurements and large-scale genomic analysis of regulatory regions to investigate the cross-compatibility of regulatory elements (REs) in bacteria. Functional characterization of thousands of natural REs in three distinct bacterial species revealed distinct expression patterns according to RE and recipient phylogeny. Host capacity to activate foreign promoters was proportional to their genomic GC content, while many low GC regulatory elements were both broadly active and had more transcription start sites across hosts. The difference in expression capabilities could be explained by the influence of the host GC content on the stringency of the AT-rich canonical 70 motif necessary for transcription initiation. We further confirm the generalizability of this model and find widespread GC content adaptation of the 70 motif in a set of 1,545 genomes from all major bacterial phyla.

Data abstracted from verdict reports included year, state, court type, defendant specialty, procedure performed, claimed injuries and liabilities, verdict, and damage amount awarded. Sixty-one cases across 25 states were identified, 16 cases between 2006 and 2013, and 45 from 2014 to 2021. Among those 45 cases, defendant verdicts predominated (n = 35, 77.8%), with only four plaintiff verdicts (8.9%) and six settlements (13.3%). Overall, 169 liabilities were claimed, most commonly negligent surgery (82.2%), misdiagnosis/failure to diagnose (46.7%), delayed treatment (35.6%), and lack of informed consent (31.1%). Thirteen cases resulted in indemnity payments (mean = $1,251,274), with damages ranging from $10,087 (infection and retained foreign body) to $5,008,922 (patient death). Hysterectomy (n = 19, 42.2%) was the most commonly litigated surgery, followed by prostatectomy (n = 5) and hernia repair (n = 4).

There were 2,747 primary infections and 210 reinfections between 07/12/2020 and 21/09/2021. Adjusted VE (aVE) decreased from 81% (95% CI 68%-89%) 14-73 days after dose-2 to 46% (95% CI 22%-63%) >6-months; with no significant difference for short-interval BNT162b2 but significantly lower aVE (50% (95% CI 18%-70%) 14-73 days after dose-2 from ChAdOx1. Protection from infection-acquired immunity showed evidence of waning in unvaccinated follow-up but remained consistently over 90% in those who received two doses of vaccine, even in those infected over 15-months ago. Conclusion Two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination induce high short-term protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which wanes significantly after six months. Infection-acquired immunity boosted with vaccination remains high over a year after infection. Boosters will be essential to maintain protection in vaccinees who have not had primary infection to reduce infection and transmission in this population.

Alcohol misuse varies across the US and is related to poorer health and comorbidities that likely affect the severity of COVID-19 infection. High levels of pre-pandemic alcohol misuse in some counties may have set the stage for worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, this relationship may depend on how rural a county is, as access to healthcare in rural communities has lagged behind more urban areas. The objective of this study was to test for associations between county-level COVID-19 mortality, pre-pandemic county-level excessive drinking, and county rurality. METHOD: We used national COVID-19 data from the New York Times to calculate county-level case fatality rates (n = 3,039 counties and county equivalents; October 1 CDecember 31, 2020) and other external county-level data sources for indicators of rurality and health. We used beta regression to model case fatality rates, adjusted for several county-level population characteristics. We included a multilevel component to our model and defined state as a random intercept. Our focal predictor was a single variable representing nine possible combinations of low/mid/high alcohol misuse and low/mid/high rurality. RESULTS: The median county-level COVID-19 case fatality rate was 1.57%. Compared to counties with low alcohol misuse and low rurality (referent), counties with high levels of alcohol and mid ( = -0.17, p = 0.008) or high levels of rurality ( = -0.24, p<0.001) demonstrated significantly lower case fatality rates.

Little is known about the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with rare endocrine malignancies, such as pituitary carcinoma. We describe the case of a 43-year-old patient with adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting pituitary carcinoma who developed a severe COVID-19 infection. He had stabilized Cushings disease after multiple lines of treatment and was currently receiving maintenance immunotherapy with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and steroidogenesis inhibition with ketoconazole (800 mg daily). On admission, he was urgently intubated for respiratory exhaustion. Supplementation of corticosteroid requirements consisted of high-dose dexamethasone, in analogy with the RECOVERY trial, followed by the reintroduction of ketoconazole under the coverage of a hydrocortisone stress regimen, which was continued at a dose depending on the current level of stress. He had a prolonged and complicated stay at the intensive care unit but was eventually discharged and able to continue his rehabilitation. The case points out that multiple risk factors for severe COVID-19 are present in patients with Cushings syndrome. Block-replacement therapy with suppression of endogenous steroidogenesis and supplementation of corticosteroid requirements might be preferred in this patient population. LEARNING POINTS: Comorbidities for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are frequently present in patients with Cushings syndrome. Block-replacement with suppression of endogenous steroidogenesis and supplementation of corticosteroid requirements might be preferred to reduce the need for biochemical monitoring and avoid adrenal insufficiency. The optimal corticosteroid dose/choice for COVID-19 is unclear, especially in patients with endogenous glucocorticoid excess. First-line surgery vs initial disease control with steroidogenesis inhibitors for Cushings disease should be discussed depending on the current healthcare situation.","output":"COVID-19 and Cushings disease in a patient with ACTH-secreting pituitary carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, digital epidemiology has been proposed to comple-ment traditional reporting and surveillance systems.

Attachment is the first step in viral life cycle, which is dependent on the interactions of virions with extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Studying this process will help in understanding virus infection and controlling viral diseases. In this study, the roles of primary ECM components in TFV attachment were investigated. The results on the kinetics of virus attachment showed successful TFV attachment to the cell surface as a relatively rapid process after the TFV was used to inoculate cells for 10a?mina?at 4a?C. Western blot and quantitative PCR analysis results showed that soluble fibronectin, collagen IV, laminin, or hyaluronic acid treatment with TFV caused no significant effect on virus attachment. Soluble heparin, heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate A/B could inhibit TFV attachment in a dose-dependent manner. Enzymic digestion by cell surface heparin/heparan sulfate using heparinase I, II, and III could significantly prevent TFV attachment, suggesting that heparan sulfate plays an important role in TFV attachment. Furthermore, the binding assays of heparin-agarose beads and virion showed that TFV virions specifically bound with heparin in a dose-dependent manner. Given that heparin is a structural analogue of heparan sulfate, the above results suggest that heparan sulfate might serve as an attachment factor of TFV infection.

We conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) using wave 2 data to identify our outcome, patterns of 10 COVID-preventive behaviors (e.g., wearing a facemask, handwashing, social distancing), and then used a three-step regression (R3STEP) to test associations between the likelihood of class membership with (1) health beliefs and sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment) in bivariate models and (2) health beliefs adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics in multivariate models. The LCA identified a three-class model of preventive behaviors characterized by high likelihood of engagement in the set of preventive behaviors (high), low likelihood of the preventive behaviors (low), or engagement in some behaviors (mixed). Respondents of older age (i.e., age 50 or older) and those with higher levels of educational attainment (i.e., a 4-year college degree or higher) were less likely to be in the low engagement versus the mixed engagement class compared to those who are younger (18C29) and have lower levels of educational attainment (i.e., high school), respectively.

We report rapid early detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), comparing it to the serostatus of convalescent infection, at an Austrian National Sentinel Surveillance Practice in an isolated ski-resort serving a population of 22,829 people. Methods Retrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection) vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR (late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute infection. Findings All 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded. RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8 days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively.

This work principally aimed at defining a realistic temporal relationship between vaccination and myocarditis/pericarditis development. METHODS: All relevant cases reported from week 52/2020 through week 41/2021 in the VAERS database were retrieved and analyzed for licensed vaccines. These included BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and AD26.COV2S. Incidence rates were calculated using the corresponding administered vaccine doses as denominators. Additionally, analyzed parameters included demographics, dose series, hospitalization length and outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 2016 myocarditis and 1380 pericarditis cases, (4.96/10(6) and 3.40/10(6) administered vaccine doses, respectively), were recorded. Most myocarditis cases occurred following BNT162b2 (5.60/10(6) doses) in males <30 years.

In particular, quarantine measures have been related to negative psychological effects, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, anxiety, and depression (1). This rise in mental health disorders might be even worse among people more vulnerable to psychological stress such as patients suffering from chronic rheumatic diseases (RDs). Objectives: The present Italian nationwide survey engages patients with rheumatic conditions through eleven associations of RD patients. It is conducted to establish the COVID-19 related self-reported poor mental health symptoms and to identify potential factors associated with these concerns among RDs who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in Italy. Methods: We collected data from May to September 2020 from RD patients living in Italy during the COVID-19 quarantine by an ad-hoc online survey. By using their mailing list and the related webpage and social network, eleven patients' associations sent a call to RD patients asking them to complete an anonymous online survey which included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Impact Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). 2 tests were performed to detect statistically significant differences in both rating scale scores between groups defined by qualitative variables. Correlation analyses were realized with quantitative variables and rating scale scores. Variables significant in univariate analyses were then inserted in multivariate regression models. Results: In total, 507 RD patients completed to the survey. 375 (73.9%) patients had inflammatory arthritis (243 rheumatoid arthritis, 76 psoriatic arthritis, 49 ankylosing spondylitis, and 7 Still's disease), and 96 (18.9%) with connective tissue diseases or systemic vasculitis. 31 (6.1%) patients had primary fibromyalgia and 5 osteoarthritis or crystal arthropathies. Self-reported major sources of anxiety are reported in the Figure 1 below. The mean (SD) scores of the PSS-10 and the IES-R were 18.1  8.1 and 29.7  17.5, respectively. With regard to the IES-R subscale scores, the total sample did not show a prominence of one of the three main domains (intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal). Higher PSS scores were significantly associated with younger age (p<0.01), female gender (p<0.01), living outside Lombardy (p=0.03), presence of overweight/obesity (p=0.01), ongoing psychopharmacotherapy (p<0.01), and anxiety for loss of incomes (p<0.01). Female gender (p<0.01) and living outside Lombardy (p=0.02) were associated also with higher IES-R scores, together with the presence of intestinal diseases (p=0.03), anxiety disorders (p<0.01), and worries about health (p<0.01). Conclusion: This nationwide study revealed a high impact of self-reported distress, anxiety, and perceived stress among rheumatic patients after confinement during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Different factors were found to be predictive of poor mental health such as having female gender, younger age, living outside Lombardy, having overweight/obesity, or intestinal diseases, having a history of psychiatric symptoms (e.g. anxiety). Moreover, the lockdown experience worsened psychiatric symptoms and increased the assumption of psychopharmacotherapy in this vulnerable population.

Although such equipment mainly cause damage to the retina, the specific pathogenesis has not been systematically elucidated.

We used a white light-emitting diode source to establish a mouse model of retinal light damage and observed significant changes of retinal structure and an impairment of visual function. Further experiments revealed that dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated excessive mitochondrial fission induced overproduction of reactive oxygen species in the retinal cells, leading to apoptosis, activation of microglia, and formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This, in turn, triggered a series of inflammatory cascade reactions, leading to pyroptosis. We also carried out red light and Drp1 inhibitor treatment and found that retinal damage and the decline in visual function caused by white light could be partially ameliorated.

This randomized controlled clinical trial evaluated the clinical efficacy and prognosis of Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills and Lianhua Qingwen granules in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 283 patients participated in this clinical trial, and participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1) Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills and Lianhua Qingwen granules or 2) Linahua granules, both combined with western medicine, or 3) western medicine alone for 14 days. At the end of the trial, the improvement and resolution rates of clinical symptoms and the rate of patients who progressed to severe disease status were evaluated. RESULTS: After 14 days of treatment, there was no significant difference in the improvement rate of clinical symptoms among the three groups (P > 0.05). Huoxiang Zhengqi dropping pills combined with Lianhua Qingwen granules has advantages in the treatment of nausea, vomiting and limb soreness. During treatment, all participants were treated with western medicine, and there was a significant difference in the use of macrolides among the three groups (P < 0.05). Specifically, the utilization rate of antibiotics in the western medicine group was significantly greater than that of the other two groups. Among the 182 diagnosed patients who completed this clinical trial, 13 patients progressed to severe disease, including one case in the Huoxiang + Lianhua group (1.6%), five cases in the Lianhua group (8.6%), and seven cases in the western medicine group (11.1%).

Afterward, the model was tested on all patients admitted to the same hospital with COVID-19 from November 6, 2020, to February 5, 2021. The primary outcome was in-hospital case-fatality risk. The out-of-sample performance of the model was estimated from the training set in terms of Area under the Receiving Operator Curve (AUROC) and classification matrix statistics by averaging the results of fivefold cross validation repeated 3-times and comparing the results with those obtained on the test set. An explanation analysis of the model, based on the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), is also presented. To assess the subsequent time evolution, the change in paO2/FiO2 (P/F) at 48 h after the baseline measurement was plotted against its baseline value. Among the 921 patients included in the training cohort, 120 died (13%). Variables selected for the model were age, platelet count, SpO2, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, and sodium.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of physical activity among Swiss office workers. Methods: Office workers from two Swiss organizations, aged 18-65 years, were included. Baseline data from January 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic became effective in Switzerland were compared with follow-up data during the lockdown phase in April 2020. Levels of physical activity were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Paired sample t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed for statistical analysis. Results: Data from 76 participants were analyzed. Fifty-four participants were female (71.1%). The mean age was 42.7 years (range from 21.8 to 62.7) at baseline. About 75% of the participants met the recommendations on minimal physical activity, both before the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown. Weak statistical evidence for a decline in total physical activity in metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week (MET min/week) was found (estimate = -292, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 74, p-value = 0.09), with no evidence for a decrease in the three types of activity: walking (estimate = -189, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 100, p-value = 0.28), moderate-intensity activity (estimate = -200, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 30, p-value = 0.22) and vigorous-intensity activity (estimate = 80, 95% CI from - &#8734; to 460, p-value = 0.74).

In this Health Policy paper, we analyse and discuss how the healthcare systems of two European countries C Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia C adapted to war as a man-made disaster, and how they adapted to COVID-19 pandemic twenty-five years later. These countries experienced full scale wars in recent history, which significantly changed their political and healthcare systems. This experience prepared the countries for the response to the pandemic, which coincided with two earthquakes in Croatia. We argue that healthcare systems in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are not only resilient but antifragile, and that they benefited from stressors they were exposed to. The antifragility of the two systems were primarily based on human effort C the strength, adaptability and resilience of health care professionals. We will look at lessons from the wars that were applied to the pandemic and discuss newly recognized opportunities and improvements.","output":"Antifragility of healthcare systems in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina: Learning from man-made and natural crises"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes.

Thus, it is important to review the progress of studies on mucormycosis and highlight the important findings in relation to epidemiology, clinical manifestation, major risk factors, diagnostic strategies, and management. An electronic literature search was performed in PubMed using the keywords: Rhizopus, Mucorales, mucormycosis, zygomycosis, zygomycetes, COVID-19, the drugs (azoles, posaconazole, isavuconazole, amphotericin B pharmaceutical preparations, and caspofungin), combination therapy, diagnosis, and clinical manifestations. Studies written in the English language from January 1960 to 2021 were considered for this review article. All search results were reviewed, and the relevance of each article was determined by the authors independently. The review emphasized the fact that the diagnosis of mucormycosis is difficult, it is necessary to have a high index of suspicion to identify it, surgical debridement should be done prior to the dissemination of infection to improve clinical outcomes, and identifying underlying risk factors is important for proper treatment. Moreover, antifungal therapeutic options are few with polyenes and their combinations should be appropriate for empirical therapy while posaconazole and isavuconazole are best reserved for de-escalation, refractory cases, or patients intolerant to amphotericin B.","output":"Mucormycosis: The Hidden and Forgotten Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has ravaged the medical, social, and financial landscape across the world, and the USA-Mexico border is no exception. Although some risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality have already been identified in various ethnic cohorts, there remains a paucity of data among Hispanics, particularly those living on borders. Ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in Hispanic and black populations have been reported. We sought to identify the clinical presentation, treatment, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of 82 Hispanic patients in a county hospital and describe the factors associated with rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (48.8%) and diabetes mellitus (DM) (39%), both found to be associated with hospitalization and mortality, while only DM was associated with increased rate of ICU admission. Multivariable analysis showed that individuals with fever, low oxygen saturation (SpO2), nasal congestion, shortness of breath, and DM had an increased risk of hospitalization. Individuals with fever, decreased levels of SpO2, and advanced age were found to be associated with an increased risk of death. The most common cause of death was respiratory failure (28.9%), followed by shock (17.8%) and acute kidney injury (15.6%).

Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has been fully elucidated, there is no specific therapy for the disease at present, and most treatments are limited to supportive care. Stem cell therapy may be a potential treatment for refractory and unmanageable pulmonary illnesses, which has shown some promising results in preclinical studies. In this review, we systematically summarize the pathogenic progression and potential mechanisms underlying stem cell therapy in COVID-19, and registered COVID-19 clinical trials. Of all the stem cell therapies touted for COVID-19 treatment, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or MSC-like derivatives have been the most promising in preclinical studies and clinical trials so far. MSCs have been suggested to ameliorate the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and protect alveolar epithelial cells by secreting many kinds of factors, demonstrating safety and possible efficacy in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

METHODS The clinical data and thoracic MSCT volume scanning data were analyzed retrospectively for 102 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College between January 18 and February 26, 2020. According to the Fifth Edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines by the National Health Commission, the patients were divided into common type, severe type and critical type. The imaging characteristics including the lung sides of the lesions, lung segment involved, lesion distribution, and lesion number and density were compared among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. RESULTS Seventy-seven of the patients had common type, 18 had severe type and 7 had critical type of COVID-19. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Severe and critical types were more frequently seen in elderly patients, who were more prone to show such symptoms as asthenia, breathing difficulty and dyspnea. Two patients presented with no obvious abnormality in the first CT examinations; in the remaining 100 patients, 89.0% had bilateral lung lesions, 16.0% had diffuse lesions, involving a mean of 6.564.22 lung segments. Compared with the patients with the common type, the severe and critical patients had a significantly greater number of lung segments involved (P < 0.05), and were also more likely to show diffuse lesions (P < 0.05). The lesion side, lesion number or lesion density did not differ significantly among the patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05).

Regardless advances in diagnosis and mass treatment, schistosomiasis has a severe impact on morbimortality in the country and remains a neglected tropical disease. Herein, we assessed the basic and associated causes of schistosomiasis-related deaths and the temporal and spatial patterns of mortality from the disease in Brazil between 1999 and 2018. METHODS: We conducted an ecological and time series study. The segmented log-linear regression model was applied to assess time trends, considering all deaths recorded in the category B65/ICD-10. Additionally, we elaborated maps of mortality rates from schistosomiasis in Brazil. RESULTS: A total of 4168 schistosomiasis-related deaths were recorded in Brazil in this period, as an associated cause. Time trend analysis revealed an increase in the average age of deaths from schistosomiasis (annual percentage change (APC) = 0.84), and stable trend in Brazil (APC = 0.31). Concerning schistosomiasis-related deaths, we observed disorders related to the digestive system, liver diseases, septicemias, and chronic diseases. Surprisingly, there were deaths caused by non-endemic Schistosoma species in Brazil. Also, municipalities from non-endemic areas in Brazil presented schistosomiasis-related deaths. CONCLUSION: Altogether, our analyses demonstrated that schistosomiasis remains a significant cause of death in Brazil, and it is increasing in some areas, especially in the Northeast region. Additionally, women and the elderly showed a stable time trend of deaths. Thereby, it urgently requires improvements in the control programs strategies, in the sense of an effective reduction in cases and deaths from the disease in Brazil.","output":"Basic and associated causes of schistosomiasis-related mortality in Brazil: A population-based study and a 20-year time series of a disease still neglected"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A third dose of CVnCoV, a former candidate mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, was previously shown to boost neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type in adults aged 18C60 and >60 years in a phase 2a clinical study.

Individual genetic landscapes can contribute to understand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) burden and can give information on how to fight virus spreading and the associated severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The spread and pathogenicity of the virus have become pandemic on specific geographic areas and ethnicities. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 firstly emerged in East Asia and next in Europe, where it has caused higher morbidity and mortality. This is a peculiar feature of SARS-CoV-2, different from past global viral infections (i.e., SARS-1 or MERS); it shares with the previous pandemics strong age- and sex-dependent gaps in the disease outcome. The observation that the severest COVID-19 patients are more likely to have a history of hypertension, diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease and receive Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS) inhibitor treatment raised the hypothesis that RAS-unbalancing may have a crucial role. Accordingly, we recently published a genetic hypothesis on the role of RAS-pathway genes (ACE1, rs4646994, rs1799752, rs4340, rs13447447; and ACE2, rs2285666, rs1978124, rs714205) and ABO-locus (rs495828, rs8176746) in COVID-19 prognosis, suspecting inherited genetic predispositions to be predictive of COVID-19 severity.

CASE PRESENTATION: To explain these pathophysiological features and discuss the ventilatory strategy during the late phase of severe ARDS in COVID-19 patients, we first used a metabolic module on a General Electric R860 ventilator (Engstrom Carestation; GE Healthcare, USA) to monitor parameters related to gas metabolism, lung mechanics and physiological dead space in two COVID-19 patients. We found that remarkably decreased ventilatory efficiency (e.g., the ratio of dead space to tidal volume 70C80%, arterial to end-tidal CO(2) difference 18C23 mmHg and ventilatory ratio 3C4) and hypermetabolism (oxygen consumption 300C400 ml/min, CO(2) elimination 200C300 ml/min) may explain why these patients experienced more severe respiratory distress and CO(2) retention in the late phase of ARDS caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the recovery period of ARDS among mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients, attention should be paid to the monitoring of physiological dead space and metabolism. Tidal volume (8C9 ml/kg) could be increased appropriately under the limited plateau pressure; however, barotrauma should still be kept in mind.","output":"Increased physiological dead space in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients recovering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Influenza is a major concern in hospitals, including the emergency department (ED), mainly because of a high risk for ED personnel to acquire and transmit the disease. Although influenza vaccination is recommended for health care workers, vaccination coverage is low. METHODS: This survey was conducted in the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 influenza seasons. Questionnaires were sent to ED personnel in 12 hospitals in Bavaria, South-Eastern Germany. The response rates were 62% and 38% in 2016/2017 and 2020/2021, respectively. Data were compared between the two seasons as well as between vaccinated and not vaccinated respondents in 2020/2021. RESULTS: Significantly more ED personnel reported having been vaccinated in the 2020/2021 season. Factors associated with vaccination coverage (or the intention to get vaccinated) were profession (physician / medical student), having been vaccinated at least twice, the availability of an influenza vaccination on site (in the ED) as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, significant differences in the assessment and evaluation of influenza, its vaccination side effects and ethical aspects were found between vaccinated and not vaccinated ED personnel in 2020/2021. Unvaccinated respondents estimated higher frequencies of almost all potential vaccination side effects, were less likely to accept lay-offs if employees would not come to work during an influenza pandemic and more likely to agree that work attendance should be an employees decision. Vaccinated participants instead, rather agreed that vaccination should be mandatory and were less likely to consider job changes in case of a mandatory vaccination policy. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic might have contributed to a higher influenza vaccination rate among ED workers. Vaccination on site and interventions targeting the perception of influenza vaccination and its side effects may be most promising to increase the vaccination coverage among ED personnel.","output":"Influenza vaccination coverage among emergency department personnel is associated with perception of vaccination and side effects, vaccination availability on site and the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: This research aimed to shed light on the relationship between the sociodemographic characteristics of front-line medical workers and their anxiety and depression, to provide the basis and reference for targeted mental health education and for relevant departments to formulate appropriate policies during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study adopted a convenient sampling method and examined the psychological status of 150 front-line medical workers from Zhejiang Province with questionnaire surveys using the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: The participants had severe anxiety and depression; the top three items under the category of anxiety were genitourinary symptoms, behavior at interview, and respiratory symptoms, whereas the top three items under depression were feelings of guilt, weight loss, and retardation. Among all personal data, the following factors influenced anxiety, in decreasing order: degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms, degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected, and the affiliated hospital (p < .05). As for depression, the factors were the degree of suspicion of being infected when showing associated symptoms and the degree of fear of yourself and your family being infected (p < .05). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that front-line medical staff presented symptoms of anxiety and depression when dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak and the factors influencing their psychological stress. Guiding policies and psychological interventions is crucial to maintaining their psychological well-being.

By failing to integrate testing into the epidemiological model, models missed a vital opportunity to better understand the role of asymptomatic infection in transmission. In this work, we propose a model considering testing as well as asymptomatic infection considering underlying network topology. We extract the transmission parameters from the data set of COVID-19 of India and apply those parameters in our proposed model.

We hypothesized that caregiver's transportation needs may be a key point of intervention for child-level health outcomes, such that the resolution of caregiver transportation needs may have an important, downstream impact on other areas of the child's functioning. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of children (n=4341) served in a large, statewide public behavioral healthcare system. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis of children served in the system between March 2019 and March 2020, using a specialized assessment tool that captures a comprehensive range of psychosocial functioning: the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS; Lyons, 2009) assessment. Linear mixed-effects analyses demonstrated that, if caregivers' transportation needs were resolved during the episode of care, those children demonstrated greater improvements on both need reduction and strength building across multiple domains than did their peers whose caregivers had unresolved transportation needs. By the end of the episode of care, children whose caregivers had resolved transportation needs were not significantly different than those children whose caregivers never had transportation needs. The resolution of transportation needs may be an important focus for providers working with children with a complex behavioral health, such that the resolution of these transportation needs seems to have a large, positive downstream impact on their overall functioning.","output":"Investigating the Impact of Caregiver Transportation Needs on Children's Response to Behavioral and Mental Health Treatment: A Longitudinal Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of goal-directed therapy in high-risk cardiac surgical patients has not been determined. This study sought to observe the effect of a postoperative standardised haemodynamic protocol (SHP) on the administration of fluid and vasoactive drugs after high-risk cardiac surgery. This was an interventional pilot study. In 2010 to 2011, the SHP was introduced to the ICU at Wellington Regional Hospital, Wellington, New Zealand, for the perioperative management of patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery. A pulmonary artery catheter was inserted in the patients in the study group and fluids and supportive medications were provided in the ICU according to a protocol that targeted a cardiac index  2 l/min/m2, mixed venous oxygen saturation  60% and a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 75 mmHg. Data from 40 consecutive high-risk cardiac surgical patients assigned to this protocol were compared with a matched cohort of 40 consecutive high-risk cardiac surgical patients receiving 'usual care' in 2009. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the duration of noradrenaline infusion in the SHP cohort compared to historical controls (median [IQR] 18.5 hours [31.63] versus 18 hours [18.3]; P=0.35), despite patients receiving more fluid in their first 12 hours in the ICU (mean 4687 ml [SD  2284 ml] versus 1889 ml [SD  1344 ml]; P <0.001). The SHP cohort had a higher rate of reintubation (4 in 37 [10.8%] versus 0 in 40 [0%]; P=0.049).

As in animal viruses, the ?1 ribosomal frameshift site in the viral mRNA consists of a canonical shifty heptanucleotide followed by a highly structured frameshift stimulatory element, and the gene translated as a result of frameshifting usually encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In plant viruses, the ?1 frameshift stimulatory element consists of either (i) a small pseudoknot stabilized by many triple-stranded regions and a triple base pair containing a protonated cytidine at the helical junction, (ii) an unusual apical loopCinternal loop interaction in which a stem-loop in the 3() untranslated region 4 kb downstream base pairs to a bulged stem-loop at the frameshift site, or (iii) a potential simple stem-loop. Other less well-characterized changes in reading frame occur on plant viral RNAs, including a possible +1 frameshift, and net ?1 reading frame changes that do not utilize canonical frameshift signals.

In Australia, group model building, a participatory method from systems science, has been applied in various locations to engage communities in systems-based health promotion projects. To date there is limited evidence regarding GMB use with Australian Aboriginal communities. This study aimed to determine the value and acceptability of group model building (GMB) as a methodological approach in research with Aboriginal communities and identify any adaptations required to optimise its utility. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 18 Aboriginal health and university staff who had prior experience with a GMB research project. Interview transcripts were inductively analysed using thematic analysis and key themes were organised using an Indigenous research framework. Participants reported that GMB methods generally aligned well with Aboriginal ways of knowing, being, and doing. Participants valued the holistic, visual and collaborative nature of the method and its emphasis on sharing stories and collective decision-making. Group model building was viewed as a useful tool for identifying Aboriginal-led actions to address priority issues and advancing self-determination. Our findings suggest that by bringing together Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal knowledge, GMB is a promising tool, which Aboriginal communities could utilise to explore and address complex problems in a manner that is consistent with their worldviews.

Two CBM9-spike protein fragment fusion proteins and one CBM9-nucleocapsid fragment fusion protein largely resisted protease degradation, while most of the CBM9 fusion proteins were degraded at some site in the SARS-CoV-2 protein fragment. All of the fusion proteins were highly expressed in E. coli and the CBM9-ID-H1 fusion protein was shown to yield 122 mg/L of purified product.

To develop a qualitative reverse transcription PCR to detect spliced mRNA from HBoV1 and to determine whether HBoV1 mRNA correlated better with RTIs than did HBoV1 DNA, we used samples from HBoV1 DNACpositive children, with and without RTIs, to evaluate the test. A real-time reverse transcription PCR, targeting 2 alternatively spliced mRNAs, was developed. HBoV1 mRNA was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from 33 (25%) of 133 children with RTIs but in none of 28 controls (p<0.001). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the test were good. Our data support the hypothesis that HBoV1 may cause RTIs, and we propose that HBoV1 mRNA could be used with benefit, instead of HBoV1 DNA, as a diagnostic target.","output":"Detection of Spliced mRNA from Human Bocavirus 1 in Clinical Samples from Children with Respiratory Tract Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The authors studied the interaction between sevoflurane and remifentanil on bispectral index (BIS), state entropy (SE), response entropy (RE), Composite Variability Index, and Surgical Pleth Index, by using a response surface methodology. The authors also studied the influence of stimulation on this interaction. METHODS Forty patients received combined concentrations of remifentanil (0 to 12 ng/ml) and sevoflurane (0.5 to 3.5 vol%) according to a crisscross design (160 concentration pairs). During pseudo-steady-state anesthesia, the pharmacodynamic measures were obtained before and after a series of noxious and nonnoxious stimulations. For the \\"prestimulation\\" and \\"poststimulation\\" BIS, SE, RE, Composite Variability Index, and Surgical Pleth Index, interaction models were applied to find the best fit, by using NONMEM 7.2.0. (Icon Development Solutions, Hanover, MD). RESULTS The authors found an additive interaction between sevoflurane and remifentanil on BIS, SE, and RE. For Composite Variability Index, a moderate synergism was found. The comparison of pre- and poststimulation data revealed a shift of C50SEVO for BIS, SE, and RE, with a consistent increase of 0.3 vol%. The Surgical Pleth Index data did not result in plausible parameter estimates, neither before nor after stimulation. CONCLUSIONS By combining pre- and poststimulation data, interaction models for BIS, SE, and RE demonstrate a consistent influence of \\"stimulation\\" on the pharmacodynamic relationship between sevoflurane and remifentanil.

These compounds show anticancer activity in other biological systems. However, whether frankincense and/or myrrh can inhibit the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown, and the potential molecular mechanism(s) has not yet been determined. AIM: To predict and determine latent anti-HCC therapeutic targets and molecular mechanisms of frankincense and myrrh in vivo. METHODS: In the present study, which was based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (http://tcmspw.com/tcmsp.php), Universal Protein database (http://www.uniprot.org), GeneCards: The Human Gene Database (http://www.genecards.org/) and Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://www.ctdbase.org/), the efficacy of and mechanism by which frankincense and myrrh act as anti-HCC compounds were predicted. The core prediction targets were screened by molecular docking. In vivo, SMMC-7721 human liver cancer cells were transplanted as xenografts into nude mice to establish a subcutaneous tumor model, and two doses of frankincense plus myrrh or one dose of an EGFR inhibitor was administered to these mice continuously for 14 d. The tumors were collected and evaluated: the tumor volume and growth rate were gauged to evaluate tumor growth; hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to estimate histopathological changes; immunofluorescence (IF) was performed to detect the expression of CD31, -SMA and collagen IV; transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted to observe the morphological structure of vascular cells; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the levels of secreted HIF-1 and TNF-; reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure the mRNA expression of HIF-1, TNF-, VEGF and MMP-9; and Western blot (WB) was performed to determine the levels of proteins expressed in the EGFR-mediated PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. RESULTS: The results of the network pharmacology analysis showed that there were 35 active components in the frankincense and myrrh extracts targeting 151 key targets. The molecular docking analysis showed that both boswellic acid and stigmasterol showed strong affinity for the targets, with the greatest affinity for EGFR. Frankincense and myrrh treatment may play a role in the treatment of HCC by regulating hypoxia responses and vascular system-related pathological processes, such as cytokine-receptor binding, and pathways, such as those involving serine/threonine protein kinase complexes and MAPK, HIF-1 and ErbB signaling cascades. The animal experiment results were verified. First, we found that, through frankincense and/or myrrh treatment, the volume of subcutaneously transplanted HCC tumors was significantly reduced, and the pathological morphology was attenuated. Then, IF and TEM showed that frankincense and/or myrrh treatment reduced CD31 and collagen IV expression, increased the coverage of perivascular cells, tightened the connection between cells, and improved the shape of blood vessels. In addition, ELISA, RT-qPCR and WB analyses showed that frankincense and/or myrrh treatment inhibited the levels of hypoxia-inducible factors, inflammatory factors and angiogenesis-related factors, namely, HIF-1, TNF-, VEGF and MMP-9. Furthermore, mechanistic experiments illustrated that the effect of frankincense plus myrrh treatment was similar to that of an EGFR inhibitor with regard to controlling EGFR activation, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation activity of its downstream targets: the PI3K/Akt and MAPK (ERK, p38 and JNK) pathways. CONCLUSION: In summary, frankincense and myrrh treatment targets tumor blood vessels to exert anti-HCC effects via EGFR-activated PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, highlighting the potential of this dual TCM compound as an anti-HCC candidate.","output":"Frankincense myrrh attenuates hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating tumor blood vessel development through multiple epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signaling pathways"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The first surge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Bulgaria occurred in the fall of 2020. To accommodate the rising number of critically ill patients, new intensive care units were formed in several hospitals. Here we describe the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in a newly formed COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary cardiac center in Sofia, Bulgaria. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to Sveta Ekaterina University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, between November 4th, 2020 and January 6th, 2021. Data were collected from electronic and written patient records and charts. Results: We identified 38 critical care patients admitted with respiratory failure and treated with mechanical ventilation at our COVID-19 ICU during this period. The median age was 66 (IQR 57-76, range 27-89) and 74% were male. Most patients, 36 (95%), had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Overall, 27 (71%) patients had a concomitant cardiac disease other than hypertension and 24% were recent cardiac surgical patients. Inotropic support was required in 29 (76%) patients, renal replacement therapy in 12 (32%) patients and prone positioning and ECMO were used in 5 (13%) and 2 (5%) patients respectively. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.5 (IQR 5-14) days overall and 9 (IQR 6-13) days for survivors. At 30-days 28 (74%) of patients had died. Overall, 32 (84%) patients died in hospital and only 6 (16%) patients were discharged home. Conclusions: During the first major surge of COVID-19 cases in Bulgaria, despite the wave arriving later than in other countries, the healthcare system was largely unprepared. In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was very high at 85%. There may be several factors contributing to these results, namely the predominance of cardiovascular comorbidities in our patient population, the strained ICU capacity and the lack of medical personnel to provide adequate intensive care to such complex patients.","output":"Presentation, characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Bulgaria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Here we aimed to investigate the difference in clinical characteristics and outcomes between pediatric and adult patients with COVID-19.

People on HMV have complex care needs and require support from an interprofessional team. In Germany, HMV is criticised for inadequate quality standards, particularly in outpatient intensive care practice. The objective of this study was to describe the quality of care for people on outpatient HMV in Germany, Bavaria and provide recommendations for improvement from the perspective of healthcare professionals (HCPs). METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews with HCPs (i.e., nurses, equipment providers, therapists, and physicians) were analysed using the framework method. The quality framework of Health Improvement Scotland (HIS), which aims to improve the quality of person-centred care, was used to build a deductive analysis matrix. The framework includes the three key areas: (1) Outcomes and impact, (2) Service delivery, and (3) Vision and leadership. The domains (meta-codes) and quality indicators (sub-codes) of the quality framework were used for deductive coding. RESULTS: Overall, 87 HCPs (51 female, mean age of 44.3 years, mean professional experience in HMV of 9.4 years) were interviewed (mean duration of 31 min). There was a complex interaction between the existing health care system (Outcomes and impact, 955 meaning units), the delivery of outpatient intensive care (Service delivery, 939 meaning units), and improvement-focused leadership (Vision and leadership, 70 meaning units) that influenced the quality of care for people on HMV. The main barriers were an acceleration in transition management, a neglect of weaning potential, a shortage of qualified professionals and missing quality criteria. The central recommendations for promoting person-centred care were training and supervision of staff and an inspiring leadership. An integrated care structure supporting medical home visits and outpatient rehabilitation should be developed. CONCLUSION: This study describes a heterogeneous and partly deficient care situation for people on HMV, but demonstrates that high quality care is possible if person-centred care is successfully implemented in all areas of service provision. The recommendations of this study could inform the development of a person-centred integrated care structure for people on HMV.

Public health interventions continue in their attempts to control the epidemic in spite of a lack of information on the scale of silent transmission. Methods: : To tackle this challenge and the non-stationary aspect of the epidemic we used a modified SEIR stochastic model with time-varying parameters, following Brownian process. This model is coupled with Bayesian inference (PMCMC) for parameter estimation and used mainly confirmed reported hospitalized cases. Results: : Mitigation measures provided an 80% reduction in transmission between March and May 2020. By end of October our estimated seroprevalence rate was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.5%C2.8%) far from herd immunity. We estimated that the proportion of asymptomatic transmission was approximately 40% but with large uncertainty (95% CI: 14%C73%). Finally we demonstrate that the available observed confirmed cases are not reliable for any analysis owing to the fact that their reporting rate has greatly evolved. Conclusion: We provide the first estimations of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland and its key parameters. We also quantify the effects of mitigation measures on the virus transmission before, during and after mitigation. Our results demonstrate that Ireland has significantly reduced transmission by employing mitigation measures, physical distancing and lockdown. This has to date avoided the saturation of healthcare infrastructures, flattened the epidemic curve and likely reduced mortality. However, as mitigation measures change silent transmission remain an ongoing challenge.","output":"Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland under mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adverse drug reactions are common and associated with substantial economic and human costs.

However -- possibly because of its origins in the development of agents capable of self-discovery -- relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction between people and ML. In this paper we are concerned with the use of ML in automated or semi-automated tools that assist one or more human decision makers. We argue that requirements on both human and machine in this context are significantly different to the use of ML either as part of autonomous agents for self-discovery or as part statistical data analysis. Our principal position is that the design of such human-machine systems should be driven by repeated, two-way intelligibility of information rather than one-way explainability of the ML-system's recommendations. Iterated rounds of intelligible information exchange, we think, will characterise the kinds of collaboration that will be needed to understand complex phenomena for which neither man or machine have complete answers. We propose operational principles -- we call them Intelligibility Axioms -- to guide the design of a collaborative decision-support system. The principles are concerned with: (a) what it means for information provided by the human to be intelligible to the ML system; and (b) what it means for an explanation provided by an ML system to be intelligible to a human. Using examples from the literature on the use of ML for drug-design and in medicine, we demonstrate cases where the conditions of the axioms are met.

The symptoms of infection can be devastating or at the least very debilitating for vulnerable individuals. It is clear that the elderly are at most risk of the adverse impacts of the virus, including hospitalization and death. Others at risk are those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions and those with a hyper-excitable immune response. Treatment options for those with acute responses to the virus are limited and there is an urgent need for potential strategies that can mitigate these severe effects. One potential avenue for treatment that has not been explored is the microbiome gut/lung axis. In addition to those severely affected by their acute reaction to the virus, there is also a need for treatment options for those that are slow to recover from the effects of the infection and also those who have been adversely affected by the measures put in place to arrest the spread of the virus. One potential treatment option is photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. PBM has been shown over many years to be a safe, effective, non-invasive and easily deployed adjunctive treatment option for inflammatory conditions, pain, tissue healing and cellular energy. We have also recently demonstrated the effectiveness of PBM to alter the gut microbiome. PBM therapy is worthy of consideration as a potential treatment for those most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with comorbidities. The treatment may potentially be advantageous for those infected with the virus, those who have a slow recovery from the effects of the virus and those who have been denied their normal exercise/rehabilitation programs due to the isolation restrictions that have been imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"A Potential Role for Photobiomodulation Therapy in Disease Treatment and Prevention in the Era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aberrant mucosal immunity has been suggested to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a global concern. However, whether the mucosal immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 influences the clinical manifestations of IgAN patients remains unknown. Here we tracked the SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels in a cohort of 88 COVID-19 patients. We found that 52.3% of the COVID-19 patients produced more SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgA than IgG or IgM, and the levels of the IgA were stable during 4-41 days of infection. Among these IgA-dominated COVID-19 patients, we found a severe COVID-19 patient concurrent with IgAN. The renal function of the patient declined presenting with increased serum creatinine during the infection and till 7 months post infection. This patient predominantly produced anti-RBD IgA as well as total IgA in the serum compared to that of healthy controls. The analysis of the IgA-coated microbiota as well as proinflammatory cytokine IL-18, which was mainly produced in the intestine, reveals intestinal inflammation, although no obvious gastrointestinal symptom was reported.

Using geolocated containment zones and COVID-19 case data for Mumbai, India?s most populous city, we find that cases and case fatality rates are higher in slums compared to formal residential buildings. Our results show that access to toilets for men is associated with lower COVID-19 prevalence. However, the effect is opposite in the case of toilets for women. This could be because limited hours for safely using toilets and higher waiting times increase risk of exposure, and women and children sharing toilet facilities results in crowding. Proximity to water pipelines has no effect on prevalence, likely because slumdwellers are disconnected from formal water supply networks. Indoor crowding does not seem to have an effect on case prevalence. Finally, while police capacity ? measured by number of police station outposts ? is associated with lower prevalence in non-slum areas, indicating effective enforcement of containment, this relationship does not hold in slums. The study highlights the urgency of finding viable solutions for slum improvement and upgrading to mitigate the effects of contagion for some of the most vulnerable populations.

The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines, and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant in vivo.

Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells and, more frequently, formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs.

Autopsy studies showed high prevalence of platelet-fibrin-rich microthrombi in several organs. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet therapy (APT) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and its impact on survival. METHODS: 7824 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a multicentre international prospective registry (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation-COVID-19 Registry). Clinical data and in-hospital complications were recorded. Data on APT, including aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, were obtained for each patient. RESULTS: During hospitalisation, 730 (9%) patients received single APT (93%, n=680) or dual APT (7%, n=50). Patients treated with APT were older (7412 years vs 6317 years, p<0.01), more frequently male (68% vs 57%, p<0.01) and had higher prevalence of diabetes (39% vs 16%, p<0.01). Patients treated with APT showed no differences in terms of in-hospital mortality (18% vs 19%, p=0.64), need for invasive ventilation (8.7% vs 8.5%, p=0.88), embolic events (2.9% vs 2.5% p=0.34) and bleeding (2.1% vs 2.4%, p=0.43), but had shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (85 days vs 117 days, p=0.01); however, when comparing patients with APT versus no APT and no anticoagulation therapy, APT was associated with lower mortality rates (log-rank p<0.01, relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94).

However, none have examined the perceptions of neurosurgeons towards the pandemic, their life changes, and the strategies they implemented to be able to deal with their patients in such a difficult time. METHODS: From April 2021 to May 2021 a modified Delphi method was used to construct, pilot, and refine the questionnaire focused on the evolution of global neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. This survey was distributed among 1000 neurosurgeons; the responses were then collected and critically analyzed. RESULTS: Outpatient department practices changed with a rapid rise in teleservices. 63.9% of respondents reported that they have changed their OT practices to emergency cases with occasional elective cases. 40.0% of respondents and 47.9% of their family members reported to have suffered from COVID-19. 56.2% of the respondents reported having felt depressed in the last 1 year. 40.9% of respondents reported having faced financial difficulties. 80.6% of the respondents found online webinars to be a good source of learning. 47.8% of respondents tried to improve their neurosurgical knowledge while 31.6% spent the extra time in research activities. CONLCUSIONS: Progressive increase in operative waiting lists, preferential use of telemedicine, reduction in tendency to complete stoppage of physical clinic services and drop in the use of PPE kits were evident. Respondents' age had an impact on how the clinical services and operative practices have evolved.

METHODS Thirty-five patients with medial compartment knee OA were assessed for the presence of effusion using a brush test. Based on the results, they were assigned to the knee effusion (n = 17) and no knee effusion (n = 18) groups. Electromyograms from seven lower extremity muscles (lateral and medial gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and medialis, rectus femoris and the lateral and medial hamstrings), leg motion and ground reaction forces were recorded during self-selected walking. Isometric knee extensor, plantar flexor and knee flexor strength were measured. Discrete measures from angular knee motion and net external moment of force waveforms were identified. Principal component analysis extracted electromyographic waveform features. Analysis of variance models tested for main effects (group, muscle) and interactions ( = 0.05). Bonferroni post-hoc testing was employed. RESULTS No differences in age, body mass index, knee pain, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, gait velocity and muscle strength were found between groups (P > 0.05). Individuals with effusion had a greater overall quadriceps activation and prolonged hamstring activation into mid-stance (P < 0.05). Knee joint flexion angles were higher (P < 0.05) and net external knee extension (KE) moments in mid to late stance lower in the effusion group.

Methods: COVID-19, SARS, MERS and Ebola clinical trials registered in the Chinese clinical trial registry and clinical trials.gov were collected and analyzed and intervention protocols were descriptively analyzed, focusing on the analysis and comparison of the drug used. The search period ended on February 24, 2020. Results: The number of the registered COVID-19 clinical trials was 295. Among 203 intervention trials, 78.3% (159) were drug clinical trials. The 159 COVID-19 trials were designed and analyzed with the highest proportion of random, open control study [66.0% (105)], and blind randomized trials [13.8% (22)]. The drug mostly used was Lopinavir/Ritonavir (15.1%). The sample size median 100,IQR(interquartile range) 140. The number of the registered SARS was 6, MERS 15, and Ebola 97.

Early reports from states releasing vaccination data by race show that White residents are being vaccinated at significantly higher rates than Black residents. Public health efforts are being targeted to address vaccine hesitancy among Black and other minority populations. However, health care interventions intended to reduce health disparities that do not reflect the underlying values of individuals in underrepresented populations are unlikely to be successful. OBJECTIVE: To identify key factors underlying the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Primary data were collected from an online survey of a representative sample of the populations of the 4 largest US states (New York, California, Texas, and Florida) between August 10 and September 3, 2020. Using latent class analysis, we built a model identifying key factors underlying the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We found that individuals who identify as Black had lower rates of vaccine hesitancy than those who identify as White. This was true overall, by latent class and within latent class. This suggests that, contrary to what is currently being reported, Black individuals are not universally more vaccine hesitant. Combining the respondents who would not consider a vaccine (17%) with those who would consider one but ultimately choose not to vaccinate (11%), our findings indicate that more than 1 in 4 (28%) persons will not be willing to vaccinate. The no-vaccine rate is highest in White individuals and lowest in Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that other factors, potentially institutional, are driving the vaccination rates for these groups. Our model results help point the way to more effective differentiated policies. DISCLOSURES: No funding was received for this study.

Several theories have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related anosmia, including nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea, oedema of the olfactory cleft mucosa, olfactory epithelial damage either within the olfactory receptor cells or the supporting non-neural cells (either direct or immune-mediated), damage to the olfactory bulb, and impairment of the central olfactory pathways. Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related anosmia is still not fully elucidated, it appears to be mainly due to sensorineural damage, with infection of the olfactory epithelium support cells via the ACE1 receptor and disruption of the OE caused by immense inflammatory reaction, and possibly with direct olfactory sensory neurons infection mediated by the NRP-1 receptor.

Methods: This multi-centre cohort study involved patients aged 18 years and older hospitalised with COVID-19, using routinely collected data. We used Cox regression analysis to assess the impact of age, frailty, and delirium on the risk of inpatient mortality, adjusting for sex, illness severity, inflammation, and co-morbidities. We used ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of age, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and delirium on risk of increased care requirements on discharge, adjusting for the same variables. Results: Data from 5711 patients from 55 hospitals in 12 countries were included (median age 74, IQR 54 C 83;55.2% male). The risk of death increased independently with increasing age (>80 vs 18-49: HR 3.57, CI 2.54 C 5.02), frailty (CFS 8 vs 1-3: HR 3.03, CI 2.29 C 4.00) inflammation, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, but not delirium. Age, frailty (CFS 7 vs 1-3: OR 7.00, CI 5.27 C 9.32), delirium, dementia, and mental health diagnoses were all associated with increased risk of higher care needs on discharge. The likelihood of adverse outcomes increased across all grades of CFS from 4 to 9. Conclusions: Age and frailty are independently associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

In Ethiopia, though the prevalence of hypothyroidism is high the magnitude of cognitive impairment among these patients is not known. Therefore, the current study is aimed at determining the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among adult hypothyroid patients. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was employed from February 24 to May 22, 2020, to assess the prevalence of cognitive impairment and associated factors among adult hypothyroid patients. Data was collected by a pretested interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and standardized Mini-mental state examination (SMMSE) tool. A cluster sampling technique was used. Data was entered into Epidata version 4.6 and exported into a statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25 for further analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done. A 95% confidence interval and P-value <0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 216 adult hypothyroid patients were included with a response rate of 98.6%. The mean age was 42.5 ( 11) years. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 27.3% (95% CI (21.7, 33.8)) and it was significantly associated with increased age (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI (1.11, 1.34)), increased duration of illness (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI (1.14, 1.90)) and high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level (AOR = 1.3, 95% CI (1.1, 1.6)). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cognitive impairment among hypothyroid patients was high. Increased age, increased duration of illness and high TSH levels were significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Hence, early screening of cognitive impairment among hypothyroid patients with increased age, increased duration of illness and high TSH level should be given due emphasis to increase patients quality of life.","output":"Cognitive Impairment and Associated Factors Among Adult Hypothyroid Patients in Referral Hospitals, Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020 brought many changes to the early childhood sector internationally.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed, recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=30) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells in these individuals (n=52 distinct epitopes) are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC (n=50 mutations). Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC, and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time. ImportanceThe newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses, in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8+ T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron. These data suggest that the T-cell immune response in previously infected, and most likely vaccinated individuals, should still be effective against Omicron.","output":"Minimal cross-over between mutations associated with Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and CD8+ T cell epitopes identified in COVID-19 convalescent individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews have disclosed a lack of clinically relevant cardiac arrest animal models.

METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies published prior to 01 January 2020. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and Web of Science and the reference lists of original studies and review articles. We used random-effects models to generate meta-estimates of relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS Twenty-four cohort and ten case-control studies were eligible. Ten articles examined smoking, 11 alcohol, 13 BMI, and four hair dye use and risk of FL. The meta-estimate for current smoking was 1.11 (95% CI 0.92-1.35; I2 = 51%) and there was no significant dose-response per 5-year increase in duration (p-trend = 0.087). Current alcohol intake was inversely associated with FL risk (meta-RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.94; I2 = 0%) and there was a significant dose-response per 5 drinks/week increase in intake (p-trend = 0.008). There was no association with 5 kg/m2 increase in early adulthood BMI (meta-RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.91-1.20; I2 = 7%) or being overweight (meta-RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92-1.07; I2 = 0%) or obese (meta-RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.99-1.17; I2 = 0%) as an adult. Hair dye use before 1980 was positively associated with FL risk (meta-RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.22-2.25; I2 = 55%) and no evidence of effect after 1980.

As a feline endogenous retrovirus, RD114 virus, exists in the genome of all cats, it can be assumed that contamination with the virus in feline and canine live vaccines manufactured by culturing cells of feline origin occurs. To detect an infectious RD114 virus in vitro, a LacZ marker rescue assay has recently been established. In feline and canine live vaccines approved in Japan, feline cell lines are widely used to produce vaccines, especially those containing canine parvovirus components. The LacZ marker rescue assay detects infectious viral particles, but the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR detects both infectious and defective viruses. The canine live vaccines manufactured in cells of feline origin showed positive results for the env gene by the real-time reverse-transcription-PCR, including all of the 8 vaccines produced in feline cell lines that were negative in the LacZ marker rescue assay. In conclusion, the present investigation suggests that the newly developed method has the advantages of shorter time requirements and can be applied as a valuable screening method to detect RD114 viral RNA in vaccines.","output":"Development of a real-time reverse-transcription-PCR method for detection of RD114 virus in canine vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent efforts in understanding the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections have highlighted both potential beneficial as well as detrimental effects of cross-reactive antibodies derived from memory immunity. Specifically, due to a significant degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the coronavirus family, memory B-cells that emerged from previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could be re-activated upon encountering the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, thus prompting the production of cross-reactive antibodies. Understanding the affinity and concentration of these potentially cross-reactive antibodies to the new SARS-CoV-2 antigens is therefore particularly important when assessing both existing immunity against common HCoVs and adverse effects like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19. However, these two fundamental parameters cannot easily be deconvoluted by surface-based assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which are routinely used to assess cross-reactivity. Here, we have used microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling (MAAP) to quantitatively evaluate the humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent patients by determining both antibody affinity and concentration against spike antigens of SARS-CoV-2 directly in nine convalescent COVID-19 patient and three pre-pandemic sera that were seropositive for common HCoVs. All 12 sera contained low concentrations of high affinity antibodies against spike antigens of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, indicative of past exposure to these pathogens, while the affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was lower. These results suggest that cross-reactivity as a consequence of memory re-activation upon an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be a significant factor in generating immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Understanding the role of memory re-activation and cross-reactivity in the defense against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid, on-site diagnostics allow for timely intervention and response for warfighter support, environmental monitoring, and global health needs.

We studied the usage of facemasks and its consequences among people with PCD in an international context. Methods We used data from COVID-PCD, an international observational cohort study which collects longitudinal data from people with PCD during the COVID-19 pandemic via weekly online questionnaires. An online questionnaire investigating use of facemasks was posted in October 2020. It asked about frequency of facemask usage in different public places, problems experienced with use of facemasks, affordability of masks, and beliefs regarding their effectiveness. Results 282 participants (50%) completed the questionnaire. Participants came from 27 different countries; median age was 32 years (interquartile range 17-48), and 63% were female. Almost all wore a facemask whenever they left their house. In addition, many avoided public places altogether. For example, 159 (57%) did not use public transport at all, 108 (39%) always wore a facemask in public transport, 4 (1%) sometimes, and 7 (3%) never. 81% agreed with the statement that facemasks protect the person who wears the mask, and 91% agreed that facemasks protect others. One third reported that it was uncomfortable to wear a mask because of their runny nose, 31% because of cough, and 22% because of difficulty breathing. Participants less often wore facemasks in public when there was no national requirement. Only two persons had a personal exemption from wearing a facemask prescribed by a physician. Conclusions This international study found that people with PCD carefully shield themselves, and most wear facemasks everywhere in public. People who did not wear facemasks in public came from countries without a national facemask requirement. National policies mandating facemask use in public are important for universal use to protect high-risk populations from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Facemask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic among people with primary ciliary dyskinesia: a participatory project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper is concerned with the problem of students' upgradation of knowledge gained through digital learning.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey of all FPMRS program directors in the United States conducted from April 29, 2020, to May 30, 2020. At the time of this study, there were 73 program directors and 69 obstetrics and gynecology and urologyCaccredited FPMRS programs nationwide. The primary outcome was to subjectively assess the effectiveness of virtual interviews as compared with in-person interviews for evaluating applicants. RESULTS: Fifty seven (82.6%) of the program directors completed the survey. A total of 80.7% (46/57) of the respondents had participated in interviews for the active match cycle. Of the programs that participated in the interview process, almost all conducted interviews using virtual platforms (97.8%, 45/46). Program directors who conducted interviews virtually found them effective in evaluating applicants (88.9%, 40/45) and were satisfied with the virtual interview process (86.7%, 39/45). A total of 31.1% of respondents (14/45) preferred a virtual platform to an in-person setting for future interviews, and 60% (27/45) reported that they will likely perform future interviews virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic resulted in a sudden reformatting of FPMRS fellowship interviews, most program directors nationally were satisfied with the process and found virtual interviews effective for assessing applicants.

A growing need to provide effective and accessible services, with maximal population reach has stimulated demand for flexible and efficient service models. The implementation of evidence-based practice has been slow, leaving many services ill equipped to respond to requests for non-face-to-face delivery. To address this translation gap, and provide empirically derived evidence to support large-scale practice change, our study aimed to explore practitioners perspectives of the factors that enhance the delivery of a NICE-recommended psychological intervention, i.e. guided self-help by telephone (GSH-T), in routine care. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to analyse our data, identify essential behaviour change processes and encourage the successful implementation of remote working in clinical practice. METHOD: Thirty-four psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) from the UK NHS Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services were interviewed. Data were first analysed inductively, with codes cross-matched deductively to the TDF. RESULTS: Analysis identified barriers to the delivery, engagement and implementation of GSH-T, within eight domains from the TDF: (i) Deficits in practitioner knowledge, (ii) Sub-optimal practitioner telephone skills, (iii) Practitioners lack of beliefs in telephone capabilities and self-confidence, (iv) Practitioners negative beliefs about consequences, (v) Negative emotions, (vi) Professional role expectations (vii) Negative social influences, and (viii) Challenges in the environmental context and resources. A degree of interdependence was observed between the TDF domains, such that improvements in one domain were often reported to confer secondary advantages in another. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple TDF domains emerge as relevant to improve delivery of GSH-T; and these domains are theoretically and practically interlinked. A multicomponent approach is recommended to facilitate the shift from in-person to telephone-based service delivery models, and prompt behaviour change at practitioner, patient and service levels. At a minimum, the development of practitioners telephone skills, an increase in clients awareness of telephone-based treatment, dilution of negative preconceptions about telephone treatment, and robust service level guidance and standards for implementation are required. This is the first study that provides clear direction on how to improve telephone delivery and optimise implementation, aligning with current mental health policy and service improvement.","output":"What influences practitioners readiness to deliver psychological interventions by telephone?

Although, various research on therapeutic measures to solve this pandemic crisis has been published; no favourable results have been achieved. We propose the use of potential FDA-approved dual inhibitors which can inhibit two targets (either on entry-level or the main protease) for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We screened 12 FDA-approved antiviral inhibitors listed in Drug bank and analysed the ADMET properties of each drug of interest to study the bioavailability, safety and toxicity. Two potential targets, the spike protein and the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from PDB have been used for molecular docking. All the selected drugs were docked with both targets and demonstrated strong hydrogen bond (HB) interactions in multiple active sites. Amongst these, the range of binding energy was from 3-7 kcal/mol for spike protein and 2-8 kcal/mol for the main protease. Upon comparison of all the processed drugs ganciclovir and zanamivir displayed significant binding energy with HB interactions with both, spike (-9.2 and -9 kcal/mol respectively) and the main protease (-9 kcal/mol). Ribavirin and tenofovir showed significant binding energy above -8 kcal/mol with seven HB interactions with the main protease and also spike protein. The novel findings regarding the antiviral properties of these dual inhibitors using a computational approach will be a good starting point for the efficacy determination of these drugs for pre-clinical and clinical studies aimed at developing active antivirals to target SARS-CoV-2.

Anatomical variations of the intranasal branching may result in long operative time and possible inadequate cauterization. A modification of ESPAL by cauterization at the sphenopalatine foramen (SPF), has been performed by our group. Our study assessed the clinical benefit of endoscopic sphenopalatine foramen cauterization (ESFC) and compared it to ESPAL. METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients who received ESFC for posterior epistaxis from 2016 to 2018 at a tertiary hospital were recruited. Middle meatal antrostomy was done. After ethmoidal crest was identified and nipped, pterygopalatine fossa was entered through the SPF. Sphenopalatine artery (SPA) and its branches within the SPF were cauterized without identification of any SPA distal branches in the nasal cavity. Patients receiving conventional ESPAL by the same surgeon were recruited and compared as control. Patients were followed-up for 3 months. Success rate, operative time, and complication were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were identified. Recurrent epistaxis was absent in 90.0% and 100% of patients receiving ESPAL (9/10 patients) and ESFC (24/24 patients) respectively, p = 0.294. Median operative time was 115 and 60 min, respectively, p < 0.001. Ipsilateral hard palatal or anterior palatal numbness were found in one and three patients, respectively.

Our group previously demonstrated that the immunostimulatory effects of CMP-001 are dependent on an anti-Q antibody response which results in opsonization of CMP-001 and uptake by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that then produce interferon (IFN)-. IFN- then leads to an antitumor T-cell response that is responsible for the in vivo efficacy of CMP-001. Here, we explore mechanisms by which the initial effects of CMP-001 on pDCs activate other cells that can contribute to development of an antitumor T-cell response. METHODS: Uptake of CMP-001 by various peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and response to anti-Q-coated CMP-001 were evaluated by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Purified monocytes were treated with anti-Q-coated CMP-001 or recombinant IFN- to evaluate direct and secondary effects of anti-Q-coated CMP-001 on monocytes. RESULTS: Monocytes had the highest per cell uptake of anti-Q-coated CMP-001 with lower levels of uptake by pDCs and other cell types. Treatment of PBMCs with anti-Q-coated CMP-001 induced upregulation of IFN-responsive genes including CXCL10, PDL1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression by monocytes. Most of the impact of anti-Q-coated CMP-001 on monocytes was indirect and mediated by IFN-, but uptake of anti-Q-coated CMP-001 altered the monocytic response to IFN- and resulted in enhanced expression of PDL1, IDO, and CD80 and suppressed expression of CXCL10. These changes included an enhanced ability to induce autologous CD4 T-cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Q-coated CMP-001 induces IFN- production by pDCs which has secondary effects on a variety of cells including monocytes. Uptake of anti-Q-coated CMP-001 by monocytes alters their response to IFN-, resulting in enhanced expression of PDL1, IDO and CD80 and suppressed expression of CXCL10. Despite aspects of an immunosuppressive phenotype, these monocytes demonstrated increased ability to augment autologous CD4 T-cell proliferation. These findings shed light on the complexity of the mechanism of action of anti-Q-coated CMP-001 and provide insight into pathways that may be targeted to further enhance the efficacy of this novel approach to immunotherapy.","output":"Direct and indirect immune effects of CMP-001, a virus-like particle containing a TLR9 agonist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the demographic and clinical features of pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) syndromes and identify admission variables predictive of disease severity STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, and prospective study of pediatric patients hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at 8 sites in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut RESULTS: We identified 281 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections and divided them into 3 groups based on clinical features Overall, 143 (51%) had respiratory disease, 69 (25%) had MIS-C, and 69 (25%) had other manifestations including gastrointestinal illness or fever Patients with MIS-C were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic black compared with patients with respiratory disease (35% vs 18%, P = 02) Seven patients (2%) died and 114 (41%) were admitted to the intensive care unit In multivariable analyses, obesity (OR 3 39, 95% CI 1 26-9 10, P = 02) and hypoxia on admission (OR 4 01;95% CI 1 14-14 15;P = 03) were predictive of severe respiratory disease Lower absolute lymphocyte count (OR 8 33 per unit decrease in 109 cells/L, 95% CI 2 32-33 33, P = 001) and greater C-reactive protein (OR 1 06 per unit increase in mg/dL, 95% CI 1 01-1 12, P = 017) were predictive of severe MIS-C Race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status were not predictive of disease severity CONCLUSIONS: We identified variables at the time of hospitalization that may help predict the development of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations in children and youth These variables may have implications for future prognostic tools that inform hospital admission and clinical management","output":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Clinical Syndromes and Predictors of Disease Severity in Hospitalized Children and Youth"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Santa Catarina was one of the first Brazilian states to allow businesses to reopen on 22 April 2020.

Pulmonology OBJECTIVE: Unusual setting of medical care BACKGROUND: Pneumonia caused by coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has spread around the world, becoming a pandemic. Many patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and mechanical ventilation, which is causing the collapse of healthcare systems in many countries. Coronavirus infection is associated with extensive lung inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, which can result in hypoxia. It can also cause severe and lasting harm in other organs, including the heart and kidneys. At present, there is no proven and efficacious treatment for this new disease. Consequently, there is a growing tendency to use novel methods. Ozone therapy consists of administration of a mixture of oxygen and ozone (a molecule consisting of 3 oxygen atoms). The potential benefits of this therapy include reduced tissue hypoxia, decreased hypercoagulability, renal and heart protection, modulated immune function, improved phagocytic function, and impaired viral replication. CASE REPORTS: We report rapidly improved hypoxia with associated decreases in inflammatory markers and D-dimer immediately after 1C4 sessions of oxygenCozone (O(2)CO(3)) therapy in 3 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with respiratory failure. Invasive mechanical ventilation was not required in these 3 patients. All patients were discharged home on days 3C4 after O(2)CO(3) therapy. CONCLUSIONS: O(2)CO(3) therapy appears to be an effective therapy for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.

The results suggest the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in some samples collected in the prepandemic period, with the oldest samples found to be positive for IgM by both laboratories collected on 10 October 2019 (Lombardy), 11 November 2019 (Lombardy) and 5 February 2020 (Lazio), the latter with neutralizing antibodies. The detection of IgM and/or IgG binding and neutralizing antibodies was strongly dependent on the different serological assays and thresholds employed, and they were not detected in control samples collected one year before. These findings, although gathered in a small and selected set of samples, highlight the importance of harmonizing serological assays for testing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and may contribute to a better understanding of future virus dynamics.","output":"Timeline of SARS-CoV-2 Spread in Italy: Results from an Independent Serological Retesting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In terms of global impact, foodborne infections have been likened to major infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, with 1 in 10 people becoming ill and 420,000 deaths per year. A large number of these incidents are caused by improperly handled food in foodservice establishments. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to estimate the proportion of food handlers in Ethiopian commercial food service establishments who have safe food handling practices and their associated factors. METHODS: Studies conducted before 02-05-2022 were explored in PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, ProQuest, and Ovid MEDLINE(?), as well as other sources. A total of fourteen studies were included in the final synthesis. Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction format prepared in Microsoft excel and the analysis was done using STATA 16 statistical software. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institutes Critical assessment checklist for prevalence studies. To evaluate publication bias, a funnel plot and Eggers regression test were employed. The I(2) statistic was calculated to examine for study heterogeneity. To assess the pooled effect size, odds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals across studies, the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used. Subgroup analysis was conducted by region and publication year. The influence of a single study on the whole estimate was determined via sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Of 323 identified articles, 14 studies were eligible for analysis (n = 4849 participants). The pooled prevalence estimate of safe food handling practices among Ethiopian food handlers was 47.14% (95% CI: 39.01C55.26, I(2) = 97.23%). Foodservice training (OR, 3.89; 95% CI: 2.37C5.40), having on-site water storage facilities (OR, 4.65; 95% CI: 2.35C6.95), attitude (OR, 4.89; 95% CI: 1.39C8.29), hygiene and sanitary inspection certification (OR, 3.08; 95% CI: 1.62C4.45) were significantly associated with safe food handling practice among food handlers. CONCLUSION: This review identified that improvements are needed in food handling training, government regulation, and infrastructure. Standard regulations for food service enterprises must be implemented on a local and national level. Though long-term food safety requires legislation and training, failure to address infrastructure challenges can harm public health efforts. Access to safe drinking water and the presence of sanitary waste management systems should all be part of the basic infrastructure for ensuring the safety of food in food businesses.","output":"Food safety practice and associated factors in public food establishments of Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging non-invasive, targeted treatment of malignancy. The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy, safety and optimal technical parameters of HIFU to treat malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system. METHODS: A systematic search of the English literature was performed until March 2020, interrogating Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The following key-words were input in various combinations: 'HIFU', 'High intensity focussed ultrasound', 'Hepatobiliary', 'Liver', 'Cancer' and 'Carcinoma'. Extracted content included: Application type, Exposure parameters, Patient demographics, and Treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles reported on the clinical use of HIFU in 940 individuals to treat malignant liver lesions. Twenty-one studies detailed the use of HIFU to treat hepatocellular carcinoma only. Mean tumour size was 5.1 cm. Across all studies, HIFU resulted in complete tumour ablation in 55% of patients. Data on technical parameters and the procedural structure was very heterogeneous. Ten studies (n = 537 (57%) patients) described the use of HIFU alongside other modalities including TACE, RFA and PEI; 66% of which resulted in complete tumour ablation. Most common complications were skin burns (15%), local pain (5%) and fever (2%). CONCLUSION: HIFU has demonstrated benefit as a treatment modality for malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system. Combining HIFU with other ablative therapies, particularly TACE, increases the efficacy without increasing complications. Future human clinical studies are required to determine the optimal treatment parameters, better define outcomes and explore the risks and benefits of combination therapies.","output":"Systematic review of the role of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in treating malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the U.K.'s lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, both food shortages and stockpiling were well-publicised events.

Virtually all organs and biological systems suffer from this new coronavirus infection, either because the virus targets directly specific tissues or because of indirect effects. Endocrine diseases are not an exception and some of endocrine organs are at risk of direct or indirect lesion by COVID-19. Although there is still no evidence of higher predisposition to contract the infection in patients with diabetes and/or obesity, the coexistence of these conditions contributes to a worse prognosis because both conditions confer an impaired immunologic system. Cytokines storm can be amplified by these two latter conditions thereby leading to multisystemic failure and death. Glycaemic control has been demonstrated to be crucial to avoiding long hospital stays, ICU requirement and also prevention of excessive mortality. Endocrine treatment modifications as a consequence of COVID-19 infection are required in a proactive manner, in order to avoid decompensation and eventual hospital admission. This is the case of diabetes and adrenal insufficiency in which prompt increase of insulin dosage and substitutive adrenal steroids through adoption of the sick days rules should be warranted, as well as easy contact with the health care provider through telematic different modalities.

In this study, the lasso method has been applied to select variables affecting the recovery of the Covid-19 patients. The data consisted of the number of patients treated in several hospitals or clinics in China, recovered patients, demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and treatment. The performance of the lasso binary logistic regression was compared with the full model of logistic and the stepwise logistic regression. The results showed that the number of independent variables selected by the lasso method was larger than those selected by the stepwise method. It has also been showed that coefficient values of variables produced by the lasso method were smaller than those produced by the stepwise.

So far, the tumors in previous studies were mostly <3cm. We performed a previous pilot study with tumors >3cm (3-8cm) submitted to HoLERBT in 2019. All samples had detrusor muscle present and there were no peri-operative complications. These results support the present study to establish the best approach to endoscopic treatment of large bladder tumors. The objectives are to analyze differences between HoLERBT and TURBT in terms of presence of detrusor muscle in the histopathological analysis, intra-operative and peri-operative complications and oncological outcomes in large bladder tumors. Materials & Methods: This is a single-institution, randomized, single-blinded, prospective, controlled trial (RCT). The expected duration is of 24 months. The sample size calculated is 47 patients per group (n = 94). The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Board and was submitted to the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC). Inclusion criteria is bladder tumor >3cm by CT or MRI. The exclusion criteria are diagnosis of invasive tumor on image examination (CT, MRI), urethral stenosis, systemic or intra-vesical chemotherapy or previous radiotherapy. The outcomes analyzed are quality of detrusor muscle, intra-operative and immediate post-operative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS);clinical progression, recurrence-free, overall and cancer-specific survival at 24 months. Results: This is an ongoing trial that began in January 2020, was suspended for 5 months due to Covid-19, restarted recruitment in September 2020 and currently has 9 patients in the group HoLERBT and 11 patients in the group TURBT. The first surgery was in 01/21/20. The current data represents 22% of the estimated sample and the analysis is partial. The median age (years) was 55.8 (29-83) and 65.5 (46-84), the median tumor size (cm) was 3.4 (2.1-5.4) and 3.1 (2.1-5.7), the median time of surgery (min) was 29 (16-49) and 37.6 (13-60), the LOS (days) was 1.25 (1-3) and 2.0 (1-4), complications rates Clavien I was 11% and 36% and Clavien >I was 0% and 9% for HoLERBT and TURBT.

A characteristic feature of IBV is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes, which renders complete control of the disease by vaccination a challenging task due to the poor cross-protection between different serotypes. In this study, based on the results of S1 sequence analysis and virus cross-neutralization tests, IBV strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 was found to be genetically and antigenically different from other known IBV types, representing not only a novel genotype, but also a novel serotype (designated as GI-28). Viruses belonging to this novel serotype have been isolated from several regions in China in recent years, suggesting endemic circulation of the serotype in various geographic locations in China. Further studies by complete genomic analysis showed that strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 may have originated from recombination events involving LX4 genotype IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified IBV donating a S1 gene, or from the result of accumulation of mutations and selections, especially in the S1 gene, from a LX4 genotype virus. ck/CH/LGX/111119 is a nephropathogenic strain, although it had broader tissue tropism (respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts) among chickens challenged at one day old. Infection of the oviducts with ck/CH/LGX/111119 found in this study may have severe implications because the virus will likely induce the occurrence of false layers.","output":"Identification and molecular characterization of a novel serotype infectious bronchitis virus (GI-28) in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has placed human health under unprecedented issues since its outbreak in 2019.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether an innovative mHealth technology system with several overlapping purposes can impact (1) clinical outcomes (ie, readmission rates, revisit rates, and length of stay) and (2) patient-centered care outcomes (ie, patient engagement, patient experience, and patient satisfaction). METHODS: We compared all patients (2059 patients) of participating orthopedic surgeons using mHealth technology with all patients of nonparticipating orthopedic surgeons (2554 patients). The analyses included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were performed on categorical outcomes and a gamma-distributed model for continuous variables. All models were adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities. RESULTS: The inpatient readmission rates for the nonparticipating group when compared with the participating group were higher and demonstrated higher odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 106/2636, 4.02% and participating group 54/2048, 2.64%; OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.13; P=.04), 60-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 194/2636, 7.36% and participating group 85/2048, 4.15%; OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.39; P<.001), and 90-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 261/2636, 9.90% and participating group 115/2048, 5.62%; OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.34; P<.001). The length of stay for the nonparticipating cohort was longer at 1.90 days, whereas the length of stay for the participating cohort was 1.50 days (mean 1.87, SD 2 vs mean 1.50, SD 1.37; P<.001). Patients treated by participating surgeons received and read text messages using mHealth 83% of the time and read emails 84% of the time. Patients responded to 60% of the text messages and 53% of the email surveys. Patients were least responsive to digital monitoring questions when the hospital asked them to do something, and they were most engaged with emails that did not require action, including informational content. A total of 96% (558/580) of patients indicated high satisfaction with using mHealth technology to support their care. Only 0.40% (75/2059) patients opted-out of the mHealth technology program after enrollment.

The presence of asymptomatic subjects in the population, that are responsible for about 30% of the new infections, may complicate this phase. Serological tests for the measurement of immune response could represent an effective tool for the rapid monitoring of the population with asymptomatic infections and for estimating the proportion of immune in a territory, too. OBJECTIVES to describe the distribution of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population of the Municipality of Borgosesia (Piedmont Region, Northern Italy) and to estimate the efficacy of this strategy for the identification of asymptomatic cases.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS all subjects resident in Borgosesia over the age of 18, where invited to participate. A rapid serological test was administered to enrolled participants to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies on peripheral blood. Subjects with IgG or IgM positivity were offered to perform a swab test for viral RNA research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the prevalence of IgM and IgG, and the relative risks of having positive swab test and of having symptoms similar to those of COVID-19 in the recent past has been estimated.

Fundamental to this growing threat are multiple factors, including the increased public consumption for single-use plastics, limited or non-existence of adequate plastic waste management infrastructures, and urbanisation. Plastics-based personal protective equipment including millions of surgical masks, medical gowns, face shields, safety glasses, protective aprons, sanitiser containers, plastics shoes, and gloves have been widely used for the reduction of exposure risk to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This paper estimates and elucidates the growing plethora of plastic wastes in African countries in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral fingerprint indicates that face masks were characterised by natural and artificial fibres including polyester fibres, polypropylene, natural latex resin. Our estimate suggests that over 12 billion medical and fabric face masks are discarded monthly, giving the likelihood that an equivalent of about 105,000 tonnes of face masks per month could be disposed into the environment by Africans.

Dilation may be normal or due to biliary tract pathology. The purpose of this study is to review patients who underwent imaging of their biliary system both before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in an effort to elucidate the effect this operation has on hepatic duct diameter. METHODS Patients with imaging both before and at least 3 months after gastric bypass were analyzed. Hepatic duct was measured at the level of the porta hepatis to determine interval changes. RESULTS Thirty-three patients had postoperative imaging at least 3 months following gastric bypass. Mean hepatic duct diameter was 5.2  2 and 7.1  2.6 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients with prior cholecystectomy had hepatic duct diameters of 7.9  1.3 and 9.5  3.5 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p = 0.3). Patients who had not previously undergone cholecystectomy had hepatic duct diameters of 4.3  1.1 and 6.4  1.8 mm preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively (p < 0.01).

Moreover, epidemiology of GBS in Mexico differs from European and North American countries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, cerebrospinal and electrodiagnostic features in Mexican patients diagnosed with GBS and classify them according to the Brighton Collaboration Group diagnostic criteria. Patrients and methods. An ambispective cohort study was conducted. We included patients that fulfilled the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) diagnostic criteria for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patients in this study were classified according to Brighton collaboration group levels of certainty for Guillain-Barre syndrome. RESULTS: Sixty eight percent of patients were male. Of the 248 patients included, 58.4% had history of a precedent infection, mean time from symptom onset to admission was 5 (1-30) days. Mean Medical Research Council sum score 30.3  15.5. Almost 98% of patients had a monophasic course. Level 1 of certainty according to Brighton collaboration group criteria was fulfilled by 54.6% of patients, level 2 by 45% and level 4 by 0.6%. Patients meeting level 2 of certainty were mostly because normal cerebrospinal fluid findings or findings in nerve conduction studies not consistent with any GBS variants. CONCLUSION: GBS is a frequent autoimmune neuropathy that has been associated with preceding infections and with vaccination campaigns. For SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign in Mexico, validation of Brighton Criteria is necessary.

Immune compromised patients are among the high risk groups with poor prognosis of the disease. The presence of bacterial or fungal co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with increased mortality. Methods: The electronic data of the liver and kidney recipients, hospitalized in COVID-19 intensive care unit in an 8-month period in 2020 were retrospectively assessed. The documented bacterial or fungal infections alongside with outcome and risk factors were recorded and analyzed by binary logistic regression model and multivariate analyses. Results: Sixty-Six liver and kidney recipients were included this study. Twenty one percent of the patients had at least one episode of co-infection during their COVID-19 course. Bacterial and fungal co-infections contributed to a significantly higher mortality. Urine and sputum were the most common sites of pathogen isolation (45.45 % and 36.36%;respectively). The majority of infections were caused by vancomycin- resistant Enterococci (30%). Escherichia coli stood in the next position with 23.3%. Prior hospitalization and high does corticosteroid use were associated with co-infections (p=0<0.001 and p=0.02;respectively.) Conclusions: Bacterial and fungal co-infections with COVID-19 are more prevalent on solid organ recipients compared to the general population. Prior hospitalizations and use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents leads to emergence of multi-drug resistant pathogens in this susceptible patient population.

Malignant tumors characterized by increased proliferation also require new vasculature to provide an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients for developing tumor. Gliomas are among the most frequent primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by increased new vessel formation. The processes of neoangiogenesis, necessary for glioma development, are mediated by numerous growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. In contrast to other solid tumors, some biological conditions, such as the bloodCbrain barrier and the unique interplay between immune microenvironment and tumor, represent significant challenges in glioma therapy. Therefore, the objective of the study was to present the role of various proangiogenic factors in glioma angiogenesis as well as the differences between normal and tumoral angiogenesis. Another goal was to present novel therapeutic options in oncology approaches. We performed a thorough search via the PubMed database.

The service was implemented across a selection of community pharmacies in the Netherlands. Data were captured on test outcomes and through a pharmacist survey. Following testing, 17.8% of the clinical samples were recommended to avoid certain medication (based on their current medicines use), and 14.0% to have their dose adjusted. Pre-emptive analysis of genotyped patients showed that the majority (99.2%) had actionable variants. Pharmacists felt confident in their operational knowledge to deliver the service, but less so in applying that knowledge. Delivering the service was believed to improve relationships with other healthcare professionals. These results add to the evidence in understanding how PGx can be delivered effectively within the community pharmacy environment.

In this multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we sought to evaluate outcomes in patients with DDVT treated with warfarin versus direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran). METHODS: Queries were built on the TriNetX database, a federated network of healthcare organizations across the United States that provides de-identified patient data through aggregated counts and statistical summaries. ICD-10 diagnostic codes were used to identify eligible patients. Data from 01/01/2013-01/01/2020 was reviewed. Statistical analyses, including propensity matching, were performed with TriNetX's internal software. Inclusion criteria included starting treatment with either warfarin or a DOAC within the first 24 hours of diagnosis of isolated thrombosis of the following veins: anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal, or calf muscular veins. Exclusion criteria included history of adverse reaction to anticoagulants, SARS-CoV-2, thrombophilia, mechanical heart valve, chronic proximal DVT (PDVT) and/or DDVT, and 6-month history of the following: acute PDVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), or anticoagulant usage. Outcomes measured were incidences of mortality, PE, PDVT, stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and major bleeding within six months after initiating anticoagulation. RESULTS: In a cohort of 6509 patients, 1570 were treated with warfarin and 4939 were treated with a DOAC. After propensity matching for age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities, the DOACs cohort had a significantly lower incidence of PE (1.795% vs 3.590%; p=0.0020) and major bleeding (7.949% vs 10.513%; p=0.0134). Differences in incidences of mortality, PDVT, MI, and stroke were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to this study, there has been no strong evidence to suggest an optimal treatment modality for DDVT in need of anticoagulation. These data suggests patients receiving DOACs for treatment of DDVT have significantly lower rates of progression to PE and lower incidence of major bleeding when compared to patients receiving warfarin. This suggests that DOACs are superior to warfarin for treatment of DDVT.","output":"Warfarin Versus Direct Oral Anticoagulants For Patients Needing Treatment For Distal Deep Vein Thrombosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In open inguinal hernia repair self-gripping meshes are currently commonly employed. Assumed benefits are saving of time, ease of handling and omission of fixation. Self-gripping meshes are, however, not as easy to handle and position as commonly stated. We describe a newly developed way of intra-operative mesh preparation and implantation and compare it to the conventional technique of insertion of self-gripping meshes. METHODS A two-armed, randomized trial with 64 patients was performed. For implantation of the self-gripping, light weight and partially absorbable mesh we used either a newly described rolling technique (group 1: n = 32) or the conventional way of insertion (group 2: n = 32). Primary endpoints of the study were feasibility with regard to actual implantation time and surgeons' satisfaction with the methods. Secondary endpoints were total operating time, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, duration of pain medication intake and postoperative morbidity. In addition all patients were prospectively followed up according to the Hernia Med? registry's standards. RESULTS Implantation time (seconds) 140  74 vs. 187  84, p = 0.008, duration of pain medication intake (days) 3.6  2.8 vs. 4.8  2.6; p = 0.046 and postoperative morbidity 2 (6%) vs. 8 (25%) was significantly beneficial in group 1 (rolling technique) compared to group 2 (conventional method). Blinded questionnaire revealed that rolling the mesh is generally easier with less repositioning maneuvers than conventional placement. Neither overall procedure time, length of stay nor postoperative pain scores differed significantly between groups. CONCLUSION The newly introduced rolling technique for the actual placement of self-gripping meshes in open inguinal hernia repair is technically less demanding and therefore significantly faster when compared to the conventional way of insertion of the same product. In addition the rolling technique has shown to be safe for the patients and to also provide higher surgeons' satisfaction.","output":"Rail or roll: a new, convenient and safe way to position self-gripping meshes in open inguinal hernia repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: All-cause mortality and estimates of excess deaths are commonly used in different countries to estimate the burden of COVID-19 and assess its direct and indirect effects. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan in April-December 2020. METHODS: Official data on deaths in Jordan for 2020 and previous years (2016-2019) were obtained from the Department of Civil Status. We contrasted mortality rates in 2020 with those in each year and the pooled period 2016-2020 using a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) measure. Expected deaths for 2020 were estimated by fitting the overdispersed Poisson generalized linear models to the monthly death counts for the period of 2016-2019. RESULTS: Overall, a 21% increase in standardized mortality (SMR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19-1.22) occurred in April-December 2020 compared with the April-December months in the pooled period 2016-2019. The SMR was more pronounced for men than for women (SMR 1.26, 95% CI 1.24-1.29 vs SMR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10-1.14), and it was statistically significant for both genders (P<.05). Using overdispersed Poisson generalized linear models, the number of expected deaths in April-December 2020 was 12,845 (7957 for women and 4888 for men). The total number of excess deaths during this period was estimated at 4583 (95% CI 4451-4716), with higher excess deaths in men (3112, 95% CI 3003-3221) than in women (1503, 95% CI 1427-1579). Almost 83.66% of excess deaths were attributed to COVID-19 in the Ministry of Health database. The vast majority of excess deaths occurred in people aged 60 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: The reported COVID-19 death counts underestimated mortality attributable to COVID-19. Excess deaths could reflect the increased deaths secondary to the pandemic and its containment measures. The majority of excess deaths occurred among old age groups.

An underlying assumption is that irradiation of about 1 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. Its rationale, however, relies on early human case series or animal studies mostly obtained in the pre-antibiotic era, where rigorous statistical analyses were not performed. It therefore remains unclear whether those early data support such assumptions. With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature review, we re-analyzed 14 radiobiological animal datasets in which animals received mostly fractionated doses of radiation before or after bacterial/viral inoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality, pneumonia morbidity). In most datasets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. Various different model systems and types of challenging infection are considered. For 7 studies that evaluated post-inoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with 2 studies showing a significant increase (p<0.001) and another showing a significant decrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. For pre-inoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with 6 datasets showing a significant increase (p<0.01) in mortality risk associated with radiation exposure and the other 2 showing a significant decrease (p<0.05) in mortality risk. Collectively, these data do not provide clear support for reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation exposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction of effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, one must be cautious about adducing evidence from the published reports of these old animal datasets.","output":"Pneumonia after bacterial or viral infection preceded or followed by radiation exposure -- a reanalysis of older radiobiological data and implications for low dose radiotherapy for COVID-19 pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We describe a large multi-center experience of COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury, examining the prognostic role left ventricular function plays on short-term outcomes. METHODS/MATERIALS: We included adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our health system with evidence of myocardial injury and who underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during index admission. Patients were dichotomized into those with reduced ejection fraction (EF; <50%) and preserved EF (&#8805;50%). RESULTS: Across our 11-hospital system, 5032 adult patients were admitted with COVID-19 from March-September 2020. Of these, 235 had evidence of myocardial injury (troponin &#8805;1 ng/mL). Included were 134 patients who underwent TTE, of whom 43.3% (n = 58) had reduced EF and 56.7% (n = 76) preserved EF. A subset of 6 patients had newly reduced EF, with 5 demonstrating evidence of stress cardiomyopathy and subsequently dying. Overall, mortality was high in those with reduced EF and preserved EF (in-hospital: 34.5% vs. 28.9%; p = 0.494; 6 months: 63.6% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.167; Kaplan-Meier estimates: p = 0.2886).

Remote triage and consultations became the default, with adapted face-to-face contact used only when clinically necessary. Face-to-face delivery modifications were decided locally and this study aimed to identify the different models used nationwide in spring/summer 2020. Methods: In June 2020, a survey was sent by email to the 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) responsible for planning and commissioning NHS health care services in England to identify the local organisation of face-to-face general practice consultations since March 2020. Results: 1. zoned practices (used within 47% of CCGs), where COVID-19 and other patients were separated within their own practice; 2. hot or cold hubs (used within 90% of CCGs), separate sites where COVID-19 or other patients registered at one of several collaborating practices were seen; 3. hot and cold home visits (used within 70% of CCGs). For around half of CCGs, either all their GP practices used zoning, or all used hubs; in other CCGs, both models were used. Demand-led hub availability offered flexibility in some areas. Home visits were mainly used supplementally for patients unable to access other services, but in two CCGs, they were the main/only form of COVID-19 provision.

Early tracheostomy was defined as performed on postoperative days 1C10 and late tracheostomy on days 10C20 after operation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the characteristics and outcomes between both cohorts. A total of 143 patients were identified, and 96 patients received early tracheostomy. Multivariable analysis identified early tracheostomy as an independent variable associated with lower occurrence of pneumonia (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09C0.73; p = 0.011), shorter stays in ICUs (hazard ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3C0.6; p = 0.03), and earlier decannulation (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4C0.8; p = 0.003).

We sought to characterize the rates of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in patients with COVID-19 ARDS as a function of coexisting AKI. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all patients with severe COVID-19 infection, admitted to ICU level of care between 3/1/2020 and 6/1/2020, and we obtained patient data through the Research Patient Data Registry. We excluded patients who did not develop AKI, those who were admitted with a primary medical problem unrelated to coexisting COVID-19 infection, and those with end stage renal disease. We stratified patients into two cohorts: Those with AKI not requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) and AKI requiring RRT.

All data was analyzed using Excel and R version 4.0.1 (2020-06-06) when comparing groups-medians and interquartile ranges are reported. Pearson's Chi-squared test was used during statistical analysis. Results: 272 patients were identified, of which 136 patients were excluded from further study due to reasons as above. Of the remaining 136 patients analyzed, all developed AKI as per AKIN criteria, and we identified those who did not require RRT (100), and those who were initiated on RRT (36). Median age was 66  9.75, and 57  7.12, respectively. 38% (38/100) and 27.7% (10/36) were female, respectively.

METHODS: Here, two novel DNA-based (pVAXzenv) and fowlpox-based (FPzenv) recombinant putative vaccine candidates were constructed that contained the cPrME genes of ZIKV. The env gene inserted into the fowlpox vector was verified for correct transgene expression by Western blotting and by immunofluorescence in different cell lines. The production of virus-like particles as a result of env gene expression was also demonstrated by electron microscopy. BALB/c mice were immunosuppressed with dexamethasone and immunized following a primeCboost strategy in a heterologous protocol where pVAXzenv was followed by FPzenv, to evaluate the immunogenicity of the Env protein. The mice underwent a challenge with an epidemic ZIKV after the last boost. RESULTS: These data show that the ZIKV Env protein was correctly expressed in both normal human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) and green monkey kidney (Vero) cells infected with FPzenv, and that the transgene expression lasted for more than 2 weeks. After mucosal administration of FPzenv, the immunized mice showed specific and significantly higher humoral responses compared to the control mice. However, virus neutralizing antibodies were not detected using plaque reduction assays.

Among those who remained unvaccinated at follow\\\\up, 38% who were vaccine hesitant at baseline were considering vaccination compared to 71% who were not vaccine hesitant (aRR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.67). Individuals who were older, parous, employed, and of higher educational attainment were more likely to be vaccinated, and those who identified as non\\\\Hispanic Black, were Medicaid beneficiaries, and still pregnant at follow\\\\up were less likely to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: COVID\\\\19 vaccine hesitancy persisted over time in the peripartum period, and few individuals who reported hesitancy at baseline were later vaccinated. Interventions that address vaccine hesitancy in pregnancy are needed. FUNDING: Ms. Germann was supported by the New York Academy of Medicine David E. Rogers Fellowship Program.

Minimal data are available from adequately powered randomized, controlled trials. METHODS: We randomly assigned hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in a 2:1 ratio to receive convalescent plasma or placebo. The primary outcome was the patients clinical status 30 days after the intervention, as measured on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from total recovery to death. RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were assigned to receive convalescent plasma and 105 to receive placebo. The median time from the onset of symptoms to enrollment in the trial was 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10), and hypoxemia was the most frequent severity criterion for enrollment. The infused convalescent plasma had a median titer of 1:3200 of total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (interquartile range, 1:800 to 1:3200]. No patients were lost to follow-up. At day 30 day, no significant difference was noted between the convalescent plasma group and the placebo group in the distribution of clinical outcomes according to the ordinal scale (odds ratio, 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52 to 1.35; P=0.46).

To aid in alleviating that demand, a survey of commercially available filter media was conducted to determine whether any could serve as a substitute for an N95 FFR while held in a 3D-printed mask (Stopgap Surgical Face Mask from the NIH 3D Print Exchange). Fourteen filter media types and eight combinations were evaluated for filtration efficiency, breathing resistance (pressure drop), and liquid penetration. Additional testing was conducted to evaluate two filter media disinfection methods in the event that the filters were reused in a hospital setting. Efficiency testing was conducted in accordance with the procedures established for approving an N95 FFR. One apparatus used a filter-holding device and another apparatus employed a manikin head to which the 3D-printed mask could be sealed. The filter media and combinations exhibited collection efficiencies varied between 3.9% and 98.8% when tested with a face velocity comparable to that of a standard N95 FFR at the 85 L min-1 used in the approval procedure. Breathing resistance varied between 10.8 to >637 Pa (1.1 to > 65 mm H2O). When applied to the 3D-printed mask efficiency decreased by an average of 13% and breathing resistance increased 4-fold as a result of the smaller surface area of the filter media when held in that mask compared to that of an N95 FFR. Disinfection by dry heat, even after 25 cycles, did not significantly affect filter efficiency and reduced viral infectivity by > 99.9%. However, 10 cycles of 59% vaporized H2O2 significantly (p < 0.001) reduced filter efficiency of the media tested. Several commercially available filter media were found to be potential replacements for the media used to construct the typical cup-like N95 FFR.

Spontaneous air leaks have been reported in patients with COVID-19. We report on a phenomenon of significant chest air-leak manifestations on a cohort of critically unwell intubated COVID-19 patients in our single centre. METHODS: All patients admitted to our single-centre intensive care unit during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK were identified. Individual electronic notes and imaging were screened to look for complications of: surgical emphysema, pneumomediastinum and/or pneumothorax. RESULTS: 158 patients were admitted to our intensive care and eleven (7.0%) of patients were found to have suffered air leak complications unrelated to line insertion. Five suffered surgical emphysema only, one surgical emphysema with pneumomediastinum and two with the full triad of surgical emphysema, pneumomediastinum & pneumothorax. Two patients had unilateral pneumothoraces and one patient experienced a tension pneumothorax. Four patients were managed conservatively and seven had chest drains inserted. Overall outcomes were: one patient was discharged home, one discharged to ward, two transferred to an outside hospital and seven died. CONCLUSION: Air-leak complications in COVID-19 patients, both spontaneous and ventilation associated are an under-recognised phenomenon. In the critically ill population literature suggests there is a > 5% incidence and risk reduction strategies should be considered. We advocate for early diagnosis and decompressive therapy with chest drains to avoid tamponade in intubated patients.

Understanding the interaction patterns between a particular virus and human proteins plays a crucial role in unveiling the underlying mechanism of viral infection and pathogenesis. This could further help in the prevention and treatment of virus-related diseases. However, the task of predicting protein-protein interactions between a new virus and human cells is extremely challenging due to scarce data on virus-human interactions and fast mutation rates of most viruses. We developed a multitask transfer learning approach that exploits the information of around 24 million protein sequences and the interaction patterns from the human interactome to counter the problem of small training datasets. Instead of using hand-crafted protein features, we utilize statistically rich protein representations learned by a deep language modeling approach from a massive source of protein sequences. Additionally, we employ an additional objective which aims to maximize the probability of observing human protein-protein interactions. This additional task objective acts as a regularizer and also allows to incorporate domain knowledge to inform the virus-human protein-protein interaction prediction model. Our approach achieved competitive results on 13 benchmark datasets and the case study for the SAR-CoV-2 virus receptor.

Recently, many low-cost and easy-to-use rapid test kits (RTK) have been developed in many countries for the massive screening of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, evaluating the accuracy and reliability of an RTK is critical. The current study was conducted on 157 individuals to evaluate the performance accuracy of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection kits using different clinical samples compared with qRT-PCR results. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients for qRT-PCR and RTK tests, and then buccal and nasal, and nasal swabs were collected for RTK tests separately. The nasal and buccal swabs showed high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%) compared with the qRT-PCR results. Meanwhile, for nasal, the sensitivity was 96% with 98% specificity, and nasopharyngeal swabs showed 98% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Fisher's exact test revealed statistical significance (p < 0.05) between nasopharyngeal, nasal and buccal, and nasal swabs compared with qRT-PCR results. The study concludes that different clinical samples used for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 showed high sensitivities and specificities compared with qRT-PCR. The RTKs using nasal and buccal, nasopharyngeal, and nasal swabs are valuable tools for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2, especially when molecular detections are available with limited access and a high infectivity rate, when the timely detection of virus cases is urgently needed.

As of 11 th June 2020, Ghana had recorded over 11,000 cases with 48 deaths. This study seeks to provide a micro-level evidence on how COVID-19 is posing a threat to some of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty and hunger in Ghana. Specifically, the study examined the effect of COVID-19 on poverty and living standards of Ghanaian households. It also analyzed which class of persons within the income distributions is mostly hit by the pandemic. Data on 3,905 households were obtained via concurrent online survey and telephone interviews. Multiple analytical approaches were employed: Ordinary least squares, probit model and simultaneous quantile regressions. The results showed that COVID-19 had significantly increased the poverty levels of households, while deteriorating living standards. The study also showed that gender and locational heterogeneities exist regarding the impact of COVID-19 with females and rural dwellers mostly disadvantaged. However, the simultaneous quantile regression showed that in terms of overall household consumption, those in the middle and upper classes were heavily affected compared to those in the lowest class. A key policy implication from this study is that Ghana needs to broaden its social protection programmes to assist both the new poor and existing poor.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on poverty and living standards in Ghana: A micro perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryptosporidiosis is an extensively contagious zoonotic waterborne disease caused by the genus Cryptosporidium and poses to be a danger to public health. Sheep and goats are an intermediate host of Cryptosporidium. Consequently, a first systematic review and meta-analysis are performed to assess the burden of the infection relative to the Cryptosporidium in sheep and goat flocks in China. Five databases were searched for relevant literature in accordance with the inclusion criteria until January 30, 2020. At last, a total of 33 qualified documents were included. We calculate the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium (4.9%) in sheep and goats in China with the random-effects model. The prevalence after 2014 (4.6%) was higher than that before or in 2014 (2.8%). The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in sheep and goats from Northern China (12.3%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than other regions. The infection rate of modified acid-fast staining (14.3%) was the highest among the detection methods. In age subgroups, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in sheep and goats in 3 months or before was the highest (20.8%). Goats had a higher infection rate (5.9%) in species. The prevalence of large-scale farms (2.8%) was lower than free-ranging farms (4.4%). The medium quality level (6.4%) was the highest. Besides, geographical factors (such as latitude, longitude, height, precipitation, humidity, mean temperature, etc.) were further analyzed as potential risk factors of Cryptosporidium in sheep and goats. This meta-analysis indicates that the Cryptosporidium infection of Chinese sheep and goat flocks is general. Thus, it is necessary to further monitor the prevalence of Cryptosporidium, and the reasonable preventive strategy should be formulated on the basis of the geographical factors of different regions and the differences in sheep and goats' growth stages to reduce the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in sheep and goats.","output":"Prevalence of Cryptosporidium Infection in Sheep and Goat Flocks in China During 2010-2019: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To reflect on the relationship between the nomophobia and the pandemic of COVID-19 and the nursing contributions to deal with this issue and its consequences.

Here, we report a novel, recessive syndrome associated with PRDM13 mutation. Patients exhibited intellectual disability, ataxia with cerebellar hypoplasia, scoliosis and delayed puberty with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH). Expression studies revealed Prdm13/PRDM13 transcripts in the developing hypothalamus and cerebellum in mouse and human. We investigated the development of hypothalamic neurons and the cerebellum in mice homozygous for a Prdm13 mutant allele. A significant reduction in the number of Kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the hypothalamus and PAX2+ progenitors emerging from the cerebellar ventricular zone were observed. The latter was accompanied by ectopic expression of the glutamatergic lineage marker TLX3. Phenotypically, mice lacking PRDM13 displayed cerebellar hypoplasia, normal gonadal structure, but delayed pubertal onset. Together, these findings identify PRDM13 as a critical regulator of GABAergic cell fate in the cerebellum and of kisspeptin neuron development in the hypothalamus, providing a mechanistic explanation for the co-occurrence of CHH and cerebellar hypoplasia in this syndrome.

Survey responses were summarized, and multiple correspondence analysis was used to map responses and identify data clusters. At the time of the survey, some respondents suspected (3%) or had confirmed (9%) COVID-19 cases on their premises. Respondents were somewhat or very concerned about the health (75%) and business (92%) implications associated with COVID-19. Producers were concerned about the health of their families, employees, and employees' families; having to reduce production; workforce shortage; limited goods availability; and lack of services. Producers perceived that their employees were somewhat or very concerned (74%) with the pandemic. There was COVID-19 safety information or training provided (78%) or intended (4%) in English (22%), Spanish (23%), or both (55%). The focus of training was as follows: how to remain healthy at work (91%) and at home (60%), what to do if a worker gets sick (77%), and sick leave information (54%). Nevertheless, 18% of the respondents answered that training was not going to be provided. The following control measures implemented: providing hand sanitizer or disinfectant wipes (78%), instruction on frequent hand-washing (76%), social distancing (59%), prevention of employee gatherings (54%), providing and requiring the use of face masks (49%), and limiting on-farm visitors (44%). Multiple correspondence analysis showed that concern with health risk and business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as mitigation and response strategies implemented, varied based on respondent's dairy size and state.

Metabolic complications, nutritional aspects, physical inactivity, and a chronic unbalance in the hormonal and adipocytokine microenvironment are major determinants in the severity of viral infections in obesity. By these pleiotropic mechanisms obesity impairs immune surveillance and the higher leptin concentrations produced by adipose tissue and that characterize obesity substantially contribute to such immune response dysregulation. Indeed, leptin not only controls energy balance and body weight, but also plays a regulatory role in the interplay between energy metabolism and immune system. Since leptin receptor is expressed throughout the immune system, leptin may exert effects on cells of both innate and adaptive immune system. Chronic inflammatory states due to metabolic (i.e., obesity) as well as infectious diseases increase leptin concentrations and consequently lead to leptin resistance further fueling inflammation. Multiple factors, including inflammation and ER stress, contribute to leptin resistance. Thus, if leptin is recognized as one of the adipokines responsible for the low grade inflammation found in obesity, on the other hand, impairments of leptin signaling due to leptin resistance appear to blunt the immunologic effects of leptin and possibly contribute to impaired vaccine-induced immune responses. However, many aspects concerning leptin interactions with inflammation and immune system as well as the therapeutical approaches to overcome leptin resistance and reduced vaccine effectiveness in obesity remain a challenge for future research.","output":"Susceptibility and Severity of Viral Infections in Obesity: Lessons from Influenza to COVID-19.

METHODS: Data come from an online cohort of PrEP-using MSM in the Southern United States from October 2019 to July 2020. Participants were administered ten surveys in total, including one ad hoc survey specifically on COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of this ad hoc survey (n=56) and present changes in sexual behaviors and utilization of and access to sexual health services. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, we also analyzed data from the larger cohort (n=78) and document how sexual behaviors and PrEP use varied longitudinally focusing on three months: February (pre-pandemic), April (early pandemic), and June (later in the pandemic). RESULTS: A fifth of participants discontinued or changed how often they take PrEP because of COVID-19. A quarter of the cohort documented challenges when attempting to access PrEP, HIV testing, or STD testing. For all sexual behaviors examined longitudinallynumber of male sexual partners, anal sex acts, condomless anal sex, oral sex (all measured in the past 2 weeks)there was a significant decrease from February to April followed by a significant increase from April to June.

Meanwhile, mitigation of the pandemic has focused on limiting social contacts (lockdowns, regulations on gatherings) and decreasing transmission risk through mask wearing and social distancing. Using a mathematical model, we show that the competitive advantage of disease variants may heavily depend on the restrictions imposed. In particular, we find that lockdowns exert an evolutionary pressure which favours variants with lower levels of overdispersion.

Hospitals were asked about their treatment strategies for elective PCI and emergency PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and high-risk acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Most hospitals opted to perform primary PCI in the usual manner at the beginning of the pandemic. As the pandemic progressed, hospitals in the 7 populated areas downgraded the performance of PCI for chronic coronary syndrome and high-risk ACS, but not for STEMI patients. After the state of emergency was lifted in most prefectures in mid-May, the rate of PCI gradually normalized.

Due to a rise in telemedicine use by doctors and patients, it is imperative to understand the perception of patients towards the adoption of telemedicine, the availability of telemedicine to the general population, the frequency with which patients avail these services, and the motivation or apprehensions in using them, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: The study is performed to understand the behavioral attitude and perceptions of the population regarding telemedicine and, in doing so, make services more user-friendly for patients. METHODS: A total of 1170 participants were surveyed using a structured online questionnaire to assess the perceptions towards the adoption of telemedicine in healthcare delivery services. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify key variables of knowledge and attitude affecting the utilization of telemedicine. RESULTS: Of the total respondents, 35.3% of patients never encountered telemedicine before and 26.9% did not come across telemedicine even during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Understanding the perceptions of patients, using targeted health education, positive communication, and behavioral modifications, is the key factor to be addressed to mitigate the apprehensions towards telemedicine and improve the utilization of the services.","output":"Attitudes and perceptions of outpatients towards adoption of telemedicine in healthcare during COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study of interleukin-17 (IL-17) has gotten a lot of attention in the last decade because of the cytokine's role in psoriasis and other autoinflammatory disorders, as well as the success of IL-17-targeting therapy in patients with these diseases.

Online cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) programs provide scalable access to psychological interventions, however the effectiveness of these programs during the pandemic has not been investigated. This study examined the uptake and effectiveness of iCBT for symptoms of anxiety and depression during the first eight months of the pandemic in Australia (March- October 2020) and compared outcomes to the 12 months prior to COVID-19. METHODS: 6,132 adults commenced iCBT (5,074 during the pandemic and 1,058 in the year before) and completed measures of anxiety and depression symptom severity, and psychological distress pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: In the COVID-19 period, we observed a 504% increase in the number of monthly course registrations compared to the year prior (with a peak increase of 1,138% between April and June 2020). Baseline anxiety and depression symptom severity were similar for the COVID and pre-COVID groups. Prior to and during the pandemic, the iCBT course was associated with large effect size reductions in anxiety (g = 0.94-1.18) and depression (g = 0.92-1.12) symptom severity, as well as psychological distress (g = 1.08-1.35). LIMITATIONS: lack of control group and long-term follow-up, as well as lack of detailed information about course users (e.g., health status and life context).

Point-of-care rapid antigen tests have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use among symptomatic individuals, as an alternative to the gold standard PCR-based tests (which have a much longer turnaround time). Inaccurate test results can detrimentally affect the spread of infection. In this study, we assessed false positives and false negatives reported for COVID-19 rapid antigen tests with Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs), using FDAs Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database (a repository of deidentified reports of issues associated with authorized medical devices). Methods: The MAUDE database was queried for reports of false positives or false negatives associated with COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, from the date of the first EUA (05/08/2020) through 12/31/2020. When noted in the MAUDE report, off-label use of the test was recorded. Results: Five of the 11 authorized rapid antigen tests had false positive or false negative reports in the MAUDE database. Of the total 1816 reports, 1725 (95.0%) were false positives and 91 (5.0%) were false negatives. Off-label use in asymptomatic individuals was noted in 1024 (56.4%) reports. Conclusions: Our study found that nearly all erroneous results with rapid antigen tests reported to MAUDE were false positives, and half involved samples from asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that false negatives, which are more consequential for virus transmission, occur infrequently with rapid antigen tests. Limitations of this study include potential under-reporting to MAUDE, the unknown denominator of COVID-19 tests, and the inability to establish device malfunction in relation to aberrant results. This analysis provides important new insights into real-world use of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests and the potential negative ramifications of off-label use.","output":"PRS30 COVID-19 RAPID Antigen Test False Positives and False Negatives Reported to the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Broke out at the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has been spreading throughout the world, leading to more than 87 million confirmed infections and 1 88 million fatalities Motivated by this, we evaluate the economic impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on both national and industrial levels by employing quarterly computable general equilibrium (CGE) model Our results reveal that the epidemic may lower China's economic growth in 2020 by 3 5%, versus 4 4% for final consumption (relative to baseline) The service industry suffers the most from the outbreak, and the Accommodation-Food-Beverage service, Wholesale-Retail Trade, and Transport-Storage-Post are identified as the most vulnerable sectors, with the negative impact on output reaching as high as 14 6% When moving to 2021, the hit to economy shrinks to 2% (1 2C2 7%), with industry estimated to be the most affected sector instead This study indicates that implementing effective measures for preventing and controlling the epidemic and policies for post-disease economic recovery play critical role in curbing the potential economic damage","output":"The hit of the novel coronavirus outbreak to China's economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to describe how the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has affected pregnancy, prenatal maternity care practices, and infant feeding plans among pregnant persons in the United States STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study using an app-based survey METHODS: A link to the survey was sent via email to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app on May 20, 2020 and was open for 1 week Participants were asked to complete the survey as it applied to their pregnancy, breastfeeding, and maternity care received during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning approximately February 2020 through the time of the survey There were 258 respondents who completed the survey RESULTS: The majority (96 4%;n = 251) of pregnant women felt they received safe prenatal care during this time period Slightly less 86 3% (n = 215) felt they received adequate prenatal care during this time period 14 2% (n = 33) reported changing or considering changing the location where they planned to give birth due to COVID-19 Of those who reported they had begun purchasing items for their baby, 52 7% reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their ability to get items they need for their baby CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although it is imperative to implement policies that reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19 to pregnant women and health care providers, it is necessary for healthcare providers and policy makers to listen to the collective voices of women during pregnancy about how COVID-19 has affected their birth and infant feeding plans and their perception of changes in prenatal care","output":"Pregnant Women's Reports of the Impact of COVID-19 on Pregnancy, Prenatal Care, and Infant Feeding Plans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim: To investigate the causes of the negative impact of diabetes mellitus co-morbidity on the onset and development of COVID-19 in diabetic patients.

Currently available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigens (Ag) have sensitivity well below PCR. The correlation of Ag and RNA quantities in clinical nasopharyngeal (NP) samples is unknown. An ultrasensitive, quantitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (the MSD S-PLEX SARS-CoV-2 N assay) was used to measure Ag in clinical NP samples from adults and children previously tested by PCR. The S-PLEX Ag assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.16 pg/ml and a cutoff of 0.32 pg/ml. Ag concentrations measured in clinical NP samples (collected in 3.0 ml of media) ranged from less than 160 fg/ml to 2.7 g/ml. Log-transformed Ag concentrations correlated tightly with CT values. In 35 adult and 101 pediatric PCR-positive samples, the sensitivities were 91% (95% confidence interval, 77 to 98%) and 79% (70 to 87%), respectively. In samples with a CT of &#8804;35, the sensitivities were 100% (88 to 100%) and 96% (88 to 99%), respectively. In 50 adult and 40 pediatric PCR-negative specimens, the specificities were 100% (93 to 100%) and 98% (87 to 100%), respectively.

Hence the extent of likely excess healthcare needs during this period must be fully considered. We will make use of the historical healthcare record in Taiwan during and after the 1918 influenza pandemic to ascertain the scope of potential excess healthcare burden during the post-pandemic period. METHODS: To establish the healthcare needs after the initial wave in 1918, the yearly healthcare records (hospitalizations, outpatients, etc.) in Taiwan during 1918-1920 are compared with the corresponding data from the adjacent \\"baseline\\" years of 1916, 1917, 1921, and 1922 to estimate the excess healthcare burden during the initial outbreak in 1918 and in the years immediately after. RESULTS: In 1918 the number of public hospital outpatients exceeded the yearly average of the baseline years by 20.11% (95% CI: 16.43, 25.90), and the number of hospitalizations exceeded the corresponding yearly average of the baseline years by 12.20% (10.59, 14.38), while the excess number of patients treated by the public medics was statistically significant at 32.21% (28.48, 39.82) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. For 1920, only the excess number of hospitalizations was statistically significant at 19.83% (95% CI: 17.21, 23.38) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable extra burden with significant loss of lives was reported in 1918 by both the public medics system and the public hospitals. In comparison, only a substantial number of excess hospitalizations in the public hospitals was reported in 1920, indicating that the population was relatively unprepared for the first wave in 1918 and did not fully utilize the public hospitals. Moreover, comparatively low mortality was reported by the public hospitals and the public medics during the second wave in 1920 even though significantly more patients were hospitalized, suggesting that there had been substantially less fatal illnesses among the hospitalized patients during the second wave. Our results provide viable parameters for assessing healthcare needs for post-pandemic preparedness.","output":"Excess healthcare burden during 1918-1920 influenza pandemic in Taiwan: implications for post-pandemic preparedness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin B6 (VB6) is essential to heme synthesis, and its deficiency can lead to anemia.

As an opioid medication, concerns have arisen regarding the potential for impairment and any effects that this would have on an employee's ability to safely perform job duties. While there are no definitive guidelines on the use of buprenorphine for those employed in safety-sensitive lines of work, most employers do not permit its use under any circumstance due to the potential risk of harm to the public. In addition to overlooking the fact that buprenorphine is a well-established and life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), there are many flaws in making this determination. For one, buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid agonist which makes it inherently unique in comparison to other opioids. Most studies on impairment have examined acute use of full agonist opioids instead of chronic dosing of buprenorphine. Furthermore, assessments of impairment are not tailored to the tasks required of specific positions. Importantly, policies banning buprenorphine may contribute to treatment discontinuation and stigma, which can lead to relapse and overdose. Considering the morbidity and mortality associated with OUD, along with the surge in overdose deaths during the COVID19 pandemic, buprenorphine policies should be considered carefully. Given the lack of evidence showing definitive and specific impairments as a result of chronic buprenorphine use, coupled with the consequences of universal bans on its use, determinations on the permissibility of buprenorphine treatment for safety-sensitive positions should be made on a case-by-case basis.","output":"Buprenorphine in safety-sensitive positions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High altitude sojourn is a risk factor for hypobaric hypoxemia and subsequent altitude sickness.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are associated with significant clinical benefit but may not result in significant tumor size reduction. Thus standard size-based response assessment with RECIST is insensitive, resulting in low response rates which do not reflect disease control measured by time to progression. We compared the use of combined size and density response criteria with standard size based criteria in metastatic RCC patients treated with TKI's. RESULTS Partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) defined by modified criteria successfully identified patients with a long TTP (448 days) or short TTP (89 days) respectively (p = 0.002). Neither RECIST nor standard Choi criteria successfully discriminated between patients having a short or long clinical benefit. PATIENTS AND METHODS CT scans from 32 patients with metastatic RCC treated with either sunitinib (18) or cediranib (14) were assessed. Twelve patients were excluded from the analysis as ten had non-contrast enhanced scans due to renal impairment and two stopped treatment due to toxicity. Scans from 20 evaluable patients at baseline and 12 w on treatment were assessed using RECIST, Choi and modified criteria in which both a 10% decrease in size and 15% decrease in density were required to define a partial response (PR). Response assessment performed using each of the three methods was compared with time to disease progression (TTP) defined by RECIST using Kaplan-Meier statistics and Log-rank test with significance at 5%.

Viral-infection models were created in CD-1 mice and Wistar rats. Three strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus were tested for the performance in these models. One virus strain is the molecularly cloned attenuated vaccine. The second strain has major virulence determinants converted to the wild-type state which are present in virulent strains. The third virus has wild-type virulence determinants, and in addition, is engineered to express green fluorescent protein. Experimentally infected animals received Tilorone or Cridanimod, and their treatment was equivalent to the pharmacopoeia-recomended human treatment regimen.

This study determines the clinical and demographic parameters associated with severe acute disease and chronic complications from COVID\\\\19 in the pediatric population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of all patients between birth and 21 years of age who were positive for SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and were admitted to two tertiary care hospitals between March 1, 2020, and January 21, 2021. Markers for severe disease were defined as supplemental oxygen requirement, positive pressure ventilation, and acute chest radiograph abnormality at presentation. Chronic disease was defined as symptoms persisting >4 weeks. RESULTS: Review of 101 patients with positive SARS\\\\CoV2 testing found 67 presentations consistent with acute symptomatic infection. Age distribution was bimodal, with predominance in infancy and adolescence. Most (75%) had an extrapulmonary comorbidity, and fewer patients (33%) had pre\\\\existing lung disease. A history of pulmonary comorbidity and obesity was significantly associated with markers for severe disease. Long\\\\term chronic complications were associated with history of underlying lung disease and acute severe COVID\\\\19.

Methods: We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). The PASC symptom lexicon incorporated Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of the lexicon and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. Results: The PASC symptom lexicon included 355 symptoms consolidated from 1,520 UMLS concepts. NLP achieved an averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%), fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal reflux (18.6%). Discussion and Conclusion: PASC symptoms are diverse. A comprehensive PASC symptom lexicon can be derived using a data-driven, ontology-driven and NLP-assisted approach.

Pediatric and adult ED patients in a high volume New York City hospital (N = 295) were randomized to receive a face-to-face HIV test offer, or to complete a tablet-based intervention that contained an HIV test offer delivered via computer. Test rates in both conditions were then compared to historic test rates in the same ED during the previous six months. Among participants aged 19 years and younger who were offered HIV testing and declined before enrollment in the study, participants in the tablet-based condition were 1.7 times more likely to test for HIV compared to participants in the face-to-face condition. Participants aged 19 years and younger were three times as likely to test for HIV compared to patients the same age who were treated in the previous six months (26.39%, n = 71 study participants vs. 10.29%, n = 189 prior patients, OR = 3.13, [Formula: see text] (2 )= 54.76, p < 0.001).

However, a critical gap exists between the fast pace of biomarker discovery and the successful translation to clinical use. This gap underscores the fundamental biomarker conundrum across various acute and chronic disorders: how does a biomarker address a specific unmet need? Additionally, the gap highlights the need to shift the paradigm from a focus on biomarker discovery to greater translational impact and the need for a more streamlined drug approval process. The unmet need for biomarkers in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is for reliable and validated biomarkers that minimize heterogeneity and allow for stratification of subject selection for enrollment in clinical trials of tailored therapies. This unmet need is particularly highlighted by the ongoing SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented numbers of COVID-19-induced ARDS cases has strained health care systems across the world and exposed the need for biomarkers that would accelerate drug development and the successful phenotyping of COVID-19-infected patients at risk for development of ARDS and ARDS mortality. Accordingly, this review discusses the current state of ARDS biomarkers in the context of the drug development pipeline and highlight gaps between biomarker discovery and clinical implementation while proposing potential paths forward. We discuss potential ARDS biomarkers by category and by context of use, highlighting progress in the development continuum.

Methods In the combined Solitaire Flow Restoration with the Intention for Thrombectomy (SWIFT), Solitaire Flow Restoration Thrombectomy for Acute Revascularization (STAR), and Solitaire Flow Restoration with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment (SWIFT PRIME) databases, we identified patients treated with the Solitaire stent retriever. Using 24-h CT scan, a multivariate ordinal regression was used to determine the relative contribution of each ASPECTS region to clinical outcome separately in each hemisphere. The coefficients from the regression were used to create a weighted ASPECTS (wASPECTS), which was compared with the original ASPECTS to predict 90-day modified Rankin Scale disability outcomes in an independent validation cohort. Results Among 342 patients treated with EST, the average age was 67 years, 57% were female, and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17 (IQR 13-20). The median ASPECTS at presentation was 8 (IQR 7-10). The most commonly involved ASPECTS regions on 24-h CT were the lentiform nuclei (70%), insula (55%), and caudate (52%). In multivariate analysis, preservation of M6 ( = 9.7) and M4 ( = 4.4) regions in the right hemisphere was most strongly predictive of good outcome. For the left hemisphere, M6 ( = 5.5), M5 ( = 4.1), and M3 ( = 3.1) generated the greatest parameter estimates, though they did not reach statistical significance. A wASPECTS incorporating all 20 parameter estimates resulted in improved discrimination against the original ASPECTS in the independent cohort (C-statistic 0.78 vs. 0.67, right hemisphere). Conclusions For both right and left hemisphere, preservation of the high cortical regions was more strongly associated with improved outcomes compared to the deep regions.

We analyzed our surgical practice since March 14th when the lockdown was declared up to date, May 14th (2 months). Procedural surgical practice, organizational issues, early outcomes, and all the troubles encountered during this new situation are described. RESULTS: Our department is composed of 10 vascular surgeons and 4 trainees. Surgical practice has been reduced to only urgent care, totaling 50 repairs on 45 patients during the period.

During virus outbreaks, anxiety is widespread. However, the role of trait health anxiety, cyberchondria, and coping in the context of virus anxiety during the current COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been studied. An online survey was conducted in the German general population (N = 1,615, 79.8% female, M(age) = 33.36 years, SD = 13.18) in mid-March 2020, which included questionnaires on anxiety associated with SARS-CoV-2, trait health anxiety, cyberchondria(Pandemic) (i.e. excessive online information search), and emotion regulation. The participants reported a significantly increasing virus anxiety in recent months (previous months recorded retrospectively), especially among individuals with heightened trait health anxiety. Cyberchondria(Pandemic) showed positive correlations with current virus anxiety (r = .09 C .48), and this relationship was additionally moderated by trait health anxiety. A negative correlation was found between the perception of being informed about the pandemic and the current virus anxiety (r=-.18), with adaptive emotion regulation being a significant moderator for this relationship. The findings suggest that trait health anxiety and cyberchondria serve as risk factors, whereas information about the pandemic and adaptive emotion regulation might represent buffering factors for anxiety during a virus pandemic.","output":"Health anxiety, cyberchondria, and coping in the current COVID-19 pandemic: Which factors are related to coronavirus anxiety?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Lacunar infarcts are thought to result from occlusion of small penetrating arteries due to microatheroma and lipohyalinosis, pathognomonic for cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Concurrent embolic ischemic lesions indicate a different stroke mechanism. The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with lacunar infarcts and concurrent embolic infarcts on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). METHODS All patients screened for the WAKE-UP trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01525290) were reviewed for acute lacunar infarcts and concurrent embolic lesions on baseline DWI. Clinical characteristics and outcome were compared between lacunar infarct patients with and without concurrent embolic lesions. RESULTS Of 244 patients with an acute lacunar infarct, 20 (8.2%) had concurrent acute embolic infarcts. Compared to patients with a lacunar infarct only, patients with concurrent embolic infarcts were older (mean age 69 years vs. 63 years; p = 0.031), more severely affected (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 5 vs. 4; p = 0.046), and-among those randomized-had worse functional outcome at 90 days (median modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3 vs. 1; p = 0.011). CONCLUSION Approximately 8% of lacunar infarct patients show concurrent embolic lesions suggesting a stroke etiology other than CSVD.

While a certain form of environmentalism with proclivities for dour, self-righteous, sentimental, or apocalyptic tones is often taken to be hegemonic, Nicole Seymour argues that a more irreverent ?low environmental culture? should not be occluded. Humor and irony can serve as emotional registers for environmental media that provide openings for the emergence of playful environmentalisms perhaps more amenable to a diverse audience. Such ?bad environmentalism? mobilizes humor by transgressing the emotional norms of piety within environmentalism. This article deepens the concept of bad environmentalism through an examination of the emergence of ?nature is healing? memes during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Implicitly critical of nefarious arguments that the death-dealing pandemic would provide a ?pause for nature? and thus that ?humans were the real virus?, the formal and easily reproduced ?nature is healing? genre subverts conventional understandings of ?the natural? as well as the naturalization of social order and political economy. In particular, I extend Seymour?s argument ? and pop cultural studies of the environment ? by parsing five modes through which the ?nature is healing? genre plays ironically on differing understandings of the natural.

This article aims to review the data of various case/control association studies that examine the difference in genetic polymorphisms between long-lived people and younger subjects across different human populations. There are more than 100 candidate genes potentially involved in human longevity; this article particularly focuses on genes of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, FOXO3A, FOXO1A, lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., APOE and PON1), and cell-cycle regulators (e.g., TP53 and P21). Since the confirmed genetic components for human longevity are few to date, further precise assessment of the genetic contributions is required.

A protective role of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins against CMV disease has been reported after transplantation, but the impact in HIV-infected patients is unclear. METHODS: In a case-control study nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, we investigated associations between plasma levels of MBL/ficolins and CMV disease. We compared HIV-infected patients with CMV disease (cases) to CMV-seropositive patients without CMV disease (controls) matched for CD4 T-cells, sampling time, and use of combination antiretroviral therapy. MBL and M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin were quantified using ELISA. RESULTS: We analysed 105 cases and 105 matched controls. CMV disease was neither associated with MBL (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per log(10) ng/mL increase (95% CI 0.73C1.45)) nor with ficolins (OR per log(10) ng/mL increase 0.66 (95% CI 0.28C1.52), 2.34 (95% CI 0.44C12.36), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.26C3.03) for M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin, respectively). We found no evidence of a greater association between MBL and CMV disease in patients with low CD4 counts; however in the multivariable analysis, CMV disease was more likely in patients with an increased HIV RNA (OR 1.53 per log(10) copies/mL; 95% CI 1.08C2.16), or a shorter duration of HIV-infection (OR 0.91 per year; 95% CI 0.84C0.98).

As a result, precision medicine and personalized medicine are rapidly growing new disciplines that support the clinician in making the correct diagnosis, in predicting outcomes, and in optimally selecting patients for interventional therapies. In addition, precision medicine tools are greatly facilitating the development of new drugs, therapeutic approaches, and new multiparametric prognostic scoring models.

Most patients with severe COVID-19 infections who died had developed ARDS. Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014C2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, ?30b-3p, ?145, ?27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration.

Given the constant rise in bacterial resistance to antibiotics, treatment failure is increasingly frequent. In this context, innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Stimulation of innate immune cells in the respiratory tract [via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)] is an attractive approach for rapidly activating the body's immune defenses against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Previous studies of the TLR5 agonist flagellin in animal models showed that standalone TLR stimulation does not result in the effective treatment of pneumococcal respiratory infection but does significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of concomitant antibiotic treatment. Here, we investigated the antibacterial interaction between antibiotic and intranasal flagellin in a mouse model of pneumococcal respiratory infection. Using various doses of orally administered amoxicillin or systemically administered cotrimoxazole, we found that the intranasal instillation of flagellin (a dose that promotes maximal lung pro-inflammatory responses) induces synergistic rather than additive antibacterial effects against antibioticCsusceptible pneumococcus. We next set up a model of infection with pneumococcus that is resistant to multiple antibiotics in the context of influenza superinfection. Remarkably, the combination of amoxicillin and flagellin effectively treated superinfection with the amoxicillin-resistant pneumococcus since the bacterial clearance was increased by more than 100-fold compared to standalone treatments. Our results also showed that, in response to flagellin, the lung tissue generated an innate immune response even though it had been damaged by the influenza virus and pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the selective boosting of lung innate immunity is a conceptually advantageous approach for improving the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment and fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","output":"Therapeutic Synergy Between Antibiotics and Pulmonary Toll-Like Receptor 5 Stimulation in Antibiotic-Sensitive or -Resistant Pneumonia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a pathogen of great economic significance that impacts the swine industry globally. Since the first report of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreak, tremendous efforts to control this disease, including various national policies and plans incorporating the use of multiple modified live-virus vaccines, have been made. However, PRRSV is still a significant threat to the swine industry, and new variants continually emerge as a result of PRRSV evolution. Several studies have shown that pandemic PRRSV strains have enormous genetic diversity and that commercial vaccines can only provide partial protection against these strains. Therefore, effective anti-PRRSV drugs may be more suitable and reliable for PRRSV control. In this study, we observed that isobavachalcone (IBC), which was first isolated from Psoralea corylifolia, had potent anti-PRRSV activity in vitro. Although many biological activities of IBC have been reported, this is the first report describing the antiviral activity of IBC. Furthermore, after a systematic investigation, we demonstrated that IBC inhibits PRRSV replication at the post-entry stage of PRRSV infection.

The evolution of the virus has been occurred by the continuous process of molecular genetic manipulation, through mutation, deletion and genetic recombinationevents. Different host body environment acts as the supportive system for the pathogen which creates extreme selective pressure. By the process of genetic evolution the pathogen developes new characters. Then the new version of the virus has been naturally selected by susceptible human host and adapt itself inside the host body causing deadly effect. Moreover, extreme environmental stability helps in the process of viral survival outside the host and its transmission. Thus both the host body or internal environment and the external environment performs equally as a source, responsible for shaping the genetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 towards theCOVID-19 disease fitness in nature in a pandemic form.","output":"Decoding the global outbreak of COVID-19: the nature is behind the scene"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Exercises are increasingly common tools used by the health sector and other sectors to evaluate their preparedness to respond to public health threats. Exercises provide an opportunity for multiple sectors to practice, test and evaluate their response to all types of public health emergencies.

There is a growing body of literature about the use of exercises among local, state and federal public health agencies in the United States. There is much less information about the use of exercises among public health agencies in other countries and the use of exercises that involve multiple countries. RESULTS: We developed and conducted 12 exercises (four sub-national, five national, three sub-regional) from August 2006 through December 2008. These 12 exercises included 558 participants (average 47) and 137 observers (average 11) from 14 countries. Participants consistently rated the overall quality of the exercises as very good or excellent. They rated the exercises lowest on their ability to identifying key gaps in performance. The vast majority of participants noted that they would use the information they gained at the exercise to improve their organizations preparedness to respond to an influenza pandemic. Participants felt the exercises were particularly good at raising awareness and understanding about public health threats, assisting in evaluating plans and identifying priorities for improvement, and building relationships that strengthen preparedness and response across sectors and across countries. Participants left the exercises with specific ideas about the most important actions that they should engage in after the exercise such as improved planning coordination across sectors and countries and better training of health workers and response personnel. CONCLUSIONS: These experiences suggest that exercises can be a valuable, low-burden tool to improve emergency preparedness and response in countries around the world. They also demonstrate that countries can work together to develop and conduct successful exercises designed to improve regional preparedness to public health threats.

METHODS The subjects were recruited by letters mailed to area physicians and local advertisement. The inclusion criteria were age older than 50 years and at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. The exclusion criteria were symptoms suggestive of lung cancer or a history of malignancy in the previous 5 years. The participants completed a questionnaire and underwent a chest CT scan at baseline and annually for 5 years. The management of positive screening results was determined using a defined algorithm: annual follow-up CT scan for nodules less than 5 mm; 6-month follow-up CT scan for nodules 5 to 7 mm; review by our multidisciplinary tumor board for nodules 8 to 12 mm; and biopsy for nodules greater than 12 mm. RESULTS A total of 132 patients were recruited. Of the 132 patients, 61% had positive baseline CT findings and 22% had positive findings on the annual CT scans. Six cancers were detected.

Often outbreak investigations and genomic surveillance efforts require running similar analyses again and again on the latest dataset and producing reports. We developed civet (cluster investigation and virus epidemiology tool) to aid these routine analyses and facilitate virus outbreak investigation and surveillance. Civet can place sequences of interest in the local context of background diversity, resolving the query into different catchments and presenting the phylogenetic results alongside metadata in an interactive, distributable report. Civet can be used on a fine scale for clinical outbreak investigation, for local surveillance and cluster discovery, and to routinely summarise the virus diversity circulating on a national level.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. RESULTS: The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma.

METHODS: We performed a scoping review on PubMed, Cochrane, the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Clinical Trial Register, and the Grey Literature Repository databases, to identify reports on viral transmission via surgical smoke or aerosolisation. A systematic review of all available national and international guidelines was also performed to report their recommendations. Additionally, a worldwide transdisciplinary survey was performed to capture the actual compliance to dedicated guidelines and their impact on MIS activity. RESULTS: Based on a selection of 17 studies, there was no evidence to support the concerns of an intraoperative viral transmission via pneumoperitoneum aerosolisation. Most national surgical and urological societies either did address this topic or referred to international guidelines. The guidelines of the American College of Surgery, the Royal College of Surgeons, and the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section, recommended an avoidance of MIS due to an increased risk of intraoperative aerosol-enhanced transmission. The results of the survey completed by 334 respondents, from different surgical abdominal specialties, suggested a lack of compliance with the guidelines. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a dissonance between contemporary guidelines and ongoing surgical activity, possibly due to the perceived lack of evidence. Recommendations regarding changes in clinical practice should be based on the best available research evidence and experience. A scoping review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms together with a survey showed that laparoscopic procedures do not seem to increase the risk of viral transmission. Nevertheless, the few publications and low quality of existing evidence limits the validity of the review.","output":"Intraoperative aerosol viral transmission in minimally invasive surgery: a scoping review and impact on clinical guidelines and practice during the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The relationship between ethnicity and COVID-19 is uncertain. We performed a systematic review to assess whether ethnicity has been reported in patients with COVID-19 and its relation to clinical outcomes. METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and PROSPERO for English-language citations on ethnicity and COVID-19 (1(st) December 2019-15(th) May 2020). We also reviewed: COVID-19 articles in NEJM, Lancet, BMJ, JAMA, clinical trial protocols, grey literature, surveillance data and preprint articles on COVID-19 in MedRxiv to evaluate if the association between ethnicity and clinical outcomes were reported and what they showed. PROSPERO:180654. FINDINGS: Of 207 articles in the database search, five reported ethnicity; two reported no association between ethnicity and mortality. Of 690 articles identified from medical journals, 12 reported ethnicity; three reported no association between ethnicity and mortality. Of 209 preprints, 34 reported ethnicity C 13 found Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) individuals had an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and 12 reported worse clinical outcomes, including ITU admission and mortality, in BAME patients compared to White patients. Of 12 grey literature reports, seven with original data reported poorer clinical outcomes in BAME groups compared to White groups. INTERPRETATION: Data on ethnicity in patients with COVID-19 in the published medical literature remains limited. However, emerging data from the grey literature and preprint articles suggest BAME individuals are at an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to White individuals and also worse clinical outcomes from COVID-19.

To predict the effect of a change in t on the course of the pandemic. To evaluate the robustness and sensitivity of the model in response to a change in the input parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS Start parameters for the modified Bateman SIZ model were obtained from observational data published by the Robert-Koch-Institute in Berlin for the period June 1 to July 13, 2020. The robustness and sensitivity of the model were determined by changing the input parameter for the doubling-time (t) by  5% and  10%. RESULTS The predictions show that small changes,  5%, in the doubling-time, t for the rate of increase in the number of new infections, can have a major effect, both positive and negative, on the course of the pandemic. The model predicted that the number of persons infected with the virus would reach 1 million within 8 years. A 5% longer tt would reduce the number of infected persons by ~ 75%. In contrast, a 5% shorter doubling-time would increase the number of infections over 8 years to ~ 9 million when the number of infectious persons would exceed 100,000 at the end of 2022. The pandemic is predicted to have disappeared by the end of 2024. DISCUSSION Predictions for the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany based on the status quo up to July 13, 2020 have been obtained using the modified Bateman SIZ model. There are several important assumptions necessary to apply the model and thus the results must be interpreted with caution. The model, previously used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Heidelberg (pop. 166,000) gives comparable predictive data for the whole of Germany (pop. 83 million) and thus appears to be both sensitive and robust. CONCLUSION Since a shorter doubling-time for the number of infectious persons by only 5% would result in a major clinical emergency, interventional measures such as vaccination are urgently needed. Taking into consideration that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is not yet available and the efficacy of the Corona-Warn-App has yet to be shown, a relaxation in the lockdown conditions in Germany in 2020 appears premature.","output":"Predictions for the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany using the modified Bateman SIZ model ."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: People obtain information on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the internet and other sources.

OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19.

Tongue diagnosis is an important component of TCM, but also plays a role in Western medicine, for example in dermatology. However, the procedure of obtaining tongue images has not been standardized and the reliability of tongue diagnosis by smartphone tongue images has yet to be evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The first objective of this study was to develop an operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis. The second and main objective of this study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of tongue coating diagnosis using the operating classification scheme. METHODS: An operating classification scheme for tongue coating was developed using a stepwise approach and a quasi-Delphi method. First, tongue images (n=2023) were analyzed by 2 groups of assessors to develop the operating classification scheme for tongue coating diagnosis. Based on clinicians' (n=17) own interpretations as well as their use of the operating classification scheme, the results of tongue diagnosis on a representative tongue image set (n=24) were compared. After gathering consensus for the operating classification scheme, the clinicians were instructed to use the scheme to assess tongue features of their patients under direct visual inspection. At the same time, the clinicians took tongue images of the patients with smartphones and assessed tongue features observed in the smartphone image using the same classification scheme. The intra-rater agreements of these two assessments were calculated to determine which features of tongue coating were better retained by the image. Using the finalized operating classification scheme, clinicians in the study group assessed representative tongue images (n=24) that they had taken, and the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of their assessments was evaluated. RESULTS: Intra-rater agreement between direct subject inspection and tongue image inspection was good to very good (Cohen &#954; range 0.69-1.0). Additionally, when comparing the assessment of tongue images on different days, intra-rater reliability was good to very good (&#954; range 0.7-1.0), except for the color of the tongue body (&#954;=0.22) and slippery tongue fur (&#954;=0.1). Inter-rater reliability was moderate for tongue coating (Gwet AC2 range 0.49-0.55), and fair for color and other features of the tongue body (Gwet AC2=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study has shown that tongue images collected via smartphone contain some reliable features, including tongue coating, that can be used in mHealth analysis.

The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHODS: We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found wide variation in the prevalence of tele-ICUs across HRRs and states.

The levels of immune protection of these subunit vaccines were evaluated by inoculating specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens at 14 days of age, giving them a booster with the same dose 14 days later and challenging them with a virulent GX-YL5 strain of IBV 14 days post-booster (dpb). The commercial vaccine strain H120 was used as a control. The IBV-specific antibody levels, as well as the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, were detected within 28 days post-vaccination (dpv). The morbidity, mortality and re-isolation of the virus from the tracheas and kidneys of challenged birds were evaluated at five days post-challenge (dpc). The results showed that the IBV-specific antibody levels and the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were higher in the rHBM-S1-N vaccinated birds compared to birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. At 5 dpc, the mortality, morbidity and virus re-isolation rate of the birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1-N vaccine were slightly higher than those vaccinated with the H120 control vaccine but were lower than those vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. The present study demonstrated that the protection of the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins was better than that of recombinant baculoviruses mono-expressing the S1 or N protein. Thus, the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins could serve as a potential IBV vaccine and this demonstrates that the bivalent subunit vaccine including the S1 and N proteins might be a strategy for the development of an IBV subunit vaccine.","output":"Protection against Virulent Infectious Bronchitis Virus Challenge Conferred by a Recombinant Baculovirus Co-Expressing S1 and N Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cultivation of the actinobacteria strain Isoptericola chiayiensis, a mangrove-derived actinobacteria that was isolated from a mangrove soil collected in Chiayi County, resulted in the isolation of one new 2-furanone derivative, isopterfuranonea?

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of comparative (quasi-)experimental interventional studies published in Medline or EMBASE between January 2003-July 2021. We performed random-effects effect meta-analyses (DerSimonian and Laird method) for interventions that were homogenous (based on intervention descriptions); for others we narratively synthesized the intervention effect. Studies were assessed using ROBINS-I, Cochrane Risk-of-Bias, and GRADE. (PROSPERO #CRD42018109629). RESULTS: Of 21,516 retrieved studies, 23 were included, contributing 53 arms and 84,884 participants from 4 continents. Five interventions were analyzed: co-location of test and/or treatment services; patient education and counselling; dedicated personnel; peer support; and financial support. A majority were implemented in primary health facilities (n = 22) and reported on HIV outcomes in people with TB (n = 18). Service co-location had the most consistent positive effect on HIV testing and treatment initiation among people with TB, and TB case-detection among PLHIV. Other interventions were heterogenous, implemented concurrent with standard-of-care strategies and/or diverse facility-level improvements, and produced mixed effects. Operational system, human resource, and/or laboratory strengthening were common within successful interventions. Most studies had a moderate to serious risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides operational clarity on intervention models that can support early linkages between the TB and HIV care cascades.

We have computationally investigated the interaction between RBD of both wild-type and omicron variants with hACE2 receptor using molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA based binding free energy calculations. The mode of the interaction between Omicrons RBD to the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor is similar to the original SARS-CoV-2 RBD except for a few key differences. The binding free energy difference shows that the spike protein of Omicron has increased binding affinity for the hACE-2 receptor. The mutated residues in the RBD showed strong interactions with a few amino acid residues of the hACE2. More specifically, strong electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) and hydrogen bonding were observed between R493 and R498 residues of the Omicron RBD with D30/E35 and D38 residues of the hACE2, respectively. Other mutated amino acids in the Omicron RBD, e.g. S496 and H505, also exhibited hydrogen bonding with the hACE2 receptor. The pi-stacking interaction was also observed between tyrosine residues (RBD-Tyr501: hACE2-Tyr41) in the complex, which contributes majorly to binding free energies suggesting this as one of the key interactions stabilizing the complex formation. The structural insights of RBD:hACE2 complex, their binding mode information and residue wise contributions to binding free energy provide insight on the increased transmissibility of Omicron and pave the way to design and optimize novel antiviral agents.","output":"Improved binding affinity of the Omicron's spike protein with hACE2 receptor is the key factor behind its increased virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the science behind many commonly used medical devices such as the pulse oximeter.

To test this hypothesis, we prospectively collected PPG recordings and d-dimer levels for 197 ICU patients with COVID-19 and compared them with the PPG tracings from 300 non-COVID controls.Results demonstrated significant differences in rates of PPG dropout between patients with COVID-19 vs non-COVID controls.

Hotels and other facilities have been adapted to help appropriate isolation be achieved. Our study tested the efficacy of isolating patients in a reconditioned hotel versus isolation in their domiciles to reduce infection transmission. METHODS: Observational cohort study based on a survey to COVID-19 patients between April and June 2020. One cohort had been isolated in a hotel and the other in their domiciles. Multivariate regression models analyzed the factors related to the occurrence of COVID-19 infection among the household members. RESULTS: A total of 229 household members of COVID-19 patients were analyzed, 139 of them belonging to the group of hotel-isolated patients and 90 in the group of domicile-isolated ones. More than half of the household members became infected (53.7%). Higher risk of infection was found in the household members of domicile-isolated patients isolated and in those reporting overcrowding at home, (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-3.12) and (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.81; 2.56), respectively.

Despite the myriad of recent advances in the rapid and accurate detection of pathogens, large volume clinical samples with a low concentration of pathogens continue to present challenges for diagnosis and surveillance. We here report a simple and label-free approach via homobifunctional imidoesters (HIs) with a microfluidic platform (SLIM) to efficiently enrich and extract pathogens at low concentrations from clinical samples. The SLIM system consists of an assembled double microfluidic chip for streamlining large volume processing and HIs for capturing pathogens and isolating nucleic acids by both electrostatic and covalent interaction without a chaotropic detergent or bulky instruments. The SLIM system significantly increases the enrichment and extraction rate of pathogens (up to 80% at 10 CFU (colony forming unit) in a 1 mL volume within 50 min). We demonstrated its clinical utility in large sample volumes from 46 clinical specimens including environmental swabs, saliva, and blood plasma. The SLIM system showed higher sensitivity with these samples and could detect pathogens that were below the threshold of detection with other methods. Finally, by combining our SLIM approach with an isothermal optical sensor, pathogens could be detected at a very high sensitivity in blood plasma samples within 80 min via enrichment, extraction and detection steps. Our SLIM system thus provides a simple, reliable, cost-effective and ultrasensitive pathogen diagnosis platform for use with large volume clinical samples and would thus have significant utility for various infectious diseases.","output":"Simple and label-free pathogen enrichment via homobifunctional imidoesters using a microfluidic (SLIM) system for ultrasensitive pathogen detection in various clinical specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meat is one of the most consumed agro-products because it contains proteins, minerals, and essential vitamins, all of which play critical roles in the human diet and health. Meat is a perishable food product because of its high moisture content, and as such there are concerns about its quality, stability, and safety. There are two widely used methods for monitoring meat quality attributes: subjective sensory evaluation and chemical/instrumentation tests. However, these methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and destructive. To overcome the shortfalls of these conventional approaches, several researchers have developed fast and nondestructive techniques. Recently, electronic nose (e-nose), computer vision (CV), spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and multispectral imaging (MSI) technologies have been explored as nondestructive methods in meat quality and safety evaluation. However, most of the studies on the application of these novel technologies are still in the preliminary stages and are carried out in isolation, often without comprehensive information on the most suitable approach. This lack of cohesive information on the strength and shortcomings of each technique could impact their application and commercialization for the detection of important meat attributes such as pH, marbling, or microbial spoilage. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of recent nondestructive technologies (e-nose, CV, spectroscopy, HSI, and MSI), as well as their applications and limitations in the detection and evaluation of meat quality and safety issues, such as contamination, adulteration, and quality classification.

Low serum lipid levels during hospital admission are associated with COVID-19 severity. However, the effect of antecedent serum lipid levels on COVID-19 infection risk has not been explored. Methods: From our retrospective cohort from the Arkansas Clinical Data-Repository, we used log-binomial regression to assess the risk of COVID-19 infection among the trajectories of lipid levels during the 2 years antecedent to COVID-19 testing, identified using group-based-trajectory modeling. We used mixed-effects linear regression to assess the serum lipid level trends followed up to the time of, and 2-months following COVID-19 testing. Results: Among the 11001 individuals with a median age of 59 years (IQR 46-70), 1340 (12.2%) tested positive for COVID-19. The highest trajectory for antecedent serum HDL-C was associated with the lowest COVID-19 infection risk (RR 0.63, 95%CI 0.46-0.86). Antecedent serum LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) were not independently associated with COVID-19 infection risk. In COVID-19 patients, serum HDL-C (-7.7, 95%CI -9.8 to -5.5 mg/dL), and LDL-C (-6.29, 95%CI -12.2 to -0.37 mg/dL), but not TG levels, decreased transiently at the time of testing. Conclusions: Higher antecedent serum HDL-C, but not LDL-C, TC, or TG, levels were associated with a lower COVID-19 infection risk. Serum HDL-C, and LDL-C levels declined transiently at the time of infection.

Vaccination of healthcare workers started in January 2021, earlier than that of other population groups. The main aim of this study is to compare the spread of the pandemic between HCW and the general population focusing on potential effects of the vaccination. METHODS: The study consisted of a retrospective analysis of results of RT-PCR tests performed between 6 March 2020 and 4 April 2021 among HCWs from Bologna, Italy, and those of the general population of Emilia Romagna region. We calculated the crude proportion of positive RT-PCR tests over total tests and the crude prevalence of positive test in population; then, we conducted joinpoint analyses using the Joinpoint Regression Program of the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: The results of the joinpoint analysis show that both  and  ratio indicators have a similar pattern, with a sharp increase during the early phase of the pandemic, and a strong decrease at the end of the first wave around week 15. In both indicators there are no significant changes in the trend after week 25. Pandemic spread among HCWs appeared earlier than in the general population, but it otherwise appeared to have comparable features. A decline in infection was apparent among HCWs after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of HCWs would inform on the epidemic in the general population. The apparent effectiveness of the anti-SarsCoV2 vaccine will likely occur in the general population.","output":"One year of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: comparison of infection between health care workers and general population before and after vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Prehabilitation services assist patients in preparing for surgery, yet access to these services are often limited by geographical factors. Enabling rural and regional patients to access specialist surgical prehabilitation support with the use of telehealth technology has the potential to overcome health inequities and improve post-operative outcomes. AIM: To evaluate the current and likely future impact of a telehealth preoperative education package for patients preparing for major abdominal cancer surgery. METHODS: A telehealth alternative to a hospital based pre-operative education session was developed and implemented at a dedicated cancer hospital. Adult patients (18 years) scheduled for elective major cancer surgery were offered this telehealth alternative. Impact evaluation was conducted using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: To date, 35 participants have consented to participate in the study. Thirty-one participants attended the intervention; 24 (69%) residing in rural or regional areas. Twenty-four (77%) reported that if given a choice they would prefer the online session as opposed to attending the hospital in person. The majority (97%) reported they would recommend the intervention to others preparing for surgery. Session information was recalled by all 26 participants and 77% of participants reported acting on recommendations 2 weeks after the session. Lessons learnt and recommendations for providers implementing similar programs are reported. CONCLUSION: Telehealth alternatives to hospital based pre-operative education are well received by patients preparing for major cancer surgery. We make seven recommendations to improve implementation. Further evaluation of implementation strategies alongside clinical effectiveness in future studies is essential.

During this crisis, schools around the world are challenged with the issues of implementing online learning. Three areas of misalignment were identified: disjoint in learning with home-school separation, piecemeal technologies to mimic physical teaching, and disconnect between teacher professional development and classroom practices and we discussed emerging realignment efforts for transformative learning. Through analyzing the three case examples of how teachers responded to COVID-19 challenges in inter-related areas of curriculum, pedagogy, technology and community, we identified several themes on emerging alignments conducive for transformative pedagogy and technology through community advancement. These themes include: innovating practice around the centrality of ideas;perceiving knowledge building as pervasive;transformative use of technology, and symmetrical advancement of knowledge. These case examples show that in these disruptive times, the teachers were more actively building new practices supported by community dynamics and systemic processes of the KBC. Consequently, the interactions between stakeholders shifted from disjointed relations in different hierarchical levels to a networked community of people, ideas, and resources, and teachers continually advancing their knowledge-building practice in these challenging times.","output":"Pedagogical Transformation and Teacher Learning for Knowledge Building: Turning COVID-19 Challenges into Opportunities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The university must adapt to the challenges which have characterized the 21st century According to UNESCO, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic the number of learners has been affected by school closures;it has exceeded 1 5 billion in 195 countries The Sultan Moulay Slimane University in Morocco has employed a strategy through distance education which makes the online courses massive and open to all, but there are many obstacles such as the problem of choice due to the diversity of platforms and multilingual e-assessment tools To solve this serious problem, we have thought of establishing criteria for choosing a suitable learning management system and integrating new automatic natural language processing, using artificial intelligence techniques to make MOOCs more attractive To do this, we created a plugin of automatic multilingual questions generation which transforms the course into an addictive game with points and badges To solve this serious problem, we have thought of establishing criteria for choosing a suitable learning management system and integrating new automatic natural language processing, using artificial intelligence techniques to make MOOCs more attractive To do this, we created a plugin of automatic multilingual questions generation which transforms the course into an addictive game with points and badges ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Applicable strategy to choose and deploy a MOOC platform with multilingual AQG feature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the epidemic of COVID-19, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 has been developed for the preventative and therapeutic purposes.

We consider a susceptible/infected model in which agents can invest in order to reduce the contagiousness of network links.

First, we exhibit an upper bound on the Price of Anarchy and prove that the level of inefficiency can scale up to linearly with the number of agents. Second, we prove that policies of uniform reduction of interactions satisfy some optimality conditions in a vast range of networks. In setting where no central authority can enforce such stringent policies, we consider as a type of second-best policy the shift from a local to a global game by allowing agents to subsidise investments in contagiousness reduction in the global rather than in the local network. We then characterise the scope for Pareto improvement opened by such policies through a notion of Price of Autarky, measuring the ratio between social welfare at a global and a local equilibrium.

More recently is the current pandemic where the SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown a high degree of person-to-person clinical variability. A wide range of disease severity occurs in the patients experiences, from asymptomatic cases, mild infections to serious life threatening conditions requiring admission into the intensive care unit (ICU). MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Although, it is generally reported that age and co-morbidities contribute significantly to the variations in the clinical outcome of the scourge of COVID-19, a hypothetical question of the possibility of genetic involvement in the susceptibility and severity of the disease arose when some unique severe outcomes were seen among young patients with no co-morbidity. The role human genetics play in clinical response to the viral infections is scarcely understood; however, several ongoing researches all around the world are currently focusing on possible genetic factors. This review reports the possible genetic factors that have been widely studied in defining the severity of viral infections using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. These involve the possible involvements of ACE2, HLA, and TLR genes such as TLR7 and TLR3 in the presentation of a more severe condition. SHORT CONCLUSION: Understanding these variations could help to inform efforts to identify people at increased risk of infection outbreaks through genetic diagnosis of infections by locating disease genes or mutations that predispose patients to severe infection. This will also suggest specific targets for therapy and prophylaxis.","output":"Understanding the genetic determinant of severity in viral diseases: a case of SARS-Cov-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quantitative evaluations of nutrients delivered by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) have been widely conducted worldwide, but sources of nutrients in the discharged submarine groundwater remain unclear. Identifying these sources of nutrients is essential to the protection and management of marine ecological environments. This study aims to evaluate the magnitudes of SGD and the associated nitrate in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHM Greater Bay Area), China, and identify the sources of SGD-driven nitrate in this region using radioactive radium (Ra) isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, and 228Ra) and stable nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope composition of nitrate (15N-NO3- and 18O-NO3-). The results of the Ra mixing model show that the estimated SGD and the associated nitrate fluxes into the Greater Bay Area are (9.15  1.26)  108 m3/d and (3.77  0.52)  107 mol/d, respectively, both of which are comparable to the contributions from the Pearl River. Combing NO3- dual isotopic signatures of sampled coastal groundwater and five kinds of potential nitrate sources, we found that ammonium (NH4+) fertilizer and natural soil N are the two main sources of nitrate in discharged submarine groundwater and rivers. No anthropogenic inputs from manure or sewage waste were identified.

Mild/severe manifestations of the post-COVID neurological syndrome have been identified in approximately 33.00% of COVID-19 survivors. The presence of neurological complications after COVID allowed neuropathologists to investigate in-depth the role of viral infection in neurons. The pathophysiology of the post-COVID neurological syndrome involved the development of a systematic response, including coagulopathy characterized by the formation of microthrombi. Coagulopathy, an old term for a new disease, describes the discrepancy between pro-coagulant and anticoagulant systems due to overexpression of pro-coagulant substances and or their receptors in addition to suppression of the anticoagulant molecules and or their receptors. Vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes play a central role in the regulation of hemostasis that is disrupted during the acute phase response (APR) of coronavirus-19 (COVID-19). Currently, coagulopathy and inflammation are termed together since both form a complementary system, indicated by the elevation of inflammatory biomarkers (APR) and fibrinolysis biomarkers (D-dimer/fibrin). The later events of post-COVID neurological syndrome are primarily induced by coagulopathy and direct viral tropism.

METHODS: This is a preliminary report of PAIN\\\\COVID trial (NCT04394169) presenting a descriptive analysis in critically ill COVID\\\\19 survivors, following in person interview 1 month after hospital discharge. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory, the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. HRQoL was evaluated with the EQ 5D/5L, and mood disorders with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: From 27 May to 19 July 2020, 203 patients were consecutively screened for eligibility, and 65 were included in this analysis. Of these, 50.8% patients reported new\\\\onset pain; 38.5% clinically significant pain (numerical rating score 3 for average pain intensity); 16.9% neuropathic pain; 4.6% pain catastrophizing thoughts, 44.6% pain in 2 body sites and 7.7% widespread pain.

The debate on expanding the pool of comparable euro area assets focuses on safe assets, often on various combinations of government bonds, most of which would not entail a strong increase in euro VHQLA. This paper explores a different option, complementary to the existing ones, based on the creation of a safe European asset backed by fully private assets. The idea proposed in this paper is the issuance of supra-covered bonds by a central European institution. The latter are bonds issued by the central issuer and backed by covered bonds, which banks would have created using their mortgages as their cover pool. The aim is to increase substantially the outstanding amount of euro VHQLA. Such an asset would be very beneficial also during crisis periods, like the current COVID-19 crisis, by allowing banks to transform mortgages into very high quality and liquid assets that can be used for funding and as a collateral in operations with the Eurosystem, thus enhancing the possible credit sustain to the SMEs.

The assessment of the indicators finds that the most vulnerable neighborhoods are characterized by significant clustering of racial minorities. An overwhelming 73% of Blacks reside in the neighborhoods with the two highest levels of pre-existing health conditions. For the barriers to accessing health care indicator, 40% of Latinx reside in the highest vulnerability places. The built environment indicator finds that selected Asian ethnic groups (63%), Latinx (55%), and Blacks (53%) reside in the neighborhoods designated as high or the highest vulnerability. The social vulnerability indicator finds 42% of Blacks and Latinx and 38% of selected Asian ethnic group residing in neighborhoods of high vulnerability. The vulnerability indicators can be adopted nationally to respond to COVID-19.

Then, we evaluated the differences in the scores among various socio-demographic groups using Kruskal-Wakkis H tests and t-tests and analyzed the IES-R, state anxiety (SA) score, and trait anxiety (TA) score using the Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, we conducted a path analysis to determine the mediating role of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (measured by the IES-R) in the relationship between TA and SA. The results show that the average of the SA and TA scores were 48.0  10.4 and 38.0  8.2, respectively; the respondents who suffered from mild, moderate, and severe psychological impacts because of the health crisis accounted for 21.9, 5.2, and 13.1%, respectively; farmers have the highest IES-R score than others; people with the highest income have the lowest SA level; a significant positive correlation existed between the IES-R and STAI scores; and TA produces both direct and indirect (through the IES-R) effects on SA. Overall, the general Chinese public exhibited much higher anxiety levels than normal in the early days of the pandemic outbreak.

However, it is unclear whether diverse racial/ethnic populations have experienced a disproportionate rise in heart disease and cerebrovascular disease deaths. METHODS: We used the National Center for Health Statistics to identify heart disease and cerebrovascular disease deaths for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic individuals from March to August 2020 (pandemic period), as well as for the corresponding months in 2019 (historical control). We determined the age- and sex-standardized deaths per million by race/ethnicity for each year. We then fit a modified Poisson model with robust SEs to compare change in deaths by race/ethnicity for each condition in 2020 versus 2019. RESULTS: There were a total of 339 076 heart disease and 76 767 cerebrovascular disease deaths from March through August 2020, compared with 321 218 and 72 190 deaths during the same months in 2019. Heart disease deaths increased during the pandemic in 2020, compared with the corresponding period in 2019, for non-Hispanic White (age-sex standardized deaths per million, 1234.2 versus 1208.7; risk ratio for death [RR], 1.02 [95% CI, 1.02-1.03]), non-Hispanic Black (1783.7 versus 1503.8; RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.17-1.20]), non-Hispanic Asian (685.7 versus 577.4; RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.22]), and Hispanic (968.5 versus 820.4; RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.16-1.20]) populations. Cerebrovascular disease deaths also increased for non-Hispanic White (268.7 versus 258.2; RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.03-1.05]), non-Hispanic Black (430.7 versus 379.7; RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10-1.17]), non-Hispanic Asian (236.5 versus 207.4; RR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.21]), and Hispanic (264.4 versus 235.9; RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.08-1.16]) populations. For both heart disease and cerebrovascular disease deaths, Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations experienced a larger relative increase in deaths than the non-Hispanic White population (interaction term, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations experienced a disproportionate rise in deaths caused by heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that these groups have been most impacted by the indirect effects of the pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Checklists were developed with the following objectives: (1) improve best-practice adherence; (2) reduce errors; and (3) support standardization at stem cell drives. Topics included: recruiting needed donors; securing informed consent; maintaining good-documentation practices; and supervising registration and tissue sample collection. Checklists were iteratively revised with input from stakeholders. We evaluated the checklists by examining recruitment outcomes and errors (i.e., preventing registrants from being listed as donors) pre- (11/2011-8/2016) and post- (9/2016-11/2019) implementation by the Canadian donor recruitment organization Stem Cell Club. Quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to analyze recruiters' perspectives on the checklists. RESULTS The checklists supported recruitment of donors from needed demographic groups as Stem Cell Club expanded its recruitment effort from 4118 registrants (60% male, 58% non-European) pre-implementation to 10,621 (52% male, 56% non-European) post-implementation. Checklist implementation was associated with a marked reduction in errors (from 13.2% to 1.9%) and a three-fold increase in the match rate of recruited donors (from 0.024% to 0.075%).

Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the first COVID-19 vaccine (Oxford University/AstraZeneca). METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study ('COVID Survey'), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society ('Main Survey'). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11,740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination in the COVID-19 Survey. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N = 1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability being vaccine-hesitant. With individuals with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.","output":"Pre-pandemic cognitive function and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Age rationing is a central issue in the health care priority-setting literature, but it has become ever more salient in the light of the Covid-19 outbreak, where health authorities in several countries have given higher priority to younger over older patients.

Real industry data for vehicles and batteries produced in China was collected. Further, for the criticality assessment, Chinese import patterns are analyzed. The results show that the battery electric vehicle has similar and partly increased environmental impacts compared with the internal combustion engine vehicle. For both, the vehicle cycle contributes to a large proportion in all the environmental impact categories except for global warming. Further, battery electric vehicles show a higher criticality than internal combustion engine vehicles, with tantalum, lithium, and cobalt playing essential roles. In addition, the Chinese-specific results show a lower criticality compared to the global assessment for the considered categories trade barriers and political stability, while again tantalum crude oil and cobalt have high potential supply disruptions.

However, the mental health challenges and complexities faced by hospital staff in the United States has not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we conducted this study to examine the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among hospital staff in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The design is a single-center, cross-sectional, online survey evaluating depression and anxiety among all hospital employees (n = 3,500) at a safety-net hospital with a moderate cumulative COVID-19 hospitalization rate between April 30-May 22, 2020. We assessed depression with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Anxiety was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to identify associations with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Of 3,500 hospital employees, 1,246 (36%) responded to the survey. We included 1,232 individuals in the final analysis. Overall, psychological distress was common among the respondents: 21% and 33% of staff reported significant depression and anxiety, respectively, while 46% experienced overwhelming stress due to COVID-19. Notably, staff members overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 were seven and nine times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, respectively. In addition to stress, individuals with six to nine years of work experience were two times more likely to report moderate or severe depression compared to those with 10 or more years of work experience. Moreover, ancillary staff with direct patient contact (odds ratio [OR] 8.9, confidence interval (CI), 1.46, 173.03) as well as administrative and ancillary staff with indirect patient contact (OR 5.9, CI, 1.06, 111.01) were more likely to be depressed than physicians and advanced providers. CONCLUSION: We found that a considerable proportion of staff were suffering from psychological distress. COVID-19-associated depression and anxiety was widespread among hospital staff even in settings with comparatively lower COVID-19 hospitalization rates. Ancillary staff, administrative staff, staff with less job experience, and staff overwhelmed by the stress of COVID-19 are particularly susceptible to negative mental health outcomes.

ACE2-CC genotype was strongly associated with increased COVID-19 mortality OR 3.66 (95%) CI = (1.34 to 9.97), p < 0.011 and also ACE2-C allele was associated with COVID-19 mortality OR 2, 01 (1.1761C3.45), p < 0.010. Conclusions: It is concluded that ACE- genotype and D allele was strongly associated with increased COVID-19 patient severity. In addition, ACE I/D polymorphism were strongly associated with advanced age, diabetes and ischemic heart disease in COVID-19 patients whereas ACE-II genotype was a protective factor against the development of severe COVID-19. ACE2- genotype was strongly associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Additionally, ACE2CCC and CT genotypes were strongly associated with COVID-19 severity. Therefore, our study might be useful for identifying the susceptible population groups for targeted interventions and for making relevant public health policy decisions.","output":"Strong Association of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 Gene Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism with Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, Hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease and COVID-19 Disease Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has further illuminated the already existing need for methods of building resilience in perinatal caregivers.

Though international organisations created guidance in 2020 for vaccine deployment, this had to be adapted for each country's situation and values. We aimed to assist public health decision makers by identifying areas of consensus among Swiss experts for the deployment of one or more novel COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: An electronic, modified Delphi process between September and November 2020. We recruited a convenience sample of experts working in Switzerland from a variety of specialities, who completed two anonymous questionnaires. They voted on clarification questions and guidance statements from 0 (complete disagreement) to 10 (complete agreement). Responses for guidance statements with a median 8 and a lower inter-quartile range bound 7 were considered as reaching consensus. RESULTS: Sixty-five experts accepted (66% response rate), with 47 completing the first questionnaire (72%), and 48 the second (74%). Statements reaching consensus included: in the first phase we should vaccinate front-line healthcare professionals and people 65 years with risk factors; widespread vaccination of children and adolescents should not be an early priority; and vaccines should be provided free of charge in the setting of national or cantonal vaccination campaigns. Statements not reaching consensus included: early vaccination of people living with someone with risk factors who are not themselves at risk; vaccination of people with previous confirmed or suspected COVID-19; and whether vaccination should be mandatory for individuals with certain activities, such as front-line healthcare professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Experts reached consensus on several statements that were available for decision-makers when making key decisions for COVID-19 vaccine deployment in Switzerland. Statements without consensus highlighted areas requiring expert and public dialogue. The modified Delphi process allowed us to rapidly synthesise views from a broad panel of experts on sensitive topics, and could be considered for a broad range of issues during public health crises.","output":"Expert guidance for COVID-19 vaccine deployment in Switzerland: a Delphi process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Several intensive-care units (ICUs) in Wuhan are nonstandard wards that were repurposed from general wards. Considering the shortage of medical resources and the need to prevent nosocomic infection, the respiratory-treatment strategy in these nonstandard ICUs is different from those in general wards and standard ICUs. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) plays an important role in nonstandard ICUs and is beneficial to the patients therein. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we analyzed four cases of HFNC-treated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a makeshift ICU and summarized our experience. DIAGNOSES: Four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were admitted to the makeshift ICU. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had oxygen treatment with HFNC, as well as regular treatment of antivirals and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: Two patients survived after treatment, while the other two died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 often have poor prognoses after mechanical ventilation, exhibiting corresponding complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis, which significantly prolongs length of stay in the ICU. HFNC could prevent intubation in some patients, thereby avoiding the above complications; however, this needs confirmation in further clinical studies. This treatment reduced difficulty and workloads for healthcare professionals, had good tolerability for patients, might not significantly increase the risk of infection for healthcare professionals, and do not require additional preventive measures against nosocomic infection. HFNC treatment has its advantages in providing oxygen therapy in COVID-19, but healthcare professionals should still pay close attention to changes in patients' oxygenation rates and respiratory frequency.","output":"Therapeutic effect of high-flow nasal cannula on severe COVID-19 patients in a makeshift intensive-care unit: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During an epidemic period, we compared patients hospitalized for initial suspicion of COVID-19 but for whom an alternative diagnosis was finally retained (n = 152) with those who had COVID-19 (n = 222).

Many studies have considered the effect of temperature on cardiovascular disease and found that there is an association between extreme levels of temperature, cold and hot, and cardiovascular disease.

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies focusing on detecting and testing the significance of the change point in the temperatureCcardiovascular relationship. Identifying the change point in cities may help to design better adaptive strategies in view of predicted weather changes in the future. Knowing the change points of temperature may prevent further mortality associated with the weather changes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously estimates the semiparametric relationship and detects the significant point. A semiparametric generalized change point single index model is introduced as our unified approach by adjusting for several weather variables. A permutation-based testing procedure to detect the change point is introduced as well. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm.

One trained observer recorded the healthcare activities performed, contacts with fomites, and self-contacts made by healthcare workers (HCWs), while another observer recorded fomite contacts of patients during the encounter using predefined checklists. RESULTS: The surface contacted by HCWs during the majority of visits was the patient (90%).

HCWs self-contacts differed significantly among HCW job roles, with providers and respiratory therapists contacting themselves significantly more times than nurses and nurse technicians (P < .05). When HCWs performed only 1 care activity, there were significant differences in the number of patient contacts and self-contacts that HCWs made during performance of multiple care activities (P < .05).

The present study compared the structure and composition of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), neurovascular coupling, and cerebrovascular function and cognition in young Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Wall thickness and the inner diameter of the MCA were smaller in females than males. Female MCA exhibited less vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), diminished contractile capability, and more collagen in the media, and a thicker internal elastic lamina with fewer fenestrae compared with males. Female MCA had elevated myogenic tone, lower distensibility, and higher wall stress. The stress/strain curves shifted to the left in female vessels compared with males. The MCA of females failed to constrict compared with a decrease of 15.5  1.9% in males when perfusion pressure was increased from 40 to 180 mmHg. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) rose by 57.4  4.4 and 30.1  3.1% in females and males, respectively, when perfusion pressure increased from 100 to 180 mmHg. The removal of endothelia did not alter the myogenic response in both sexes. Functional hyperemia responses to whisker-barrel stimulation and cognition examined with an eight-arm water maze were similar in both sexes. These results demonstrate that there are intrinsic structural differences in the MCA between sexes, which are associated with diminished myogenic response and CBF autoregulation in females. The structural differences do not alter neurovascular coupling and cognition at a young age; however, they might play a role in the development of CVD after menopause. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Using perfusion fixation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in calcium-free solution at physiological pressure and systematically randomly sampling the sections prepared from the same M2 segments of MCA, we found that there are structural differences that are associated with altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation but not neurovascular coupling and cognition in young, healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.

We investigated the interaction of these two important factors on health-related job loss (HRJL) over 2 years of follow-up comparing male and female older workers. METHODS: A population sample of adults aged 50-64 years, recruited from 24 English general practices in the Health and Employment After Fifty (HEAF) study, completed questionnaires at baseline with follow-ups at 12 and 24 months. Multiple-record Cox proportional hazards models were performed to explore the main effects of, and potential interactions between, job satisfaction and self-rated health (SRH) as predictors of time to first HRJL. RESULTS: Of the initial 8134 participants, 5143 were ever in work in the study period. Among men, 5.7% and 14.3% reported job dissatisfaction (those in good and poor SRH, respectively), while among women these percentages were 4.6 and 12.9. HRJL was reported by 106 men and 176 women. Men in good health dissatisfied with their job had a sixfold (HR=6.4; 95% CI 3.3 to 12.4) increased risk of HRJL compared with men satisfied with their job (significant multiplicative interaction). Women dissatisfied with their job were more likely to have an HRJL within 2 years of follow-up irrespective of their SRH.

We conducted a comprehensive global study investigating the number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published on different health conditions, and how this compares with the global disease burden that they impose. METHODS: We use machine learning to monitor PubMed daily, and find and analyse RCT reports. We assessed RCTs investigating the leading causes of morbidity and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease study. Using regression models, we compared numbers of actual RCTs in different health conditions to numbers predicted from their global disease burden (disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)). We investigated whether RCT numbers differed for conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development. RESULTS: We estimate 463 000 articles describing RCTs (95% prediction interval 439 000 to 485 000) were published from 1990 to July 2020. RCTs recruited a median of 72 participants (IQR 32C195). 82% of RCTs were conducted by researchers in the top fifth of countries by socio-economic development. As DALYs increased for a particular health condition by 10%, the number of RCTs in the same year increased by 5% (3.2%C6.9%), but the association was weak (adjusted R(2)=0.13). Conditions disproportionately affecting countries with lower socioeconomic development, including respiratory infections and tuberculosis (7000 RCTs below predicted) and enteric infections (9700 RCTs below predicted), appear relatively under-researched for their disease burden. Each 10% shift in DALYs towards countries with low and middle socioeconomic development was associated with a 4% reduction in RCTs (3.7%C4.9%).

We focus on three dimensions of vaccination: procurement and production; regulation of marketing registration; and distribution and uptake. For each dimension we show the distinct challenges and opportunities faced by MICs. We illustrate these challenges and opportunities with the case of Brazil, showing how each dimension has been affected by intense political conflicts. Brazil's procurement and production strategy, which builds on a long trajectory of local production and technology transfer, has been riddled by conflicts between the national government and state governments. The regulatory approval process, based around one of Latin America's most highly-regarded regulatory authorities, has also been subject to acute inter- and intra-governmental conflicts. And with regard to distribution and uptake, in the face of high uncertainty, even with a solid health infrastructure, Brazil encounters difficulties in promoting vaccine delivery.

The incidence of IUI is low and dependent on the type of surgery (< 10 %), but it is associated with high morbidity. Therefore, intraoperative visualization of the ureter is critical to reduce the incidence of IUI, and some methodologies for ureter visualization have been developed. Amongst these, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) visualization is thought to bring an advantage with real-time retroperitoneal visualization through the retroperitoneum. We investigated an indocyanine green (ICG) derivative, ASP5354, which emits NIRF at 820 nm when exposed to near-infrared light at a wavelength of 780 nm, in a rodent and porcine model. PROCEDURES Wistar rats and G?ttingen minipigs under anesthesia were laparotomized and then administered ASP5354 chloride intravenously at dose of 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg for rats and 0.001 and 0.01 mg/kg for minipigs, respectively. Videos of the abdominal cavity in minipigs were taken using a near-infrared fluorescent camera (pde-neo) and assessed visually by three independent clinicians. Toxicological evaluation was demonstrated with cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS The proportion of animals whose ureters were visible up to 3 h after administration of ASP5354 chloride were 33 % at 0.001 mg/kg and 100 % at 0.01 mg/kg, respectively. In a toxicological study in cynomolgus monkeys, ASP5354 chloride demonstrated no significant toxicity, suggesting that 0.01 mg/kg provides an optimal dose when used clinically and could allow for ureter visualization during routine surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS The dose of 0.01 mg/kg provided an optimal dose for ureter visualization up to 3 h after administration. ASP5354 shows promise for ureter visualization during abdominopelvic surgery, which may potentially lower the risk of IUI.","output":"Preclinical Development and Validation of ASP5354: A Near-Infrared Fluorescent Agent for Intraoperative Ureter Visualization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many lecturers in higher education institutions suddenly had to switch from on campus to online teaching An online learning environment demands more from students self-regulation skills Self-regulation skills allow students to achieve their goals and continue to develop cognitively and personally In order to achieve effective learning in an online environment, we argue that increasing students' self-regulatory skills must be a central tenet in designing online education Based on students and lecturers experience, we identify three issues regarding self-regulated learning in an online environment: 1) disrupted curriculum structure and study rhythm, 2) less feedback, and 3) fewer opportunities to reflect together Subsequently, we make recommendations to provide a solid online environment in which self-regulation can occur Each recommendation empowers students to enhance their self-regulation skills by going through the self-regulated learning cycle The different recommendations reinforce each other in achieving effective learning in an online environment","output":"How to Encourage Online Self-regulation of Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Designed in 2012 with a first implementation in 2013, NE STEM 4U is a professional development program for post-secondary students/undergraduates, and serves as a source of outreach, content knowledge generation, and STEM literacy for youth in grades kindergarten through 8th grade (ages 5C14). The model empowers post-secondary students as facilitators of inquiry-based learning within the context of an out-of-school time program. This study investigated the potential for replicating or franchising this model by evaluating on the following: (1) Is the model replicable? And, if so, (2) what core elements are necessary for program fidelity? And (3) is there a dependency on a particular setting/participant type (e.g., a more rural or urban setting)? RESULTS: Strategic expansion of the program to different institutional types (i.e., Research 1, Research II, and a predominantly undergraduate institution), different geographical locations (i.e., rural and urban), and with various school district partners (i.e., large and small) determined that program fidelity and replicability required 4 core elements or criteria: (i) intentional programming, (ii) staff quality, (iii) effective partnerships, and (iv) program evaluation and continuous improvement. Importantly, we examined emergent themes by each site, as well as in combination (n = 16 focus group participants, n = 12 reflection surveys). These data indicated that Flexibility (21.22%), Student Engagement (i.e., Youth) (19.53%), Classroom Management (i.e., also pertaining to youth) (19.31%), and Communication (15.71%) were the themes most referenced by the post-secondary student mentors in the NE STEM 4U program, regardless of site.

As a result, there was a rapid change in transplant practices and policies, with cessation of most procedures. Our goal was to understand changes to pediatric kidney transplantation (KT) at the national level during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: Using SRTR data, we examined changes in pediatric waitlist registration, waitlist removal or inactivation, and deceased donor and living donor (DDKT/LDKT) events during the start of the disease transmission in the USA compared with the same time the previous year. RESULTS: We saw an initial decrease in DDKT and LDKT by 47% and 82% compared with expected events and then a continual increase, with numbers reaching expected prepandemic levels by May 2020. In the early phase of the pandemic, waitlist inactivation and removals due to death or deteriorating condition rose above expected values by 152% and 189%, respectively. There was a statistically significant decrease in new waitlist additions (IRR 0.49 0.65 0.85) and LDKT (IRR 0.17 0.38 0.84) in states with high vs. low COVID activity. Transplant recipients during the pandemic were more likely to have received a DDKT, but had similar calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) values, waitlist time, and cause of kidney failure as before the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the longitudinal effects of physician trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout using three surveys conducted during the early phase of the pandemic. DESIGN: Longitudinal survey study. PARTICIPANTS: All physician trainees (N = 1375) at an academic medical center. MAIN MEASURE: Assess the relationship between repeated exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 and stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. KEY RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-nine trainees completed the baseline survey (28.3%). Of these, 191 and 136 completed the ensuing surveys. Mean stress, anxiety, and burnout decreased by 21% (95% confidence interval (CI): ? 28 to ? 12%; P < 0.001), 25% (95% CI: ? 36 to ? 11%; P < 0.001), and 13% (95% CI: ? 18 to ? 7%; P < 0.001), respectively, per survey. However, for each survey time point, there was mean increase in stress, anxiety, and burnout per additional exposure: stress [24% (95% CI: + 12 to + 38%; P < 0.001)], anxiety [22% (95% CI: + 2 to + 46%; P = 0.026)], and burnout [18% (95% CI: + 10 to + 28%; P < 0.001)].

Our objective was to test a fully automated closed-loop control (CLC) system in the absence of announcement of carbohydrate ingestion among adolescents with T1D, who are known to commonly omit meal announcement. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Eighteen adolescents with T1D (age 15.6  1.7 years; HbA1c 7.4  1.5%; 9 females/9 males) participated in a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing our legacy hybrid CLC system (Unified Safety System Virginia [USS]-Virginia) with a novel fully automated CLC system (RocketAP) during two 46-h supervised admissions (each with one announced and one unannounced dinner), following 2 weeks of data collection. Primary outcome was the percentage time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL (TIR) following the unannounced meal, with secondary outcomes related to additional continuous glucose monitoring-based metrics. RESULTS Both TIR and time-in-tight-range 70-140 mg/dL (TTR) were significantly higher using RocketAP than using USS-Virginia during the 6 h following the unannounced meal (83% [interquartile range 64-93] vs. 53% [40-71]; P = 0.004 and 49% [41-59] vs. 27% [22-36]; P = 0.002, respectively), primarily driven by reduced time-above-range (TAR >180 mg/dL: 17% [1.3-34] vs. 47% [28-60]), with no increase in time-below-range (TBR <70 mg/dL: 0% median for both). RocketAP also improved control following the announced meal (mean difference TBR: -0.7%, TIR: +7%, TTR: +6%), overall (TIR: +5%, TAR: -5%, TTR: +8%), and overnight (TIR: +7%, TTR: +19%, TAR: -5%).

The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150C250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge.

Epidemiologists have shown that the mortality risks are higher when the health care system is subjected to pressure from COVID-19. It is therefore of great importance to maintain the health of health care providers and prevent contamination. An important group who will be required to treat patients with COVID-19 are health care providers during semiacute surgery. There are concerns that laparoscopic surgery increases the risk of contamination more than open surgery; therefore, balancing the safety of health care providers with the benefit of laparoscopic surgery for the patient is vital. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide an overview of potential contamination routes and possible risks for health care providers; we also aimed to propose research questions based on current literature and expert opinions about performing laparoscopic surgery on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a scoping review, adding five additional questions concerning possible contaminating routes. A systematic search was performed on the PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases, adding results from gray literature as well. The search not only included COVID-19 but was extended to virus contamination in general. We excluded society and professional association statements about COVID-19 if they did not add new insights to the available literature. RESULTS: The initial search provided 2007 records, after which 267 full-text papers were considered. Finally, we used 84 papers, of which 14 discussed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Eight papers discussed the added value of performing intubation in a low-pressure operating room, mainly based on the SARS outbreak experience in 2003. Thirteen papers elaborated on the risks of intubation for health care providers and SARS-CoV-2, and 19 papers discussed this situation with other viruses. They conclude that there is significant evidence that intubation and extubation is a high-risk aerosol-producing procedure. No papers were found on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 and surgical smoke, although 25 papers did provide conflicting evidence on the infection risk of human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, polio, and rabies. No papers were found discussing tissue extraction or the deflation risk of the pneumoperitoneum after laparoscopic surgery. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be consensus in the literature that intubation and extubation are high-risk procedures for health care providers and that maximum protective equipment is needed. On the other hand, minimal evidence is available of the actual risk of contamination of health care providers during laparoscopy itself, nor of operating room pressure, surgical smoke, tissue extraction, or CO2 deflation. However, new studies are being published daily from current experiences, and society statements are continuously updated. There seems to be no reason to abandon laparoscopic surgery in favor of open surgery. However, the risks should not be underestimated, surgery should be performed on patients with COVID-19 only when necessary, and health care providers should use logic and common sense to protect themselves and others by performing surgery in a safe and protected environment.","output":"COVID-19 and Laparoscopic Surgery: Scoping Review of Current Literature and Local Expertise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, national and local governments introduced a large number of policies, particularly non-pharmaceutical interventions, to combat the spread of Covid-19. Understanding the effects that these policies had (both on Covid-19 cases and on other outcomes) is particularly challenging though because (i) Covid-19 testing was not widely available, (ii) the availability of tests varied across locations, and (iii) the tests that were available were generally targeted towards individuals meeting certain eligibility criteria. In this paper, we propose a new approach to evaluate the effect of policies early in the pandemic that accommodates limited and nonrandom testing. Our approach results in (generally informative) bounds on the effect of the policy on actual cases and in point identification of the effect of the policy on other outcomes. We apply our approach to study the effect of Tennessee's open-testing policy during the early stage of the pandemic.

In this study, we investigated parental behaviour when feeding their children and their willingness to pay for a game product with educational and eating functions. The sample consisted of 300 parents of children aged from 4 to 12. A hypothetical choice experiment has been used and a latent class model estimated the parents preferences for a plant-based product game carrying two attributes, namely, the price and narrative context of the game The results indicated that parents were willing to pay more for a product with a storybook related to healthy eating habits or recycling than one with no storybook. Moreover, two dominant feeding styles in households were found: indulgent parents and uninvolved parents.

Such an approach allows us to transform tourism and thereby evolve it to be of wider benefit and less damaging to societies and ecologies than has been the case under the corporatised model of tourism. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual analysis draws on the theorisation of tourism as a social force and the new concept of socialising tourism. Using critical tourism approaches, it seeks to identify the dynamics that are evident in order to assess the possibilities for socialising tourism for social and ecological justice. It employs an Indigenous perspective that the past, present and future are interconnected in its consideration of tourism futures. Findings: COVID-19 has fundamentally disrupted tourism, travel and affiliated industries. In dealing with the crisis, borders have been shut, lockdowns imposed and international tourism curtailed. The pandemic foregrounded the renewal of social bonds and social capacities as governments acted to prevent economic and social devastation. This disruption of normality has inspired some to envision radical transformations in tourism to address the injustices and unsustainability of tourism. Others remain sceptical of the likelihood of transformation. Indeed, phenomena such as vaccine privilege and vaccine tourism are indicators that transformations must be enabled. The authors look to New Zealand examples as hopeful indications of the ways in which tourism might be transformed for social and ecological justice. Practical implications: This conceptualisation could guide the industry to better stakeholder relations and sustainability. Social implications: Socialising tourism offers a fruitful pathway to rethinking tourism through a reorientation of the social relations it fosters and thereby transforming its social impacts for the better. Originality/value: This work engages with the novel concept of socialising tourism. In connecting this new theory to the older theory of tourism as a social force, this paper considers how COVID-19 has offered a possible transformative moment to enable more just and sustainable tourism futures. ? 2021, Freya Higgins-Desbiolles, Bobbie Chew Bigby and Adam Doering.","output":"Socialising tourism after COVID-19: reclaiming tourism as a social force?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Detailed clinical assessment of the central nervous system involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant due to the low specificity of neurological manifestations, the complexity of evaluation of patient complaints, reduced awareness of the existing spectrum of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, as well as low yield of the neurological imaging.

Adequately cleaning surfaces in patient rooms is an essential part of this fight to reduce the spread. Traditional audits, however, are insufficient. This study assesses surface cleaning practices using UV marker technology and the extent to which this technology can help improve cleaning audits and practices. METHODS: 144 audits (1,235 surfaces) were retrieved. UV marker cleaning audits conducted at a major teaching hospital in 2018 after implementing a new cleaning protocol. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with cleaning staff and supervisors. RESULTS: On average, 63% of surfaces were appropriately cleaned. Toilet handles (80%) and toilet seats underside (83%) scored highest while main room sink fixtures (54%), light switch (55%) and bedrails (56%) scored lowest. Training, staffing and time constraints may play a role in low cleaning rates. DISCUSSION: The high-touch patient surfaces in the bedroom remain neglected and a potential source of infections.

To slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have introduced mobility restrictions, ordered the temporary closure of businesses, and encouraged social distancing. These policies have directly and indirectly influenced travel behaviour, particularly modal preferences. The purpose of this paper to explore modality profiles for non-mandatory trips and analyze how they have changed in response to the pandemic and pandemic-related public health policies. The data used for this study were collected from web-based surveys conducted in the Greater Toronto Area. Modality profiles were identified through the application of latent class cluster analysis, with six modality profiles being identified for both the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The results indicate that the importance of public transit has declined during the pandemic, while the roles of private vehicles and active modes have become more prominent. However, individuals changes in modal preferences vary based on their pre-pandemic modality profile. In particular, it appears that pre-pandemic transit users with access to a private vehicle have substituted public transit for travel by private vehicle, while those without private vehicle access are continuing to use public transit for non-mandatory trips. Consequently, pandemic-related transportation policies should consider those who do not have access to a private vehicle and aim to help those making non-mandatory trips using transit or active modes comply with local public health guidelines while travelling. The results highlight how the changes in modal preferences that occurred due to the pandemic differ among different segments of the population. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd","output":"Exploring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on modality profiles for non-mandatory trips in the Greater Toronto Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to the healthcare system, including increased reliance on virtual services, particularly clinic appointments.

The use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for the management of postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock is controversial, and there are at least three scenarios where it may be necessary: first, pre-emptive postoperative VA-ECMO, where the decision for postoperative mechanical support is made prior to surgery, for example, in the context of poor pre-operative cardiac function; second, early yet unplanned post-cardiopulmonary bypass VA-ECMO following a long duration of cardiopulmonary bypass due to, for example, unexpected surgical complications; third, late rescue VA-ECMO following several attempts at weaning, either immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass or following transfer to the intensive care unit. The use of mechanical circulatory support for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock is further complicated by the wide range of available devices, the availability of VA-ECMO in different centres, variations in experience and expertise as a function of local VA-ECMO workload, and regional variations in the diagnosis and management of postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock.

This study aimed to review the association of COVID-19 with renal involvement. Evidence Acquisition: International databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched for articles by April 1, 2020. Keywords were COVID-19, coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2, kidney, renal function, acute kidney injury, and acute renal failure, or a combination of them in title/abstracts. Results: There were a few studies concerning COVID-19 and renal failure due to the short time elapsed from the epidemic onset. The results showed that hematuria and proteinuria were common in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Patients with elevated creatinine are at risk of mortality two times more than patients with normal creatinine. Also, elevated BUN, proteinuria, and hematuria can increase the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19 up to four times compared to patients with normal tests. Therefore, it is important to check creatinine, BUN, proteinuria, and hematuria in primary assessments. Generally, all routine measures for people affected with COVID-19 can be done for COVID-19 patients with acute renal failure until the current knowledge is changed.

METHODS: Logistic regression assessed associations between HBM factors and consistent adoption of five individual NPI strategies. Multivariate linear regression assessed HBM correlates of NPI adoption overall. RESULTS: Correlates of NPI uptake varied by strategy. Only perceived NPI benefits were significantly associated with NPI adoption individually and overall. Perceived susceptibility was associated with use of hand sanitizer, facemasks, and general NPI adoption. Perceived severity was associated with avoidance of large social gatherings only.

We sought to understand the frequency and characteristics of social media usage among general surgery trainees. MATERIALS AND METHODS General surgery trainees in 15 American training programs were invited to participate in an anonymous electronic survey. The survey included questions about demographics, frequency of social media usage, and perceptions of risks and benefits of social media. Univariate analysis was performed to identify differences between high users of social media (4-7 h per week on at least one platform) and low users (0-3 h or less on all platforms). RESULTS One hundred fifty-seven of 591 (26.6%) trainees completed the survey. Most respondents were PGY3 or lower (75%) and high users of social media (74.5%). Among high users, the most popular platforms were Instagram (85.7%), YouTube (85.1%), and Facebook (83.6%). YouTube and Twitter were popular for surgical education (77.3% and 68.2%, respectively). The most reported benefits of social media were improving patient education and professional networking (85.0%), where high users agreed more strongly about these benefits (P = 0.002). The most reported risks were seeing other residents (42%) or attendings (17%) with unprofessional behavior. High users disagreed more strongly about risks, including observing attendings with unprofessional behavior (P = 0.028).

However, little is known about the development and maintenance, as well as heterogeneity of immune cell exhaustion. Here, we investigated the effects of HIV infection on immune cell exhaustion at the transcriptomic level by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four healthy subjects (37,847 cells) and six HIV-infected donors (28,610 cells). We identified nine immune cell clusters and eight T cell subclusters, and three of these (exhausted CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and interferon-responsive CD8(+) T cells) were detected only in samples from HIV-infected donors. An inhibitory receptor KLRG1 was identified in a HIV-1 specific exhausted CD8(+) T cell population expressing KLRG1, TIGIT, and T-bet(dim)Eomes(hi) markers. Ex-vivo antibody blockade of KLRG1 restored the function of HIV-specific exhausted CD8(+) T cells demonstrating the contribution of KLRG1(+) population to T cell exhaustion and providing an immunotherapy target to treat HIV chronic infection. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of gene signatures associated with immune cell exhaustion during HIV infection, which could be useful in understanding exhaustion mechanisms and developing new cure therapies.","output":"An atlas of immune cell exhaustion in HIV-infected individuals revealed by single-cell transcriptomics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Removal of rectosigmoid retained foreign bodies (RFB) may require laparoscopy and often laparotomy.

Patients without clinical findings concerning for acute colonic perforation undergo bedside digital rectal examination and proctoscopic attempt at removal of RFB. If unsuccessful, patients undergo rectal examination under anesthesia with proctoscopy and attempted RFB removal. If the RFB cannot be easily removed, a TAMIS port is inserted into the anal canal and pneumorectum is established. A laparoscopic camera and instruments are then used to facilitate removal of the RFB. To date, TAMIS was successful in all 10 patients with RFB requiring an operation. All patients tolerated the procedure well and were discharged to home from the postoperative recovery room. Unfortunately, none of the patients presented for follow-up visits, but there were no known complications.

This perception has attracted attention in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to their fragile health systems and economies. The objective of this study was to understand how residents in Malawi perceived COVID-19, to determine the factors related to KAP. Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was used for the data collection. A field-based survey was conducted among adult residents in Lilongwe, Malawi. Descriptive statistic, linear regression, the Chi-square test, and Pearsons correlation statistics were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 580 questionnaires were involved. The mean knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores were 10 (SD = 3, range: 3C19), 16 (SD = 4, range: 5C25), and 2 (SD = 1, range: 0C5), respectively. Lack of money and resources (39%) was the biggest challenge for people who practice prevention measures. Among the participants, the radio (70%) and friends/family (56%) were the main sources of information. A higher economic status was associated with better KAP. Conclusions: A low level of KAP was detected among the population. The people faced challenges regarding a lack of necessary preventive resources and formal information channels. The situation was worse considering vulnerable population who had low economic status.

Recent literature on TBDA mainly focuses on different expression forms of targets and performance levels, and on different types of aggregation operators in terms of multi-attribute preference functions. However, different expression forms are usually introduced separately in literature, which cannot fully support the inherent complexity of problems along with different perception and knowledge levels of decision makers during assessing targets and performance levels. Furthermore, although there are attractive features of multilinear target-based preference functions (MTPFs), its applications are seldom considered because of the complexity of identifying their coefficients. In order to solve these two issues, an integrated approach is proposed for multilinear hybrid-information target-based decision analysis, which can deal with diverse forms of targets and performance levels, and identify the coefficients of MTPFs. First, given targets and performance levels for each attribute being expressed in multiple forms simultaneously, a generalized procedure is proposed to transform different forms into probability distributions, and to measure probability of target achievement for each attribute. Second, a novel procedure to identify the coefficients of MTPFs is proposed. This procedure is based on the multilinear model and 2-additive fuzzy measures, which is based on the equivalence between multilinear model based on fuzzy measures and MTPFs. The approach is applied to a case study involving customer competitive evaluation of smart thermometer patches to demonstrate its feasibility and advantages.","output":"Multilinear target-based decision analysis with hybrid-information targets and performance levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the increasing personalization of medicine, surprisingly ~37.0C (98.6F) continues as the estimate of normal temperature. We investigated between-subject and within-subject thermal variability, whether a significant percentage of individuals have a low mean oral temperature, and whether these differ by sex, age, time of day, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), or menstrual phase. Oral temperature was measured by Life Brand(?) Fast-Read Digital Oral Thermometers and sampled 14 times over two weeks, seven morning and seven evening readings. The volunteer sample consisted of 96 adults (42 men, 54 women; 27 couples, 42 singletons), ages 18C67 years. We found sizeable individual differences in body temperature and that the normal temperature of many individuals is considerably lower than 37.0C (98.6F). Mean temperatures ranged from 35.2C (95.4F) to 37.4C (99.3F). The mean temperature across all participants was 36.1C (97.0F)lower than most studies have reported, consistent with recent evidence of temperature declining over decades. 77% had mean temperatures at least 0.55C (1F) lower than 37.0C (98.6F). Mean temperature did not differ by age, but women had higher temperatures than men, even within a couple with room temperature and warmth of clothing equated. Although oral temperature varied widely across individuals, it showed marked stability within individuals over days. Variability of temperature over days did not differ by sex, but was larger among younger adults. Using 37.0C (98.6F) as the assumed normal temperature for everyone can result in healthcare professionals failing to detect a serious fever in individuals with a low normal temperature or obtaining false negatives for those individuals when using temperature to screen for COVID-19, mistaking their elevated temperature as normal. Some have called for lowering the estimate of normal temperature slightly (e.g., 0.2C [0.36F]). That still seems an overly high estimate. More important, using any standardized normal temperature will lead to errors for many people. Individual differences are simply too great. Personalizing body temperature is needed. Temperature could be measured at yearly doctor visits, as blood pressure is now. That would be simple to implement. Since our results show marked thermal stability within an individual, sampling temperature only once yearly could provide an accurate indication of a persons normal temperature at that time of day. Such records over time would also provide a more accurate understanding of how temperature changes over the lifespan.","output":"One size does not fit all: Assuming the same normal body temperature for everyone is not justified"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linear and polynomial regression model has been used to investigate the COVID-19 outbreak in India and its different states using time series epidemiological data up to 26th May 2020.

As an organism ages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined performance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease and death. In this study we develop a mathematical model of the immune system that incorporates both the innate and adaptive immune compartments, named the integrated immune branch (IIB) model, and investigate how immune behavior changes in response to a sequence of pathogen encounters. We find that repeated pathogen exposures induce a fragility, in which exposure to novel pathogens may cause the immune response to transition to a chronic inflammatory state. The chronic inflammatory state of the IIB model is qualitatively consistent with\\"inflammaging,\\"a clinically-observed condition in which aged individuals experience chronic low-grade inflammation even in the absence of pathogens. Thus, the IIB model quantitatively demonstrates how immunosenescence can manifest itself in the innate compartment as inflammaging. In particular, the onset of a persistent inflammatory response strongly depends on the history of encountered pathogens; the timing of its onset differs drastically when the same set of infections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the two immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen clearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence. By considering complex feedbacks between immune compartments, our work suggests potential mechanisms for immunosenescence and provides a theoretical framework to account for clinical observations.","output":"Fragility of an aging immune system"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 pandemic many countries enforced mandatory stay-at-home orders.

Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between depressive symptoms and PA among college students with different gender and gender role (masculinity traits and femininity traits) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Methods: Cross-sectional study included 628 healthy college students from nineteen different locations. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scales (CES-D), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and the 50-item Chinese Sex-Role Inventory (CSRI-50) were used to measure depressive symptoms, PA continuous (weekly metabolic equivalent minutes, MET-minutes/week) and categorical indicators (activity level category) and gender role, respectively. The statistical analyses were used in partial correlation analysis, t-test, one-way ANOVA, moderation model tests, and linear regression model tests. Results: Total of 34.72% participants had clinically relevant depression (16, CES-D scale). Total of 58.6% participants were classified as a \\"low\\" activity level for spending less time on PA. Depression significantly negatively correlated with MET-minutes/week in moderate-intensity PA but not vigorous and walking scores. Of note, the depression-PA association was only moderated by the \\"low\\" activity level group in terms of categorical scores across gender groups. Participants with higher masculinity traits were less likely to have depression among all participants. Moreover, more recovered cases and fewer deaths could also predict the lower depression risk in the \\"high\\" activity level group. Conclusion: Moderate-intensity PA is beneficial for reducing depression risk among college students at a low activity level. College students with fewer masculinity traits (regardless of gender) are highly vulnerable to depression during the outbreak of COVID-19.

Pathophysiology suggests that viral stimulation of the innate immune system, augmented by inflammatory signals sent from dying cells, ramps up into a poorly controlled outpouring of inflammatory mediators. Other aging-related changes in cells such as senescence as well as higher prevalence of chronic disease states also likely ramp up inflammatory signaling. This in turn drives downstream pathophysiological changes to pulmonary, cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and brain tissues that drive many of the adverse health outcomes observed in older adults. This article provides an overview of the underlying etiologies of innate immune system activation and adaptive immune system dysregulation in older adults and how they potentiate the consequences of the COVID-19-related cytokine storm, and possible uses of this knowledge to develop better risk assessment and treatment monitoring strategies.","output":"Underlying Vulnerabilities to the Cytokine Storm and Adverse COVID-19 Outcomes in the Aging Immune System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: About 30% of patients with Guillain-Barr syndrome become ventilator dependent, of whom roughly 75% develop pneumonia. This trial aimed at assessing the impact of early mechanical ventilation (EMV) on pneumonia occurrence in GBS patients. We hypothesize that EMV will reduce the incidence of pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial performed on two parallel groups. 50 intensive care unit adults admitted for Guillain-Barr syndrome and at risk for acute respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to early mechanical ventilation via face-mask or endotracheal intubation owing to the presence or absence of impaired swallowing (experimental arm), or to conventional care (control arm). The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumonia up to intensive care unit discharge (or 90 days, pending of which occurred first). FINDINGS: Twenty-five patients were randomized in each group. There was no significant difference between groups for the incidence of pneumonia (10/25 (40%) vs 9/25 (36%), P = 1). There was no significant difference between groups for the time to onset of pneumonia (P = 0.50, Gray test). During follow-up, there were 16/25 (64%) mechanically ventilated patients in the control group, and 25/25 (100%) in the experimental arm (P < 0001). The time on ventilator was non-significantly shorter in the experimental arm (14 [7; 29] versus 21.5 [17.3; 35.5], P = 0.10). There were no significant differences between groups for length of hospital stay, neurological scores, the proportion of patients who needed tracheostomy, in-hospital death, or any serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study including adults with Guillain-Barr syndrome at high risk of respiratory failure, we did not observe a prevention of pneumonia with early mechanical ventilation.

The most recent increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections over July to August 2020 resulted in more than 100 new cases per day for a prolonged period. The increased numbers of critically ill patients requiring ICU admission posed a capacity challenge to ICUs across the territory, and it may be reasonably anticipated that should a substantially larger outbreak occur, ICU services will be overwhelmed. Therefore, a transparent and fair prioritisation process for decisions regarding patient ICU admission is urgently required. This triage tool is built on the foundation of the existing guidelines and framework for admission, discharge, and triage that inform routine clinical practice in Hospital Authority ICUs, with the aim of achieving the greatest benefit for the greatest number of patients from the available ICU resources. This COVID-19 Crisis Triage Tool is expected to provide structured guidance to frontline doctors on how to make triage decisions should ICU resources become overwhelmed by patients requiring ICU care, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The triage tool takes the form of a detailed decision aid algorithm based on a combination of established prognostic scores, and it should increase objectivity and transparency in triage decision making and enhance decision-making consistency between doctors within and across ICUs in Hong Kong.

This study examines partisan patterns in mental health outcomes at three time points throughout the pandemic. Results demonstrate a clear partisan distress gap, with Democrats consistently reporting worse mental health than Republicans. Trend data suggest that the 2020 pandemic patterns are a continuation and exacerbation of an existing partisan distress gap.

Design is based on and guided by cognitive support findings coming from a long-term collaboration of a team of engineers (University of Zaragoza) and special education teachers (Alborada Special Education School, Zaragoza). The description starts by providing a structure of such findings in five cognitive-social areas (interface usability, virtual representations understanding, time orientation, self-awareness, and social interaction). Design requirements are extracted by applying those findings to four support services (home control, time orientation, behavior contention, and context anticipation). Technological system description follows, together with the degree of implementation and testing for each service. A major result is the benefit of using a services interface with the same structure and appearance as the alternative and augmentative communication system that children are already acquainted with. Based on regulatory conditions, the needed flexibility, and reduced available budgets, this support platform is built on mainstream technology and low-cost single-board computers with standard databases and free software packages.

Methods: A mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression was used to investigate vaccine impact. Impact was assessed both for a vaccine that prevents infection (VEs = 95%) and a vaccine that prevents only disease (VEp = 95%). Results: For VEs = 95% and gradual easing of restrictions, vaccination in the US reduced the peak incidence of infection, disease, and death by >55% and cumulative incidence by >32%, and in China by >77% and >65%, respectively. Nearly three vaccinations were needed to avert one infection in the US, but only one was needed in China. For VEp = 95%, benefits of vaccination were half those for VEs = 95%. In both countries, the impact of vaccination was substantially enhanced with rapid scale-up, vaccine coverage >50%, and slower or no easing of restrictions, particularly in the US. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination can flatten, delay, and/or prevent future epidemic waves. However, vaccine impact is destined to be heterogeneous across countries because of an underlying epidemiologic inequity that reduces benefits for countries already at high incidence, such as the US. Despite 95% efficacy, actual vaccine impact could be meager in such countries, if vaccine scale-up is slow, acceptance of the vaccine is poor, or restrictions are eased prematurely.","output":"Epidemiological differences in the impact of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States and China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Waterborne diseases are a major global problem, resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and massive economic costs. The ability to rapidly and reliably detect and monitor the spread of waterborne diseases is vital for early intervention and preventing more widespread disease outbreaks. Pathogens are, however, difficult to detect in water and are not practicably detectable at acceptable concentrations that need to be achieved in treated drinking water (which are of the order one per million litre). Furthermore, current clinical-based surveillance methods have many limitations such as the invasive nature of the testing and the challenges in testing large numbers of people. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which is based on the analysis of wastewater to monitor the emergence and spread of infectious disease at a population level, has received renewed attention in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present review will focus on the application of WBE for the detection and surveillance of pathogens with a focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the waterborne protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia.

Biosensors have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective tools for the analysis of sewage biomarkers due to their fast response, ease-to-use, low cost and the potential for field-testing. This paper presents biosensors as effective tools for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers and monitoring of public health via WBE. In particular, we discuss the use of sewage sensors for rapid detection of a range of targets, including rapid monitoring of community-wide illicit drug consumption and pathogens for early warning of infectious diseases outbreaks.

Laboratory studies showed leucocytosis, elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), D-Dimers and fibrinogen. Echocardiography depicted hyperechogenicity in the coronary arteries. Treatment with a single dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and aspirin (ASA) was performed, but clinical worsening motivated the introduction of oral corticotherapy. She was discharged after 8 days with clinical and analytical improvement.An 8-year-old female, infected with SARS-COV-2 twenty days before the admission, presented to the ED complaining of persistent fever with a 2-days evolution, associated with abdominal pain and maculopapular rash in the trunk and face. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevation of inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR and ferritin), D-Dimers, fibrinogen and cardiac enzymes. Echocardiography revealed hyperechogenicity of the coronary arteries. She began treatment with IV methylprednisolone pulses for 3 days, ASA and oral corticoid.

Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 via rRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens were isolated and cultured in Vero-E6 cells. Results 243 patients (mean age 63.1 years;54.3 % men) were enrolled from July 15, 2020 to September 2, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed from 242 (99.6 %) nasopharyngeal, 243 (100 %) rectal, 183 (75.3 %) upper gastrointestinal tract and 73 (30 %) colon samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal specimens in one patient (0.4 %). After a 14-day incubation period, there was no evidence of virus growth in cells incubated with any of these specimens. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 was rarely detected in the gastrointestinal tract of patients with negative nasopharyngeal testing prior to endoscopy. No live virus was detected by culture, further highlighting that presence of viral genome on its own is not sufficient proof of infectivity. PCR-based screening provides limited insight into virus infectivity and its results should be interpreted carefully as to avoid unnecessary delays in clinical care or inadvertent risk exposure.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract among patients with negative nasopharyngeal COVID-19 testing prior to endoscopy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In gastrointestinal surgery, anastomosis can result in various complications. Anastomosis is evaluated using classical examinations. The most reliable one is endoscopy, which provides direct information on the anastomosis and conduit. But the influence of endoscopy on anastomosis is uncertain. METHODS The internal pressure of a graft during endoscopy was measured in 36 patients who received esophagectomy, by utilizing the decompression tube which was inserted into the graft during operation. We filled the tube with water and measured the maximum water level in a centimeter water column. All examinations were routinely performed on the day after operation, and thin endoscopes were selected for reducing the stress. RESULTS The internal pressure before endoscopy ranged from 6 to 20 cm H2O, and during endoscopy ranged from 9 to 27 cm H2O. The difference in the internal conduit pressure in each patient ranged from 1 to 9 cm H2O. There was no increase in complications caused by endoscopy, including anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSION This study is the first to report changes in internal pressure due to the endoscope by direct measurement. The pressure gradient observed was below the physiological pressure during swallowing. These results suggest that endoscopy is a safe examination even after surgery.","output":"Internal pressure of the conduit during endoscopy on the day after esophagectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alles flie?

To study the epidemiological dynamics with the possibility of reinfection, I use a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Resistant-Susceptible model with the time-varying transmission rate. I consider three different ways of modeling reinfection. The crucial feature of this study is that I explore both the difference between the reinfection and no-reinfection scenarios and how the mitigation measures affect this difference. The principal results are the following. First, the dynamics of reinfection and no-reinfection scenarios are indistinguishable before the infection peak. Second, the mitigation measures delay not only the infection peak, but also the moment when the difference between the reinfection and no-reinfection scenarios becomes prominent. These results are robust to various modeling assumptions.","output":"Simulation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Scenarios with Possibility of Reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health risks within prisons are well known and have worsened with the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), becoming a public health emergency.

Before and after using AI-CDSS, the incidence of hospital-related VTE and using anticoagulants were analyzed. Results Between January to July 2019 and January to July 2020, 3,565 and 4,423 adult patients over 18 years old were hospitalized in our hospital and were designed as a control group and intervention group, respectively (7,988 in total). Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. There were 4,716 (59.03%) male patients, the mean age was 60.4313.09 years, and the mean stay was 7.567.76 days. More than half of the patients (4,605, 57.58%) came from the respiratory. VTE events during hospitalization occurred in 41 patients; overall, 5.13/1,000 (41 episodes in 7,988 patients).

OBJECTIVE We compared the early postoperative outcome in robot-assisted IPAA with open surgery procedures. DESIGN This was an observational study based on prospectively collected data obtained from chart reviews. SETTING The single-center data set covers patients operated on from January 13, 2004, to September 16, 2014, at a specialist center. PATIENTS Patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing IPAA surgery were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Study end points included the duration of operation, admission length, complications (Clavien-Dindo), reoperations, and readmissions. RESULTS Eighty-one robot-assisted and 170 open IPAA procedures were performed. The duration of operation was significantly longer for robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures (mean difference, 154 minutes; CI, 140-170). During a mean follow-up of 102 days, no significant differences in the distribution of complications were found (Spearman p = 0.12; p = 0.07), and no postoperative deaths occurred in either group. Postoperative admission length was shorter following robot-assisted procedures (mean difference, -1.9; CI, -3.5 to -0.3), whereas 40% of patients were readmitted, compared with 26% of patients who had open surgery (OR, 1.9; CI, 1.1-3.4). Pouch failure occurred in 3 patients (1 following robot-assisted laparoscopy; 2 following open surgery). On multivariate regression analyses, robot-assisted laparoscopy was associated with a significantly longer duration of operation (mean difference, 159 minutes; CI, 144-174), and more readmissions for any cause (OR, 2; CI, 1.1-3.7).

Currently, there is no effective vaccine available to protect the pigs from PEDV. The N-terminal subunit of spike protein (S1) is responsible for virus binding to the cellular receptor and contains a number of neutralizing antibody epitopes. Thus, we expressed and produced recombinant S1 protein to protect newborn piglets by immunization of sows. METHODS: Affinity tagged PEDV S1 protein was expressed in a secretory form in yeast, insect and mammalian cells to identify the most suitable production system. Purified recombinant protein was analysed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and deglycosylation assay. A pregnant sow was intramuscularly immunized three times with adjuvanted recombinant protein prior to farrowing. PEDV-specific immune responses in sera and colostrum of the sow and piglets were assayed by ELISA and virus neutralization assays. Piglets were challenged orally with PEDV, and clinical parameters were monitored for 6 days post-challenge. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of three eukaryotic expression systems tested (yeast, insect-cell, and mammalian), expression by HEK-293 T cells gave the highest yield of protein that was N-glycosylated and was the most appropriate candidate for vaccination. Administration of the subunit vaccine in a sow resulted in induction of S1-specific IgG and IgA that were passively transferred to the suckling piglets. Also, high virus neutralization titres were observed in the serum of the vaccinated sow and its piglets. After PEDV challenge, piglets born to the vaccinated sow exhibited less severe signs of disease and significantly lower mortality compared to the piglets of a control sow. However, there were no significant differences in diarrhea, body weight and virus shedding. Thus, vaccination with S1 subunit vaccine failed to provide complete protection to suckling piglets after challenge exposure, and further improvements are needed for the development of a subunit vaccine that fully protects against PEDV infection.","output":"S1 domain of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein as a vaccine antigen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, is a new corona virus of the Beta Coronavirus genus which originated in bats. The virus first emerged in China in December 2019 and has rapidly spread since to other areas worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore recently declared it as the source of a pandemic. The disease caused by the virus manifests in most cases as a lower respiratory tract infection leading to fever, cough and dyspnea, while more severe cases can led to respiratory failure and/or multi organ failure. COVID-19 enters the human cell using the ACE2, an enzyme abundant in renal tubular epithelial cells. Theoretically, this may be significant in several ways: acute kidney injury (AKI) as well as proteinuria and/or microhematuria could be associated with the penetration of COVID-19 into the cells. Moreover, medications based on RAAS inhibition, such and ACE inhibitors and ARBs, upregulate the enzyme ACE2 and could therefore hypothetically explain the high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes reported as previous diagnoses in severe cases. In the setting of chronic kidney disease, the risk of infection with COVID-19 is not clear at this time. However, hemodialysis patients represent a unique group of patients, mostly elderly and immunocompromised, for whom dialysis is a life-saving treatment which cannot be stopped.

OBJECTIVES: This research determined the intra- and interrater reliability of measuring knee and wrist range of motion (ROM) assessed virtually and obtained face-to-face (F2F) using a goniometer (UG) for a student and an experienced examiner. METHOD: Knee and wrist joint ROM for 54 healthy participants was assessed virtually and F2F by a student examiner and an experienced physical therapist. Intra- (virtual vs. UG assessment) and inter-rater (virtual or UG assessment between examiners) reliabilities were examined for all ROM using Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC values were considered good (>0.75) or excellent (>0.90). Bland and Altman plots determined the limits of agreement (LOA) in assessing joint ROM. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Student examiner had good reliability in virtually estimating knee extension (ICC = 0.79), wrist flexion (ICC = 0.82) and wrist extension (ICC = 0.78), whereas the experienced examiner had excellent reliability in virtually estimating all knee and wrist ROM (ICC > 0.90).

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure the frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among hospitalized children with cancer and to detect the associated clinical manifestations and outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A prospective noninterventional study including all hospitalized children with cancer conducted between mid-April and mid-June 2020 in Ain Shams University Hospital, Egypt. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests in nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Fifteen of 61 hospitalized children with cancer were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Their mean age was 8.33.5 years. Initially, 10 (66.7%) were asymptomatic and 5 (33.3%) were symptomatic with fever and/or cough. Baseline laboratory tests other than SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were not diagnostic; the mean absolute lymphocyte count was 8.72.410/L. C-reactive protein was mildly elevated in most of the patients. Imaging was performed in 10 (66.7%) patients with significant radiologic findings detected in 4 (40%) patients. Treatment was mainly supportive with antibiotics as per the febrile neutropenia protocol and local Children Hospital guidance for management of COVID-19 in children.

Moreover, all SARS CoV-2 types of vaccines, depending on the spike protein immunogenicity, especially the conventional inactivated ones might increase the likelihood of COVID-19 severity upon re-infection through antibody dependent enhancement which might reason for the recently described abundance of hospital admissions within seven days of vaccination and might also reason for some of the serious adverse effects encountered with administration of convalescent plasma to COVID-19 patients as well as they might share in development of some lethal SARS CoV-2 variants. Importantly, we suggest that SARS CoV-2 mass vaccination campaigns were the worst ever decision made and that making these COVID-19 vaccines compulsory or administering them to children or pregnant participants might be considered as a crime against humanity to the extent that no prior companies- governmental agreements would ever secure impunity.

Several studies have investigated factors that contribute to inequalities in access to PRT; distance to a radiotherapy centre has been identified as one potential barrier. AIM To assess whether there is an association between distance to a radiotherapy centre and utilisation rates of PRT in adults with cancer. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020190772). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and APA-PsycINFO were searched for relevant papers up to 28 February 2021. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included. Twelve studies focused on whether patients with incurable cancer received PRT, as part of their treatment package. Pooled results reported that living 50 km vs <50 km from the radiotherapy centre was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving PRT (OR 0.84 (95%CI 0.80, 0.88)). Nine focused on distance from the radiotherapy centre and compared single-fraction (SF) versus multiple-fraction PRT, indicating that patients living further away were more likely to receive SF. Pooled results comparing 50 km versus <50 km showed increased odds of receiving SF for those living 50 km (OR 1.48 (95%CI 1.26,1.75)). CONCLUSION Patients living further away from radiotherapy centres were less likely to receive PRT and those who received PRT were more likely to receive SF PRT, providing some evidence of inequalities in access to PRT treatment based on proximity to centres providing radiotherapy. Further research is needed to understand whether these inequalities are influenced by clinical referral patterns or by patients unwilling or unable to travel longer distances.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the disease and analyzing potential biomarkers of AMI is crucial. However, specific diagnostic biomarkers have thus far not been fully established and candidate regulatory targets for AMI remain to be determined. In the present study, the AMI gene chip dataset GSE48060 comprising blood samples from control subjects with normal cardiac function (n=21) and patients with AMI (n=26) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the AMI and control groups were identified with the online tool GEO2R. The co-expression network of DEGs was analyzed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient of all gene pairs, mutual rank screening and cutoff threshold screening. Subsequently, the Gene Ontology (GO) database was used to analyze the genes' functions and pathway enrichment of genes in the most important modules was performed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Disease and BioCyc were used to analyze the hub genes in the module to determine important sub-pathways. In addition, the expression of hub genes was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR in AMI and control specimens. In the present study, 52 DEGs, including 26 upregulated and 26 downregulated genes, were identified. As key hub genes, three upregulated genes (AKR1C3, RPS24 and P2RY12) and three downregulated genes (ACSL1, B3GNT5 and MGAM) were identified from the co-expression network. Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis of all AMI co-expression network genes revealed functional enrichment mainly in RAGE receptor binding and negative regulation of T cell cytokine production. In addition, KEGG Disease and BioCyc analysis indicated functional enrichment of the genes RPS24 and P2RY12 in cardiovascular diseases, of AKR1C3 in cardenolide biosynthesis, of MGAM in glycogenolysis, of B3GNT5 in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and of ACSL1 in icosapentaenoate biosynthesis II.

Recently, nociplastic pain has been introduced as a descriptor of the mechanism of pain, which is due to the disturbance of neural processing without actual or potential tissue damage, appearing to replace a concept of psychogenic pain. An interdisciplinary task force of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) compiled a systematic classification of clinical conditions associated with chronic pain, which was published in 2018 and will officially come into effect in 2022 in the 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization. ICD-11 offers the option for recording the presence of psychological or social factors in chronic pain; however, cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in the pathogenesis of chronic pain are missing.

Although antibody and glycan-based targeting of receptors on dendritic cells have been employed, these are often expensive and time-consuming to manufacture or lack sufficient specificity. Thus, we applied a small-molecule ligand that specifically binds Langerin, a hallmark receptor on Langerhans cells, conjugated to a model protein antigen. Via microneedle injection, this construct was intradermally administered into intact human skin explants, selectively loading Langerhans cells in the epidermis. The ligand-mediated cellular uptake outpaces protein degradation resulting in intact antigen delivery.

Involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system is noted in more than one-third of patients with antecedent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, while an approximately threefold higher incidence of neurological symptoms is recorded in observational studies including patient-reported data. The most frequent neurological manifestations of long-COVID encompass fatigue; brain fog; headache; cognitive impairment; sleep, mood, smell, or taste disorders; myalgias; sensorimotor deficits; and dysautonomia.

By adding adversarial noises to training samples, adversarial training can improve the model's robustness against adversarial noises. However, adversarial training samples with excessive noises can harm standard accuracy, which may be unacceptable for many medical image analysis applications. This issue has been termed the trade-off between standard accuracy and adversarial robustness. In this paper, we hypothesize that this issue may be alleviated if the adversarial samples for training are placed right on the decision boundaries. Based on this hypothesis, we design an adaptive adversarial training method, named IMA. For each individual training sample, IMA makes a sample-wise estimation of the upper bound of the adversarial perturbation. In the training process, each of the sample-wise adversarial perturbations is gradually increased to match the margin. Once an equilibrium state is reached, the adversarial perturbations will stop increasing. IMA is evaluated on publicly available datasets under two popular adversarial attacks, PGD and IFGSM. The results show that: (1) IMA significantly improves adversarial robustness of DNN classifiers, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance; (2) IMA has a minimal reduction in clean accuracy among all competing defense methods; (3) IMA can be applied to pretrained models to reduce time cost; (4) IMA can be applied to the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation networks, with outstanding performance. We hope our work may help to lift the trade-off between adversarial robustness and clean accuracy and facilitate the development of robust applications in the medical field.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the surgical complications before COVID -19 (Pre-COVID) and after COVID -19 (post-COVID) appearance using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). Methods: between January 1, 2019, to November 3, 2021, we performed a comprehensive search in PubMed/Medline and Scopus for studies reporting the postoperative complications based on/transformable to CDC. Result: From 909 screened articles, 34 studies were included for systematic review. Among included articles, 11 were eligible for meta-analysis. Nineteen thousand one hundred thirty-seven patients (pre-COVID: 3522, post-COVID: 15615) were included, mostly undergoing elective surgeries (86.32%). According to CDC classification, there were no significant change between pre-COVID and post-COVID for grade 1 (Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95-CI): 0.99, 0.60-1.63, p=0.96), grade 2 (OR and 95-CI: 0.65, 0.42-1.01, p = 0.055), grade 3 (OR and 95-CI: 0.86, 0.48-1.57, p=0.64), grade 4 (OR and 95-CI: 0.85, 0.46-1.57, p =0.60).

Growing evidence indicates that different types of coronaviruses not only affect the respiratory system, but they might also invade the central nervous system (CNS). However, very little evidence has been so far reported on the presence of COVID-19 in the brain, and the potential exploitation, by this virus, of the lung to brain axis to reach neurons has not been completely understood. In this Article, we assessed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein sequence, structure, and electrostatic potential using computational approaches. Our results showed that the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are highly similar, sharing a sequence identity of 77%. In addition, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is slightly more positively charged than that of SARS-CoV since it contains four more positively charged residues and five less negatively charged residues which may lead to an increased affinity to bind to negatively charged regions of other molecules through nonspecific and specific interactions. Analysis the S protein binding to the host ACE2 receptor showed a 30% higher binding energy for SARS-CoV-2 than for the SARS-CoV S protein.

Our objective was to investigate the incidence, time course, laboratory features, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had undergone ultrasound imaging for suspected VTE from March 13 to May 18, 2020. The medical records of the included patients were reviewed for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-sensitivity troponin T at admission and at up to seven time points before and after ultrasound examination. The clinical outcomes included superficial venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, intubation, and death. Mixed effects logistic, linear, and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate the relationships between the laboratory markers and VTE and other in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Of 138 patients who had undergone imaging studies, 44 (31.9%) had evidence of VTE. On univariable analysis, an elevated admission CRP (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09; P = .02; per 10-U increase in CRP), platelet count (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-2.12; P = .03; per 1000-U increase in platelet count), and male sex (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.19-5.84; P = .02), were associated with VTE. However only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.01-5.56; P = .048). The independent predictors of death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07; P = .04), active malignancy (HR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.39-13.91; P = .01), elevated admission D-dimer (HR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.003-1.029; P = .02), and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.81; 95% CI, 1.76-13.10; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Male sex, elevated CRP, and elevated platelet count at admission were associated with VTE on univariable analysis. However, only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19Crelated GT data, particularly those related to ageusia and anosmia, were primarily related to media coverage or to epidemic trends. METHODS: We retrieved GT query data for searches on coronavirus, cough, anosmia, and ageusia and plotted them over a period of 5 years. In addition, we analyzed the trends of those queries for 17 countries throughout the year 2020 with a particular focus on the rises and peaks of the searches. For anosmia and ageusia, we assessed whether the respective GT data correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths both throughout 2020 and specifically before March 16, 2020 (ie, the date when the media started reporting that these symptoms can be associated with COVID-19). RESULTS: Over the last five years, peaks for coronavirus searches in GT were only observed during the winter of 2020. Rises and peaks in coronavirus searches appeared at similar times in the 17 different assessed countries irrespective of their epidemic situations. In 15 of these countries, rises in anosmia and ageusia searches occurred in the same week or 1 week after they were identified in the media as symptoms of COVID-19. When data prior to March 16, 2020 were analyzed, anosmia and ageusia GT data were found to have variable correlations with COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different countries.

Although this claim is supported by several keystone studies, no thorough assessment on the frequency of introgression in nature has been performed to date. In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by providing a meta-analysis of the most comprehensive survey of introgression studies in Eukaryotes to date (724 papers with claims of introgression). We first examined the evidence given to support introgression, and if/how the lines of evidence have changed across time. We then collated a single statistic, Pattersons D, that quantifies the strength of introgression across 123 studies to further assess how taxonomic group, divergence time, and aspects of life history influence introgression. We find three main results. Studies on introgression are much more frequent in plants and mammals than any other taxonomic group. The study of introgression has shifted from a largely qualitative assessment of whether introgression happens, to a focus on when and how much introgression has occurred across taxa. The most often used introgression statistic, Pattersons D, shows several intriguing patterns suggesting introgression reports may be biased by both differences in reporting criteria and sequencing technology, but may also differ across taxonomic systems and throughout the process of speciation. Together, these results suggest the need for a unified approach to quantifying introgression in natural communities, and highlight important areas of future research that can be better assessed once this unified approach is met.","output":"15 years of introgression studies: quantifying gene flow across Eukaryotes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Surprisingly, 40% to 95% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) show early remission of hyperglycemia after obesity surgery. It is unknown to what extent other diabetes-associated comorbidities such as distal peripheral neuropathy (DPN) might be influenced by obesity surgery. This pilot study aimed at providing further evidence for the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on both glycemic control and DPN in non-severely obese patients with insulin-dependent T2DM. METHODS In the present prospective cohort study, 20 patients with long-standing, insulin-dependent T2DM and a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m underwent laparoscopic RYGB. Body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and DPN [quantified by the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS)] were investigated. RESULTS Six months after surgery, the preoperative BMI of 32.8  2.1 kg/m (mean  standard deviation) dropped to 25.6  2.5 kg/m (P < 0.001). Preoperative HbA1c levels decreased from 8.5  1.2% to 7.1  1.2% (P < 0.001), with 15% of patients having a normalized HbA1c level lower than 6.2%. Of 12 patients with documented DPN, the median NSS was 8 (range, 0-10) preoperatively and 0 (range, 0-9) postoperatively (P = 0.004), with 8 patients scoring an NSS of 0. The median NDS was 6 (range, 2-8) preoperatively and 4 (range, 0-8) postoperatively (P = 0.027), with 1 patient scoring an NDS of 0. All patients had an improvement or normalization in either 1 or both scores. CONCLUSIONS As expected, BMI and HbA1c levels improved significantly after RYGB. More interestingly, neuropathy scores, such as NSS and NDS, improved significantly early after surgery. Symptomatic neuropathy was completely reversible in 67% of the patients. These findings add further evidence to the fact that RYGB might be a valuable treatment option not only for improving glycemic control but also for reducing diabetes-associated comorbidities, such as DPN. This points to a complex metabolic effect of RYGB that exceeds glucose normalization.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex lung disease, characterized by progressive lung scarring. Severe COVID-19 is associated with substantial pneumonitis and has a number of shared major risk factors with IPF. This study aimed to determine the genetic correlation between IPF and severe COVID-19 and assess a potential causal role of genetically increased risk of IPF on COVID-19 severity. Methods. We performed a Mendelian randomisation (MR) study for IPF causality in COVID-19. Genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility (P<5x10-8) in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used as instrumental variables (IVs). Effect estimates of those IVs on COVID-19 severity were gathered from the GWAS meta-analysis by the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. The genetic correlation between IPF and COVID-19 severity was estimated with linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. Findings. We detected a positive genetic correlation of IPF with COVID-19 severity (rg=0.31 [95% CI 0.04-0.57], P = 0.023). The MR estimates for severe COVID-19 did not reveal any genetic association (OR 1.05, [95% CI 0.92-1.20], P = 0.43). However, outlier analysis revealed that the IPF risk allele rs35705950 at MUC5B had a different effect compared with the other variants. When rs35705950 was excluded, MR results provided evidence that genetically increased risk of IPF has a causal effect on COVID-19 severity (OR 1.21, [95% CI 1.06-1.38], P = 4.24x10-3). Furthermore, the IPF risk-allele at MUC5B showed an apparent protective effect against COVID-19 hospitalization only in older adults (OR 0.86, [95% CI 0.73-1.00], P = 2.99x10-2) . Interpretation. The strongest genetic determinant of IPF, rs35705950 at MUC5B, seems to confer protection against COVID-19, whereas the combined effect of all other IPF risk loci seem to confer risk of COVID-19 severity. The observed effect of rs35705950 could either be due to protective effects of mucin over-production on the airways or a consequence of selection bias due to a patient group that is heavily enriched for the rs35705950 T undertaking strict self-isolation. Due to the diverse impact of IPF causal variants on SARS-CoV-2 infection, further investigation is needed to address this apparent paradox between variance at MUC5B and other IPF genetic risk factors.","output":"Shared genetic etiology between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Only from the primary structures of peptides, a new set of descriptors called the molecular electronegativity edge-distance vector (VMED) was proposed and applied to describing and characterizing the molecular structures of oligopeptides and polypeptides, based on the electronegativity of each atom or electronic charge index (ECI) of atomic clusters and the bonding distance between atom-pairs. Here, the molecular structures of antigenic polypeptides were well expressed in order to propose the automated technique for the computerized identification of helper T lymphocyte (Th) epitopes. Furthermore, a modified MED vector was proposed from the primary structures of polypeptides, based on the ECI and the relative bonding distance of the fundamental skeleton groups. The side-chains of each amino acid were here treated as a pseudo-atom. The developed VMED was easy to calculate and able to work. Some quantitative model was established for 28 immunogenic or antigenic polypeptides (AGPP) with 14 (1C14) A(d) and 14 other restricted activities assigned as 1(+) and 0(?), respectively. The latter comprised 6 A(b)(15C20), 3 A(k)(21C23), 2 E(k)(24C26), 2 H-2(k)(27 and 28) restricted sequences. Good results were obtained with 90% correct classification (only 2 wrong ones for 20 training samples) and 100% correct prediction (none wrong for 8 testing samples); while contrastively 100% correct classification (none wrong for 20 training samples) and 88% correct classification (1 wrong for 8 testing samples). Both stochastic samplings and cross validations were performed to demonstrate good performance. The described method may also be suitable for estimation and prediction of classes I and II for major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) epitope of human. It will be useful in immune identification and recognition of proteins and genes and in the design and development of subunit vaccines. Several quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed for various oligopeptides and polypeptides including 58 dipeptides and 31 pentapeptides with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by multiple linear regression (MLR) method. In order to explain the ability to characterize molecular structure of polypeptides, a molecular modeling investigation on QSAR was performed for functional prediction of polypeptide sequences with antigenic activity and heptapeptide sequences with tachykinin activity through quantitative sequence-activity models (QSAMs) by the molecular electronegativity edge-distance vector (VMED). The results showed that VMED exhibited both excellent structural selectivity and good activity prediction. Moreover, the results showed that VMED behaved quite well for both QSAR and QSAM of poly-and oligopeptides, which exhibited both good estimation ability and prediction power, equal to or better than those reported in the previous references. Finally, a preliminary conclusion was drwan: both classical and modified MED vectors were very useful structural descriptors.

However, these systems reacted differently to lockdown and a decline in business activity, which was associated with both their structures and the specifics of their development. Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to assess the impact of the 2020 pandemic on tax revenues of Russian regions, as well as to analyze the factors contributing to the resilience of regional tax systems to epidemiological crises. Methods: The study is based on monthly data from the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation on total tax revenues in 83 Russian regions for 2013-2020. For data up to March 2020, we construct stationary time series and plotted ARiMA regressions. Based on them, we forecast tax revenues for the period from April to December 2020, if there were no pandemic. The impact of the pandemic is calculated as the deviation of actual tax revenue from the forecast for the corresponding 9 months. Findings & value added: We find that the impact of the pandemic on tax revenues varies over time and space. The crisis hit the fiscal system most negatively in the first three full months of the lockdown (April-June 2020). Some mining regions of the Urals, Western and Eastern Siberia, specializing in the extraction of oil and gas, as well as non-ferrous metals, turned out to be the most vulnerable to the pandemic. The most resistant to it are the central and southern regions of the European part of Russia. Calculation of Pearson's correlations shows that the greatest drop in tax revenues occur in regions with a larger share of the mining industry in gross value added and MET in tax revenues, with a higher GRP per capita and an increased level of general economic instability. The smallest decline in tax revenue, or even its growth, is observed in regions with a larger share of personal income tax and property tax in tax revenues, a higher share of trade and processing industries, social sphere and public administration in gross value added, a higher degree of economic diversification and a larger share of small business in total turnover.

From the hospital information system, which is used in everyday clinical work, laboratory parameters at admission were verified, along with demographic data, the comorbidities, while the outcome (recovery, death) was recorded thirty days after the admission. Results: Out of the total number, in 314 patients (200 males), arterial hypertension was verified, out of which, 56 (17.83%) patients died. Patients were divided into two groups, according to outcome, i.e., whether they survived COVID-19 infection or not.

When patients who died and had hypertension were compared with those who died and did not have hypertension (n = 15), out of alll the analyzed parameters, the only significant difference was established in the patient's age (p = 0.00). In case when patients with hypertension who died were compared to patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus who died no significant differences were found between features. Conclusion: Patients with hypertension and COVID-19 who died were older, had higher values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, neutrophils, CRP and D-dimer, and lower values of platelets, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils count at admission. Compared to deaths without hypertension, the only difference that was established was that patients with hypertension were older. ? 2022 Faris Kadic, Edin Begic, Mirza Pasic, Ali Gavrankapetanovic,Aida Mujakovic, Aida Pidro, Ada Djozic","output":"Arterial Hypertension in Patients with COVID-19 - Neural Network Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Child maltreatment is a public health problem of considerable magnitude.

To assess contributions of these non-elastic changes, we compare behaviour of delta values in human kinetochores with small yet mechanically malleable kinetochores against compound kinetochores in Indian muntjac (IM) cells whose architecture remains constant. Due to the micrometre-scale length of kinetochore plates in IM, their shape and orientation are discernible in conventional light microscopy, which enables precise measurements of IKT independent of contributions from changes in overall architecture of the organelle. We find that delta in IM kinetochores remains relatively constant when microtubule-mediated forces are suppressed by Taxol, but it prominently decreases upon detachment of microtubules. By contrast, large decreases of delta observed in Taxol-treated human cells coincide with prominent changes in length and curvature of the kinetochore plate. These observations, supported by computational modelling, suggest that at least 50% of the decrease in delta in human cells reflects malleable reorganization of kinetochore architecture rather than elastic recoil due to IKT.","output":"Effects of malleable kinetochore morphology on measurements of intrakinetochore tension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the coronavirus pandemic continues apace in the United States, the dizzying amount of data being generated, analyzed and consumed about the virus has led to calls to proclaim this the first data-driven pandemic But at the same time, it seems that this plethora of data has not meant a better grasp on the reality of the pandemic and its effects Even as we have the potential to digitally track and trace nearly every single individual who has contracted the virus, we have no idea exactly how many people have had the virus, been hospitalized, or died because of it, largely due to a confluence of factors, particularly active obfuscation and mismanagement by public authorities and misinformation spread through social media and right-wing media channels But beyond these dynamics, there also lies the less nefarious ways that the everyday, subjective practices of data collection, analysis and visualization have the potential to themselves (re)produce these very same dynamics where data is at once valorized and ignored, preeminent and completely useless That is, the pandemic has revealed only the general inadequacy of our data infrastructures and assemblages to solving pressing social issues, but also the more general shift towards a post-truth disposition in contemporary social life But, as this paper argues, it would be a mistake to see the centrality of data as being somehow the opposite from the larger post-truth apparatus, as the two are instead fundamentally intertwined and co-produced ?

In addition, COVID-19 is likely to have a long-term effect on risk evaluation in the Indo-Pacific states. Therefore, it is vital to oversee and execute remedial activities quickly and successfully, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a national defense and military budget planning strategy. It applies a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory linguistic data strategy for group decision-making, in order to collect group opinions and analyze the causal relationship of complicated social science issues in indistinct situations. These concepts are divided into causal and impact groups, to provide an improved understanding of the relationship among them, as well as making recommendations to improve their general execution. This paper employed the fuzzy DEMATEL method to analyze the model and considered suggestions as the key influencing factors in budget planning strategy. Through this well-constructed fuzzy DEMATEL approach our research results show that a proper operations strategy and management of both resource usage and task arrangement in accordance with policy making will accomplish excellent budget planning strategy results. The results reveal that the Mission Requirement is a major causal factor. The study can provide a successful national defense and military budget strategy assessment with satisfactory criteria that fit the decision-makersrequirements, particularly when the assessment criteria are various and entwined. We offer recommendations for government authorities to plan national defense and military budget planning strategies.

Since then, the situation has worsened with more than 672, 000 confirmed cases and at least 36, 000 reported deaths by June 2020. Accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 is extremely important to offer adequate treatment, and avoid overloading the healthcare system. Characteristics of patients such as age, comorbidities and varied clinical symptoms can help in classifying the level of infection severity, predict the disease outcome and the need for hospitalization. Here, we present a study to predict a poor prognosis in positive COVID-19 patients and possible outcomes using machine learning. The study dataset comprises information of 8, 443 patients concerning closed cases due to cure or death. Our experimental results show the disease outcome can be predicted with a Receiver Operating Characteristic AUC of 0.92, Sensitivity of 0.88 and Specificity of 0.82 for the best prediction model. This is a preliminary retrospective study which can be improved with the inclusion of further data. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques fed with demographic and clinical data along with comorbidities of the patients can assist in the prognostic prediction and physician decision-making, allowing a faster response and contributing to the non-overload of healthcare systems.","output":"Predicting the Disease Outcome in COVID-19 Positive Patients Through Machine Learning: A Retrospective Cohort Study With Brazilian Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 has devastated the world with its rapid spread and fatality. The researchers across the globe are struggling hard to search a drug to treat this infection. Understanding the time constraint, the best approach is to study clinically approved drugs for control of this deadly pandemic of COVID 19. The repurposing of such drugs can be supported with the study of molecular interactions to enhance the possibility of application. The present work is a molecular docking study of proteins responsible for viral propagation namely 3Clpro, Nsp10/16, Spike protein, SARS protein receptor binding domain, Nsp 9 viral single strand binding protein and viral helicase. The protein through virus enters the host cell-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, is also used as a target for molecular docking. The docking was done with most discussed drugs for SARS-CoV-2 like Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), routine antiviral drugs like Oseltamivir and Ribavirin. In addition, small molecules with anti-inflammatory actions like Mycophenolic acid (MPA), Pemirolast, Isoniazid and Eriodictyol were also tested. The generated data confirms the potential of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Remdesivir as a therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV-2. It is observed that Eriodictyol binds to almost all selected target proteins with good binding energy, suggesting its importance in treatment of COVID 19. Molecular interactions of Ritonavir, Lopinavir and Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 proteins enhanced their potential as a candidate drug for treatment of COVID-19.

The use of music in mindfulness is apparent in several traditional and Western practices but has little research regarding its effect in novice practitioners. In an online course-based research experience, a group of student researchers, a graduate research assistant and two faculty members recruited 54 healthy participants within their social networks, to investigate the effect of a music stimulus on one mindfulness exercise and the feasibility of implementing this intervention in virtual sessions. Participants attended two virtual group sessions where student researchers and a faculty member/research assistant provided online questionnaires and links to a 20-minute meditation recording, either with or without music, as the two conditions. Potential moderators of the intervention included stress in the previous month and absorption in music. A repeated-measures ANCOVA indicated no significant differences among conditions, and no interaction with stress or absorption in music. Although contrary to our expectations, the lack of significant differences between conditions indicate that music did not distract from a mindfulness meditation, and that the music and guided mindfulness stimulus was as efficacious as the guided mindfulness alone. Given the potential for music to become a distractor for novice practitioners, this finding is important and in line with our theoretical framework.

The enhancement of seed mineral content via genetic improvement is considered as the most promising and cost-effective approach compared alternative means for meeting the dietary needs. The overall objective of this study was to perform a GWAS of mineral content (Ca, K, P and S) in seeds of a core set of 137 soybean lines that are representative of the diversity of early maturing soybeans cultivated in Canada (maturity groups 000-II). RESULTS: This panel of 137 soybean lines was grown in five environments (in total) and the seed mineral content was measured using a portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. The association analyses were carried out using three statistical models and a set of 2.2 million SNPs obtained from a combined dataset of genotyping-by-sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Eight QTLs significantly associated with the Ca, K, P and S content were identified by at least two of the three statistical models used (in two environments) contributing each from 17 to 31% of the phenotypic variation. A strong reproducibility of the effect of seven out these eight QTLs was observed in three other environments. In total, three candidate genes were identified involved in transport and assimilation of these mineral elements. CONCLUSIONS: There have been very few GWAS studies to identify QTLs associated with the mineral element content of soybean seeds. In addition to being new, the QTLs identified in this study and candidate genes will be useful for the genetic improvement of soybean nutritional quality through marker-assisted selection. Moreover, this study also provides details on the range of phenotypic variation encountered within the Canadian soybean germplasm.","output":"Identification of loci controlling mineral element concentration in soybean seeds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People in receipt of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa often discontinue taking the medication. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with men and women who had started PrEP but did not return to the clinic for a refill after a 1, 2 or 3-month period. These 'discontinuation' clients were enrolled in a PrEP demonstration project for the general population in nurse-led, public-sector, primary-care clinics in Eswatini. Reasons for discontinuation included changes to self-perceived HIV risk such as the end of pregnancy and absent partners. Others described PrEP as inaccessible when working away from home and many described difficulties relating to a daily pill regimen and managing side effects. Female clients described being prohibited from using PrEP by their partners and co-wives. From these results, we recommend that client-centred counselling stresses the prevention-effective adherence paradigm, which promotes PrEP use in risk periods that are identifiable and PrEP discontinuation when the risk period has finished. A national scale up of PrEP may mitigate problems accessing PrEP. Extended counselling and support could assist with adherence and the management of side effects.

However, the relationship between aerosol characteristics and wastewater treatment process remains poorly understood. In this study, aerosols were collected over a 24-month period from a WWTP using a modified anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process. The aerated tank (AerT) was characterized by the highest respiratory fraction (RF) concentrations (861-1525 CFU/m3) and proportions (50.76%-65.96%) of aerosol particles. Fourteen core potential pathogens and 15 toxic metal(loid)s were identified in aerosols. Mycobacterium was the genus that aerosolized most easily in fine grid, pre-anoxic tank, and AerT. High wastewater treatment efficiency may increase the emission of RF and core potential pathogens. The median size of activated sludge, richness of core potential pathogens in wastewater, and total suspended particulates were the most influential factors directly related to the RF proportions, core community of potential pathogens, and composition of toxic metal(loid)s in WWTP aerosols, respectively. Relative humidity, temperature, input and removal of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, and mixed liquor suspended solids could also directly or indirectly affect the aerosol characteristics.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID admitted to an academic medical center from 2017 to 2020 for an invasive injection-related infection. Standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the effects of COVID-19 on participants. RESULTS: Among the 30 PWID interview participants, 14 reported barriers to accessing health and addiction services due to COVID-19. As facilities decreased appointment availability or transitioned to telemedicine, PWID reported being unable to access services. Social distancing led to isolation or loneliness during hospital stays and in the community. Recovery meetings and support groups, critical to addiction recovery, were particularly affected. Other participants reported that uncertainty and fear of contracting the virus generated changes in behavior that led them to avoid seeking services. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has disrupted health systems and social services, leading PWID to experience unprecedented barriers to accessing and maintaining health and addiction services in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

Methods: We evaluated a nationwide administrative database of all hospitalized patients with main diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with/without diagnosis of Covid-19 who were hospitalized during the time period from January 16th to May 15th, 2020. Data from a total of 1463 hospitals in Germany were included. We compared case numbers, treatment characteristics (intravenous thrombolysis, IVT; mechanical thrombectomy, MT; treated on an intensive care unit, stroke unit or regular ward) and in-hospital mortality of AIS with and without concurrent diagnosis of Covid-19. Results: From a total of 30,864 hospitalized Covid-19 patients during the evaluation period in Germany, we identified a subgroup of 213 patients with primary diagnosis of AIS. Compared to the 68,700 AIS patients without Covid-19, this subgroup showed a similar rate of IVT (16.4% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.985) but a significantly lower rate of MT (3.8% vs. 7.9%, p = 0.017). In-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with AIS and concurrent Covid-19 compared to non-infected AIS patients (22.5% vs. 7.8%, p < 0.001).

Propofol infusion was started at 2000 mg/h until loss of consciousness and then guided by target BIS values (40-60). Measurements of propofol plasma concentration were performed using gas chromatography. A PKPD model was developed using NONMEM. The data set contained 423 propofol concentrations and 483 897 BIS values from 60 patients (20-92 years, 42-136 kg). A 3-compartment model was used to describe the plasma concentrations of propofol. An allometric model using lean body weight calculated by the Janmahasatian formula was found to describe the data better than total body weight for all clearance parameters, V1 and V2. An age effect was found on Q2, Q3, V1, and V3. With respect to the PD model, the use of a 2-compartment model significantly improved the model fit.

Over the past 2.8 million years, humans and tools have co-evolved. However, in the last century, technology is introduced at a rate that exceeds human evolution. The proliferation of computers and, more recently, robots, introduces new cognitive demands, as the human is required to be a monitor rather than a direct controller. The usage of robots and artificial intelligence is only expected to increase, and the present COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be catalytic in this regard. One way to improve overall system performance is to 'adapt the human to the machine' via task procedures, operator training, operator selection, a Procrustean mandate. Using classic research examples, we demonstrate that Procrustean methods can improve performance only to a limited extent. For a viable future, therefore, technology must adapt to the human, which underwrites the necessity of human factors science.

DESIGN: Quantitative design using a cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Online survey in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: UK adults (18+ years) were eligible to participate. A total of 9110 people participated. Of these, 4377 (48%) reported at least one existing health condition, 874 (10%) reported having two or more existing conditions, and 715 (8%) reported having an existing mental health condition. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariable linear regression and sequential multiple mediation analysis were used to estimate differences in average scores for active and avoidant coping response scores due to pre-existing health conditions, and to investigate the extent to which these differences are explained by differences in perceptions, beliefs, concerns and mood. RESULTS: People with pre-existing physical (+1.11 higher; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34) and especially mental health conditions (3.06 higher; 95% CI 2.65 to 3.48) reported poorer health and used more avoidant coping compared with healthy participants. Under some strong untestable assumptions, we estimate that experiencing low mood or concern related to SARS-CoV-2 mostly explained the relationship between existing health conditions and avoidant coping.

Profound interactions between ENPs and biomolecules such as proteins are inevitable to occur when ENPs are administered or exposed to biological systems, for example, through intravenous injection, oral, or respiration. As a key component of these interactions, protein corona (PC) is immediately formed surrounding the outlayer of ENPs. PC formation is crucial because it gives ENPs a new biological identity by altering not only the physiochemical properties, but also the biobehaviors of ENPs. In the past two decades, most investigations about PC formation were carried out with in vitro systems which could not represent the true events occurring within in vivo systems. Most recently, studies of in vivo PC formation were reported, and it was found that the protein compositions and structures were very different from those formed in vitro. Herein, we provide an in-time review of the recent investigations of this in vivo PC formation of ENPs. In this review, commonly used characterization methods and compositions of in vivo PC are summarized firstly. Next, we highlight the impacts of the in vivo PC formation on absorption, blood circulation, biodistribution, metabolism, and toxicity of administered ENPs. We also introduce the applications of modulating in vivo PC formation in nanomedicine. We further discuss the challenges and future perspectives.","output":"In vivo Protein Corona Formation: Characterizations, Effects on Engineered Nanoparticles Biobehaviors, and Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the performance and interobservers agreement of cases with findings on chest CT based on the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guideline statement of COVID-19 and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) expert consensus statement. METHODS: In this study, 903 patients who had admitted to the emergency department with a pre-diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 and 18 July 2020 and had chest CT. Two radiologists classified the chest CT findings according to the RSNA and BSTI consensus statements. The performance, sensitivity and specificity values of the two classification systems were calculated and the agreement between the observers was compared by using kappa analysis. RESULTS: Considering RT-PCR test result as a gold standard, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values were significantly higher for the two observers according to the BSTI guidance statement and the RSNA expert consensus statement (83.3%, 89.7%, 89.0%; % 81.2,% 89.7,% 88.7, respectively). There was a good agreement in the PCR positive group (: 0.707; p < 0.001 for BSTI and : 0.716; p < 0.001 for RSNA), a good agreement in the PCR negative group (: 0.645; p < 0.001 for BSTI and : 0.743; p < 0.001 for RSNA) according to the BSTI and RSNA classification between the two radiologists. CONCLUSION: As a result, RSNA and BSTI statement provided reasonable performance and interobservers agreement in reporting CT findings of COVID-19. However, the number of patients defined as false negative and indeterminate in both classification systems is at a level that cannot be neglected.

Covid\\\\19 related restrictions introduced challenges to gross anatomy education due to the discipline's reliance on lab\\\\based learning and assessment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess changes made by anatomy educators to gross anatomy lab assessments during May\\\\August 2020. MATERIALS & METHODS: A 20\\\\item survey assessed gross anatomy pedagogy, teaching resources, and assessment before and during the pandemic. The survey was distributed online to anatomy educators through professional associations and listservs in June 2020. Data were obtained from two survey items that asked respondents for narrative descriptions of their lab\\\\based assessment before and during Covid\\\\19. Open coding was used to apply descriptive codes relating to 3 categories: (1) setting of the assessment, (2) format of the assessment, and (3) materials used for the questions. The last author coded the data, while the first author reviewed the coding. Both authors reconciled and re\\\\coded discrepancies. Code frequencies and percentages were calculated. Chi\\\\square or Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences in frequencies before and during Covid\\\\19. Alpha<5%. RESULTS: Of the 61 respondents who described lab assessment, the use of the physical lab setting decreased (before: 82%, during: 20%; P<0.001) while computer\\\\based platforms increased (before: 9%, during: 61%; P<0.001). The use of medical imaging and other anatomical images were maintained (before: 11%, during: 51%; P=0.37), but there were decreases in the use of cadavers (before: 63%, during: 14%; P<0.001) as well as bones, plastic models, and plastinates (before: 12%, during: 0%; P<0.001). There were no significant changes in assessment structure, with the majority of participants maintaining a practical examination (i.e. bell ringer) format during Covid\\\\19 (before: 66%, during: 62%; P=0.39). CONCLUSION: Anatomy educators continued the use of bell ringer style lab assessments during the early part of the Covid\\\\19 pandemic. The setting shifted towards computer\\\\based examinations due to Covid\\\\19 restrictions; thus, the use of digital images was maintained while cadaver use decreased.

This study was done to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations correlated with the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: In this prospective cohort study serial monthly concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured over the fall and winter 2009C2010 in 198 healthy adults, blinded to the nature of the substance being measured. The participants were evaluated for the development of any acute respiratory tract infections by investigators blinded to the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The incidence of infection in participants with different concentrations of vitamin D was determined. One hundred ninety-five (98.5%) of the enrolled participants completed the study. Light skin pigmentation, lean body mass, and supplementation with vitamin D were found to correlate with higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Concentrations of 38 ng/ml or more were associated with a significant (p<0.0001) two-fold reduction in the risk of developing acute respiratory tract infections and with a marked reduction in the percentages of days ill. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Maintenance of a 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration of 38 ng/ml or higher should significantly reduce the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections and the burden of illness caused thereby, at least during the fall and winter in temperate zones. The findings of the present study provide direction for and call for future interventional studies examining the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence and severity of specific viral infections, including influenza, in the general population and in subpopulations with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, such as pregnant women, dark skinned individuals, and the obese.","output":"Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and the Incidence of Acute Viral Respiratory Tract Infections in Healthy Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globalization has brought not only advantages but also risks into the supply chains.

Some theories posit that humans learn these statistics by forming cognitive maps, or underlying representations of the latent space which links items in the sequence. Here, an item in the sequence is a node, and the probability of transitioning between two items is an edge. Sequences can then be generated from walks through the latent space, with different spaces giving rise to different sequence statistics. Individual or group differences in sequence learning can be modeled by changing the time scale over which estimates of transition probabilities are built, or in other words, by changing the amount of temporal discounting. Latent space models with temporal discounting bear a resemblance to models of navigation through Euclidean spaces. However, few explicit links have been made between predictions from Euclidean spatial navigation and neural activity during human sequence learning. Here, we use a combination of behavioral modeling and intracranial encephalography (iEEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity might support the formation of space-like cognitive maps through temporal discounting during sequence learning. Specifically, we acquire human reaction times from a sequential reaction time task, to which we fit a model that formulates the amount of temporal discounting as a single free parameter. From the parameter, we calculate each individuals estimate of the latent space. We find that neural activity reflects these estimates mostly in the temporal lobe, including areas involved in spatial navigation. Similar to spatial navigation, we find that low dimensional representations of neural activity allow for easy separation of important features, such as modules, in the latent space. Lastly, we take advantage of the high temporal resolution of iEEG data to determine the time scale on which latent spaces are learned. We find that learning typically happens within the first 500 trials, and is modulated by the underlying latent space and the amount of temporal discounting characteristic of each participant. Ultimately, this work provides important links between behavioral models of sequence learning and neural activity during the same behavior, and contextualizes these results within a broader framework of domain general cognitive maps.","output":"Neurophysiological evidence for cognitive map formation during sequence learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Null.","output":"New Insight for Kidney Biopsy Series in Cases with COVID-19-related Acute Kidney Injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Agitation associated with schizophrenia remains an important clinical concern and if not managed effectively, can escalate into aggressive behavior. This is a review of the recent biomedical literature on agitation in individuals with schizophrenia. RECENT FINDINGS Themes in the recent literature include consideration of comorbidities such as cigarette smoking and cannabis use. Surveys reveal that pharmacological approaches to manage agitation have changed little, with haloperidol remaining in common use and intramuscular administration of antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines being frequently administered to more severely agitated/aggressive individuals. Of note, ketamine has been recently adopted for use in severe agitation in medical emergency departments, but the risk of this medication for people with schizophrenia is unclear. At present, inhaled loxapine remains the only rapidly acting noninjectable FDA-approved treatment for agitation associated with schizophrenia. In development is an intranasal formulation for olanzapine (a well characterized atypical antipsychotic already approved to treat agitation) and a sublingual film for dexmedetomidine (an 2-adrenergic agonist used as an anesthetic and now being repurposed).

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a chronic inflammatory disease accompanied by eosinophil and neutrophil infiltration. The role of necroptosis in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP remains elusive. METHODS: Cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis in control sinonasal mucosa and CRSwNP, were analyzed by immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for cleaved caspase 3, cleaved gasdermin D and p-MLKL, respectively. Correlations between necroptosis, inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration were assessed and a possible role of necroptosis in CRSwNP was evaluated. Primary nasal polyp cells (DNPCs) were stimulated with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) including ATP or IL-1 and their expression of inflammatory cytokines was analyzed using RT-PCR. The expression of TNF- and IFNs in nasal polyps was measured by ELISA; human monocyte THP-1 cells were treated with TNF- or IFN- and cell death was measured by LDH release. RESULTS: Necroptosis, rather than apoptosis or pyroptosis, was overtly activated in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP as evidenced by the presence of prominent phosphorylation of MLKL compared to controls. The abundance of DAMPs (IL-1, HMGB1), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-1) were all increased especially in non-eosinophilic CRSwNP. The extent of necroptosis was positively correlated with the abundance of DAMPs and cytokines, and neutrophil infiltration in CRSwNP. In DNPCs, ATP and IL-1 induced the expression of IL-8 and CXCL-1. Macrophage was found to be the predominant cell type positive for p-MLKL in CRSwNP. Concomitant treatment with TNF- and IFN-, which were abundantly present in CRSwNP, triggered marked necroptosis in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Necroptosis induced by TNF- and IFN- may facilitate the production and release of a myriad of proinflammatory cytokines and entailed neutrophil infiltration to exacerbate inflammation in CRSwNP.","output":"Necroptosis Underlies Neutrophilic Inflammation Associated with the Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation : Drug-target binding affinity (DTA) reflects the strength of the drug-target interaction;therefore, predicting the DTA can considerably benefit drug discovery by narrowing the search space and pruning drug-target (DT) pairs with low binding affinity scores. Representation learning using deep neural networks has achieved promising performance compared with traditional machine learning methods;hence, extensive research efforts have been made in learning the feature representation of proteins and compounds. However, such feature representation learning relies on a large-scale labelled dataset, which is not always available. Results: We present an end-to-end deep learning framework, ELECTRA-DTA, to predict the binding affinity of drug-target pairs. This framework incorporates an unsupervised learning mechanism to train two ELECTRA-based contextual embedding models, one for protein amino acids and the other for compound SMILES string encoding. In addition, ELECTRA-DTA leverages a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) convolutional neural network block stacked over three fully connected layers to further capture the sequential and spatial features of the protein sequence and SMILES for the DTA regression task. Experimental evaluations show that ELECTRA-DTA outperforms various state-of-the-art DTA prediction models, especially with the challenging, interaction-sparse BindingDB dataset.

However, the conditions faced by specific populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including stigma and discrimination, criminalization, social and economic safety nets and the local epidemiology of HIV and COVID\\\\19, which determine risk of exposure and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, as well as the ability to comply with measures such as physical distancing. This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross\\\\cutting themes in terms of the impacts of COVID\\\\19 on key populations before addressing issues and concerns specific to particular populations. DISCUSSION: Cross\\\\cutting themes include direct impacts such as disrupted access to essential medicines, commodities and services such as anti\\\\retroviral treatment, HIV pre\\\\exposure prophylaxis, opioid agonist treatment, viral load monitoring, HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing, condoms and syringes. Indirect impacts include significant collateral damage arising from prevention measures which restrict human rights, increase or impose criminal penalties, and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized populations. Significant heterogeneity in the COVID\\\\19 pandemic, the underlying HIV epidemic and the ability of key populations to protect themselves means that people who inject drugs and sex workers face particular challenges, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income and sometimes both. Geographical variations mean that transgender people and men who have sex with men in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their vulnerability to adverse outcomes in relation to COVID\\\\19. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of income and livelihoods and changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing have the potential to exacerbate the impacts of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on key populations.

In patient-reported attributes of care provided by a usual physician, the percentages of positive responses for comprehensiveness and coordination were 67.2% and 34.5%, respectively. By institution type, primary care clinics showed the lowest percentage (32.8%) of positive responses for coordination. Adjusted odds ratios of having a usual physician were 3.77 (95% confidence interval, CI: 3.75C3.79) for those aged 65 years or older (vs. aged 18C34 years), 1.31 (CI: 1.30C1.31) for females (vs. males), 0.72 (CI: 0.72C0.73) for unmarried people (vs. married), 1.16 (CI: 1.16C1.16) for college graduates or higher (vs. elementary school graduate or less), 0.64 for the fifth quintile (vs. the first quintile) by household income, 1.53 (CI: 1.52C1.54) for Medical Aid (vs. employee health insurance) for type of health insurance, and 4.09 (CI: 4.08C4.10) for presence (vs. absence) of a chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of Korean adults who have a USC is extremely low, the most influential factor of having a USC is having a chronic disease or not, and Korean patients experience much poorer health care coordination than do patients in other industrialized countries. The findings of this study will give insight to researchers and policy makers regarding the potential facilitators of and barriers to promoting having a USC in the general Korean public.","output":"Having a usual source of care and its associated factors in Korean adults: a cross-sectional study of the 2012 Korea Health Panel Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wastewater surveillance has shown to be a valuable and efficient tool to obtain information about the trends of COVID-19 in the community. Since the recent emergence of new variants, associated with increased transmissibility and/or antibody escape (variants of concern), there is an urgent need for methods that enable specific and timely detection and quantification of the occurrence of these variants in the community. In this study we demonstrate the use of RT-ddPCR on wastewater samples for specific detection of mutation N501Y. This assay enabled simultaneous enumeration of the concentration of variants with the 501Y mutation and Wild Type (WT, containing 501N) SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detection of N501Y was possible in samples with mixtures of WT with low proportions of lineage B.1.351 (0.5%). The method could accurately determine the proportion of N501Y and WT in mixtures of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The application to raw sewage samples from the cities of Amsterdam and Utrecht demonstrated that this method can be applied to determine the concentrations and the proportions of WT and N501Y containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples. The emergence of N501Y in Amsterdam and Utrecht wastewater aligned with the emergence of B.1.1.7 as causative agent of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, indicating that RT-ddPCR of wastewater samples can be used to monitor the emergence of the N501Y mutation in the community. It also indicates that RT-ddPCR could be used for sensitive and accurate monitoring of current (like K417N, E484K) or future mutations present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Therefore, in pediatric diabetology the use of at least one technical device is standard. Both devices can also be combined to form automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. Many AID systems have been tested in clinical trials and have proven to be safe and effective. The supply situation in Germany currently only allows one system to be prescribed for people insured by the statutory health insurances. Currently, children younger than 7 years of age cannot be treated with this system. The reasons for this are legal hurdles and lack of certification by the manufacturers. The CE certification can also lead to problems with insulin prescriptions. Open-source systems are non-regulated variants to circumvent existing regulatory conditions. There are risks here for both users and prescribers. For permanent use a thorough knowledge of the features of each AID system is necessary for both the user and the practitioner. Complete automation does not yet work. For the evaluation of the AID treatment, the metric data of the glucose sensors, the time in range and the glucose management index are the recognized and suitable parameters, because they allow a consultation based on real data from the daily life of people with diabetes.

A total of 111 renal transplant recipients with severe CAP admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) were screened for eligibility between 1 January 2009 and 30 November 2018. Patient characteristics and laboratory test results at ICU admission were retrospectively collected. There were 18 non-survivors (22.2%) among 81 patients with severe CAP who were finally included. Non-survivors had a higher NLR level than survivors (26.8 vs. 12.3, p < 0.001).

In the absence of quick, population-wide olfactory tests, we developed SCENTinel, a rapid, inexpensive smell test to assess odor detection, intensity, and identification ability, which can discriminate anosmia (e.g., total smell loss) from normosmia (e.g., normal sense of smell) using a single odor. A new version, SCENTinel 1.1, extends the original test with one of four possible odors and a hedonic subtest (how pleasant is the odor). The purpose of this study was to determine if SCENTinel 1.1 can discriminate other types of olfactory disorders common to COVID-19, such as hyposmia (e.g., reduced sense of smell), parosmia (e.g., distorted odor perception), and phantosmia (e.g., odor sensation without an odor source). Participants (N=381) were divided into three groups based on their self-reported olfactory function: quantitative smell disorder (anosmia or hyposmia, N=135), qualitative smell disorder (parosmia and/or phantosmia; n=86), and normosmia (N=66). SCENTinel 1.1 classifies anosmia and normosmia groups with high sensitivity (AUC=0.94), similar to SCENTinel 1.0 (AUC=0.95). SCENTinel 1.1 also accurately discriminates quantitative from qualitative (AUC=0.76), and normosmia (AUC=0.84), and normosmia from qualitative (AUC=0.73) groups. We also considered a subset of participants who only reported one type of olfactory disorder. SCENTinel 1.1 discriminates hyposmia from parosmia (AUC=0.89), and anosmia (AUC=0.78); as well as parosmia from anosmia (AUC=0.82). Participants with parosmia had a significantly lower hedonic score than those without parosmia, indicating odor distortions are unpleasant. SCENTinel 1.1 is a rapid smell test that can discriminate quantitative (anosmia, hyposmia) and qualitative (parosmia, phantosmia) olfactory disorders, and it is among the only direct tests to rapidly screen for parosmia.","output":"SCENTinel 1.1 rapidly screens for COVID-19 related olfactory disorders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the end of March 2020, just over a month after the first ascertained case of CoViD-19 infection in Italy, the first reports of acute lesions of acro-ischemia appeared, especially in pre-adolescents and adolescents.

Clinical manifestations do not usually associate with other typical symptoms of Covid-19 and do not find a classical and defined serological antibody response (IgG and IgM). From a clinical point of view it is a localized and self-resolving problem of an interesting and relatively new pathogenetic model of disease in relation to a viral agent. Future studies must make us understand if there is in this specific condition a low viral load is not detectable by current methods and if this explains the inability to produce an adequate immune response for CoViD-19. It is important to determine whether the interferon immune response in some subjects can be the cause of both the low viremia and the endothelial damage so localized in the acral-site, as happens in other models of diseases (chilblain-lupus like). On the contrary, some authors believe that the acral lesions are attributable to chilblains caused by a series of favourable environmental conditions due to forced enclosure.

In addition, cases of arterial thromboembolism were also reported. We investigated the effect of antiplatelet therapy on the disease course. Methods We evaluated a cohort of inpatients with Covid-19 (n = 152). We recorded the patients demographic data, their comorbidities, medication use including the use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants, laboratory findings and data about mechanical ventilation. We then separated the patients outcomes into either being ?bad (dead or referral to higher level of care) or ?good (discharged). Then we evaluated the factors that contributed to the patient needing ventilatory support and to showing typical radiological findings. Results In our cohort, 21 patients received ventilatory support whereas 131 did not require the use of ventilators. 127 patients had good outcomes and 25 had bad outcomes. By using multivariate analysis, we found that the need for ventilatory support was the strongest predictor of a bad outcome. All patients who were on ventilators displayed typical radiological findings. The factors predicting the need for ventilatory support were LDH and CRP levels, the presence of cardiac conduction abnormalities as well as chronic lung conditions. Cardiac conduction abnormalities, LDH and CRP levels, and the use of antiplatelets, were factors that predicted typical radiological findings. Conclusions There was a higher incidence of typical radiological findings in patients on antiplatelet medication. However, it did not translate into changes in the ventilation requirement or in the outcome.

Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food security is important to provide support and identify long-term impacts and needs. OBJECTIVE: The National Food Access and COVID research Team (NFACT) was formed to assess food security over different US study sites throughout the pandemic, using common instruments and measurements. This study presents results from 18 study sites across 15 states and nationally over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A validated survey instrument was developed and implemented in whole or part through an online survey of adults across the sites throughout the first year of the pandemic, representing 22 separate surveys. Sampling methods for each study site were convenience, representative, or high-risk targeted. Food security was measured using the USDA 6-item module. Food security prevalence was analyzed using ANOVA by sampling method to assess statistically significant differences. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 27,168) indicate higher prevalence of food insecurity (low or very low food security) since the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with before the pandemic. In nearly all study sites, there is a higher prevalence of food insecurity among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), households with children, and those with job disruptions. The findings demonstrate lingering food insecurity, with high prevalence over time in sites with repeat cross-sectional surveys. There are no statistically significant differences between convenience and representative surveys, but a statistically higher prevalence of food insecurity among high-risk compared with convenience surveys. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive study demonstrates a higher prevalence of food insecurity in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. METHODS: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26th to August 10th, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the lethality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high lethality rate of around 50% was observed. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors.

One of the major concerns of hospitals was to limit spread of infection to health-care workers. Because the virus is spread mainly by respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles, procedures that may potentially disperse viral particles, the so-called \\"aerosol-generating procedures\\" were avoided whenever possible. Included in this category were noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and awake (nonintubated) proning. Accordingly, at many health-care facilities, patients who had increasing oxygen requirements were emergently intubated and mechanically ventilated to avoid exposure to aerosol-generating procedures. With experience, physicians realized that mortality of invasively ventilated patients was high and it was not easy to extubate many of these patients. This raised the concern that HFNC and NIV were being underutilized to avoid intubation and to facilitate extubation. In this article, we attempt to separate fact from fiction and perception from reality pertaining to the aerosol dispersion with NIV, HFNC, and awake proning.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore rural health professionals perceptions of health workforce capability and persuasive design techniques; and translate these into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase their impact and usefulness. METHODS: Qualitative interviews with 13 rural health professionals were conducted. Subsequently, 32 persuasive techniques were used as a framework to deductively analyze the data. Persuasive design technique domains were Primary Task Support, Dialog Support, System Credibility Support, Social Support, and Cialdinis Principles of Persuasion. RESULTS: Persuasive design techniques can be applied across the factors that influence health workforce capability including health and personal qualities; competencies and skills; values, attitudes, and motivation; and factors that operate outside of work and at the team, organizational, and labor market levels. The majority of the 32 persuasive design techniques were reflected in the data from the interviews and led to recommendations as to how these could be translated into practice, with the exception of scarcity. Many suggestions and persuasive design techniques link back to the need for tailored and localized solutions such as the need for country-specificCbased evidence, the wish for localized communities of practice, learning from other rural health professionals, and referral pathways to other clinicians. Participants identified how persuasive design techniques can optimize the user experience to help meet rural health professionals needs for more efficient systems to improve patient access to care, quality care, and to enable working in interprofessional team-based care. Social inclusion plays a vital role for health professionals, indicating the importance of the Social Support domain of persuasive techniques. Overall, health professionals were open to self-monitoring of their work performance and some professionals used wearables to monitor their health. CONCLUSIONS: Rural health professionals perceptions of health workforce capability informed which persuasive design techniques can be used to optimize the user experience of an app. These were translated into recommendations for designing a health workforce capability app to increase likelihood of adoption. This study has also contributed to the further validation of the Persuasive Systems Design model through empirically aligning elements of the model to increase persuasive system content and functionality with real-world applied data, in this case the health workforce capability of rural health professionals.

METHODS: DISCOVER CKD follows an enriched hybrid study design, with both retrospective and prospective patient cohorts, integrating primary and secondary data from patients with CKD from China, Italy, Japan, Sweden, the UK and the USA. Data will be prospectively captured over a 3-year period from >1000 patients with CKD who will be followed up for at least 1 year via electronic case report form entry during routine clinical visits and also via a mobile/tablet-based application, enabling the capture of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In-depth interviews will be conducted in a subset of 100 patients. Separately, secondary data will be retrospectively captured from >2 000 000 patients with CKD, extracted from existing datasets and registries. RESULTS: The DISCOVER CKD program captures and will report on patient demographics, biomarker and laboratory measurements, medical histories, clinical outcomes, healthcare resource utilization, medications, dietary patterns, physical activity and PROs (including QoL and qualitative interviews).

The non-structural proteins carry out activities critical for viral functions, and the structural proteins play a significant role in viral assembly and structure. The zoonotic nature of coronaviruses is responsible for the past epidemics and the current pandemic. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused infections worldwide and now crossed over a million fatalities. The high transmission rate of the virus has caused new cases emerging every day. While vaccines remain an ideal solution, it is also important to identify alternative potential small molecules and other inhibitors against molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2. The present chapter describes the current scenario of the world facing the COVID-19 pandemic and details the molecular machinery of the causative agent, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. It discusses the role of drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 and explains its methodology. It aims to provide an overview toward coronaviruses and the role and method of drug repurposing against crucial viral targets (here, 3CLpro as a case study) to create a report of current computational drug discovery approaches coherently.","output":"Computational Drug Repurposing for the Development of Drugs Against Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMO Objetivo compreender os significados que os profissionais de enfermagem atribuem s suas vivncias no contexto da pandemia da COVID-19.

In addition to soliciting point estimates, we asked participants for lower and higher bounds of a range that they felt had a 75% chance of containing the true answer. Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible.

Managing resources is one of the biggest challenges that healthcare providers around the world face during the pandemic. Allocating the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds' capacity is important since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and some patients need to be admitted to the hospital with an urgent need for oxygen support, ventilation, and/or intensive medical care. In the battle against COVID-19, many governments utilized technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), to contain the pandemic and limit its hazardous effects. In this paper, Machine Learning models (ML) were developed to help in detecting the COVID-19 patients need for the ICU and the estimated duration of their stay. Four ML algorithms were utilized: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Ensemble models were trained and validated on a dataset of 895 COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad University hospital in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The conducted experiments show that the Length of Stay (LoS) in the ICU can be predicted with the highest accuracy by applying the RF model for prediction, as the achieved accuracy was 94.16%. In terms of the contributor factors to the length of stay in the ICU, correlation results showed that age, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), nasal oxygen support days are the top related factors. By searching the literature, there is no published work that used the Saudi Arabia dataset to predict the need for ICU with the number of days needed. This contribution is hoped to pave the path for hospitals and healthcare providers to manage their resources more efficiently and to help in saving lives.","output":"Machine learning model for predicting the length of stay in the intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The world is currently experiencing the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. There is no approved drug for the definitive treatment of the disease. Various drugs are being tried for the treatment of COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). This study was performed to systematically review the therapeutic role of HCQ in COVID-19 from the available literature. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP (WHO), Cochrane Library databases, and two pre-print servers (medRxiv.org and Research Square) were searched for clinical studies that evaluated the therapeutic role of HCQ on COVID-19 until 10 May 2020. The available studies were critically analyzed and the data were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 663 articles were screened and 12 clinical studies (seven peer-reviewed and published studies and five non-peer-reviewed studies from pre-print servers) with a total sample size of 3543 patients were included. Some of the clinical studies demonstrated good virological and clinical outcomes with HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19 patients, although the studies had major methodological limitations. Some of the other studies showed negative results with HCQ therapy along with the risk of adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: The results of efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19, as obtained from the clinical studies, are not satisfactory, although many of these studies had major methodological limitations. Stronger evidence from well-designed robust randomized clinical trials is required before conclusively determining the role of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.

METHODS The short-term outcomes of robotic sphincter-preserving surgery (n = 130) were retrospectively compared to open (n = 234) and laparoscopic surgery (n = 318) by a propensity score analysis. RESULTS Robotic surgery was performed more frequently for patients with lower rectal cancer (55%) than open (30%, p < 0.0001) or laparoscopic surgery (36%, p < 0.0001). None of the robotic surgery cases were converted to open surgery. After propensity score matching, robotic surgery was found to be associated with a longer operation time (342 vs. 230 min, p < 0.0001) and less blood loss (7 vs. 420 mL, p < 0.0001) than open surgery. The overall complication rate of robotic surgery was lower than that of open surgery (13 vs. 28%, p = 0.032). Robotic surgery was associated with a lower incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) than laparoscopic surgery (0 vs. 7%, p = 0.028). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage after robotic surgery. The circumferential resection margin was involved in 0.8% of the patients who underwent robotic surgery; the incidence did not differ among the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Although robotic surgery for rectal cancer was associated with a longer operation time, it was associated with a very low incidence of SSIs.

Therefore, prompt identification of these variants in the environment is essential for pandemic assessment and containment efforts. One well established tool for such viral monitoring is the use of wastewater systems. Here, we describe continuous monitoring of traces of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the municipal wastewater of a large city in Israel. By observing morbidity fluctuations (during three main COVID-19 surges) occurring in parallel with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine vaccination rate, compromised immunity was revealed in the current morbidity peak. RT-qPCR assays for the Original (D614G), Alpha and Beta variants had been previously developed and are being employed for wastewater surveillance. In the present study we developed a sensitive RT-qPCR assay designed for the rapid, direct detection of Gamma and Delta variants of concern. Sensitive quantification and detection of the various variants showed the prevalence of the original variant during the first morbidity peak. The dominance of the Alpha variant over the original variant correlated with the second morbidity peak. These variants decreased concurrently with an increase in vaccinations (Feb-March 2021) and the observed decrease in morbidity. The appearance and subsequent rise of the Delta variant became evident and corresponded to the third morbidity peak (June-August 2021). These results suggest a high vaccine neutralization efficiency towards the Alpha variant compared to its neutralization efficiency towards the Delta variant. Moreover, the third vaccination dose (booster) seems to regain neutralization efficiency towards the Delta variant. The developed assays and wastewater-based epidemiology are important tools aiding in morbidity surveillance and disclosing vaccination efforts and immunity dynamics in the community.","output":"RT-qPCR assays for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wastewater reveals compromised vaccination-induced immunity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cybersecurity in Russia is not a standalone concept but an integral part of national information security, which influences its legal status and applicable regulation, and determines its development trends.

The objective of this study is to determine context-specific facilitators and barriers for self-testing and to assess the usability of syphilis self-testing in Zimbabwe among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: This mixed methods study was conducted in Harare as part of a larger syphilis self-testing trial. The study included in-depth interviews (phase one) followed by usability testing and a second interview (phase two). In-depth interviews were conducted with MSM and key informants prior to syphilis self-testing. The same MSM then used the syphilis self-test, quantitatively assessed its usability and participated in a second in-depth interview. Phase one data was analysed using a thematic approach, guided by an adapted Social Ecological Model conceptual framework. Phase two interviews were analysed using Rapid Assessment Procedure qualitative methodology, and usability was assessed using a pre-established index, adapted from existing HIVST evaluation scales. Results: Twenty MSM and 10 key informants were recruited for phase one in-depth interviews and 16 of these MSM participated in phase two by completing a syphilis self-test kit. Facilitating factors for self-testing included the potential for increased privacy, convenience, autonomy and avoidance of social and healthcare provider stigma. Barriers included the fear to test and uncertainty about linkage to care and treatment. Data from the usability index suggested high usability (89.6% on a 0-100 scale) among the men who received the self-test. Conclusions: MSM in Zimbabwe were willing to use syphilis self-test kits and many of the barriers and facilitators were similar to those observed for HIVST.

Methods: Outbreak studies were performed between 11 November and 15 December 2020 when the wild-type variant of SARS-CoV-2 was dominant. Clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections within schools were identified through a prospective school surveillance study. All school contacts of cluster cases, irrespective of symptoms, were invited for PCR testing twice within 48 hrs and 4-7 days later. Combined NTS and saliva samples were collected at each time point along with data on recent exposure and symptoms. Surface and active air samples were collected in the school environment. All samples were PCR-tested and sequenced when possible. Results: Out of 263 sampled school contacts, 24 tested SARS-CoV-2 positive (secondary attack rate 9.1%), of which 62% remained asymptomatic and 42% had a weakly positive test result. Phylogenetic analysis on 12 subjects from 2 schools indicated a cluster of 8 and 2 secondary cases, respectively, but also other distinct strains within outbreaks.

The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed >200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle's structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP's imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied. The PC on the nanoMIPs appeared to be driven by the protein composition of the plasma, while the template protein, towards which a nanoMIP was imprinted and that was proven to have high affinity for, did not influence the PC.","output":"Does the protein corona take over the selectivity of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles?

RESULTS: Seventy-fourCOVID-19 patients with diabetes were included. Twenty-seven patients (36.5%) were severe and 10 patients (13.5%) died. Higher levels of blood glucose, serum amyloid A (SAA), C reactive protein and interleukin 6 were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe ones (P<0.05). Levels of albumin, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, small and dense low density lipoprotein and CD4+T lymphocyte counts in severe patients were lower than those in non-severe patients (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified decreased CD4+T lymphocyte counts (odds ratio [OR]=0.988, 95%Confidence interval [95%CI] 0.979-0.997) and increased SAA levels (OR=1.029, 95%CI 1.002-1.058) as risk factors for severity of COVID-19 with diabetes (P<0.05).

In this work, computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches comprising ligand- and structure-based methods were explored for predicting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. The CADD ligand-based method used a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) classification model that was built using 5276 organic molecules extracted from the ChEMBL database with SARS-CoV-2 screening data. The best model achieved an overall predictive accuracy of up to 67% for an external and internal validation using test and training sets. Moreover, based on the best QSAR model, a virtual screening campaign was carried out using 11,162 MNPs retrieved from the Reaxys? database, 7 in-house MNPs obtained from marine-derived actinomycetes by the team, and 14 MNPs that are currently in the clinical pipeline. All the MNPs from the virtual screening libraries that were predicted as belonging to class A were selected for the CADD structure-based method. In the CADD structure-based approach, the 494 MNPs selected by the QSAR approach were screened by molecular docking against Mpro enzyme. A list of virtual screening hits comprising fifteen MNPs was assented by establishing several limits in this CADD approach, and five MNPs were proposed as the most promising marine drug-like leads as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors, a benzo[f]pyrano[4,3-b]chromene, notoamide I, emindole SB beta-mannoside, and two bromoindole derivatives.","output":"A Computer-Aided Drug Design Approach to Predict Marine Drug-Like Leads for SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Involuntary migration is a crucially important global challenge from an economic, social, and public health perspective.

Migrants and refugees are often perceived to carry a higher load of infectious diseases, despite no systematic association. We propose three important contributions that the global health community can make to help address infectious disease risks and global health inequalities worldwide, with a particular focus on the refugee crisis in Europe. First, policy decisions should be based on a sound evidence base regarding health risks and burdens to health systems, rather than prejudice or unfounded fears. Second, for incoming refugees, we must focus on building inclusive, cost-effective health services to promote collective health security. Finally, alongside protracted conflicts, widening of health and socioeconomic inequalities between high-income and lower-income countries should be acknowledged as major drivers for the global refugee crisis, and fully considered in planning long-term solutions.","output":"Pathogens, prejudice, and politics: the role of the global health community in the European refugee crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High-fidelity simulations of coughs and sneezes that serve as virtual experiments are presented, and they offer an unprecedented opportunity to peer into the chaotic evolution of the resulting airborne droplet clouds.

First, innovation is the strategy used for recovery and to gain market power, and the low energy-consumption tax reduction policy can significantly facilitate firms' innovation activities. Second, our findings further show that the low energy-consumption tax reduction policy improves firms' innovation investment through alleviating firms financial constraints.

This study aimed to describe experiences, perceptions and circumstances of an Alberta First Nations community, related to COVID-19 public health advice. We hypothesized that many challenges ensued when following and implementing advice from public health experts. METHODS: With First Nations leadership and staff, an online cross-sectional survey was deployed between April 24 and June 25, 2020. It assessed the appropriateness of public health advice to curb COVID-19 within this large First Nations community. Both quantitative and qualitative data were captured and described. RESULTS: A total of 106 adults living on-reserve responded; over 80% were female. Difficulty accessing food was significant by employment status (p = 0.0004). Those people with lower income found accessing food (p = 0.0190) and getting essential medical care (p = 0.0060), clothing (p = 0.0280) and transportation (p = 0.0027) more difficult. Some respondents described lost income associated with COVID-19 experiences, as well as difficulties accessing essential supplies. Respondents found proper handwashing most easy (98%) and keeping a distance of 2 m from others most difficult (23%). Many respondents found following public health advice within their personal domain easy and put family safety first but experienced some difficulties when navigating social aspects and obligations, particularly when unable to control the actions of others.

The pooling of samples consists of combining individual patient samples in a block and analyzing the group as a particular sample. This strategy has been shown to reduce the burden of laboratory material and logistical resources by up to 80%. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the pool of samples analyzed by RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of diagnostic tests was carried out. We individually evaluated 420 samples, and 42 clusters were formed, each one with ten samples. These clusters could contain 0, 1 or 2 positive samples to simulate a positivity of 0, 10 and 20%, respectively. RT-PCR analyzed the groups for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), the Youden index, the global and subgroup sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to their Ct values that were classified as high (H:  25), moderate (M: 26C30) and low (L: 31C35) concentration of viral RNA. RESULTS: From a total of 42 pools, 41 (97.6%) obtained the same result as the samples they contained (positive or negative). The AUC for pooling, Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95C1); 0.97 (95% CI, 0.90C1.03); 96.67% (95% CI; 88.58C100%) and 100% (95% CI; 95.83C100%) respectively.

It has varied clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. It has led to the mortality of several affected individuals. However, the prognosis seems to vary from one person to the other and efforts are being made to identify the prognostic factors. Hypocalcaemia has been identified as a poor prognostic factor with a high frequency among individuals affected with COVID-19. This review aims to estimate the prevalence of hypocalcaemia among COVID-19 patients and identify the poor prognostic factors associated with the presence of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 patients. Electronic medical databases were searched for publications on the prognostic implications of hypocalcaemia in COVID-19 infection, and relevant articles were selected for systematic review following PRISMA algorithm. The prevalence of hypocalcaemia among patients with COVID-19 was 40.0-74.4%. There was a significant association between the rate of hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission as well as septic shock and hypocalcaemia in patients with COVID-19. Hypocalcaemia is also associated with a higher mortality rate in these patients.

The inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK)-related cytokine signaling pathways using small molecules is prevalent nowadays. The JAK family belongs to nonreceptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2). JAK1 has received significant attention after being identified as a promising target for developing anti-RA therapeutics. Currently, no crystal structure is available for JAK1 in complex with the next-generation anti-RA drugs. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism of binding of baricitinib, filgotinib, itacitinib, and upadacitinib to JAK1 using a combined method of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation via the molecular mechanics PoissonCBoltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) scheme. We found that the calculated binding affinity decreases in the order upadacitinib > itacitinib > filgotinib > baricitinib. Due to the increased favorable intermolecular electrostatic contribution, upadacitinib is more selective to JAK1 compared to the other three inhibitors. The cross-correlation and principal component analyses showed that different inhibitor bindings significantly affect the binding site dynamics of JAK1. Furthermore, our studies indicated that the hydrophobic residues and hydrogen bonds from the hinge region (Glu(957) and Leu(959)) of JAK1 played an essential role in stabilizing the inhibitors. Protein structural network analysis reveals that the total number of links and hubs in JAK1/baricitinib (354, 48) is more significant than those in apo (328, 40) and the other three complexes. The JAK1/baricitinib complex shows the highest probability of the highest-ranked community, indicating a compact network of the JAK1/baricitinib complex, consistent with its higher stability than the rest of the four systems. Overall, our study may be crucial for the rational design of JAK1-selective inhibitors with better affinity.","output":"Unraveling the Molecular Mechanism of Recognition of Selected Next-Generation Antirheumatoid Arthritis Inhibitors by Janus Kinase 1"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic since it emerged in December 2019. Previous studies have reported rapid antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset. Here, we retrospectively described the dynamic changes of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in later weeks (mainly 4-10 weeks) in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We observed that serum IgM and IgG, especially in patients with moderate-to-high levels, declined significantly between week 4 to 10 after illness onset. Notably, IgG levels in high percentage of patients (77.5%, 31 of 40) rapidly declined by half, from 212.5 (range, 163.7-420.3) to 96.3 (range, 75.0-133.4) AU/mL, within 1 to 2 weeks in the second month and then sustained at around 100 AU/mL until discharge from hospital. Significant reduction of IgM was also observed as SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid turned negative (P = .002). In the recovery stage, serum IgG declined significantly (early vs late recovery stage, n = 16, P = .003) with a median reduction of 50.0% (range, 3.7%-77.0%). Our results suggested that the decline of IgM may be an indicator of virus clearance and recovered patients may have a robust immunity against reinfection within at least 3 months after illness onset. Yet, the rapid reduction of IgG by half rises serious concerns on the robustness and sustainability of the humoral immune response in the period after discharge, which is crucial for immunity strategy and developing a vaccine.","output":"The dynamic changes of serum IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Yoga is a complete science, a complete lifestyle, a complete medical practice and a complete spiritual education The secret of the popularity of yoga is that it has never distinction from the narrowness of gender, caste, class, community, region and language Any seeker, thinker, recluse, practitioner, brahmachari, householder can get benefited by attaining the same It has proved useful not only in the creation and upliftment of the individual but also in the all-round development of the family, society, nation and the world Yoga is the solution to the stress, disturbance, terrorism, lack and ignorance of modern human society Yoga is a wonderful technique to bring man on the paved path of positive thinking which was invented by the intelligent sages of India, millions of years ago Maharhi Patanjali performed it in the form of Ashtanga Yoga, disciplined, edited and executed A healthy person and a happy society can only be created by going in the condition of yoga Yoga is not only the discipline of ascetics, recluse and yogis who live in cave, but it is also very much needed for the general householder It is a matter of surprise that we are ready to exploit our financial, physical and mental by falling into a two-hundred-year-old allopathic medical system For millions of years, we remain indifferent to old yoga, remain ignorant, which is not only authentic but also teaches free treatment","output":"Era of COVID-19 pandemic: yoga contemplation and medical mystery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last two years were strongly shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing countermeasures.

However, the available evidence provides no insight into the possible mechanisms by which co-activation of the IFN-alpha/beta- and IFN-gamma-signalling pathways produces this effect. Therefore, it has not been possible to differentiate between whether these observations represent an important in vitro model of host immunological suppression of HSV-1 infection or an irrelevant laboratory phenomenon. Therefore, the current study was initiated to determine whether co-activation of the host cell's IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma pathways either (i) induced death of HSV-1-infected cells such that virus replication was unable to occur; or (ii) disrupted one or more steps in the process of HSV-1 replication. To this end, multiple steps in HSV-1 infection were compared in populations of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 strain KOS (m.o.i. of 2.5) and exposed to ligands of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor, the IFN-gamma receptor or both. The results demonstrated that IFN-beta and IFN-gamma interact in a synergistic manner to block the efficient synthesis of viral DNA and nucleocapsid formation in HSV-1-infected cells and do so without compromising host-cell viability. It was inferred that IFN-mediated suppression of HSV-1 replication may be a central mechanism by which the host immune system limits the spread of HSV-1 infection in vivo.","output":"Beta interferon and gamma interferon synergize to block viral DNA and virion synthesis in herpes simplex virus-infected cells."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a knowledge gap when treating comorbid chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included studies reporting development of a COS for use in research regardless of age, health condition or setting. Studies reporting the development of a COS for patient-reported outcomes or adverse events or complications were also included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted in relation to scope of the COS study, participant categories and the methods used in outcome selection. RESULTS: Studies describing 370 COS were identified in the database. Of these, 75 (20%) included participants from LMICs. Only four COS were initiated from an LMIC setting. More than half of COS with LMIC participants were developed in the last 5 years. Cancer and rheumatology were the dominant disease domains.

METHODS A multidisciplinary expert panel composed by specialists with direct experience in COVID-19 management discussed and reviewed the criteria that should be taken into account in the decision to operate or not a patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Disease-related factors should be first taken into account in order to precisely know the enemy we are facing. Patient-related factors should be then evaluated to understand the battleground on which we are facing the enemy. After these considerations, we must ascertain costs and expected outcomes of our surgical intervention by evaluation of surgery-related factors. Finally, the last factor that need to be evaluated before surgery is the availability of resources, staff and ward availability for perioperative care in particular. All these considerations will lead to the optimal organization and management of neurosurgical emergencies during pandemic times, taking into account the community and not only the single patient.

After segmentectomy, on histological examination was defined as: squamous keratinizing aspect. In light of this report she was subjected to quadrantectomy with lymphadenectomy. She did not undergo radiotherapy treatment, which was delayed due to the ongoing pandemic. After a few months developed a local recurrence and underwent a mastectomy with multidisciplinary treatment. DISCUSSION: Squamously-differentiated metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is one of the rarest forms of breast cancer. Its etiopathogenesis is still unclear but some authors suggest that it originates from a squamous metaplasia deriving from the epithelium of cysts. This is a very aggressive and fast-growing tumour especially in young women, in fact the patient had a recurrence after a few months. She came to our attention 6 months after the initial surgery with a relapse at a local-regional level for which she was subjected to radical treatment and with a metastatic spread for which she was given the first-line chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSION: There are no well-defined guidelines for the treatment of this rare form of cancer.

The top 100 most popular videos represented 24% of total viewed videos with the hashtag #CAMHS.The most popular recurrent themes associated with the hashtag #CAMHS in our sample were: raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management (40% of videos), reference to self-harm (27% of videos) and negative perception of CAMHS (27% of videos).Raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management had the most likes (3,694,700) and views (17,435,900). This was followed by videos with themes of reference to self-harm (3,006,300 likes and 14,382,700 views). The most shared themes were: reference to suicide (shared 56,763 times) and videos which portrayed a theme of negative perception of CAMHS (40,628 shares). Videos with themes of a negative perception of CAMHS also garnered 1,762,500 likes and 8,666,900 views.ConclusionCAMHS is actively represented on TikTok through freely accessible unregulated videos. Videos with themes of raising awareness of mental health symptoms and management can potentially allow young people to share their experiences. Nonetheless, popular hashtags such as #CAMHSmemes and #CAMHSjokes, as well as videos featuring themes of negative perception of CAMHS, could potentially undermine the reputation of CAMHS to existing and future service users. The content of these videos should be taken seriously by CAMHS clinicians as it can potentially provide an insight into service users experiences of CAMHS on a scale that has not been observed before. Presently these videos are not screened or modulated by the NHS CAMHS service.","output":"Representation of #CAMHS on social media platform TikTok"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A core goal of functional neuroimaging is to study how the environment is processed in the brain. The mainstream paradigm involves concurrently measuring a broad spectrum of brain responses to a small set of environmental features preselected with reference to previous studies or a theoretical framework. As a complement, we invert this approach by allowing the investigator to record the modulation of a preselected brain response by a broad spectrum of environmental features. Our approach is optimal when theoretical frameworks or previous empirical data are impoverished. By using a prespecified closed-loop design, the approach addresses fundamental challenges of reproducibility and generalisability in brain research. These conditions are particularly acute when studying the developing brain, where our theories based on adult brain function may fundamentally misrepresent the topography of infant cognition and where there are substantial practical challenges to data acquisition. Our methodology employs machine learning to map modulation of a neural feature across a space of experimental stimuli. Our method collects, processes and analyses EEG brain data in real-time; and uses a neuro-adaptive Bayesian optimisation algorithm to adjust the stimulus presented depending on the prior samples of a given participant. Unsampled stimuli can be interpolated by fitting a Gaussian process regression along the dataset. We show that our method can automatically identify the face of the infant's mother through online recording of their Nc brain response to a face continuum. We can retrieve model statistics of individualised responses for each participant, opening the door for early identification of atypical development. This approach has substantial potential in infancy research and beyond for improving power and generalisability of mapping the individual cognitive topography of brain function.","output":"Neuroadaptive electroencephalography: a proof-of-principle study in infants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN A finales de 2020 se aprobaron las vacunas desarrolladas en el mundo occidental contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, que ya estn siendo inoculadas, conjuntamente con vacunas chinas y rusas.

We conducted an economic evaluation of pralatrexate from a societal perspective in Korea based on data from the PROPEL phase II study. METHODS Using a Markov model with a weekly cycle, we simulated the experience of patients with R/R PTCL receiving pralatrexate or CC for 15 years. The model consists of five health states; initial treatment, treatment pause, subsequent treatment, stem cell transplantation (SCT) success, and death. Comparative effectiveness was based on PROPEL phase II single-arm study and its matched historical control analysis. Costs included drug, drug administration, monitoring, adverse event management, and SCT costs. RESULTS The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the base case was $39,153 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The results of one-way sensitivity analysis ranged from $33,949 to $51,846 per QALY gained, which remained within an implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of anticancer drugs in Korea.

Knowing the type and distribution of exposed assets, in particular buildings, is thus paramount for effective mitigation of disasters. Citizens' involvement in disaster risk reduction activities is constantly increasing by means of crowdsourced data collection, education/training and citizen science activities. In particular, schools have a central role in engaging young students and increasing risk awareness and preparedness. In this work, we explored whether students participation in this kind of activities can lead to the improvement of current exposure datasets, while increasing citizens' risk-related understanding. In 2021, due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS started a new project to be deployed in fully remote mode, named CEDAS: building CEnsus for seismic Damage ASsessment. The project consists in the collection and elaboration of crowdsourced data on main residential buildings typologies of northeastern Italy, a seismically active area which suffered consequences from strong past earthquakes. During the project, 170 high school students collected reports on more than 3200 buildings, performing a statistical analysis of theing results. The CEDAS project makes a first step beyond crowdsourcing activities and applies citizen science to exposure development. Results allow identifying the most common building typologies in the region and the challenges and opportunities associated with data collection and analysis. The experience collected during the CEDAS project shows that crowdsourcing and citizen science activities can contribute to both enhancing the exposure data available for the scientific community and increasing risk awareness among young students in the region.","output":"Can high-school students contribute to seismic risk mitigation?

Thorough validation of these tests is important before use as epidemiological tools to infer seroprevalence in specific populations and as diagnostic tools to complement molecular approaches (e.g., quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). METHODS: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. RESULTS: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a non-severe presentation.

We have previously shown that immersion in cold formalin followed by heated formalin is beneficial for preservation of histomorphology and have combined two-temperature fixation with ultra-sensitive acoustic monitoring technology that can actively detect formalin diffusing into a tissue. Here we expand on our previous work by developing a predictive statistical model to determine when a tissue is properly diffused based on the real-time acoustic signal. We trained the model based on the morphology and characteristic diffusion curves of 30 tonsil cores. To test our model, a set of 87 different tonsil samples were fixed with four different protocols: dynamic fixation according to our predictive algorithm (C/H:Dynamic, N = 18), gold-standard 24 hour room temperature (RT:24hr, N = 24), 6 hours in cold formalin followed by 1 hour in heated formalin (C/H:6+1, N = 21), and 2 hours in cold formalin followed by 1 hour in heated formalin (C/H:2+1, N = 24). Digital pathology analysis revealed that the C/H:Dynamic samples had FOXP3 staining that was spatially uniform and statistically equivalent to RT:24hr and C/H:6+1 fixation protocols. For comparison, the intentionally underfixed C/H:2+1 samples had significantly suppressed FOXP3 staining (p<0.002). Furthermore, our dynamic fixation protocol produced bcl-2 staining concordant with standard fixation techniques. The dynamically fixed samples were on average only submerged in cold formalin for 4.2 hours, representing a significant workflow improvement. We have successfully demonstrated a first-of-its-kind analytical method to assess the quality of fixation in real-time and have confirmed its performance with quantitative analysis of downstream staining. This innovative technology could be used to ensure high-quality and standardized staining as part of an expedited and fully documented preanalytical workflow.","output":"Making a science out of preanalytics: An analytical method to determine optimal tissue fixation in real-time"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Adults should achieve a minimum of 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity per week, but many people do not achieve this. Changes to international guidance have removed the requirement to complete physical activity in bouts of at least 10 min. Snacktivity is a novel and complementary approach that could motivate people to be physically active. It focuses on promoting shorter (2C5 min) and more frequent bouts, or snacks of physical activity throughout the day. It is not known whether promoting physical activity in shorter bouts is acceptable to the public, or whether it likely to translate into health behaviour change. METHODS: As part of a larger research programme, this study explored the merits of using small bouts of physical activity to help the public become physically active (the Snacktivity? programme). Thirty-one inactive adults used the approach for five days then participated in semi- structured interviews about their experiences. The data were analysed using the Framework approach. RESULTS: Whilst participants highlighted some potential barriers to implementation, they expressed the ease with which Snacktivity could be achieved, which gave them a new awareness of opportunities to do more physical activity throughout the day. Participants raised the importance of habit formation to achieve regular small bouts of physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated that participants liked the Snacktivity concept and viewed it as a motivating approach. Guidance about physical activity must lead to advice that has the best chance of preserving and promoting health and Snacktivity has potential to meet this ambition.

Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019).

The aim of this study was to examine whether the complete ban on alcohol advertising in Norway in 1975 had any effect on total alcohol sales. METHODS: Annual time series of recorded alcohol sales (1960-2006) were analysed. Autoregressive integrated moving average interrupted time series techniques were used to model the effect of the advertising ban, adjusting for alcohol prices and wages. RESULTS: The autoregressive integrated moving average analyses showed a negative and statistically significant effect of the ban on total recorded alcohol sales, suggesting an immediate and lasting reduction of 7.4% (P = 0.002). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The complete ban on alcohol advertising in 1975 in Norway reduced recorded alcohol sales. This suggests that the ban had a protective effect by reducing total alcohol consumption. The conclusion remains tentative because of possible effects of unrecorded alcohol consumption and marketing on social media and satellite TV channels.","output":"The alcohol advertising ban in Norway: Effects on recorded alcohol sales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study investigates travel behavior and psychosocial factors that influence it during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional study, using an online survey, we examined changes in travel behavior and preferences after lifting travel restrictions, and how these changes were influenced by exposure to COVID-19, COVID-19 travel-related risk and severity, personality, fear of travel, coping, and self-efficacy appraisals in the Romanian population. Our results showed that participants traveled less in the pandemic year than the year beforeespecially group and foreign travelyet more participants reported individual traveling in their home county during the pandemic period. Distinct types of exposure to COVID-19 risk, as well as cognitive and affective factors, were related to travel behavior and preferences. However, fun-seeking personality was the only major predictor of travel intention, while fear of travel was the only predictor of travel avoidance. Instead, people traveled more cautiously when they perceived more risk of infection at the destination, and had higher levels of fear of travel, but also a high sense of efficacy in controlling the infection and problem-solving capacity. The results suggest that specific information about COVID-19, coping mechanisms, fear of travel, and neuropsychological personality traits may affect travel behavior in the pandemic period.","output":"Predictors of Changes in Travel Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Tourists Personalities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carbohydrates are present on every living cell and coordinate important processes such as self/non-self discrimination. They are amongst the first molecular determinants to be encountered when cellular interactions are initiated. In particular, they resemble essential molecular fingerprints such as pathogen-, danger-, and self-associated molecular patterns guiding key decision-making in cellular immunology. Therefore, a deeper understanding of how cellular receptors of the immune system recognize incoming particles, based on their carbohydrate signature and how this information is translated into a biological response, will enable us to surgically manipulate them and holds promise for novel therapies. One approach to elucidate these early recognition events of carbohydrate interactions at cellular surfaces is the use of nanoparticles coated with defined carbohydrate structures. These particles are captured by carbohydrate receptors and initiate a cellular cytokine response. In the case of endocytic receptors, the capturing enables the engulfment of exogenous particles. Thereafter, the particles are sorted and degraded during their passage in the endolysosomal pathway. Overall, these processes are dependent on the nature of the endocytic carbohydrate receptors and consequently reflect upon the carbohydrate patterns on the exogenous particle surface. This interplay is still an under-studied subject. In this review, we summarize the application of nanoparticles as a promising tool to monitor complex carbohydrate-protein interactions in a cellular context and their application in areas of biomedicine.","output":"Elucidating Carbohydrate-Protein Interactions Using Nanoparticle-Based Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To observe the influence of Xuebijing injection on the inflammatory markers and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

The routine treatment group was treated according to the National Health Commission's guide for COVID-19. On the basis of conventional treatment, Xuebijing injection was injected by 50 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 50 mL group, while by 100 mL twice a day for 7 days in Xuebijing 100 mL group. The blood routine test, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid test and disease classification of three groups before and 8 days after treatment were observed. RESULTS (1) After treatment, the white blood cell count (WBC) and lymphocyte count (LYM) of three groups increased, meanwhile CRP and ESR decreased. Compared with routine treatment group, the WBC count of Xuebijing 100 mL group after treatment significantly increased (109/L: 7.120.55 vs. 5.670.51, P < 0.05), and the levels of CRP and ESR in Xuebijing 50 mL and 100 mL groups significantly decreased [CRP (mg/L): 32.34.6, 28.06.2 vs. 37.35.9; ESR (mm/1 h): 45.95.7, 40.57.4 vs. 55.36.6, all P < 0.05]. Compared with Xuebijing 50 mL group, the increase of WBC, and the decrease of CRP and ESR were more significant in Xuebijing 100 mL group [WBC (109/L): 7.120.55 vs. 5.820.49, CRP (mg/L): 28.06.2 vs. 32.34.6, ESR (mm/1 h): 40.57.4 vs. 45.95.7, all P < 0.05]. (2) After treatment, the APACHE II score of three groups decreased. In Xuebijing 100 mL group, the APACHE II score after treatment was significantly lower than those in routine treatment and Xuebijing 50 mL groups (12.31.5 vs. 16.51.6, 15.91.4, both P < 0.05). After treatment, the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test in three groups partly turned negative, with 9 cases in routine treatment group, 8 cases in Xuebijing 50 mL group and 9 cases in Xuebijing 100 mL group, without significant difference (P > 0.05). The conditions of patients in the three groups were improved after treatment, among them, 8 cases in the routine treatment group were transformed into common type, 1 case into critical type; 9 cases and 12 cases of Xuebijing 50 mL group and 100 mL group were transformed into common type respectively.

METHODS: All prehospital patients 16 years attended by the EMS but not transported to a hospital during 2013-2017 were included in the study. EMS mission- and patient-related factors were collected and examined in relation to patient death within 30 days of the EMS non-conveyance decision. RESULTS: The EMS performed 324 207 missions with a patient during the study period. The patient was not transported in 95 909 (29.6%) missions; 72 233 missions met the study criteria. Patient mean age (standard deviation) was 59.5 (22.5) years; 55.5% of patients were female. The most common dispatch codes were malaise (15.0%), suspected decline in vital signs (14.0%), and falling over (12.9%). A total of 960 (1.3%) patients died within 30 days after the non-conveyance decision. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that mortality was associated with patient's inability to walk (odds ratio 3.19, 95% confidence interval 2.67-3.80), ambulance dispatch due to shortness of breath (2.73, 2.27-3.27), decreased level of consciousness (2.72, 1.75-4.10), decreased blood oxygen saturation (2.64, 2.27-3.06), and abnormal systolic blood pressure (2.48, 1.79-3.37).

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population and how it compares with the data on SARS-CoV-2 cases reported by a national health surveillance system (SNVS 2.0). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a population-based, seroepidemiological, cross-sectional study in the city of Puerto Madryn, a middle size city in the Province of Chubut, Argentina. The study period was between March 3 and April 17, 2021. The sample size was calculated using the technique of calculation of confidence intervals for a proportion. Participants were selected using stratified and cluster probability sampling. A total of 1405 subjects were invited to participate in the study. Participants were divided into the following four age groups: 1) 0 to 14, 2) 15 to 39, 3) 40 to 64, and 4) 65 or older. After informed consent was obtained, a blood sample was taken by puncture of the fingertip, and a structured questionnaire was administered to evaluate demographics, socioeconomic status, level of education, comorbidities and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. COVID-19 seroprevalence was documented using an immunoenzymatic test for the in vitro detection of IgG antibodies specific to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 987 participants completed the survey. Seropositivity in the full study population was 39,2% and in those under 15 years of age, 47.1%. Cases reported by the SNSV 2.0 amounted to 9.35% of the total population and 1.4% of those under 15 years of age. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the general population is four times higher than the number of cases reported by the SNVS 2.0 in the city of Puerto Madryn. For each child under the age of 15 identified by the SNVS 2.0 with COVID-19, there are more than 30 unrecognized infections.

It remains poorly understood how the host immune system responds to the infection during disease progression. We applied microarray analysis of the whole genome transcriptome to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from severe and mild COVID-19 patients as well as healthy controls. Functional enrichment analysis of genes associated with COVID-19 severity indicated that disease progression is featured by overactivation of myeloid cells and deficient T cell function. The upregulation of TLR6 and MMP9, which promote the neutrophils-mediated inflammatory response, and the downregulation of SKAP1 and LAG3, which regulate T cells function, were associated with disease severity. Importantly, the regulation of these four genes was absent in patients with influenza A (H1N1). And compared with stimulation with hemagglutinin (HA) of H1N1 virus, the regulation pattern of these genes was unique in PBMCs response to Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo. Our data also suggested that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection largely silenced the response of type I interferons (IFNs) and altered the proportion of immune cells, providing a potential mechanism for the hypercytokinemia. This study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs inflammatory and immune signatures in patients, especially those at severe stage.

The mechanism underlying the development of post-vaccination subacute thyroiditis remains unknown; however, one theory suggests that adjuvants contained in vaccines may play a role in triggering diverse autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Another possibility is the potential cross-reactivity between the coronavirus spike protein target produced by the mRNA vaccine and thyroid cell antigens. Common side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine include pain at the injection site, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, and nausea. These symptoms are usually resolved within a few days.

METHODS: We evaluated the medical records of all patients with urolithiasis who visited in our stone prevention clinic from the beginning of COVID-19 in Iran to 1 year later (Feb 2020CFeb 2021) and compared it with the patients medical records in the same period a year before COVID-19 (Feb 2019CFeb 2020). RESULTS: The results of our stone prevention clinic showed a decrease in the number of visits during COVID-19. Twenty-four-hour urine urea, sodium, and potassium were significantly lower, and 24-h urine magnesium was significantly higher during COVID-19. Higher 24-h urine oxalate was only shown in patients with the first-time visit, whereas lower 24-h urine uric acid and citrate were only shown in patients with the follow-up visits.

The purpose of this study is to determine the availability of halal information in e-commerce and find out what improvements can be made by e-commerce business actors. Data were obtained through the observations of e-commerce products. The method used in this research is descriptive analysis. From the results of the study, we know that the form of inclusion of halal information in e-commerce is currently in the form of halal information on product titles, halal labels on product photos, and halal information on product descriptions based on halal certification and statements of business actors. Furthermore, improvements that can be made by business actors are to pay more attention to halal information on the products they sell by providing product halal information. So it is concluded that based on observations on e-commerce, the existence of halal information is still limited. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Content Analysis of Halal Information on Product Website"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present work demonstrates the design and implementation of a human-safe, portable, noninvasive device capable of predicting type 2 diabetes, using electrical bioimpedance and biometric features to train an artificial learning machine using an active learning algorithm based on population selection.

This highly responsive T-cell type was termed NK-like CD8+ T cells due to their capability to act in an innate immune fashion in mice similar to NK cells. However, KIR+NKG2A + CD8+ T cells that are Eomes- represent a small proportion of unconventional T cells that have not been described until now. METHODS We compare the distribution of the memory phenotypes and senescence-associated markers of two T-cell subsets by multicolor flow cytometry in 10 cord blood samples and 105 healthy individuals (HIs) ranging from 6 to 84 years of age. RESULTS We found that the Eomes+ population has a higher differentiation degree than the Eomes- population. T cells in the Eomes- subset show proportionally less TEMRA phenotypes while instead preferentially displaying a more na?ve and TCM phenotype. Furthermore, the Eomes- population was shown to linearly decrease with age, while the Eomes+ population exhibited more senescence-associated characteristics, such as CD57 expression and loss of CD28. CONCLUSION Overall, the KIR+NKG2A + Eomes- CD8+ T-cell population shares similar characteristics with the Eomes+ population, although with a lower degree of differentiation, lower senescence marker expression, and a proportional decrease with age. Thus, we suspect that KIR+NKG2A + Eomes-CD8+ T cells may represent a less differentiated stage of the NK-like CD8+ T-cell subset.","output":"Characterization of KIR + NKG2A + Eomes- NK-like CD8+ T cells and their decline with age in healthy individuals."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Initial local and global evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who undergo surgery, and those who become infected perioperatively, have an increased mortality risk post surgery. Objectives. To analyse and describe the 30-day mortality, presurgical COVID-19 status and hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of patients, both SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative, undergoing orthopaedic surgery at a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa (SA) during the first COVID-19 peak. Methods. This single-centre, observational, prospective study included patients who underwent orthopaedic procedures from 1 April 2020 (beginning of the COVID-19 case increase in SA) to 31 July 2020 (first COVID-19 peak in SA). All patients were screened for COVID-19 and were confirmed positive if they had a positive laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on a nasopharyngeal or oral swab. Thirty-day mortality, presurgical COVID-19 status and hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed. Results. Overall, a total of 433 operations were performed on 346 patients during the timeframe. Of these patients, 65.9% (n=228) were male and 34.1% (n=118) were female. The mean (standard deviation) age was 42.5 (16.8) years (range 9 - 89). Of the patients, 5 (1.4%) were identified as COVID-19 patients under investigation (PUI) on admission and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before surgery, and 1 (0.3%) contracted SARS-CoV-2 perioperatively;all survived 30 days post surgery. Twenty-nine patients were lost to follow-up, and data were missing for 6 patients. The final analysis was performed excluding these 35 patients. Of the 311 patients included in the final 30-day mortality analysis, 303 (97%) had a follow-up observation 30 days after the operation. The overall 30-day mortality for these patients was 2.5% (n=8 deaths). None of the recorded deaths were of screened COVID-19 PUI. Conclusions. We report a low 30-day mortality rate of 2.5% (n=8) for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery at our hospital during the first COVID-19 peak. None of the deaths were COVID-19 related, and all patients who tested SARS-CoV-2-positive, before or after surgery, survived. Our overall 30-day mortality rate correlates with several other reports of orthopaedic centres analysing over similar timeframes during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding mortality and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, we can conclude that with the appropriate measures taken, it was safe to undergo orthopaedic procedures at our hospital during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in SA.","output":"Low 30-day mortality in South African orthopaedic patients undergoing surgery at an academic hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: It was safe to perform orthopaedic procedures at our hospital during the first COVID-19 peak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel thiazolopyrimidine nucleoside, 5-amino-3-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,7(3H,6H) -dione (7-thia-8-oxoguanosine), was evaluated for antiviral activity in rodent models, and at 50-200 mg/kg prevented death in mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with Semliki Forest, San Angelo, and banzi viruses when administered i.p. before virus challenge.

This study aimed to explore family members' concerns for their relatives during the lockdown period, assess their level of acceptance of the visiting restriction policy and determine the associated factors. METHODS From the 156 family members interviewed, demographic data, satisfaction with overall care quality, worry and concerns for their relatives, acceptance of the visiting restriction and arrangement for the residents if cluster infections occur in the facility were recorded. RESULTS Among the members interviewed, 83 (53.2%) were men; mean age of members was 56.3  9.8; most were offspring of residents in the facility (n = 121, 77.6%), most visited the residents at least once a week (n = 113, 72.4%) before the lockdown. The most common concerns of the family members for their relatives were psychological stress (38.5%), followed by nursing care (26.9%) and daily activity (21.1%). Nearly 84.6% of those interviewed accepted the visiting restriction policy, and a higher satisfaction rating independently associated with acceptance of the visiting restriction policy (odds ratio 2.15).

Our objective was to systematically review the studies reporting the time of onset of selected skin lesions with respect to the reported onset of the COVID-19 core symptoms. METHODS: A comprehensive search of studies published before 21 January 2021 was performed on MEDLINE via PubMed database using a predefined strategy to identify relevant articles. RESULTS: Out of 354 references, 87 were selected, reporting a total of 895 patients with skin lesions associated with COVID-19. The most frequent pattern was exanthema (n = 430, 48%), followed by vascular (n = 299, 33%), urticarial (n = 105, 12%) and others (n = 66, 7%). Skin lesions occurred more frequently in the first 4 weeks from the COVID-19 onset (n = 831, 92%), whereas prodromal or late lesions were rarer (n = 69, 8%). The urticarial and exanthema patterns were more frequent in the first 2 weeks. About the vascular pattern some differences were noted among its subtypes. Livedoid lesions occurred mainly in the first 2 weeks, while chilblain-like lesions between weeks 2 and 4. Purpuric/petechial lesions were equally distributed during the first 4 weeks. Several skin manifestations did not fall into the pattern classification, including erythema multiforme, generalized pruritus, Kawasaki disease and others.

Innovative crisis management, such as cluster tracking, risk group testing, georeferencing, or the integration of wastewater surveillance recommended by the EU Commission, was made significantly more difficult. AIM: In this case study in Berchtesgadener Land, we present the integration of an area-wide georeferenced wastewater surveillance system that captured 95% of the entire population since November 2020. METHODOLOGY: Sampling occurred twice a week at nine municipal wastewater treatment plants and directly from the main sewer at three locations. Samples were pre-treated by centrifugation and subsequently analyzed by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting four specific genes of SARS-CoV?2. RESULTS: The integration of an area-wide georeferenced wastewater surveillance system was successful. Wastewater occurrences are plotted for each municipality against cumulative infections over seven days per 100,000 inhabitants. Changes in the infection pattern in individual communities are noticeable ten days ahead of the official case numbers with a sensitivity of approximately 20 in 100,000 inhabitants.

DESIGN: A longitudinal, prospective 2-year cohort study conducted between September 2013 and April 2015. SETTING: Medical students from a university school of medicine in Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: One voluntary cohort of undergraduate medical students in clerkships was invited to participate. Among 190 medical students recruited in September 2013, a total of 124 students provided written informed consent. Participants were free to decide whether to complete each survey; therefore, varying numbers of responses were obtained during the study period. Those who responded to our survey for more than 6 months were included in our analyses. Overall, 2128 responses from 94 medical students were analysed, with each student providing an average of 23 responses for 2 years. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Burn-out was measured using the Professional Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS: Our study found that a strong NWLB was related to high burn-out levels among medical students during their clerkships (p<0.001). However, the gender of the student had no effect on this relationship (p>0.05). In addition, our study indicated that medical students living with a companion had decreased burn-out levels than did those living alone during their clerkships. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of policies promoting employee workClife balance should be emphasised because of the potential for social contagion effects on medical students. Clerkship trainees might be vulnerable to such negative contagion effects during the transition to their early clinical workplace training and may, therefore, require advanced socialisation and mentoring.","output":"Relationship between medical students negative perceptions of colleagues workClife and burn-out during clerkships: a longitudinal observational cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As a harm reduction-focused primary care clinic for people who use drugs, the Respectful and Equitable Access to Comprehensive Healthcare (REACH) Program faced multiple barriers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe and evaluate how the telemedicine-driven adaptations REACH made allowed the program to engage its patients. Methods: REACH expanded its telemedicine capabilities by transitioning its in-person clinic and methods of connecting with referrals to telemedicine. The program provided patients with phones to increase access to needed technology. Results: Throughout 2020, patient visits continuously shifted from being entirely in-person, to entirely telemedicine, to a hybrid model. Clinic show rates averaged 71% with this hybrid model, compared with 57% pre-COVID-19. Phones were distributed to 88 patients, 77% of which engaged in at least one telemedicine visit. Conclusions: Telemedicine allowed REACH to provide uninterrupted care during the pandemic.

However, emerging pathogens could pose future threats, particularly those with blood-borne stages that are resistant to viral-inactivation steps in the manufacturing process, such as non-lipid-coated viruses. As outlined in this Review, better understanding of infectious diseases allows challenges from newly described agents of potential concern in the future to be anticipated, but the processes of zoonotic transmission and genetic selection or modification ensure that plasma-derived products will continue to be subject to infectious concerns. Manufacturers of plasma-derived CFC have addressed the issue of emerging infectious agents by developing recombinant products that limit the need for human plasma during production. Such recombinant products have extended the safety profile of their predecessors by ensuring that all reagents used for cell culture, purification steps, and stabilisation and storage buffers are completely independent of human plasma.","output":"Clinical perspectives of emerging pathogens in bleeding disorders."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To investigate the immunological characteristics of the cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing City. METHODS Clinical data of 1291 patients with SARS from March to July 2003 in Beijing City were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In patients with SARS, the absolute numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes and CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) lymphocyte subsets decreased during the early period of the disease, being manifested in 56.91%, 88.26%, 47.96%, 45.56% and 41.10% of the patients, respectively. During the first 3 days the median numbers of CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) were 425 x 10(6)/L, 223 x 10(6)/L, 170 x 10(6)/L, respectively, being the lowest values in the course of the disease. During the second week the corresponding numbers were 536 x 10(6)/L, 267 x 10(6)/L, 224 x 10(6)/L, respectively; they returned to normal by the fourth week (P < 0.05), showing a trend of gradual increase during the disease progression. Comparison of different time points of the same cases also showed that CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) were lowest in the first 1 - 3 days. The median number of CD(3) was higher (954 x 10(6)/L) during week 3, and there was no significant difference among other 3 weeks (P > 0.05). In the early period of the disease the CRP increased but ESR, C(3) and C(4) were still in normal ranges. CONCLUSIONS In the early period of SARS, the WBC, lymphocytes, CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) lymphocyte subsets decreased remarkably, and they tended to increase as the disease progressed. Simultaneous decreases in CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) during the first week is a characteristic immunological change, which may facilitate the early diagnosis of SARS.","output":"[Immunological characteristics of 1291 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Beijing]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are commonly used drugs in the treatment of malaria as well as chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although various reports on possible psychiatric side effects of these drugs exist, the nature and extent of these effects remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relevance of these drugs in the treatment of early stages of COVID-19 necessitates a careful estimation of their side effects. Here, we provide a systematic review of the psychiatric side effects associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to identify relevant literature published between 1962 and 2020. Search terms included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Only case reports and clinical trials were included. All studies included records of psychiatric side effects induced by either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or both. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized as well as non-randomized population studies were included. Overall, the psychiatric side effects are dose- and sex-independent. The most common psychiatric side effects reported are increased speech output/ excessive talking, increased psychomotor activity, irritable mood, auditory hallucinations, delusion of grandiosity, and suicide attempts, likely due to brain intoxicationbe of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The symptoms can develop in a few hours to 11 weeks after drug intake and are normally reversed within a week after the drug withdrawal. We conclude that CQ and HCQ have the potential to induce psychiatric side effects.

Pre-calving vaccination programme (PVP) against the most common diarrhea-causing pathogens could help to avoid this threat if hyperimmune transition milk (TM) is fed to calves throughout the whole susceptibility period. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to reveal the implementation practices of PVPs in large commercial dairy farms and to compare calf-level mortality hazards during the first year of vaccination (V+ period) and a year before implementing the vaccination programme (V- period). A questionnaire was filled out in 15 large-scale dairy farms in Estonia that used PVP. The farms were assigned into three groups based on compliance with the vaccine directions for use and TM feeding practices. Calf-level time-to-event data was analyzed with an observation period of 21 days and on-farm mortality due to diarrhea being the event of interest. RESULTS: During the V+ period, a significant decline in diarrhea-induced calf mortality was identified in three out of six herds that followed vaccination instructions and fed TM for at least 14 days. On average, calf mortality hazard due to diarrhea decreased among these herds (hazard rate ratio (HR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63; 0.81). In the group of correctly vaccinating herds where TM was fed for less than 14 days, diarrhea-induced calf mortality decreased in two herds and remained unchanged in two herds with average diarrhea-induced calf mortality hazard declining significantly during the vaccination period (HR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.14; 0.41). Among the three farms that deviated from the vaccination instructions, the average calf mortality hazard increased in the V+ period (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.21; 2.14). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that implementing a PVP might aid to reduce diarrhea-induced calf mortality in large commercial dairy farms. There is a need to increase veterinarians and farmers awareness about the importance of including pregnant heifers into the vaccination programme and emphasize the importance of prolonged feeding of hyperimmune TM to calves.

It was clear that the influence COVID-19 epidemic on the global market economy has increased operational risks for businesses. The semiconductor industry has high operating risks and financial risks. Moderate financial flexibility (FF) can improve the ability of semiconductor enterprises to acquire financial resources in real time, calmly cope with the impact of uncertainties in operation, improve investment opportunities, and enhance sustainable operation. It is therefore interesting to study the influence of FF on enterprise risk-taking (ERT). Purpose of the article: The aim of the contribution is to explore the effect of FF on ERT within Taiwans semiconductor industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic period, and investigate whether ERT varies with semiconductor industry characteristic. Methods: Data from first three quarters of 2020, from multinational semiconductor firms listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE), were collected and analyzed. Fixed effects regression with heteroscedasticity adjustment used to evaluate the influence of FF on the ERT of Taiwans semiconductor industry. Furthermore, in order to corroborate and support the reliability of the results, this research also used the different measures of ERT and Quantile regression (median regression) in the research model to check the robustness. Findings & value added: Empirical results indicate that FF has a U-shaped effect on ERT for multinational semiconductor firms listed on the TSE, particularly within the integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing industry. Additionally, FF also has a U-shaped effect on ERT for the asset-light semiconductor and IC manufacturing industries. This article also suggests that for the asset-light semiconductor and IC manufacturing industries, the optimal inflection points are 1.1397 and 0.9729, respectively. Based on the consequences of this study, it is suggested that Taiwans semiconductor industry should reasonably maintain FF and focus on the liquidity risk management for the long term value added, even after the COVID-19 pandemic period. ? 2021 Nicolaus Copernicus University.

This literature review aims to understand the impact of patients' disease on family members across all medical specialities, and appraise existing generic and disease-specific family quality of life (QoL) measures. METHODS: The databases Medline, EMBASE, CINHAL, ASSIA, PsycINFO and Scopus were searched for original articles in English measuring the impact of health conditions on patients' family members/partner using a valid instrument. RESULTS: Of 114 articles screened, 86 met the inclusion criteria. They explored the impact of a relative's disease on 14,661 family members, mostly 'parents' or 'mothers', using 50 different instruments across 18 specialities including neurology, oncology and dermatology, in 33 countries including the USA, China and Australia. These studies revealed a huge impact of patients' illness on family members. An appraisal of family QoL instruments identified 48 instruments, 42 disease/speciality specific and six generic measures. Five of the six generics are aimed at carers of children, people with disability or restricted to chronic disease. The only generic instrument that measures the impact of any condition on family members across all specialities is the Family Reported Outcome Measure (FROM-16). Although most instruments demonstrated good reliability and validity, only 11 reported responsiveness and only one reported the minimal clinically important difference. CONCLUSIONS: Family members' QoL is greatly impacted by a relative's condition. To support family members, there is a need for a generic tool that offers flexibility and brevity for use in clinical settings across all areas of medicine.

Unfortunately, these agents also block NTCP transport of bile acids into hepatocytes, and thus have the potential to cause adverse effects. We aimed to identify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCP transporter function. METHODS: We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for their anti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed. RESULTS: We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with a sub-micromolar IC(50). Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets. This suggested that instead, these compounds interacted directly with NTCP to inhibit viral attachment to host cells, and have no immunosuppressive function. Importantly, we found that SCY450 and SCY995 did not impair the NTCP-dependent uptake of bile acids, and inhibited multiple HBV genotypes including a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first example of small molecule selective inhibition of HBV entry with no decrease in NTCP transporter activity. It suggests that the anti-HBV activity can be functionally separated from bile acid transport. These broadly active anti-HBV molecules are potential candidates for developing new drugs with fewer adverse effects. LAY SUMMARY: In this study, we identified new compounds that selectively inhibited hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry, and did not impair bile acid uptake. Our evidence offers a new strategy for developing anti-HBV drugs with fewer side effects.","output":"Cyclosporin derivatives inhibit hepatitis B virus entry without interfering with NTCP transporter activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rsum Objectifs Durant lpidmie de Covid-19, laccs au diagnostic et aux soins des pathologies relevant de laudiologie mdicale a rgress en France, posant un risque de perte de chance pour le patient.

Given the near universal D-dimer elevation in critically ill patients with COVID-19, the PF1.2 may be a more specific marker to identify thrombotic complications. Methods: We studied hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and PF1.2 measurement performed at any point during hospitalization. We evaluated the relationship between PF1.2 and synchronously measured D-dimer. We utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate optimal thresholds for diagnosing thrombosis and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with thrombosis. Thresholds for each assay for multivariable regression were determined from ROC analysis. To avoid confounding of therapeutic anticoagulation on PF1.2 or D-dimer measurement, patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation at the time of assay measurement were excluded from these analyses. Results: Patients and Thrombotic Events. 115 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included [110 (95.7%) critically ill], encompassing 3318 patient-days (474 patient-weeks) analyzed for thrombotic and critical illness complications. At the data cutoff date, 74 patients (64.3%) had been discharged from the hospital alive, 24 patients (20.9%) died in the hospital, and 17 patients (14.8%) remained hospitalized, having been hospitalized for a median of 44 (range, 30-62) days. Over a median follow-up of 29 (range, 2-62) hospital days, 26 patients developed radiographically-confirmed VTE (22.6%, a rate of 5.49 per 100 patient-weeks); including arterial, extracorporeal circuit, and recurrent line thrombosis, 56 patients (48.7%) developed a thrombotic complication. At the time of PF1.2 and synchronous D-dimer measurement, 37 patients (32.1%) were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, 77 patients (67.0%) were receiving prophylactic anticoagulation, and 1 patient (0.9%) was not receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Association of PF1.2 with D-dimer. Synchronously measured PF1.2 and D-dimer were moderately positively correlated (r=0.542, P<0.001, Figure 1) but significant discordance was observed in elevation of each marker above the laboratory reference range (59.0% patients with elevated PF1.2 vs. 98.5% elevated D-dimer). Association of PF1.2 with Hypercoagulability. Median PF1.2 levels were higher in patients with thrombosis than those without (611 vs. 374 pmol/L, P=0.006, Figure 2). Therapeutic anticoagulation suppressed median PF1.2 levels: median (IQR) PF1.2 in patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (N=29) was 611 pmol/L (333-1148 pmol/L), significantly higher than the median (IQR) PF1.2 in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation (N=27) of 347 pmol/L (195-506 pmol/L), P=0.0017. ROC and Multivariable Regression Analyses. In ROC analysis, PF1.2 had superior specificity and conferred a higher positive likelihood ratio in identifying patients with thrombosis than did the D-dimer (PF1.2 threshold of >523 pmol/L: 69.2% sensitivity, 67.7% specificity; >924 pmol/L: 37.9% sensitivity, 87.8% specificity, Figure 3). In multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, and BMI, a PF1.2 >500 pmol/L was significantly associated with VTE [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.26, 95% CI, 1.12-16.21, P=0.034] and any thrombotic manifestation (adjusted OR 3.85, 95% CI, 1.39-10.65, P=0.010); conversely, synchronously measured D-dimer >2,500 ng/mL was not significantly associated with VTE (OR 5.91, 95% CI, 0.69-50.56, P=0.11) or any thrombotic manifestation (OR 2.47, 95% CI, 0.78-7.78, P=0.12). The vast majority (90.6%) of patients with a non-elevated PF1.2 result did not develop VTE and 75% did not develop any thrombotic complication. Conclusions: When measured at any point during hospitalization in patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, PF1.2 was more specific than synchronously measured D-dimer in identifying patients who experienced thrombosis and was significantly associated with thrombotic manifestations in multivariable analyses while the D-dimer was not. PF1.2 may be a useful assay, and potentially more discriminant than D-dimer, in identifying thrombotic manifestations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: We tested the effectiveness of the BETTER HEALTH intervention, a public health adaptation of BETTER, at improving participation in chronic disease prevention and screening actions for residents of low-income neighbourhoods in a cluster randomized trial, with ten low-income neighbourhoods in Durham Region Ontario randomized to immediate intervention vs. wait-list. The unit of analysis was the individual, and eligible participants were adults age 40C64 years residing in the neighbourhoods. Public health nurses trained as prevention practitioners held one prevention-focused visit with each participant. They provided participants with a tailored prevention prescription and supported them to set health-related goals. The primary outcome was a composite index: the number of evidence-based actions achieved at six months as a proportion of those for which participants were eligible at baseline. RESULTS: Of 126 participants (60 in immediate arm; 66 in wait-list arm), 125 were included in analyses (1 participant withdrew consent). In both arms, participants were eligible for a mean of 8.6 actions at baseline. At follow-up, participants in the immediate intervention arm met 64.5% of actions for which they were eligible versus 42.1% in the wait-list arm (rate ratio 1.53 [95% confidence interval 1.22C1.84]). CONCLUSION: Public health nurses using the BETTER HEALTH intervention led to a higher proportion of identified evidence-based prevention and screening actions achieved at six months for people living with socioeconomic disadvantage.

We hypothesize that standard 5-mm laparoscopic trocars may be a safe and more effective alternative. METHODS Thirty episodes of tPTX and 27 episodes of tension-induced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) were induced in five adult swine using thoracic CO2 insufflation via balloon trocar. Tension was defined as a 50% decrease in cardiac output. Chest decompression was performed with 5-mm laparoscopic trocars for the treatment of both tPTX with hemodynamic compromise and tension-induced PEA. The lungs and heart were inspected and graded at necropsy for trocar-related injury. Results were also compared with success rates with NT in the same model. RESULTS The placement of a 5-mm trocar rapidly and immediately relieved tension physiology in 100% of the cases. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure all returned to baseline within 1 minute of trocar placement. Adequate perfusion was restored in 100% of tension-induced PEA cases within 30 seconds of trocar placement. There was no evidence of trocar-related heart or lung damage in any of the experimental animals at necropsy (mean injury scores, 0 for both). Five-millimeter trocars significantly outperformed standard NT for both tPTX and tension-induced PEA arrest. CONCLUSION tPTX and tension-induced PEA can be safely and effectively treated with chest decompression using 5-mm laparoscopic trocars. This technique may serve as a more rapid and reliable alternative to needle decompression.","output":"Standard laparoscopic trocars for the treatment of tension pneumothorax: a superior alternative to needle decompression."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a complex disease with a multifaceted set of disturbances involving several mechanisms of health and disease in the human body. Sex hormones, estrogen, and testosterone, seem to play a major role in its pathogenesis, development, spread, severity, and mortalities. Examination of factors such as age, gender, ethnic background, genetic prevalence, and existing co-morbidities, may disclose the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity, and mortality, paving the way for COVID-19 amelioration and substantial flattening of the infection curve. In this mini-review, we focus on the role of testosterone through a discussion of the intricate mechanisms of disease development and deterioration. Accumulated evidence suggests that there are links between high level (normal male level) as well as low level (age-related hypogonadism) testosterone in disease progression and expansion, supporting its role as a double-edged sword.

According to predictions from the United Nations, more than 2.7 billion people will be challenged by water scarcity by the middle of the century. The water industry is increasingly interested in desalination of the sea, ocean, and brackish water. Desalination processes are widely classified as thermal or membrane technologies. In the Middle East, thermal desalination remains the primary technology of choice, but membrane processes, for example reverse osmosis (RO), have evolved rapidly and in many other parts of the world are currently even surpassing thermal processes. The purpose of this paper is to review the renewable energy source, the technology, desalination systems, and their possible integration with renewable energy resources and their cost. This article suggests that the most practical renewable desalination techniques to be used are the solar photovoltaic integrated RO desalination process, the hybrid solar photovoltaic-wind integrated RO desalination process, the hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) integrated RO desalination process, and the hybrid solar photovoltaic-thermal effect distillation (PVT-MED) desalination process.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of UGCB driven by FDG-avid SLNs, as performed by nuclear medicine physicians, in patients with suspected lung cancer. Methods: Institutional database in our hospital was searched for eligible patients between September 2019 and March 2021. A 3-12 MHz linear probe was used to guide the biopsy process and to ensure that the needle tip was being directed at the metabolically active area that had been indicated by side-by-side PET/CT images. Diagnostic yield, malignancy rate, molecular testing results, and complications were reviewed. Results: Among the 54 patients included in this study, definite pathological diagnosis from UGCB specimens was achieved in 53 patients, reaching a diagnostic yield of 98.1% (53/54) and a malignancy rate of 96.2% (51/53). Among the 50 patients confirmed as lung cancer, thirty-eight were spared from further invasive procedures which had been planned. Molecular analyses were adequately performed on all the 38 specimens obtained from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLS). The positive rate was 36.8% (14/38) for epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) mutation and 31.6% (12/38) for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation. 28.9% (11/38) of the patients had a tumor proportion score (TPS)  50% for PD-L1 expression. No complication was observed and the average biopsy time was 15 min. Conclusions: Nuclear medicine physicians-performed UGCB driven by FDG-avid SLNs in suspected lung cancer patients could produce a high performance in terms of diagnostic yield, malignancy rate, and molecular analysis, which may obliviate more invasive interventional procedures and lead to fast decisions on subsequent management.","output":"Performance of Ultrasound-Guided Core Biopsy Driven by FDG-avid Supraclavicular Lymph Nodes in Patients With Suspected Lung Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pelvic traumatic and iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms supplied by the internal iliac artery are very rare but can present with pain, nerve compression, and rupture.

The other 60 non-CI healthy patients underwent physical examination were selected as the healthy group. The serum levels of miRNA-124 and miRNA-210 were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS The levels of serum miRNA-124 and miRNA-210 as well as the inflammatory molecules Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the peripheral blood of the case group were higher than those in the healthy group (P<0.05).

A skewed distribution where few individuals or events are responsible for the majority of transmission can result in explosive, superspreading events, which produce rapid and volatile epidemic dynamics, especially early or late in epidemics. Anticipating and preventing superspreading events can produce large reductions in overall transmission rates. Here, we present a compartmental (SEIR) epidemiological model framework for estimating transmission parameters from multiple imperfectly observed data streams, including reported cases, deaths, and mobile phone-based mobility that incorporates individual-level heterogeneity in transmission using previous estimates for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. We parameterize the model for COVID-19 epidemic dynamics by estimating a time-varying transmission rate that incorporates the impact of non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies that change over time, in five epidemiologically distinct settingsLos Angeles and Santa Clara Counties, California; Seattle (King County), Washington; Atlanta (Dekalb and Fulton Counties), Georgia; and Miami (Miami-Dade County), Florida. We find the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] dropped below 1 rapidly following social distancing orders in mid-March, 2020 and remained there into June in Santa Clara County and Seattle, but climbed above 1 in late May in Los Angeles, Miami, and Atlanta, and has trended upward in all locations since April. With the fitted model, we ask: how does truncating the tail of the individual-level transmission rate distribution affect epidemic dynamics and control? We find interventions that truncate the transmission rate distribution while partially relaxing social distancing are broadly effective, with impacts on epidemic growth on par with the strongest population-wide social distancing observed in April, 2020. Given that social distancing interventions will be needed to maintain epidemic control until a vaccine becomes widely available, chopping off the tail to reduce the probability of superspreading events presents a promising option to alleviate the need for extreme general social distancing.","output":"Chopping the tail: how preventing superspreading can help to maintain COVID-19 control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The high prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), its morbidity and mortality continue to fare a huge burden in the intensive care unit. More than 40 years ago, experimental studies have highlighted that, albeit essential, mechanical ventilation could be harmful to lungs and more recently to the diaphragm. Despite life-saving advances in mechanical ventilation (such as low tidal-volume ventilation, neuromuscular blockers agents, or prone positioning), a recent international observational study reported that most ARDS patients were not appropriately monitored. The monitoring capabilities of ventilators, in particular the simple interaction of the patient and the mechanical ventilation, are very powerful but are underutilized. This lack of monitoring may contribute to the persisting poor outcome of patients with ARDS. Providing a more careful ventilation is a priority to improve patients' outcomes. To achieve this goal, it is of paramount importance to better understand the complex relationship between the patient and the ventilator: the impact of ventilator settings on lungs during passive controlled ventilation, but also of patient's breathing efforts on lungs during assisted ventilation. In this review we present available tools to monitor respiratory mechanics at the bedside aiming at optimizing and personalizing mechanical ventilation.

Two hybrid AI models from the COVLIAS system, namely, VGG-SegNet (HDL 1) and ResNet-SegNet (HDL 2), were used to segment the CT lungs. As part of the results, we compared both COVLIAS and MedSeg against two manual delineations (MD 1 and MD 2) using (i) BlandCAltman plots, (ii) Correlation coefficient (CC) plots, (iii) Receiver operating characteristic curve, and (iv) Figure of Merit and (v) visual overlays.

The consequent inflammation is not able to clear viruses. The persistent excessive inflammatory response can build up a clinical picture that is very difficult to manage and potentially fatal. Modulating the immune response plays a key role in fighting the disease. One of the main defence systems is the activation of neutrophils that release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) under the stimulus of autophagy. Various molecules can induce NETosis and autophagy; some potent activators are damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and, in particular, the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). This molecule is released by damaged lung cells and can induce a robust innate immunity response. The increase in HMGB1 and NETosis could lead to sustained inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, blocking these molecules might be useful in COVID-19 treatment and should be further studied in the context of targeted therapy.","output":"Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs): Two Potential Targets for COVID-19 Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Sepsis and meningitis are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Neonatal sepsis caused ~400 000 deaths globally in 2015, half occurring in Africa. Despite this, there are few published data on the acute costs of neonatal sepsis or meningitis, with none in SSA. METHODS: We enrolled neonates admitted to 2 hospitals in South Africa and Mozambique between 16 April 2020 and 1 April 2021. In South Africa all cases were microbiologically confirmed, but in Mozambique both clinically suspected and microbiologically confirmed cases were included. Data were collected on healthcare resource use and length of stay, along with information on household expenditure and caregiving. We used unit costs of healthcare resources in local currencies to estimate healthcare provider costs per patient and costs per household. Results were converted to 2019 international dollars (I$). RESULTS: We enrolled 11 neonates in Mozambique and 18 neonates in South Africa. Mean length of stay was 10 days (median, 9 [interquartile range {IQR}, 4C14) and 16 days (median, 15 [IQR, 13C18]), respectively. In Mozambique we estimated mean household costs of I$49.62 (median, 10.19 [IQR, 5.10C95.12]) and hospitalization costs of I$307.58 (median, 275.12 [IQR, 149.43C386.12]).

Untuk mengatasi penyebaran wabah, hampir seluruh dunia menerapkan kebijakan lockdown atau penutupan negara atau kota dari migrasi termasuk pembatasan masuknya barang dan jasa. Krisis kesehatan mengakibatkan terhentinya aktivitas sosial, budaya, keagamaan, pendidikan, bisnis, dll, yang mempengaruhi perekonomian nasional secara signifikan. Untuk mencapai tujuan bersama mengatasi COVID-19, sangat diperlukan kerjasama internasional. Dunia dapat mengatasi krisis ini melalui Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO), yang berfokus mengatasi masalah kesehatan masyarakat dan penyebaran COVID-19. Untuk mengatasi isu keuangan global, kerjasama dapat dilakukan melalui Organisasi keuangan dunia termasuk G-20, yang merupakan kelompok negara-negara yang memiliki perekonomian kuat dan berpengaruh signifikan dalam skala global. Sayangnya kerjasama yang diharapkan belum sepenuhnya berhasil, diakibatkan perbedaan kepentingan, kurangnya koordinasi dan komunikasi diantara negara-negara anggota. Tidak ada satu negarapun yang mengantisipasi munculnya wabah COVID-19 sehingga diperlukan kerjasama internasional yang diawali dengan implementasi diplomasi yang efektif. Tidak saja aktor pemerintah yang terlibat tetapi juga aktor aktor non-pemerintah termasuk media massa.

MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE First, a laparoscopic approach is made using a conventional 5-trocar pneumoperitoneum technique. When the Retzius and paravesical spaces are dissected to expose the tendinous arch of the levator ani muscle, the transperineal approach is synchronously begun. After the levator ani muscle and bilateral puboprostatic ligaments are dissected, the DVC and urethra are completely exposed. A linear stapler is inserted through the transperineal port along the dorsal side of the pubic body. The DVC and urethra are carefully compressed and transected with minimal bleeding. We describe four cases of laparoscopic total pelvic exenteration using this technique. Tumor size, operation time, and estimated blood loss ranged from 30-130 mm, 535-877 minutes, and 50-1520 mL, respectively.

The mechanism for the detection of thymine is demonstrated via the color change of the AuNPs from pink to blue, followed by the shift of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption band to a higher wavelength with the introduction of an analyte. The selective detection of thymine was experimentally verified by performing a control experiment with nucleobases, other biomolecules, metal ions and anions. In addition, the computation density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using the Gaussian (C.01) program highlighted that the electrostatic potential behavior of the thymine molecule facilitated a non-covalent interaction toward gold for the selective detection of analytes, and the computation was also used to calculate a UV-Vis absorption band as well. The calculated absorption band of the AuNPs with thymine, obtained using TD-DFT, was found to be very close to the experimental data. The omnicapped truncated tetrahedral ( 3-tetrahedral) Au20 cluster structure was considered as the model for the AuNP optimization. The linear range obtained for the quantitative determination of thymine was found to be 10-1200 ng mL-1 with a limit of detection of 3 ng mL-1. The advantages of using the AuNPs as a biochemical sensor are that they provide a facile and low cost method and are selective for the qualitative and quantitative determination of thymine in a DNA standard and in urine samples in comparison to chromatographic and electrochemical methods.","output":"Experimental and theoretical approaches for the selective detection of thymine in real samples using gold nanoparticles as a biochemical sensor"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite efforts to enhance enrollment and the merger of national cooperative groups, < 5% of patients with cancer will enroll into a clinical trial.

Persons sharing a dwelling with someone who has COVID-19 have a substantial risk of being exposed to the virus. However, environmental monitoring for the detection of virus in such settings is limited. We present a pilot study on environmental sampling for SARS-CoV-2 virions in the residential rooms of two volunteers with COVID-19 who self-quarantined. Apart from standard surface swab sampling, based on availability, four air samplers positioned 0.3C2.2 m from the volunteers were used: a VIable Virus Aerosol Sampler (VIVAS), an inline air sampler that traps particles on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters, a NIOSH 2-stage cyclone sampler (BC-251), and a Sioutas personal cascade impactor sampler (PCIS). The latter two selectively collect particles of specific size ranges. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time Reverse-Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-qPCR) analyses of particles in one air sample from the room of volunteer A and in various air and surface samples from that of volunteer B. The one positive sample collected by the NIOSH sampler from volunteer A's room had a quantitation cycle (Cq) of 38.21 for the N-gene, indicating a low amount of airborne virus [5.69E-02 SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents (GE)/cm(3) of air]. In contrast, air samples and surface samples collected off the mobile phone in volunteer B's room yielded Cq values ranging from 14.58 to 24.73 and 21.01 to 24.74, respectively, on the first day of sampling, indicating that this volunteer was actively shedding relatively high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 at that time. The SARS-CoV-2 GE/cm(3) of air for the air samples collected by the PCIS was in the range 6.84E+04 to 3.04E+05 using the LED-N primer system, the highest being from the stage 4 filter, and similarly, ranged from 2.54E+03 to 1.68E+05 GE/cm(3) in air collected by the NIOSH sampler. Attempts to isolate the virus in cell culture from the samples from volunteer B's room with the aforementioned Cq values were unsuccessful due to out-competition by a co-infecting Human adenovirus B3 (HAdVB3) that killed the Vero E6 cell cultures within 4 days of their inoculation, although Cq values of 34.56C37.32 were measured upon rRT-qPCR analyses of vRNA purified from the cell culture medium. The size distribution of SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosol particles collected from the air of volunteer B's room was >0.25 m and >0.1 m as recorded by the PCIS and the NIOSH sampler, respectively, suggesting a risk of aerosol transmission since these particles can remain suspended in air for an extended time and travel over long distances. The detection of virus in surface samples also underscores the potential for fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor settings.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 in residential rooms of two self-isolating persons with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infection with COVID-19 can result in silent transmission to large numbers of individuals, resulting in expansion of the pandemic with a global increase in morbidity and mortality. New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. HYPOTHESIS: A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID- 19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine alone, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including Vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and cytokine storm syndrome with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappa B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID 19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: a three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with hydroxychloroquine and/or ivermetin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NFKappaB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/ or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil.

Circulating levels of the coagulation cascade activator PAI-1 are substantially higher in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory dysfunction than in patients with bacterial-sepsis and ARDS. Indeed, the elevation of PAI-1 is recognized as an early marker of endothelial dysfunction. Here, we report that recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S1 stimulated robust production of PAI-1 by HPMEC. We examined the role of protein degradation in this SARS-CoV-2-S1 induction of PAI-1 and found that the proteasomal degradation inhibitor bortezomib inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S1 mediated changes in PAI-1. Our data further show that bortezomib upregulated KLF2, a shear-stress-regulated transcription factor that suppresses PAI-1 expression. Aging and metabolic disorders are known to increase the mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients. We therefore examined the role of ZMPSTE24, a metalloprotease with a demonstrated role in host defense against RNA viruses that is decreased in the elderly and in metabolic syndrome, in the induction of PAI-1 in HPMEC by SARS-CoV-2-S1. Indeed, overexpression of ZMPSTE24 blunted enhancement of PAI-1 production in spike protein-exposed HPMEC. Additionally, we found that membrane expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 was reduced by ZMPSTE24-mediated cleavage and shedding of the ACE2 ectodomain, leading to accumulation of ACE2 decoy fragments that may bind SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that decreases in ZMPSTE24 with age and comorbidities may increase vulnerability to vascular endothelial injury by SARS-CoV-2 viruses and that enhanced production of endothelial PAI-1 might play role in prothrombotic events in COVID-19 patients.

Despite the efforts made by researchers and pharmaceutical companies, the cryptic information related to the biological and physiological onset mechanisms, as well as the complexity in identifying specific pharmacological targets, make it almost impossible to find effective treatments. Furthermore, because of complex ethical and economic aspects, it is usually hard to find all the necessary resources when searching for drugs for new orphan diseases. In this context, computational methods, based either on receptors or ligands, share the capability to improve the success rate when searching and selecting potential candidates for further experimentation and, consequently, reduce the number of resources and time taken when delivering a new drug to the market. In the present work, a computational strategy based on Molecular Topology, a mathematical paradigm capable of relating the chemical structure of a molecule to a specific biological or pharmacological property by means of numbers, is presented. The result was the creation of a reliable and accessible tool to help during the early in silico stages in the identification and repositioning of potential hits for ALS treatment, which can also apply to other orphan diseases. Considering that further computational and experimental results will be required for the final identification of viable hits, three linear discriminant equations combined with molecular docking simulations on specific proteins involved in ALS are reported, along with virtual screening of the Drugbank database as a practical example.

The Italian Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (SIGO), and the Multicenter Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer and gynecologic malignancies (MITO) promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of gynecologist oncologists and to assess the implementation of containment measures against COVID-19 diffusion. METHODS: The survey consisted of a self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaire. The survey was sent via email to all the members of the SIGO, and MITO groups on April 7, 2020, and was closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 604 participants completed the questionnaire with a response-rate of 70%. The results of this survey suggest that gynecologic oncology units had set a proactive approach to COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: We evaluated the correspondence between P ETCO2 /P aCO2 and the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) measured in 561 subjects with ARDS from a previous study in whom P ETCO2 data were also available. Subjects also were analyzed according to 4 ranges of P ETCO2 /P aCO2 representing increasing illness severity (&#8805; 0.80, 0.6-0.79, 0.50-0.59, and < 0.50). Correlation was assessed by either Pearson or Spearman tests, grouped comparisons were assessed using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests and dichotomous variables assessed by Fisher Exact tests. Normally distributed data are presented as mean and standard deviation(SD) and non-normal data are presented as median and inter-quartile range (IQR). Overall mortality risk was assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS: P ETCO2 /P aCO2 correlated strongly with VD/VT (r = -0.87 [95% CI -0.89 to -0.85], P < .001). Decreasing P ETCO2 /P aCO2 was associated with increased VD/VT and hospital mortality between all groups. In the univariate analysis, for every 0.01 decrease in P ETCO2 /P aCO2 , mortality risk increased by a1% (odds ratio 0.009, 95% CI 0.003-0.029, P < .001) and maintained a strong independent association with mortality risk when adjusted for other variables (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.91, P = .039).

The lack of a clinically approved vaccine or drug remains the biggest bottleneck in combating the pandemic. Drug repurposing can expedite the process of drug development by identifying known drugs which are effective against SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a promising drug target due to its indispensable role in viral multiplication inside the host. In the present study an E-pharmacophore hypothesis was generated using a crystal structure of the viral protease in complex with an imidazole carbaximide inhibitor. Drugs available in the superDRUG2 database were used to identify candidate drugs for repurposing. The hits obtained from the pharmacophore based screening were further screened using a structure based approach involving molecular docking at different precisions. The binding energies of the most promising compounds were estimated using MM-GBSA. The stability of the interactions between the selected drugs and the target were further explored using molecular dynamics simulation at 100 ns.

RESULTS Overall perioperative outcomes, including operation time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, length of the resected specimen, and complications, were similar between the two procedures, whereas postoperative pain was significantly lower with SLC. Operation time for right-sided SLC was significantly shortened. SLC with CME was completed successfully in 94 % (65/69) of right-sided cases and in 88 % (71/81) of left-sided cases. Conversion rates were 1.4 % (1/69) and 1.1 % (1/81), respectively. The umbilical scars were nearly invisible 3 months after the procedure, and most patients reported being quite satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS SLC with CME for colon cancer is feasible when performed by experienced surgeons in selected patients. Excellent cosmesis and reduced postoperative pain as well as oncologic clearance can be expected. A large-scale, prospective, randomized, controlled trial should be conducted to confirm the superiority of this procedure over MLC with CME.","output":"Feasibility of single-site laparoscopic colectomy with complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer: a prospective case-control comparison."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundExcess mortality has been used to assess the health impact of COVID-19 across countries. Democracies aim to build trust in government and enable checks and balances on decision-making, which may be useful in a pandemic. On the other hand, democratic governments have been criticised as slow to enforce restrictive policies and being overly influenced by public opinion. This study sought to understand whether strength of democratic governance is associated with the variation in excess mortality observed across countries during the pandemic. MethodsThrough linking open-access datasets we constructed univariable and multivariable linear regression models investigating the association between country EIU Democracy Index (representing strength of democratic governance on a scale of 0 to 10) and excess mortality rates, from February 2020 to May 2021. We stratified our analysis into high-income and low and middle-income country groups and adjusted for several important confounders. ResultsAcross 78 countries, the mean EIU democracy index was 6.74 (range 1.94 to 9.81) and the mean excess mortality rate was 128 per 100,000 (range -55 to 503 per 100,000). A one-point increase in EIU Democracy Index was associated with a decrease in excess mortality of 26.3 per 100,000 (p=0.002), after accounting for COVID-19 cases, age [] 65, gender, prevalence of cardiovascular disease, universal health coverage and the strength of early government restrictions. This association was particularly strong in high-income countries ({beta} -47.5, p<0.001) but non-significant in low and middle-income countries ({beta} -10.8, p=0.40). ConclusionsSocio-political factors related to the way societies are governed have played an important role in mitigating the overall health impact of COVID-19. Given the omission of such considerations from outbreak risk assessment tools, and their particular significance in high-income countries rated most highly by such tools, this study strengthens the case to broaden the scope of traditional pandemic risk assessment.

Our hospitals have reached maximum capacity on several occasions. Because of the need to make beds available to new patients, some patients with severe COVID-19 who were on low flow O2 supplementation have been discharged home prior to completion of the standard ( 5-day) RDV course. To date, data are limited regarding clinical outcomes on these patients. Because of this, we conducted a retrospective study to assess the clinical outcomes of patients who received an abbreviated treatment course of RDV. Methods Retrospective (chart review) study Subject population All nonpregnant adult patients who were hospitalized at Kaiser Permanente Riverside Medical Center and Kaiser Permanente Moreno Valley Medical Center in 2020 with severe COVID-19 who required low flow O2 supplement during hospitalization who received RDV and discharged from hospital alive. Severe COVID-19 = positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR + evidence of lung involvement on lung imaging (X-ray or CT) + O2 saturation  94% on room air or requirement of O2 supplement.

Patient Section. Results Mortality rate: no difference (2.1% vs 1.8%, p=0.84). 30 day post-discharge ED visit: twice more likely in the abbreviated RDV group as compared to the group receiving the standard duration (16.1% vs 8.5%, p=0.03). 30 day readmission: almost 10 times more likely in the abbreviated RDV group as compared to the group receiving the standard duration (11.9% vs 1.2%, p=< 0.001).

One of the major complications of CF-LVAD is cerebrovascular events(CVE). Limited information is available on this complication in pediatric patients. We hereby present our experience on CVE in children under CF-LVAD support in our institution. METHODS: A retrospective, single center review of 21 patients younger than 19 years of age who underwent CF-LVAD implantation between June 2014 and September 2018 was performed. Patients on biventricular support and extracorporeal device were excluded. Cerebrovascular accidents-ischemic or hemorrhagic-were investigated. CVE was confirmed by brain computed tomographic scan. RESULTS: Of twenty-one pediatric patients, 11 was male. Mean BSA was 1.050.41 m2 and mean age was 11.054.07 years. Dilated cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure. The patients were implanted HeartWare hVAD (n=19), Heartmate II (n=1) and Heartmate III (n=1). Mean support time was 421448(18-1460) days. Target international normalized ratio was between 2.5-3.0.

We examined COVID-19 outcomes of people of various Asian ethnic subgroups and other racial and ethnic groups in an urban safety net hospital system. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 85 328 adults aged 18 tested for COVID-19 at New York City's public hospital system from March 1 through May 31, 2020. We examined COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidities known to worsen COVID-19 outcomes. We conducted adjusted multivariable regression analyses examining racial and ethnic disparities in mortality. RESULTS: Of 9971 Asian patients (11.7% of patients overall), 48.2% were South Asian, 22.2% were Chinese, and 29.6% were in other Asian ethnic groups. South Asian patients had the highest rates of COVID-19 positivity (30.8%) and hospitalization (51.6%) among Asian patients, second overall only to Hispanic (32.1% and 45.8%, respectively) and non-Hispanic Black (27.5% and 57.5%, respectively) patients.

The objective of this work is to assess the incidence of these findings, describe their characteristics and the evolution of suspected patients. Material and methods Oncological PET studies carried out in asymptomatic patients between March 18 and April 8, 2020 have been reviewed. Patients who presented findings suggestive of corresponding to an pulmonary infectious process were selected. Clinical findings have been reviewed to confirm or rule out SARS-CoV2 infection.

METHODS: A self-directed, five-unit online curriculum focused on telemedicine essentials was developed through discussions among Pediatric clinical educators and adapted from literature in telemedicine education. Improvement of communication skills was determined through evaluations of interns randomly assigned to either the telemedicine curriculum or the control group, which was then compared to their baseline encounters. RESULTS: Interns who completed the telemedicine curriculum showed significant improvement in communication scores compared to those who did not complete the curriculum.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition that may ideally suited for the use of telemedicine as initial treatment options are behavioral modification and pharmacotherapy. We sought to evaluate if there was an overall difference in patient follow up rates between telemedicine visits and in-person visits. METHODS: New patients presenting to our clinic with OAB from 7/2020 to 2/2021 were randomized into 2 follow-up groups, telemedicine and in-person visits. After each visit, patients were prompted to complete a survey regarding their visit experience. A prospective database was maintained to compare follow-up rates, satisfaction rates, and time commitment in each group. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were randomized, 24 to the telemedicine group and 22 to the in-person group. There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, Urogenital Distress Inventory-6/Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 scores, or history of telemedicine experience. There was no significant difference in followup rates between the telemedicine and in-person follow-up groups at 30-days (33% vs. 27%, p=0.66), or 60-days (63% vs. 50% p=0.39). Satisfaction rates were extremely high and there was no significant difference between the groups. There was a significant difference between the average telemedicine visit time and in-person visit time (10.88 mins vs. 21.84 mins, p=0.004). For in-person visits, the average travel time was 48 minutes (range 10-90 mins) and average miles traveled was 21 miles (range 5-35 miles). Patients in the telemedicine group reported technical difficulties in 12% of follow-up appointments (N=2). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in followup or satisfaction rates between telemedicine and in-person visits. Inperson visits took half the length of time compared to in-person visits. On average patients in the telemedicine group saved approximately 1 hour per follow-up visit. Telemedicine visits save both the provider and patient significant amounts of time without sacrificing patient satisfaction and follow-up rates.","output":"A randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine versus in-person office visits for the follow-up of overactive bladder"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Nearly half of U.S. women experienced new or worsening health-related socioeconomic risks (HRSRs) (food, housing, utilities and transportation difficulties, and interpersonal violence) early in the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine racial/ethnic disparities in pandemic-related changes in HRSRs among women. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (04/2020) of 3200 women. Pre- and early pandemic HRSRs were described by race/ethnicity. Weighted, multivariable logistic regression models generated odds of incident and worsening HRSRs by race/ethnicity. Results: The majority of Black, East or Southeast (E/SE) Asian, and Hispanic women reported 1 prepandemic HRSR (51%-56% vs. 38% of White women, p < 0.001). By April 2020, 68% of Black, E/SE Asian, and Hispanic women and 55% of White women had 1 HRSR (p < 0.001). For most HRSRs, the odds of an incident or worsening condition were similar across racial/ethnic groups, except Black, E/SE Asian and Hispanic women had 2-3.6 times the odds of incident transportation difficulties compared with White women. E/SE Asian women also had higher odds of worsening transportation difficulties compared with White women (adjusted odds ratios = 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6). In the early pandemic, 1/19 Hispanic, 1/28 E/SE Asian, 1/36 Black and 1/100 White women had all 5 HRSRs (extreme health-related socioeconomic vulnerability). Conclusions: Prepandemic racial/ethnic disparities in HRSRs persisted and prevalence rates increased for all groups early in the pandemic. Disparities in transportation difficulties widened. White women were much less likely than others to experience extreme health-related socioeconomic vulnerability.

PROCEDURE: Medical records of cats diagnosed with endogenous uveitis at North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine (NCSU\\\\CVM) or Animal Eye Care Associates of Cary, NC between 2003 and 2015 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were cats that had complete diagnostic workups, including clinical, clinicopathological, serological, and histopathological data, as well as imaging modalities. Serology was consistently completed for feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty cats met the inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of FeLV (2.7%), FIV (7.3%), FCoV (34.7%), T. gondii (23.7%), and Bartonella spp. (43.2%) was observed, with a combined seroprevalence of 59.2%. Nineteen cats (15.8%) were diagnosed with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) based on clinical, hematological, serological, histopathological, and necropsy findings.

Methods: : This research was a longitudinal study using data from four waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study conducted between 2011 and 2018, and the final sample consisted of 74,381 observations across all four waves of data collection. The present study employed a multiple imputation technique to deal with missing values, and a fixed effects logistic regression model was used for the analysis. Results: : The results of fixed effects logistic regression showed that heavy smokers were 1.2 times more likely to suffer from depressive symptoms than those who never smoked. Compared to those who never smoked, for short-term and moderate-term quitters, the odds of suffering from depressive symptoms increased by 30% and 22%, respectively. The magnitudes of the odds ratios for of the variables short-term quitters, moderate-term quitters, and long-term quitters decreased in absolute terms with increasing time-gaps since quitting.

However, there is currently limited information regarding its molecular characterization in the Republic of Korea (KOR). Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of BCoV in diarrheic pre-weaned calves (aged 60 days) and compared BCoV genome sequences identified globally. A total of 846 fecal samples were collected from calves with diarrhea across 100 beef farms in the KOR. The samples were divided into three groups based on age as follows: 1-10 days (n = 490), 11-30 days (n = 277), and 31-60 days (n = 79). BCoV infection was detected in 50 calves by real-time RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that the prevalence of BCoV was associated with calf age (P = 0.028) and was significantly higher in calves aged 31-60 days (odds ratio: 2.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.24-5.85; P = 0.012) than in those aged 1-10 days. Our findings show that BCoV is an important etiological agent of diarrhea in calves aged 31-60 days. Fifteen full genome sequences (2019-2021 variants) of the spike, hemagglutinin/esterase, and nucleocapsid were obtained from the 50 BCoV-positive samples.

Long-term climate-adaptation strategies will require leveraging physical, financial, and community resources across multiple city departments to meet the needs of compound hazards, such as COVID-19 and extreme heat.","output":"Analyzing Changes to U.S Municipal Heat Response Plans During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States leads the world in COVID-19 cases and deaths.

These types of addictions are frequently comorbid with other addictive pathologies, such as emotional dependence (ED), which is closely related to childhood attachment. This study is presented to address the scarcity of research relating EA and MD with other behavioral addictions. The aims are to analyze the sex differences found in emotional dependence, attachment dimensions, EA and MD; to analyze the association between EA and MD and other behavioral addictions, such as emotional dependence and attachment dimensions; and to analyze the possible role that childhood attachment plays in mediating the interaction between emotional dependence and EA and MD. Method: The sample comprised 366 participants (54.6% women) aged 17C31 (M = 23.53; SD = 6.48). Results: There are sex differences, with men scoring higher in EA, MD, and ED. The positive relationship between EA and ED (values between 0.16 and 0.28), MD (presenting values between 0.42 and 0.70), and attachment styles based on preoccupation, interference, permissiveness, and value of parental authority (values between 0.11 and 0.14) is highlighted. On the other hand, MD was positively related to ED (values ranging from 0.24 to 0.36) and attachment styles based on the value of parental authority, self-sufficiency, and resentment toward parents (between 0.17 and 0.18), and negatively related to secure attachment (values between ?0.13 and ?0.18). Likewise, the predictive role of ED and attachment styles in EA and MD was tested. And it was observed how attachment styles mediated the relationship between EA and ED, as well as the relationship between MD and ED. Thus, it has been shown that people with EA and MD present attachment styles that may influence negatively the decision-making process when choosing inappropriate strategies to achieve adequate emotional regulation, even selecting inappropriate goals for physical exercise with negative consequences. Conclusions: The dissemination of the findings among mental health and sports science professionals is necessary to develop prevention and intervention strategies for people affected by EA and MD.","output":"Exercise Addiction and Muscle Dysmorphia: The Role of Emotional Dependence and Attachment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has required educators at all levels to pivot instruction online.

Pre-patterning of embryos, such as that of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, is driven by asymmetrically localized maternal or zygotic factors, including mRNA species and RNA binding proteins. However, it is not clear how mammalian early embryogenesis is regulated and what the early cell fate determinants are. Here we show that, in mouse, mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (mtrRNAs) are differentially distributed between 2-cell sister blastomeres. This distribution pattern is not related to the overall quantity or activity of mitochondria which appears equal between 2-cell sister blastomeres. Like in lower species, 16S mtrRNA is found to localize in the cytoplasm outside of mitochondria in mouse 2-cell embryos. Alterations of 16S mtrRNA levels in one of the 2-cell sister blastomere via microinjection of either sense or anti-sense RNAs drive its progeny into different cell lineages in blastocyst. These results indicate that mtrRNAs are differentially distributed among embryonic cells at the beginning of embryogenesis in mouse and they are functionally involved in the regulation of cell lineage allocations in blastocyst, suggesting an underlying molecular mechanism that regulates pre-implantation embryogenesis in mouse.","output":"Unequal distribution of 16S mtrRNA at the 2-cell stage regulates cell lineage allocations in mouse embryos."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: COVID-19 /S. aureus coinfection exacerbates morbidity and mortality among patients with coronavirus infection. This study aims to report the pooled burden of S. aureus co-infections in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We searched electronic databases and bibliography of pertinent papers for articles. We considered studies that the core result was the number of patients with bacterial (S. aureus) co-infection. We performed random effects meta-analysis (REM) because the studies included were sampled from a universe of different populations and high heterogeneity was anticipated. Using the Cochrans Q statistic, the observed dispersion (heterogeneity) among effect sizes was assessed. The percentage of total variability in the estimates of the effect size was calculated with the I2 index. To check for publication bias;Egger weighted regression, Begg rank correlation and meta-funnel plot was used. We conducted meta-regression analysis to evaluate the variability between our outcomes and the covariates using computational options like methods of moments and then maximum likelihood ratio. Results: We included Eighteen studies and retrieved data for 63,370 patients hospitalized with influenza-like-illness, about 14,369 (22.67%) tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR. Of this number, 8,249 (57.4%) patient samples were analyzed. Bacterial, fungal and viral agents were detected in 3,038 (36.8%);S. aureus in 1,192 (39.2%). Five studies reported MRSA co-infection. Study quality ranged from 6 to 9 (median 7.1) on a JBI scale. From the meta-analysis, 33.1% patients were coinfected (95%, CI 18.0 to 52.6%, Q=3473: df =17, I2 =9948%, p = 0.00). The rate of S. aureus /covid-19 co-infection was 25.6% (95% CI: 15.6 to 39.0, Q=783.4, df=17, I2=97.702%, p = 0.003).The proportion of COVID-19/S. aureus co-infected patients with MRSA was 53.9% (95% CI, 24.5 to 80.9, n=66, 5 studies, Q=29.32, df=4, I2=86.369%, p=0.000).

Improved triage on admission could improve mortality, but existing tools depend on variables that often are not available. We prospectively evaluated the universal vital assessment (UVA) score to predict mortality among patients admitted to a district hospital in rural, highly HIV-prevalent South Africa. Figure 1. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for the UVA and qSOFA scoring tools. [Image: see text] METHODS: In February-March 2020, adults admitted to the medical wards were enrolled, prior to interruption by covid19, and 30-day mortality assessed. Clinical parameters including temperature, heart and respiratory rates, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and HIV status were collected within 24 hours of admission as part of routine care. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) included pneumonia and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. To evaluate the predictive ability of the UVA score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROC) and age-sex adjusted binary logistic regression models were generated, and compared to the sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA). RESULTS: Sixty one patients were enrolled; outcomes were available for 56 patients. Patients had a mean age of 52 (SD+17), 51% were women, and 46% were HIV infected. The 30-day mortality was 16.1% (9/56) with infections and non-communicable diseases comprising 47% and 47% of admission diagnoses, respectively. The most common admitting diagnosis was LRTI (24.6%). The median (+IQR) UVA score was 2 (+3) accounting for 36% of participants. Medium-risk (2-4) and high-risk (>4) UVA groups were not associated with 30-day mortality, although the high-risk score trended towards significance (p=0.07). However, a UVA score > 3 was significantly associated with 30-day mortality, both alone and after adjusting for age and sex (aOR 6.2, 95% CI 1.2-33.1; p=0.03). The aROC (95% CI) for the UVA score was 0.74 (0.55 C 0.93), which performed better than qSOFA (aROC 0.59, 95% CI 0.37-0.81) and is shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: In this resource-limited, HIV-prevalent setting, the UVA score predicted mortality better than the qSOFA score. A moderate-risk UVA score (>3) was predictive of 30-day mortality, though needs to be confirmed in larger studies. DISCLOSURES: All Authors: No reported disclosures","output":"771.

Cardiac remodeling is further influenced by various risk factors, including pre-existing conditions and sex. Thus, the purpose of this experiment was to investigate cardiac remodeling in Type I Diabetic (Akita) mice subjected to hyperoxic treatment. Overall, we demonstrated that Akita mice experience distinct challenges from wild type (WT) mice. Specifically, Akita males at both normoxia and hyperoxia showed significant decreases in body and heart weights, prolonged PR, QRS, and QTc intervals, and reduced %EF and %FS at normoxia compared to WT controls. Moreover, Akita males largely resemble female mice (both WT and Akita) with regards to the parameters studied. Finally, statistical analysis revealed hyperoxia to have the greatest influence on cardiac pathophysiology, followed by sex, and finally genotype. Taken together, our data suggest that Type I diabetic patients may have distinct cardiac pathophysiology under hyperoxia compared to uncomplicated patients, with males being at high risk. These findings can be used to enhance provision of care in ICU patients with Type I diabetes as a comorbid condition.","output":"The implications of hyperoxia, type 1 diabetes and sex on cardiovascular physiology in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serology tests can identify previous infections and facilitate estimation of the number of total infections. However, immunoglobulins targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported to wane below the detectable level of serologic assays (which is not necessarily equivalent to the duration of protective immunity). We estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection from serology studies, accounting for expected levels of antibody acquisition (seroconversion) and waning (seroreversion), and apply this framework using data from New York City and Connecticut. METHODS: We estimated time from seroconversion to seroreversion and infection fatality ratio (IFR) using mortality data from March to October 2020 and population-level cross-sectional seroprevalence data from April to August 2020 in New York City and Connecticut. We then estimated the daily seroprevalence and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The estimated average time from seroconversion to seroreversion was 3C4 months. The estimated IFR was 1.1% (95% credible interval, 1.0%, 1.2%) in New York City and 1.4% (1.1, 1.7%) in Connecticut. The estimated daily seroprevalence declined after a peak in the spring. The estimated cumulative incidence reached 26.8% (24.2%, 29.7%) at the end of September in New York City and 8.8% (7.1%, 11.3%) in Connecticut, higher than maximum seroprevalence measures (22.1% and 6.1%), respectively.

A simple and ideal quarantine measure is considered in which an individual is detected with a probability immediately after it becomes infected and the detected one and its neighbors are promptly isolated. The efficiency of this quarantine in suppressing a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is tested in random graphs and uncorrelated scale-free networks. Monte Carlo simulations are used to show that the prompt quarantine measure outperforms random and acquaintance preventive vaccination schemes in terms of reducing the number of infected individuals. The epidemic threshold for the SIR model is analytically derived under the quarantine measure, and the theoretical findings indicate that prompt executions of quarantines are highly effective in containing epidemics. Even if infected individuals are detected with a very low probability, the SIR model under a prompt quarantine measure has finite epidemic thresholds in fat-tailed scale-free networks in which an infected individual can always cause an outbreak of a finite relative size without any measure. The numerical simulations also demonstrate that the present quarantine measure is effective in suppressing epidemics in real networks.","output":"Efficiency of prompt quarantine measures on a susceptible-infected-removed model in networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the last years, accumulating evidence has suggested that the gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases via the gutCbrain axis.

As a recent example, the ?-coronavirus family virion, SARS-CoV-2, has quickly evolved as a pandemic leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To date, no definitive treatment or vaccine application exists for COVID-19. Although new investigations seek to repurpose existing antiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered to have antiviral capabilities may be critical to address this global concern. One such avenue that may prove to be exceedingly fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recent work has shown that mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets to control cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation, a significant disability associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, pathways that can activate mTOR may be necessary for anti-hepatitis C activity, reduction of influenza A virus replication, and vital for type-1 interferon responses with influenza vaccination. Yet, important considerations for the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist. Under some conditions, mTOR can act as a double edge sword and participate in virion replication and virion release from cells. Future work with mTOR as a potential antiviral target is highly warranted and with a greater understanding of this novel pathway, new treatments against several viral pathogens may successfully emerge.","output":"The Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR): Novel Considerations as an Antiviral Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: No meta-analysis has assessed the pooled frequencies of adverse events (AEs) induced by concomitant nivolumab plus ipilimumab regimen for anticancer-medications-na?ve malignancies.

The development, production and application of emergency vaccinations are the important measures against such threats. Vaccines are cost-effective tools to prevent disease, and emergency vaccines may be the only means to prevent a true disaster for global society in the event of a new pandemic with potential to cause morbidity and mortality comparable to the Spanish flu, the polio epidemics in the 1950s, or the SARS outbreak in 2003 if its spread had not been contained in time. Given the early recognition of a new threat, and given the advances of biotechnology, vaccinology and information systems, it is not an unrealistic goal to have promising prototype vaccine candidates available in a short time span following the identification of a new infectious agent; this is based on the assumption that the emerging infection is followed by natural immunity. However, major bottlenecks for the deployment of emergency vaccine are lack of established systems for fast-track regulatory approval of such candidates and limited international vaccine production capacity.

Therefore, the development of novel approaches to prevent RSV infection is highly desirable to improve pediatric health globally. We have developed a method to generate alveolar-like macrophages (ALMs) from pluripotent stem cells. These ALMs have shown potential to promote airway innate immunity and tissue repair and so we hypothesized that ALMs could be used as a strategy to prevent RSV infection. Here, we demonstrate that ALMs are not productively infected by RSV and prevent the infection of epithelial cells. Prevention of epithelial infection was mediated by two different mechanisms: phagocytosis of RSV particles and release of an antiviral soluble factor different from type I interferon. Furthermore, intratracheal administration of ALMs protected mice from subsequent virus-induced weight loss and decreased lung viral titres and inflammation, indicating that ALMs can impair the pathogenesis of RSV infection. Our results support a prophylactic role for ALMs in the setting of RSV infection and warrant further studies on stem cell-derived ALMs as a novel cell-based therapy for pulmonary viral infections.","output":"Alveolar-like Macrophages Attenuate Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity, or lack of consistent access to enough food, is associated with low intakes of fruits and vegetables (FVs) and higher risk of chronic diseases and disproportionately affects populations with low income.

Although the effectiveness of face masks to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is debated, no study has evaluated the virus-blocking efficacy of masks used by patients. We aimed to evaluate this efficacy of masks used by SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Data, masks used, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from these patients. Forty-five paired samples of nasopharyngeal swabs and masks were obtained and processed; the majority of masks were woven. Viral RNAs were amplified using quantitative reverse\\\\transcription polymerase chain reaction and detected only on the inner parts of masks. Median viral load (VL) values of swabs and masks were 1.954x10(6) and 2,51x10(3), respectively. Statistically, there was a difference of approximately 1000 RNA copies/mL between swabs and masks and no significant difference in VL values among different types of masks. There were statistically significant differences in VL values between men and women and between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Our findings suggest the blocking of virus transmission by different types of masks and reinforce the use of masks by both infected and non-infected individuals.","output":"Effectiveness of face masks in blocking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A preliminary evaluation of masks used by SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxygen (O(2)) is indispensable for aerobic respiration and cellular metabolism. In case of injury, reactive oxygen species are produced, causing oxidative stress, which triggers cell damaging chemical mediators leading to ischemic reperfusion injuries (IRI). Sufficient tissue oxygenation is necessary for optimal wound healing. In this context, several hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers have been developed and tested, especially as graft preservatives for transplant procedures. However, most of the commercially available O(2) carriers increase oxidative stress and show some adverse effects. Interestingly, the hemoglobin derived from the marine lugworm Arenicola marina (M101) has been presented as an efficient therapeutic O(2) carrier with potential anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, it has demonstrated promise as a supplement to conventional organ preservatives by reducing IRI. This review summarizes the properties and various applications of M101.

The presence of different autoantibodies allows clinicians to define distinct phenotypes. Antibodies against the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 gene, also called anti-MDA5 antibodies, are associated with a characteristic phenotype, the clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. This review aims to analyze the different pharmacological options for the treatment of rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease in patients with anti-MDA5 antibodies. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence-based therapeutic recommendations suggest that the best initial approach to treat these patients is an early combination of immunosuppressive drugs including either glucocorticoids and calcineurin inhibitors or a triple therapy adding intravenous cyclophosphamide. Tofacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, could be useful according to recent reports. High ferritin plasma levels, generalized worsening of pulmonary infiltrates, and ground-glass opacities should be considered predictive factors of a bad outcome. In this scenario, clinicians should consider rescue therapies such as therapeutic plasma exchange, polymyxin-B hemoperfusion, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or even lung transplantation. SUMMARY: Combined immunosuppressive treatment should be considered the first-line therapy for patients with anti-MDA5 rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease. Aggressive rescue therapies may be useful in refractory patients.","output":"Pharmacologic Treatment of Anti-MDA5 Rapidly Progressive Interstitial Lung Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can evolve to clinical manifestations resembling systemic autoimmune diseases, with the presence of autoantibodies that are still poorly characterized. To address this issue, we performed a cross-sectional study of 246 individuals to determine whether autoantibodies targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-related molecules were associated with COVID-19-related clinical outcomes. Moderate and severe patients exhibited the highest autoantibody levels, relative to both healthy controls and patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Random Forest, a machine learning model, ranked anti-GPCR autoantibodies targeting downstream molecules in the RAS signaling pathway such as the angiotensin II type 1 and Mas receptor, and the chemokine receptor CXCR3 as the three strongest predictors of severe disease. Moreover, while the autoantibody network signatures were relatively conserved in patients with mild COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, they were disrupted in moderate and most perturbed in severe patients. Our data indicate that the relationship between autoantibodies targeting GPCRs and RAS-related molecules associates with the clinical severity of COVID-19, suggesting novel molecular pathways for therapeutic interventions.","output":"The relationship between autoantibodies targeting GPCRs and the renin-angiotensin system associates with COVID-19 severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Enhanced community surveillance is a key pillar of the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potentially significant source of transmission, yet remains relatively poorly understood.

Ongoing precautions include preappointment and/or at appointment COVID-19 symptom screening and use of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE). This study aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in dental patients to inform community surveillance and improve understanding of risks in the dental setting. Thirty-one dental care centers across Scotland invited asymptomatic-screened patients aged over 5 y to participate. Following verbal consent and completion of sociodemographic and symptom history questionnaire, trained dental teams took a combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab sample using standardized Viral Transport Medium-containing test kits. Samples were processed by the Lighthouse Lab and patients informed of their results by SMS/email with appropriate self-isolation guidance in the event of a positive test. All positive cases were successfully followed up by the national contact tracing program. Over a 13-wk period (from August 3, 2020, to October 31, 2020), 4,032 patients, largely representative of the population, were tested. Of these, 22 (0.5%; 95% CI, 0.5%-0.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate increased over the period, commensurate with uptick in community prevalence identified across all national testing monitoring data streams. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a COVID-19 testing survey in asymptomatic-screened patients presenting in a dental setting. The positivity rate in this patient group reflects the underlying prevalence in community at the time. These data are a salient reminder, particularly when community infection levels are rising, of the importance of appropriate ongoing infection prevention control and PPE vigilance, which is relevant as health care team fatigue increases as the pandemic continues.

The frequency and nature of human-rat encounters may be altered by social distancing policies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, restaurant closures may reduce food availability for rats and promote rat activity in nearby residential areas, thus increasing public health risks during a period of public health crisis. In this study, we aimed to identify factors associated with increased perceived exposure to rats during a stay-at-home order, describe residents' encounters with rats relevant to their health and well-being, and identify factors associated with increased use of rodent control. METHODS: Urban residents in Chicago, a large city with growing concerns about rats and health disparities, completed an online questionnaire including fixed response and open-ended questions during the spring 2020 stay-at-home order. Analyses included ordinal multivariate regression, spatial analysis, and thematic analysis for open-ended responses. RESULTS: Overall, 21% of respondents (n = 835) reported an increase in rat sightings around their homes during the stay-at-home order and increased rat sightings was positively associated with proximity to restaurants, low-rise apartment buildings, and rat feces in the home (p &#8804; 0.01). Many respondents described feeling unsafe using their patio or yard, and afraid of rats entering their home or spreading disease. Greater engagement with rodent control was associated with property ownership, information about rat control, and areas with lower incomes (p &#8804; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: More frequent rat encounters may be an unanticipated public health concern during periods of social distancing, especially in restaurant-dense areas or in low-rise apartment buildings. Rat presence may also limit residents' ability to enjoy nearby outdoor spaces, which otherwise might buffer stress experienced during a stay-at-home order.

METHODS: This retrospective policy analysis used three sources of data: a comprehensive and chronological scoping review of literature, interviews with Iran health insurance policy actors and stakeholders, and a review of published and unpublished official documents and local media. All data were analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Health insurance reforms, especially health transformation plan (HTP) in 2014, helped to progress towards UHC and health equity by expanding population coverage, a benefits package, and enhancing financial protection. However, several challenges can jeopardize sustaining this progress. There is a lack of suitable mechanisms to collect contributions from those without a regular income. The compulsory health insurance coverage law is not implemented in full. A substantial gap between private and public medical tariffs leads to high out-of-pocket health expenditure.

The nonresectional dynamic mitral valve repair (NVR) method involves a complete flexible ring and artificial chordal insertion but without leaflet resection or annular plication. The aim of this study was to compare changes in mitral annular structure and function after the NVR technique with those after a resectional mitral valve repair (RVR) method, which involves leaflet resection and annuloplasty with a partial flexible ring. METHODS Patients with organic severe MR undergoing mitral valve repair with either technique underwent three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography before and after surgery. The mitral annulus was tracked offline and measured throughout the cardiac cycle. Mitral leaflet mobility was also measured. RESULTS Fifteen patients underwent repair with NVR, and 13 underwent repair with RVR (age, 56 vs 61 years, respectively). Both operations reduced mitral annular area significantly (maximum area reduction, from 18.5  4.6 to 6.6  1.7 cm(2) and from 20.1  4.8 to 6  1.5 cm(2) with the NVR and RVR techniques, respectively; P < .001). In contrast to RVR, patients who underwent NVR maintained dynamic changes in mitral annular area, circumference, and anterior-posterior diameter during the cardiac cycle. Mitral leaflet mobility was reduced with both techniques, but posterior leaflet mobility was restricted with RVR. CONCLUSIONS The size of the mitral annulus is reduced after repair with either surgical approach. Compared with resectional valve repair, more dynamic changes in the structure of the mitral annulus are maintained during the cardiac cycle with the NVR technique early postoperatively, along with more preserved motion of the posterior leaflet.","output":"Mitral annulus dynamics early after valve repair: preliminary observations of the effect of resectional versus non-resectional approaches."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on functional exercise capacity seemed quickly clinically evident. The objective of this study was to assess the functional exercise capacity of patients with severe COVID-19 and to evaluate the effect of a telerehabilitation program in the specific context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Patients hospitalized for severe or critical COVID-19 were recruited. The functional exercise capacity (1-min sit-to-stand test (STST)) was prospectively quantified at discharge. A telerehabilitation program was then proposed. A control group was composed with the patients refusing the program. RESULTS: At discharge, none of the 48 recruited patients had a STST higher than the 50th percentile and 77% of them were below the 2.5th percentile. SpO2 was 92.6  3.0% after STST and 15 patients had oxygen desaturation. After 3-months of follow-up, the number of repetitions during STST significantly increased either in telerehabilitation (n = 14) (p < 0.001) or in control groups (n = 13) (p = 0.002) but only one patient had a result higher than the 50th percentile (in Telerehabilitation group) and 37% of them were still under the 2.5th percentile for this result. The improvement was significantly and clinically greater after the telerehabilitation program (p = 0.005). No adverse events were reported by the patients during the program. CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have a low functional exercise capacity at discharge and the recovery after three months is poor.

This study analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Kashgar Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autnomous Region, China from 2011 to 2020 to provide a scientific basis for developing TB control strategies and measures in Kashgar. Methods:The data were collected from the NNDRS, which included the geographical distribution, age, sex, occupation, and pathogenic classification of reported PTB cases in 12 counties/cities of Kashgar Prefecture from 2011 to 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteristic of PTB epidemic in Kashgar. Results: There were 189,416 PTB cases reported during 2011C2020, with a mean annual PTB case notification rate (CNR) of 451.29/100,000. A rising trend in the rate of reported PTB between 2011 and 2017 ((2)(trend)=26.09, P<0.01) and a declining trend between 2018 and 2020 ((2)(trend)=314.44, P<0.01) were observed. The months with the highest reported number of PTB cases were March to May and November to December. The mean annual rate of reported PTB was 451.88/100,000 for males and 450.67/100,000 for females. In addition, 19.76% of patients were bacteriologically-confirmed (Bac+) cases (37,425/189,416), and the mean annual Bac+ CNR was 89.17/100,000, rising from 64.76/100,000 in 2011 to 139.12/100,000 in 2020 ((2)(trend)=74.44, P<0.01). Conclusions: The CNR of reported PTB in Kashgar showed a significant declining trend in the past three years.

We assessed the association between collaterals and functional outcome in EVT treated patients and investigated if this association is time dependent. METHODS We included consecutive patients from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry (March 2014-June 2016) with an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion undergoing EVT. Functional outcome was measured on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. We investigated the association between collaterals and mRS in the MR CLEAN Registry with ordinal logistic regression and if this association was time dependent with an interaction term. Additionally, we determined modification of EVT effect by collaterals compared with MR CLEAN controls, and also investigated if this was time dependent with multiplicative interaction terms. RESULTS 1412 patients were analyzed. Functional independence (mRS score of 0-2) was achieved in 13% of patients with grade 0 collaterals, in 27% with grade 1, in 46% with grade 2, and in 53% with grade 3. Collaterals were significantly associated with mRS (adjusted common OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.7)) and significantly modified EVT benefit (P=0.04). None of the effects were time dependent. Better collaterals corresponded to lower mortality (P<0.001), but not to lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.14). CONCLUSION In routine clinical practice, better collateral status is associated with better functional outcome and greater treatment benefit in EVT treated acute ischemic stroke patients, independent of time to treatment.

The vaccines used against SARS-COV-2 by now have been able to develop some neutralising antibodies in the vaccinated human population and slow down the infection rate. The effectiveness of the vaccines has been challenged by the emergence of the new strains with numerous mutations in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Since S protein is the major immunogenic protein of the virus and also contains Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that interacts with the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, any mutations in this region should affect the neutralisation potential of the antibodies leading to the immune evasion. Several variants of concern (VOC) of the virus have emerged so far. Among them, the most critical are Delta (B.1.617.2), and recently reported Omicron (B. 1.1.529) which have acquired a lot of mutations in the spike protein. We have mapped those mutations on the modelled RBD and evaluated the binding affinities of various human antibodies with it. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies have been used to explore the effect of the mutations on the structure of the RBD and the RBD-antibody interaction. The analysis shows that the mutations mostly at the interface of a nearby region lower the binding affinity of the antibody by ten to forty per cent, with a downfall in the number of interactions formed as a whole and therefore, it implies the generation of immune escape variants. Notable mutations and their effect was characterised by performing various analyses that explain the structural basis of antibody efficacy in Delta and a compromised neutralisation effect for the Omicron variant. Our results pave the way for robust vaccine design that can be effective for many variants.

However, the response is often transient and additional therapy is usually needed. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are frequently used as second-line therapy, although there is little clinical guidance on the timing of their administration and on tapering/discontinuation of the drug. To provide clinical recommendations, we used the Delphi technique to obtain consensus for statements regarding administration and on tapering/discontinuation of second-line TPO-RAs among a group of Italian clinicians with expertise in management of ITP. METHODS: The Delphi process was used to obtain agreement on five statements regarding initiation and on tapering/discontinuation of second-line TPO-RAs. Agreement was considered when 75% of participants approved the statement. Eleven experts participated in the voting. RESULTS: Full consensus was reached for three of the five statements. The experts held that an early switch from corticosteroids to a TPO-RA has the dual advantage of sparing patients from corticosteroid abuse and improve long-term clinical outcomes. All felt that dose reduction of TPO-RAs can be considered in patients with a stable response and platelet count >100  10(9)/L that is maintained for at least 6 months in the absence of concomitant treatments, although there was less agreement in patients with a platelet count >50  10(9)/L. Near consensus was reached regarding the statement that early treatment with a TPO-RA is associated with an increase in clinically significant partial or complete response. The experts also agreed that optimization of tapering and discontinuation of TPO-RA therapy in selected patients can improve the quality of life. CONCLUSION: The present consensus can help to provide guidance on use of TPO-RAs in daily practice in patients with ITP.

Radiotherapy enhanced the tumor-promoting activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pancreatic cancer. Sustained increase in lactate secretion, resulting from the radiation-augmented Warburg effect, was responsible for the enhanced immunosuppressive phenotype of MDSCs after radiotherapy.

The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 164 ml (95% CI 110-217) for LS and 160 ml (95% CI 116-203) for the MS device (p = .36). The multivariate analyses accounting for BMI, endometriosis, uterine weight and appearance of fibroids did not reveal any significant effect of the type of device used on operating time and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSION In this RCT, both devices provided reliable and effective sealing and dissection. The reusable MS showed non-inferiority against the disposable LS device with regard to operating time and estimated intraoperative blood loss.","output":"Bipolar vessel-sealing devices in laparoscopic hysterectomies: a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a serious complication in patients receiving antiresorptive medication, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, for different oncologic and non-oncologic diseases. Here, we report a case of MRONJ in a patient treated with tocilizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody that effectively treats moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Case description: A 45-year-old female patient diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis, who had been undergoing intravenous tocilizumab therapy for three years without history of bisphosphonate use, was referred to our department. Four weeks previously, several teeth in the maxilla and mandible were removed under local anesthesia by her dentist. Two weeks after the extractions, she felt pain in both jaws. We diagnosed wound dehiscence and delayed healing of the alveolar bone after the tooth extractions. Digital volume tomography showed persistent dry alveolar sockets. The patient underwent surgical debridement of necrotic bone, and intravenous antibiotics were administered in hospital. Five months later, wound dehiscence reoccurred in the same regions. Histopathological analysis of bone biopsies revealed a diagnosis of MRONJ. Four months later, wound dehiscence occurred in the left maxillary alveolar ridge, and local bone resection was performed under antibiotic treatment. Twenty-four months after the last surgery, wound dehiscence had healed completely without signs of recurrence. Discussion: Osteomyelitis of the jaw in patients treated with tocilizumab has not been reported often. This case confirms the potential role of this interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor in the pathogenesis of MRONJ and shows that patients who receive tocilizumab with MRONJ-like symptoms should be closely monitored. The pathomechanism of MRONJ under tocilizumab therapy remains unclear, so dental practitioners, maxillofacial surgeons, and rheumatologists should look for signs of MRONJ in patients receiving tocilizumab to prevent MRONJ onset.","output":"Tocilizumab: Another medication related to osteonecrosis of the jaws?

Despite the promise of nucleic acid and antibody tests, there is still a great challenge to reduce the misdiagnosis, especially for asymptomatic individuals. Here we report a generalizable method for highly specific and ultrasensitive detection of serum COVID-19-associated antigens based on an aptamer-assisted proximity ligation assay. The sensor is based on binding two aptamer probes to the same protein target that brings the ligation DNA region into close proximity, thereby initiating ligation-dependent qPCR amplification. Using this system, serum nucleocapsid protein has been detected quantitatively by converting protein recognition into a detectable qPCR signal using a simple, homogeneous and fast detection workflow in 2 hours. In addition, this system has also been transformed into a universal platform for measuring specific interactions between spike S1 and its receptor ACE2, and more importantly demonstrated the feasibility for screening and investigation of potential neutralizing aptamers. Since in vitro selection can obtain aptamers selective for many COVID-19-associated antigens, the method demonstrated here will serve as an important tool for the diagnosis and therapeutics of COVID-19.","output":"A serological aptamer-assisted proximity ligation assay for COVID-19 diagnosis and seeking neutralizing aptamers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION In Greece, higher morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic were recorded during the third pandemic wave. Only a small percentage of the population was fully vaccinated at the beginning of the third pandemic wave. Our effort was multi-level, from the emergency room department to the ward. The aim of this article is to communicate a single secondary centers experience during the third pandemic wave in Greece. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the regional Agios Andreas General Hospital of Patra, Greece, including 360 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A standard of care protocol was applied in all cases and its outcomes are examined. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 64.2 years (IQR: 18C100) and the median duration of hospitalization was 8 days. The overall case fatality rate was 8.1%. Of the 360 patients, 12 (3.3%) needed to be intubated. Most of the hospitalized patients (n=316;87.8%) were treated with nasal canula or Venturi mask. Twenty-six patients (7.2%) were supported with HFNC and 18 (5%) received any available type of non-invasive mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS An articulate protocol and coordinated collaboration among specialists were the cornerstone of proper, immediate, and individualized treatment. The international recommendations in force at that time proved to be efficient in reducing progress to SRF and intubation.

Recently, new coronavirus named as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified which is a major threat to public health. Innate immune responses play a vital role in a host's defense against viruses. Interestingly, CoVs have evolved elaborate strategies to evade the complex system of sensors and signaling molecules to suppress host immunity. SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro), as an important coronavirus enzyme, regulates viral spread and innate immune responses. SCoV-2 PLpro is multifunctional enzymes with deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activity. The PLpro can interact with key regulators in signaling pathways such as STING, NF-&#954;B, cytokine production, MAPK, and TGF-? and hijack those to block the immune responses. Therefore, the PLpro can be as an important target for the treatment of COVID-19. Until now, there are several drugs or compound have been identified that can inhibit PLpro activity.

Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed for quantitative data, along with the thematic analysis for qualitative data. RESULTS: The mean ( SD) age of the participants was 26.54 ( 3.05), and the majority were male (54.9%). About 81.6% of the participants reported COVID-19 as a viral disease, transmitted through droplets of sneezing and coughing, and close contact with another person (90.8%). Nearly 40% of participants reported news channels as a reliable source of information for COVID-19. Participants who were male were less likely to be aware than females in terms of mode of transmission of COVID-19 such as going outside of the home (82.7% male vs 90.8% female; p < 0.05). Male participants thought they were perfectly healthy and more reluctant to agree with maintaining social distance compared to female participants (72.8% male vs 90.1% female; p < 0.001). Participants satisfaction level with services provided by the government was also significantly different and higher among females than male participants (39.9% male vs 53.5% female; p < 0.05). The majority of the participants reported suffering due to financial uncertainty, psychological distress, and inadequate health facilities. Dissatisfaction was reported with the existing health services as creating several misconceptions, lacking testing facilities, and debasement by the health professionals.

Some of the biological effects of nicotine are well documented in in vitro and in vivo systems; however, data are scarce concerning the time-dependent changes on protein and phosphorylation events in response to nicotine. Here, we profiled the proteomes of SH-SY5Y and A549 cell lines subjected to acute (15 min, 1 h and 4 h) or chronic (24 h, 48 h) nicotine exposures. We used sample multiplexing (TMTpro16) and quantified more than 9000 proteins and over 7000 phosphorylation events per cell line. Among our findings, we determined a decrease in mitochondrial protein abundance for SH-SY5Y, while we detected alterations in several immune pathways, such as the complement system, for A549 following nicotine treatment. We also explored the proposed association between smoking (specifically nicotine) and SARS-CoV2.

METHODS: From 2004 to 2006, adults with CAP who were admitted to five hospitals were prospectively enrolled in the study, and clinical data, cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained. NATs from swabs were tested for influenza, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus 1C4, coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), and adenovirus. RESULTS: A total of 193 patients were included; the median age was 71 years, 51% of patients were male, and 47% of patients had severe CAP. Overall, 75 patients (39%) had a pathogen identified. Of these pathogens, 29 were viruses (15%), 38 were bacteria (20%), 8 were mixed (4%), and the rest were unknown. Influenza (n = 7), hMPV (n = 7), and RSV (n = 5) accounted for most viral infections; other infections included rhinovirus (n = 4), parainfluenza (n = 3), coronavirus (n = 4), and adenovirus (n = 2). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacterial infection (37%). Compared with bacterial infection, patients with viral infection were older (76 vs 64 years, respectively; p = 0.01), were more likely to have cardiac disease (66% vs 32%, respectively; p = 0.006), and were more frail (eg, 48% with limited ambulation vs 21% of bacterial infections; p = 0.02). There were few clinically meaningful differences in presentation and no differences in outcomes according to the presence or absence of viral infection.

We provide a comprehensive look at COVID-19 epidemiology across the state of Georgia, which includes vast rural communities that may be disproportionately impacted by the spread of this infectious disease. Methods: All 159 Georgia counties were included in this study. We examined the geographic variation of COVID-19 in Georgia from March 3 through April 24, 2020 by extracting data on incidence and mortality from various national and state datasets. We contrasted county-level mortality rates per 100,000 population (MRs) by county-level factors. Results: Metropolitan Atlanta had the overall highest number of confirmed cases; however, the southwestern rural parts of Georgia, surrounding the city of Albany, had the highest bi-weekly increases in incidence rate. Among counties with >10 cases, MRs were highest in the rural counties of Randolph (233.2), Terrell (182.5), Early (136.3), and Dougherty (114.2). Counties with the highest MRs (22.5-2332 per 100,000) had a higher proportion of: non-Hispanic Blacks residents, adults aged 60+, adults earning <$20,000 annually, and residents living in rural communities when compared with counties with lower MRs. These counties also had a lower proportion of the population with a college education, lower number of ICU beds per 100,000 population, and lower number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population.

METHODS: A total of 130 asthmatic children aged 4-6 years from the multinational PreDicta cohort were prospectively followed for a 12-month period. Allergy tests and a standard health questionnaire were carried out at study entry. Respiratory virus presence in nasopharyngeal washes was studied at illness visits and at 3 scheduled visits. RESULTS: At study entry, mean age of the children was 5.3 years. Of 571 visits, 54% were positive for any virus and 39% for RV. Patient characteristics were only assessed with RV infection due to low number of other viruses. The use of supplementary vitamin D was inversely associated with RV infection (P < .05). RV infection was associated with more severe course of acute illness in terms of more severe nighttime coughing, more sleep disturbances, and more days with runny nose (all P < .05). RV infection was also associated with more severe disease course during the 12-month follow-up in terms of more nights with awakenings and more days of exercise-related symptoms (both P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may have an anti-rhinovirus effect. Both short- and medium-term outcomes suggest RV infection to be an important clinical marker of instable preschool asthma.","output":"Clinical correlates of rhinovirus infection in preschool asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying cybersickness in virtual reality (VR) applications such as games in a fast, precise, non-intrusive, and non-disruptive way remains challenging. Several factors can cause cybersickness, and their identification will help find its origins and prevent or minimize it. One such factor is virtual movement. Movement, whether physical or virtual, can be represented in different forms. One way to represent and store it is with a temporally annotated point sequence. Because a sequence is memory-consuming, it is often preferable to save it in a compressed form. Compression allows redundant data to be eliminated while still preserving changes in speed and direction. Since changes in direction and velocity in VR can be associated with cybersickness, changes in compression rate can likely indicate changes in cybersickness levels. In this research, we explore whether quantifying changes in virtual movement can be used to estimate variation in cybersickness levels of VR users. We investigate the correlation between changes in the compression rate of movement data in two VR games with changes in players' cybersickness levels captured during gameplay. Our results show (1) a clear correlation between changes in compression rate and cybersickness, and(2) that a machine learning approach can be used to identify these changes. Finally, results from a second experiment show that our approach is feasible for cybersickness inference in games and other VR applications that involve movement.","output":"Using Trajectory Compression Rate to Predict Changes in Cybersickness in Virtual Reality Games"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of introducing discussion forum to the student teachers of an English language course was to offer more practice in reading and writing skills. The current study is a reflective account of researcher's experience teaching an online course during COVID-19 times and incorporating discussion forum for optimum student engagement and enrichment. It aimed at encouraging students to apply a variety of reading and writing strategies to achieve the learning outcomes of the course. This activity was asynchronous, so the students could respond at their convenience and spend as much time on readings as they needed. Eighty-one students of Year 1 participated and wrote their responses online to prompts from a selection of three independent readings using the learning management system (Blackboard). A descriptive analysis of responses was conducted based on five criteria: structure and format;accuracy in comprehension;relevance to the prompt;critical reading;and correct use of language. Researcher's own reflections were supplemented with students' feedback and overall performance in the course. Three themes emerge which are centered around students' participation, performance and progress. Even without formal assessment, almost all the students participated. With clearly-planned and relevant reading selections, the performance mostly met the criteria for structure, comprehension and making relevant connections. However, the student engagement has the scope to be extended to cognitive engagement for higher-order reflective thinking and better language skills. Over two-third of the participants made progress and remained good, though it was not a predictor of their final grade. The study recommends exploring the multi-dimensional possibilities of more collaborative and sustainable learning as asynchronous discussion forum promises to contribute significantly in the pursuit of academic excellence in English language teacher education. ? 2021 IEEE.","output":"Asynchronous Discussion Forum: A Reflective E-learning Platform during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already existing pandemic of physical inactivity.

We also aim to describe the determinants of change in lifestyle behaviours. Methods: /Design: A before-after experimental study design will be followed in which baseline measurements have been undertaken in 2018-19 before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the follow-up measurements will be repeated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty government and private schools of Punjab, India form the primary unit of participation from which 1086adolescents participated in the study. Validated questionnaires are used to measurephysical activity, sedentarybehaviour, and dietary behaviour. Additionally, objective measures of physical activity will be performed using ActiGraph wGT3X-BT over a 7-day period on a sub-sample. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference will be assessed objectively as a measure of central obesity. Qualitative interviews and focus group discussions will be conducted to have a better understanding for reasons of change in physical activity, sedentary and dietary behaviour or any possible differences between groups.

Infections are the first cause of hospital admission, which often occurs in the home country of pilgrims. METHODS: Literature review on PubMed from 1952 to November 2015 on the epidemiology and prevention of infections contracted during the Hajj, using the keywords Hajj and infections. RESULTS: Respiratory tract infections, ENT infections, influenza, pyogenic pneumonia, whooping cough, and tuberculosis are most frequently observed during the Hajj. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis have been reported in pilgrims and their contacts. Waterborne infections such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis A are common, despite the improvement of health conditions. Pyoderma and furuncles are also frequently observed. Recently, dengue fever, Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever have emerged but no case of MERS-coronavirus, appeared in Saudi Arabia in 2012, have yet been observed during the 2012C2014 Hajj. CONCLUSION: Prevention is based on compulsory meningococcal vaccination, vaccination against seasonal influenza and pneumococcal infections for pilgrims at high risk of contracting the infection, and on vaccination against hepatitis A. Updating immunization for diphtheria/tetanus/poliomyelitis/pertussis and measles/mumps is also crucial and pilgrims must comply with hygiene precautions.","output":"Hajj-associated infections()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effort for combating the COVID-19 pandemic around the world has resulted in a huge amount of data, e.g., from testing, contact tracing, modelling, treatment, vaccine trials, and more.

The virus causes COVID-19, with a wide range of symptoms among the infected individuals, from asymptomatic infection to mortality. This, along with a high infection rate, prompted efforts to investigate the potential mechanisms of the different clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV-2 among the infected populations. HYPOTHESIS: : One of the possible mechanisms that has been reported is the ABO blood system polymorphism. Indeed, one of the major proposed mechanisms is the presence of naturally occurring anti-A antibodies in individuals of groups O and B, which could be partially protective against SARS-CoV-2 virions. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: : This article aimed to review the published data on the potential effect of the ABO blood group system on the susceptibility to COVID-19 and the disease progression and outcomes. RESULTS: : The reviewed data suggest that individuals of blood group A are at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may develop severe COVID-19 outcomes, whereas blood group O is considered protective against the infection, to some extent. However, some of the available studies seem to have been influenced by unaccounted confounders and biases.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of single-site surgery with conventional instruments in combined procedures. PRESENTATION OF CASE SERIES Six consecutive patients who scheduled for combined cholecystectomy and splenectomy because of hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia were included this study. Both procedures were performed via trans-umbilical single-site multiport approach using conventional instruments. All procedures completed successfully without conversion to open surgery or conventional laparoscopic surgery. An additional trocar was required for only one patient. The mean operation time was 190min (150-275min). The mean blood loss was 185ml (70-300ml). Median postoperative hospital stay was two days. No perioperative mortality or major complications occurred in our series. Recurrent anemia, hernia formation or wound infection was not observed during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION Nowadays, publications are arising about laparoscopic or single site surgery for combined diseases. Surgery for combined diseases has some difficulties owing to the placement of organs and position of the patient during laparoscopic surgery. Single site laparoscopic surgery has been proposed to have better cosmetic outcome, less postoperative pain, greater patient satisfaction and faster recovery compared to standard laparoscopy. CONCLUSION We consider that single-site multiport laparoscopic approach for combined splenectomy and cholecystectomy is a safe and feasible technique, after gaining enough experience on single site surgery.","output":"Single-site multiport combined splenectomy and cholecystectomy with conventional laparoscopic instruments: Case series and review of literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pulmonary aspergillosis has been reported at high rates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

However, dyspnea was more frequent in older patients than younger patients (20.7% versus 9.9%, p=0.032). Compared with younger patients, older patients harbored more severe cases (37.9% versus 17.1%, p=0.001) and comorbidities (58.6% versus 21.0%, p<0.001) such as hypertension and diabetes. The baseline values of eosinophils and C-reactive protein were abnormal in older and younger groups. From baseline to day 14, significant decreases of three biomarkers (C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, albumin) and dramatic increases of three biomarkers (lymphocytes, platelets, blood urea nitrogen) were observed in older patients.

We explored provider perceptions of care delivery adaptations and challenges for providers and patients across nine international pediatric diabetes clinics. METHODS: Providers in a quality improvement collaborative completed a questionnaire about clinic adaptations, including roles, care delivery methods, and provider and patient concerns and challenges. We employed a rapid analysis to identify main themes. RESULTS: Providers described adaptations within multiple domains of care delivery, including provider roles and workload, clinical encounter and team meeting format, care delivery platforms, self-management technology education, and patient-provider data sharing. Providers reported concerns about potential negative impacts on patients from COVID-19 and the clinical adaptations it required, including fears related to telemedicine efficacy, blood glucose and insulin pump/pen data sharing, and delayed care-seeking. Particular concern was expressed about already vulnerable patients. Simultaneously, providers reported 'silver linings' of adaptations that they perceived as having potential to inform care and self-management recommendations going forward, including time-saving clinic processes, telemedicine, lifestyle changes compelled by COVID-19, and improvements to family and clinic staff literacy around data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: Providers across diverse clinical settings reported care delivery adaptations in response to COVID-19-particularly telemedicine processes-created challenges and opportunities to improve care quality and patient health.

Virions require spike (S) glycoproteins for binding to cell receptors and for catalyzing virus-cell membrane fusion. Fusion occurs only after S proteins are cleaved sequentially, first during their secretion through the exocytic organelles of virus-producing cells, and second after virus binding to target-cell receptors. To more precisely determine how sequential proteolysis contributes to CoV infection, we introduced S mutations obstructing the first cleavages. These mutations severely compromised MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but had little effect on infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry. Without the first cleavages, S proteins resisted cell receptor-induced conformational changes, which restricted the second, fusion-activating cleavages. Consistent with these findings, precleaved MERS viruses used receptor-proximal, cell-surface proteases to effect the second fusion-activating cleavages during cell entry, whereas the more rigid uncleaved MERS viruses trafficked past these cell-surface proteases and into endosomes. Uncleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu3 cell cultures because they lacked sufficient endosomal fusion-activating proteases. Thus, by sensitizing viruses to receptor-induced conformational changes, the first S cleavages expand virus tropism to cell types that are relevant to lung infection, and therefore may be significant determinants of MERS-CoV virulence.","output":"Proteolytic processing of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spikes expands virus tropism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing evidence suggests that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also invade the central nervous system (CNS).

We subsequently exposed these adults to a cold or influenza virus and then monitored them in quarantine for 5 to 6 days for onset of respiratory illness.

It affects people of all age groups and although in most cases it is self limiting, the common cold still causes significant morbidity. Antihistamines are commonly offered over the counter to relieve symptoms for patients affected by the common cold, however there is not much evidence of their efficacy. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antihistamines on the common cold. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948 to July week 4, 2015), EMBASE (2010 to August 2015), CINAHL (1981 to August 2015), LILACS (1982 to August 2015) and Biosis Previews (1985 to August 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using antihistamines as monotherapy for the common cold. We excluded any studies with combination therapy or using antihistamines in patients with an allergic component in their illness. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We collected adverse effects information from the included trials. MAIN RESULTS We included 18 RCTs, which were reported in 17 publications (one publication reports on two trials) with 4342 participants (of which 212 were children) suffering from the common cold, both naturally occurring and experimentally induced. The interventions consisted of an antihistamine as monotherapy compared with placebo. In adults there was a short-term beneficial effect of antihistamines on severity of overall symptoms: on day one or two of treatment 45% had a beneficial effect with antihistamines versus 38% with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92). However, there was no difference between antihistamines and placebo in the mid term (three to four days) to long term (six to 10 days). When evaluating individual symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, there was some beneficial effect of the sedating antihistamines compared to placebo (e.g. rhinorrhoea on day three: mean difference (MD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.06 on a four- or five-point severity scale; sneezing on day three: MD -0.35, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.20 on a four-point severity scale), but this effect is clinically non-significant. Adverse events such as sedation were more commonly reported with sedating antihistamines although the differences were not statistically significant. Only two trials included children and the results were conflicting. The majority of the trials had a low risk of bias although some lacked sufficient trial quality information. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Antihistamines have a limited short-term (days one and two of treatment) beneficial effect on severity of overall symptoms but not in the mid to long term. There is no clinically significant effect on nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea or sneezing. Although side effects are more common with sedating antihistamines, the difference is not statistically significant.

Sequential logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS Of the 3217 enrolled fathers, 2544 (79.08%) provided data for at least one time point during the first year postpartum and 2442 (75.29%) in the second year. Overall, 569 fathers (22.4%) had comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms at some point during the first year postpartum (2.2% at baseline to 8.9% at 6 months), and 323 fathers (13.2%) had comorbidity at some point during their second year postpartum (8.1% at 18 months and 8.6% at 24 months). Strongest risk factors associated with paternal comorbidity were poor or fair perceived health at 4 weeks postpartum, depression before pregnancy, anxiety in the current pregnancy, significant adverse childhood experiences, positive ADHD screen, and victim of intimate partner violence.

These were then tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-CoV-2.

Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.","output":"Causes and Implications of Codon Usage Bias in RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Malaria is a main public health problem in India and was so particularly in the state of Gujarat in the western part of the country. This study assesses the effects of various interventions on malaria cases using data from the last 33 years (1987C2019). METHODS: Here we have analysed 33 years of malaria epidemiological data from a malaria clinic in Kheda district in Gujarat. The data were digitised yearly and monthly, age-wise and gender-wise, and descriptive analysis was performed to assess the effects of several interventions on malaria burden. RESULTS: During 1987C2019, our clinic diagnosed 5466 Plasmodium vivax and 4732 P. falciparum malaria cases. Overall, there was a declining trend in malaria cases except for the years 1991, 1994, 2004 and 2005. The year 2004 especially witnessed an epidemic in Kheda as well as throughout Gujarat. Malaria infections were most common (40%) among the 21C40 years age group. Fever was the most common symptom in all age groups. INTERPRETATION: Introduction of revised drug policy and improved surveillance technique (rapid diagnosis kits) have strengthened the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in the district. Use of pyrethroid in indoor residual insecticide spray has also strengthened vector control. Among the various interventions used, long-lasting insecticide nets and introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy have played significant roles in controlling malaria cases. A more drastic decline in P. falciparum cases versus P. vivax is evident, but the latter persists in high proportions and therefore new tools for malaria control will be needed for elimination.","output":"Four decades of epidemiological data reveal trajectories towards malaria elimination in Kheda district (Gujarat), western part of India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case series of 15 patients shows in a cross-sectional design the association between antinuclear antibodies and joint pain in post covid syndrome.

The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients and professionals in a radiation oncology department. Materials and methods We implement a plan with the objectives of maintaining radiotherapy treatment in those patients who need it and, at the same time, reducing the risk of spreading the virus to staff and patients. This plan included measures aimed at limiting the patient's stay in hospital, selecting those patients in whom radiotherapy cannot be delayed and protecting against infection through the use of physical protective measures. Results Between March 16 and May 31, 2020, 360 patients received radiotherapy in our department. In 14 patients (4.7%) the start of treatment was delayed by an average of 28 days. Four patients had a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) (6.6% and 1.1% of tested and all patients, respectively). Among the professionals, two PCR s were positive (16.6% and 4% of tested and all individuals, respectively). In the serology analysis 4 out of 50 department members were IgG positive (8%). Conclusions Despite the fact that our department is located in a region with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, the impact of the pandemic on our patients and staff has been moderate.

Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one- or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.","output":"Genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel reassortant mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from a diarrheic piglet and seroepidemiological survey of MRV3 in diarrheic pigs from east China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influential theories of skilled action posit that distinct cognitive mechanisms and neuroanatomic substrates support meaningless gesture imitation and tool use pantomiming, and poor performance on these tasks are hallmarks of limb apraxia. Yet prior research has primarily investigated brain-behavior relations at the group level; thus, it is unclear whether we can identify individuals with isolated impairments in meaningless gesture imitation or tool use pantomiming whose performance is associated with a distinct neuroanatomic lesion profile. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with disproportionately worse performance in meaningless gesture imitation would exhibit cortical damage and white matter disconnection in left fronto-parietal brain regions, whereas individuals with disproportionately worse performance in tool use pantomiming would exhibit cortical damage and white matter disconnection in left temporo-parietal brain regions. Fifty-eight participants who experienced a left cerebrovascular accident took part in a meaningless gesture imitation task, a tool use pantomiming task, and a T1 structural MRI. Two participants were identified who had relatively small lesions and disproportionate impairments on one task relative to the other, as well as below-control-level performance on one task and not the other. Using these criteria, one participant was disproportionately impaired at meaningless gesture imitation, and the other participant was disproportionately impaired at pantomiming tool use. Graph theoretic analysis of each participants structural disconnectome demonstrated that disproportionately worse meaningless gesture imitation performance was associated with disconnection among the left inferior parietal lobule, the left superior parietal lobule, and the left middle and superior frontal gyri, whereas disproportionately worse tool use pantomiming performance was associated with disconnection between left temporal and parietal regions. Our results demonstrate that relatively focal lesions to specific portions of the Tool Use Network can be associated with distinct limb apraxia subtypes. Highlights Distinct subtypes of apraxia are supported by distinct neuroanatomic substrates. Fronto-parietal lesions are associated with meaningless imitation deficits.

We sought to characterize faculty's self-reported changes in engagement and productivity in clinical, education, and scholarly efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to correlate the changes with age, gender, and level of COVID-19 exposure. We also sought to determine if differences in faculty engagement and productivity were related to departmental efforts to create virtual community, manage conflict, foster engagement with colleagues, and support faculty emotional well-being. METHODS: We surveyed family medicine department faculty nationally on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their engagement and productivity in clinical care, teaching and research, and on the effect of departmental efforts on well-being. RESULTS: Most respondents reported decreased engagement and productivity across clinical, teaching, and research domains. Older age and male gender were associated with higher clinical engagement. Most respondents were satisfied with their departments' virtual community but reported that social distancing had a negative impact on departmental ability to problem-solve and on personal emotional well-being. Higher engagement and productivity in all three domains of effort (clinical, teaching, and research) were associated with respondents' well-being and with positive perceptions of their department's efforts.

Patient characteristics upon admission and anthropometrics, waist circumference and hunger levels assessed during follow-up were analyzed across BMI categories. RESULTS: One-hundred-eighty-five COVID-19 survivors (71% male, median age 62.1 [54.3; 72.1] years, 80% with overweight/obesity) were included. Median BMI did not change from admission to V1 in normal weight subjects (-0.5 [-1.2; 0.6] kg/m2, p = 0.08), but significantly decreased in subjects with overweight (-0.8 [-1.8; 0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (-1.38 [-3.4; -0.3] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p < 0.05 vs. normal weight or obesity). Median BMI did not change from V1 to V2 in normal weight individuals (+0.26 [-0.34; 1.15] kg/m2, p = 0.12), but significantly increased in subjects with overweight (+0.4 [0.0; 1.0] kg/m2, p < 0.001) or obesity (+0.89 [0.0; 1.6] kg/m2, p < 0.001; p = 0.01 vs. normal weight).

More specifically, regarding time, in field-based coordination it is assumed that local activities in each device, called computational rounds, are regulated by a fixed clock, typically, a fair and unsynchronized distributed scheduler. In this work, we challenge this assumption, and propose an alternative approach where the round execution scheduling is naturally programmed along with the usual coordination specification, namely, in terms of a field of causal relations dictating what is the notion of causality (why and when a round has to be locally scheduled) and how it should change across time and space. This abstraction over the traditional view on global time allows us to express what we call time-fluid coordination, where causality can be finely tuned to select the event triggers to react to, up to to achieve improved balance between performance (system reactivity) and cost (usage of computational resources).

METHODS A qualitative interview study was conducted. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 29 healthcare professionals; 12 nurses, five GPs, five consultants and registrar doctors, two pharmacists and five support therapists working in primary, secondary or tertiary care in the United Kingdom and involved in community end-of life care of 0-18-year-olds.

Across themes, the concepts of partnership working between families and healthcare professionals, and within healthcare teams, and sharing expertise were prevalent. CONCLUSION Partnership working and trust between healthcare professionals and parents, and within healthcare teams, is needed for effective at-home paediatric palliative pain management.

Our aim was to assess the value of three frontline ovarian cancer therapies by using this framework. METHODS From phase III, randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) data, the net health benefits (NHBs) for three frontline ovarian cancer treatment options-dose-dense paclitaxel (Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group study JGOG 3016), intraperitoneal (IP)/intravenous (IV) chemotherapy (Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG] study GOG 172), and concurrent plus maintenance bevacizumab (GOG 218 and the Seventh International Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm study [ICON7])-were calculated. The ASCO value framework calculates the NHB by using six criteria: clinical benefit, toxicity, tail of the curve, symptom palliation, treatment-free interval, and quality of life. Clinical benefit calculation uses ASCO-assigned importance weights for overall survival and progression-free survival. The maximum possible NHB points is 180. NHBs were presented alongside the drug-acquisition cost (DAC) of each therapy. A benefit-cost ratio of NHB points per additional cost was calculated. RESULTS The NHB of dose-dense paclitaxel was 38, at an additional cost of $16 per cycle. IP cisplatin/IV + IP paclitaxel received 29 NHB points, at an additional cost of $1,629 per cycle. Concurrent plus maintenance bevacizumab received 24 NHB points, at an additional cost of $7,581 per cycle (GOG 218) or six NHB points ($3,790 per cycle; ICON7). The ratios of NHB points-to-dollar were as follows: dose-dense paclitaxel, 2.4 (highest); IP chemotherapy, 0.018; and bevacizumab, 0.003 (lowest).

Different factors during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted key features of conducting a good meta-analysis. Some meta-analyses did not evaluate or treat substantial heterogeneity (I(2) > 75%); others did not include additional analysis for publication bias; none checked for evidence of pChacking in the primary studies nor used recent methods (i.e., p-curve or p-uniform) to estimate the average population-size effect. These inconsistencies may contribute to contradictory results in the research evaluating COVID-19 treatments. A prominent example of this is the use of hydroxychloroquine, where some studies reported a large positive effect, whereas others indicated no significant effect or even increased mortality when hydroxychloroquine was used with the antibiotic azithromycin. In this paper, we first recall the benefits and fundamental steps of good quality meta-analysis. Then, we examine various meta-analyses on hydroxychloroquine treatments for COVID-19 patients that led to contradictory results and causes for this discrepancy.

Although the transportation sector is widely acknowledged as among the largest contributors to urban air pollution, quantifying its causal effects on air pollution is challenging, as decisions to travel are endogenous with air quality. The spread of COVID-19 offers a unique opportunity for causal identification, as the pandemic directly affects decisions to travel but has little direct effect on air pollution. Leveraging the number of COVID-19 infections and COVID-19-related queries to online search engines as instruments for decisions to travel, controlling for two-way fixed effects, we quantify the effects of three public transportation subsectors (buses, railways, and taxis) and private vehicles on six primary air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2) of 36 central cities of China, using two-stage ridge regression and double/debiased machine-learning models. Our work demonstrates that the negative effects of urban transportation on air quality are likely to be significantly underestimated without addressing endogeneity in the observational data. Further, our estimates after addressing endogeneity indicate that the effects of public transportation and private vehicles on different air pollutants are heterogeneous.

Clinical trials have found that one group, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has demonstrated clinical benefits across various cancers. However, research focused on the experiences of people affected by cancer who have undergone this treatment using qualitative methodology is currently limited. Moreover, little is known about the experiences and education needs of the healthcare staff supporting the people receiving these immunotherapies. This study therefore seeks to explore the experiences of using ICIs by both the people affected by cancer and the healthcare professionals who support those people, and use the findings to make recommendations for ICI supportive care guidance development, cancer immunotherapy education materials for healthcare professionals, cancer policy and further research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Patient participants (n=up to 30) will be recruited within the UK. The sample will incorporate a range of perspectives, sociodemographic factors, diagnoses and ICI treatments, yet share some common experiences. Healthcare professionals (n=up to 15) involved in supporting people receiving immunotherapy will also be recruited from across the UK. Data will be generated through in-depth, semistructured interviews. Reflexive thematic analysis will be used to obtain thorough understanding of individual's perspectives on, and experiences of, immunotherapy. Study dates are as follows: December 2019-March 2022. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research will be performed in accordance with the UK Policy for Health and Social Care Research and Cardiff University's Research Integrity and Governance Code of Practice (2018). The study received ethical approval from the West Midlands and Black Country Research Ethics Committee in October 2019. Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales approvals were confirmed in December 2019. All participants will provide informed consent. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, non-academic platforms, the Macmillan Cancer Support website, disseminated at relevant national and international conferences and presented via a webinar.

The need to develop easy to use, rapid, robust and with minimal hands-on time approaches are warranted. In this setting, the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test may be a valuable option. The aim of our study is to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of this assay on previously tested SARS-CoV-2 people by conventional RT-PCR based approach in different settings, including initial diagnosis and clinical follow-up. METHODS: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test, we retrieved 55 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analysed by a fully validated assay, from symptomatic patients or from people who have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive cases. Discordant or high discrepant cases were further analysed by a third technique. In addition, a second subset of 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples with uncertain results (cycle threshold between 37 and 40), by using the fully validated assay, from patients with viral infection beyond day 21, were retrieved. RESULTS: Overall, Idylla showed a sensitivity of 93.9% and a specificity of 100.0%. In addition, in the additional 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples, only five (35.7%) featured a positive result by the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test.

Here, we proposed to assess the relationship between IL-6 and outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our cohort consisted of 46 adult patients with PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted in a COVID-19 ward of the Hospital de Braga (HB) from April 7 to May 7, 2020, whose IL-6 levels were followed over time. We found that IL-6 levels were significantly different between the disease stages. Also, we found a significant negative correlation between IL-6 levels during stages IIb and III, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO(2)), showing that IL-6 correlates with respiratory failure. Compared to the inflammatory markers available in the clinic routine, we found a positive correlation between IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). However, when we assessed the predictive value of these two markers, IL-6 behaves as a better predictor of disease progression. In a binary logistic regression, IL-6 level was the most significant predictor of the non-survivors group, when compared to age and CRP.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) face unique challenges during the pandemic, including concerns regarding infection risk, drug shortages, limited access to care, social isolation, and mental health. This review will examine the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients living with RA. RECENT FINDINGS: In patients with RA, risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes include older age and comorbidities, similar to those in the general population. Glucocorticoids, but not other classes of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), appear to be associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. RA patients have been affected by changes in access to care, telemedicine, drug shortages, anxiety, and social isolation, which may contribute to disease flares. SUMMARY: Glucocorticoids, but not other DMARDs, are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in RA patients. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of specific DMARDs on COVID-19 outcomes, understand the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on RA disease activity, and optimize the use of telemedicine in RA management.","output":"COVID-19 and rheumatoid arthritis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Use of public transportation could be associated with an increased risk for developing COVID-19.

By searching in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CNKI, we identified 13 retrospective studies and 6 random control trials eligible for criteria of inclusion, and conducted comprehensive meta-analyses assessing the impacts of corticosteroids on mortality, length of stay, duration of RNA clearance and duration of fever. Our multicenter study demonstrated that low-dose corticosteroids can reduce mortality in the multivariable Cox regression analysis for severe patients (p = .03), while presented no influence in univariable analysis for non-severe patients (p = .14). From multivariable analyses, patients with corticosteroids in non-severe group had longer duration of hospitalization (p = .003), but did not in severe group (p = .18). Moreover, for severe patients, corticosteroids can evidently shorten duration of fever. The same results were summarized in the meta-analyses supplemented with the result that corticosteroids delayed viral clearing in non-severe patients. Corticosteroids should be considered based on patient's condition. For patients with non-severe COVID-19, corticosteroid was not recommended as a routine therapeutic initiative as that presented prolonged duration of hospitalization and delayed viral clearing, as well as no positive impact on prognosis.

It is now questionable how PAD can be affected by changes in lifestyle imposed by the Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic. This study's main objective is to evaluate how the limitations of social behavior set by Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic impact the perception and evolution of the disease in a group of patients with a diagnosed PAD. METHODS: The changes in the in the perception and the evolution of the PAD were evaluated by comparing results of a modified VascuQol-6 quality of life (QoL) survey referring to the time frame defined No-Sars-CoV-2 period (from July to December 2019) with results referring to the time frame defined Sars-CoV-2 period (from January to June 2020). An overall score (range 4-60) was calculated, and a comparison between the two period studies was reported. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves evaluated a delta value for each patient with revascularization of lower limb peripheral arteries. Optimal cut-offs were chosen based on their specificity, sensitivity. RESULTS: One-hundred-two PAD patients gave their informed consent to take part in the study. A significant general worsening of patients PAD perception in the Sars-CoV-2 period was recorded for the following items: lower limbs health status perception; overall activity limitation; walking ability limitation; overall daily walking distance; lower limbs fatigue perception; concerns about PAD worsening; pain discomfort (P < 0.05).

While hospital-based inpatient addiction consult services can also improve outcomes for patients using drugs, inpatient clinical care is often focused on acute withdrawal and the medical management of substance use disorders. There has been limited exploration of the integration of community-based harm reduction programs into the hospital setting. We conducted a qualitative study to describe provider perspectives on the implementation of a harm reduction in-reach program. METHODS: We conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with providers from three different primary work sites within a safety net hospital in Boston, MA, in 2021. Interviews explored perceived facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the harm reduction in-reach program in the hospital setting and solicited recommendations for potential improvements to the harm reduction in-reach program. Interviews were analyzed using an inductive approach that incorporated principles of grounded theory methodology to identify prevailing themes. RESULTS: Twenty-four participants were interviewed from the harm reduction in-reach program, inpatient addiction consult service, and the hospital observation unit. Thematic analysis revealed seven major themes and multiple facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the harm reduction in-reach program. Participants highlighted the impact of power differences within the medical hierarchy on inter-team communication and clinical care, the persistence of addiction-related stigma, the importance of coordination and role delineation between care team members, and the benefits of a streamlined referral process.

In cats with inflammatory conditions, fever is a common finding, with leucocytosis due to the release of cells from the marginal pool, followed by activation of myelopoiesis. Because excitement frequently causes leucocytosis in cats, a diagnosis of inflammation should therefore be supported by additional findings such as the presence of toxic neutrophils. The major APPs are serum amyloid A and (1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), which both increase a few hours after the inflammatory stimulus and remain elevated for as long as the inflammation persists.

Yin yoga is an adaptable, quiet practice ideal for those lacking previous yoga experience, flexibility, and time. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a 6-week yin yoga and meditation intervention on College of Pharmacy faculty and students' stress perception, anxiety levels, and mindfulness skills. METHODS: Faculty and students participated in a 6-week pilot program comprising a once-weekly yin yoga class followed by guided meditation. Yin yoga was selected for its quiet meditative style. Participants completed a pre- and postquestionnaire at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months to evaluate potential changes in perceived stress scores, anxiety scores, and mindfulness skills. The questionnaire was composed of 3 self-reporting tools: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Stress Scale, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty participants, 12 students and 8 faculty (ages 18-66 years), completed the study. Anxiety and stress scores decreased, and mindfulness increased at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, with all changes reaching statistical significance. No participants reported being in the \\"high\\" category of anxiety after intervention using BAI categorical data, although this finding was not statistically significant.

Here, we determined how aging contributes to the altered gene expression related to mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomeric length processes that play an important role in the progression of COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). METHODS: Total RNA from the human lung tissues of non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF were processed and analyzed using a Nanostring platform based on their ages (younger: <55 years and older: >55 years). RESULTS: Several genes were differentially expressed in younger and older smokers, and patients with COPD and IPF compared to non-smokers which were part of the mitochondrial biogenesis/function (HSPD1, FEN1, COX18, COX10, UCP2 & 3), cellular senescence (PCNA, PTEN, KLOTHO, CDKN1C, TNKS2, NFATC1 & 2, GADD45A), and telomere replication/maintenance (PARP1, SIRT6, NBN, TERT, RAD17, SLX4, HAT1) target genes. Interestingly, NOX4 and TNKS2 were increased in the young IPF as compared to the young COPD patients. Genes in the mitochondrial dynamics and quality control mechanisms like FIS1 and RHOT2 were decreased in young IPF compared to their age matched COPD subjects. ERCC1 and GADD45B were higher in young COPD as compared to IPF. Aging plays an important role in various infectious diseases including the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Lung immunoblot analysis of smokers, COPD and IPF subjects revealed increased abundance of proteases and receptor/spike protein like TMPRSS2, furin, and DPP4 in association with a slight increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor ACE2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings suggest that altered transcription of target genes that regulate mitochondrial function, cellular senescence, and telomere attrition in the pathobiology of lung aging in COPD and IPF is associated with alterations in SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 axis as pharmacological targets for COVID-19.","output":"Age-Dependent Assessment of Genes Involved in Cellular Senescence, Telomere, and Mitochondrial Pathways in Human Lung Tissue of Smokers, COPD, and IPF: Associations With SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 ACE2-TMPRSS2-Furin-DPP4 Axis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which remain the number one contributor to mortality worldwide.

In particular, 2020/ 2021 has seen a significant increase in successful phishing attacks mainly due to the rise in human vulnerabilities caused by the global COVID-19 situation. In this paper, we consider the human factors of the phishing attack. We explore the evolution of the phishing attack with particular reference to its many different guises. Following that, the paper discusses the concept of trust and the human trust issues resulting from a phishing attack;it will focus on human vulnerability and the idea of phishing awareness. The findings from the study show that people feel that they can confidently recognize a phishing attack but it also highlights how personal attitudes and situational influences can make certain online users more susceptible than others. The findings also clearly detail how the phishing attack makes them and others feel and they assertively suggest ways to counter the attack.

Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users' levels of stress and depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% (16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and two. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available online-based interventions.

In this study, we analysed the responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol (ISO) of left atria isolated from Syphacia-infested (SYPH) and control, non-infested adult male Wistar rats (CONT). In the non-infested animals, ISO pD(2) was not significantly changed by ivermectin treatment. Whereas the maximal inotropic response to ISO was not significantly affected, the pD(2) value was decreased in SYPH (7.61 +/- 0.09, n = 7, vs 8.21 +/- 0.25 in CONT, n = 5, P < 0.05), indicating lower sensitivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation. This change was similar to that caused by a classic stressor, namely repeated immobilization, in non-infested rats (IMMO). In this group, ISO pD(2) was 7.62 +/- 0.14, n = 6 (P < 0.05 with relation to CONT). The results indicate that infestation with Syphacia sp. is as effective as immobilization at diminishing cardiac reactivity to beta-adrenergic stimulation.

Dietary protein is essential for skeletal muscle function, but older adults do not anabolise muscle in response to protein supplementation as well as younger people, so called anabolic resistance. The aetiology and molecular mechanisms for this are not understood, however the gut microbiome is known to play a key role in several of the proposed mechanisms. Thus, we hypothesise that the gut microbiome may mediate anabolic resistance and therefore represent an exciting new target for ameliorating muscle loss in older adults. This study aims to test whether modulation of the gut microbiome using a prebiotic, in addition to protein supplementation, can improve muscle strength (as measured by chair-rise time) versus protein supplementation alone. METHODS: The study is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with two parallel arms; one will receive prebiotic and protein supplementation, and the other will receive placebo (maltodextrin) and protein supplementation. Participants will be randomised as twin pairs, with one twin from each pair in each arm. Participants will be asked to take supplementation once daily for 12 weeks in addition to resistance exercises. Every participant will receive a postal box, containing their supplements, and the necessary equipment to return faecal, urine, saliva and capillary blood samples, via post. A virtual visit will be performed using online platform at the beginning and end of the study, with measures taken over video. Questionnaires, food diary and cognitive testing will be sent out via email at the beginning and end of the study. DISCUSSION: This study aims to provide evidence for the role of the gut microbiome in anabolic resistance to dietary protein. If those who take the prebiotic and protein supplementation have a greater improvement in muscle strength compared with those who take protein supplementation alone, this would suggest that strategies to modify the gut microbiome may reduce anabolic resistance, and therefore potentially mitigate sarcopenia and frailty in older adults.

The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.","output":"Impact du SARS-CoV2 sur la structuration de la prise en charge du cancer : exemple de la tenue des RCP de cancrologie en Occitanie./ [COVID-19 impact on the cancer care structuration: Example of the multidisciplinary team meeting dedicated to oncology in Occitanie]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19 reached Belgium in February and quickly became a major public health challenge It is of importance to evaluate the actual impact of COVID-19 on patients and staff in Belgian radiotherapy departments (RTDs) This was evaluated through a weekly national survey sent to departments measuring key factors that were affected by the pandemic Materials and Methods: The Belgian SocieTy for Radiation Oncology (BeSTRO) together with the Belgian College for physicians in Radiation Oncology invited all 26 RTD to participate in a survey that started on March 2nd and was re- submitted weekly for 4 months to assess variations in time The survey focused on: (1) the COVID-19 status of patients and staff;(2) the management of clinically suspected COVID patients and COVID positive patients;(3) the impact of COVID-19 on RTD activities;(4) its impact in radiotherapy indications and fractionation schemes","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients and Staff in Radiation Oncology Departments in Belgium: A National Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Before the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was among the top priorities for global public health.

We aim to report the perceptions of a large sample of MHCI workers and government administrators and provide recommendations for developing a national mental health disaster response management plan in China. METHODS: An in-depth qualitative study was conducted, collecting data from 20 focus-group discussions and 25 key stakeholder interviews. These recruited participants who had been involved in different types of disaster rescue across 7 provinces/cities where disasters have recently occurred. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data and relevant findings were extracted for policy recommendation. RESULTS: Mental health workers perspectives were examined in detailed according to four core themes: forms of organization, intervention pathway, intervention strategy and technique, and public health information. Post-disaster MHCI should be approached in teams that are integrated with emergency medicine systems, and be led by unified command management. All levels of local health and family planning commission should prepare post-disaster MHCI work plans and build response teams/emergency centres. Future training for MHCI workers should focus on: building a sense of trust within the team; clarifying each members role; strengthening the screening, assessment and referrals training for psychological professionals; and providing psychological intervention training for Chinese psychiatrists. It is necessary to set up guiding principles for disaster research ethics, mental health rehabilitation and media interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Through exploring and analyzing the perceptions of current disaster response mental health workers and government administrators, our findings provide essential recommendations for developing a national to county level post-disaster MHCI emergency management plan and can guide the formulation of relevant laws and regulation in China.

Learning to read is a requirement for becoming a self-providing human being. However, while spoken language is acquired naturally with exposure to language without explicit instruction, reading and writing need to be taught explicitly. Decades of research have shown that well-structured teaching of phonological awareness, letter knowledge, and letter-to-sound mapping is crucial in building solid foundations for the acquisition of reading. During the COVID-19 pandemic, children worldwide did not have access to consistent and structured teaching and are, as a consequence, predicted to be behind in the development of their reading skills. Subsequent evidence confirms this prediction. With the best evidence-based practice in mind, we developed an online version of a well-structured early literacy training program (Reading Camp) for 5-year-old children. This 2-week online Reading Camp program is designed for pre-K children. It incorporates critical components of the fundamental skills essential to learning to read and is taught online in an interactive, multi-sensory, and peer-learning environment. We measure the participants literacy skills and other related skills before and after participating in the online Reading Camp and compare the results to no-treatment controls. Results show that children who participated in the online Reading Camp improved significantly on all parameters in relation to controls. Our results demonstrate that a well-structured evidence-based reading instruction program, even if online and short-term, benefits 5-year-old children in learning to read. With the potential to scale up this online program, the evidence presented here, alongside previous evidence for the efficacy of the in-person program, indicates that the online Reading Camp program is effective and can be used to tackle a variety of questions regarding structural and functional plasticity in the early stages of reading acquisition.","output":"Can an Online Reading Camp Teach 5-Year-Old Children to Read?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and development of new vaccines, the issue of post-vaccination exacerbation or manifestation of demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disorders has gained increasing attention. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 68-year-old woman previously diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) since the 1980s who suffered a rapidly progressive severe sensorimotor paraparesis with loss of bladder and bowel control due to an acute longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) after immunization with the mRNA PfizerCBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Detection of Aquaporin-4-antibodies (AQP4) in both serum and CSF led to diagnosis of AQP4-antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Treatment with intravenous corticosteroids and plasmapheresis led to a slight improvement of the patients symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic mechanisms of post-vaccination occurrence of NMOSD are still unknown. However, cases like this should make aware of rare neurological disorders manifesting after vaccination and potentially contribute to improvement of management of vaccinating patients with inflammatory CNS disorders in the future. So far two cases of AQP4-antibody positive NMOSD have been reported in association with viral vector COVID-19 vaccines.

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the acute stroke care processes and outcomes in tertiary COVID-19-dedicated centers in South Korea. Methods: We included 1,213 patients with acute stroke admitted to three centers in three cities (Seoul, Seongnam, and Daegu) through the stroke critical pathway between September 2019 and May 2020 (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). In all three centers, we collected baseline characteristics and parameters regarding the stroke critical pathway, including the number of admitted patients diagnosed with acute stroke through the stroke critical pathway, door to brain imaging time, door to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator time, door to groin puncture time, and door to admission time. We performed an interrupted time series analysis to determine the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on outcomes and critical pathway parameters. Results: Three centers modified the protocol of the stroke critical pathway during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an immediate decrease in the number of patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke after the outbreak of COVID-19 in Korea, especially in the center of Daegu, an epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the number of patients with stroke soon increased to equal that before the Covid-19 outbreak. In several critical pathway parameters, door to imaging time showed a temporary increase, and door to admission was transiently decreased after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, there was no significant effect on the timely trend. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes between the periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the COVID-19 outbreak immediately affected the management process. However, it did not have a significant overall impact on the trends of stroke treatment processes and outcomes.

However, due to high prevalence rates of trauma-related mental disorders in this region, it is important to scale up existing Internet-based interventions in order to increase the number of clients. Objective The aim of the study was to examine whether a brief Internet-based intervention with one cognitive technique (TF-short, 6 assignments) results in the same PTSD symptom change and lower dropouts compared to a longer intervention with two cognitive techniques (TF-reg, 10 assignments). Method A total of 224 Arab participants (67.4% female; M = 25.3 years old) with PTSD were randomly assigned to Internet-based CBT with either a TF-reg protocol (n = 110) or a TF-short protocol (n = 114). Symptoms of PTSD and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, quality of life) were self-assessed online at baseline and post-treatment. Treatment-associated changes were estimated using multigroup latent difference score models. Results The overall PTSD score assessed with the PDS decreased by about 15 points in both conditions. The between-group differences (TF-reg vs. TF-short) at post-assessment were non-significant,  = 0.29, p = .896, d = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.34].

Overall, the dropout rates did not differ between the two conditions, 2 (1/N = 175) = 0.83, p = .364. Conclusions The findings suggest that the shorter condition results in the same symptom change and dropout rate as the longer condition.

This report summarizes the evaluation of antibody tests used in the representative population-based serological study of SARS-CoV-2 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Methods: We used three different antibody tests throughout the study: chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) CoronaPass total antibodies test, and ELISA SARS-CoV-2-IgG-EIA-BEST. Clinical sensitivity was estimated with the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test as the gold standard and specificity in pre-pandemic sera samples using the cut-off recommended by manufacturers. Paired and unpaired serum sets were used. Measures of concordance were also calculated in the seroprevalence study sample against the microneutralization test (MNA). Findings: Sensitivity was equal to 91.1% (95% CI: 78.8-97.5) and 90% (95% CI: 76.4-96.4) for ELISA Coronapass and ELISA Vector-Best respectively. It was equal to 63.1% (95% CI (50.2-74.7) for CMIA Abbott. Specificity was equal to 100% for all the tests. Comparison of ROCs for three tests has shown lower AUC for CMIA Abbott, but not for ELISA Coronapass and CMIA Abbott. The cutoff SC/O ratio of 0.28 for CMIA-Abbott resulted in a sensitivity of 80% at the same full level of specificity. In less than one-third of the population-based study participants with positive antibody test results, we detected neutralizing antibodies in titers 1:80 and above. There was a moderate correlation between antibody assays results and MNA. Interpretation: Our validation study encourages the use of local antibody tests for population-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and sets the reference for the seroprevalence correction. Available tests are sensitive enough to detect antibodies in most individuals with previous positive PCR tests with a follow-up of more than 5 months. The Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG's sensitivity can be significantly improved by incorporating a new cut-off. Relying on manufacturers' test characteristics for correction of reported prevalence estimates may introduce bias to the study results.","output":"Evaluation of the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays for the longitudinal population-based study of COVID-19 spread in St. Petersburg, Russia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To survey medical graduates from the University of Hong Kong on how well they perceived their learning needs had been fulfilled by the old (before 1997) and the new (after 1997) curricula.

Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). RESULTS: Over the course of the study 576 participants reported testing positive for COVID-19. Using regression analysis including individual and time fixed effects we found that psychological distress increased by 0.29 standard deviations (p <.001) during the two-week period when participants first tested positive for COVID-19. Distress levels remained significantly elevated (d = 0.16, p <.01) for a further two weeks, before returning to baseline levels. Coronavirus symptom severity explained changes in distress attributable to COVID-19, whereby distress was more pronounced among those whose symptoms were more severe and were slower to subside. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that testing positive for COVID-19 is associated with an initial increase in psychological distress that diminishes quickly as symptoms subside. While COVID-19 may not produce lasting psychological distress among the majority of the general population it remains possible that a minority may suffer longer-term mental health consequences.","output":"Acute and longer-term psychological distress associated with testing positive for COVID-19: longitudinal evidence from a population-based study of US adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 was first detected in China and has now become a global pandemic. Government reactions varied in different countries. In Malta, the authorities took immediate action, assessments scaling of the potential public health threat. The article aims to briefly outline Malta's pandemic preparedness while describing the processes and purchases to face this pandemic. Costings for this exercise in risk mitigation were estimated as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product and the national budget. RESULTS: Among many actions, the Intensive Care facilities were ramped up from 20 beds in one area to 100 beds in five areas. Up to 600 extra COVID-19 beds for severely ill patients were also catered for, in addition to creation of several swabbing centers.

The primary treatment of choice for a sonographic short cervix was cervical cerclage in 10/33 (30%) clinics and vaginal progesterone in 6/33 (18%), with 10/33 (30%) using multiple first-line options and 6/33 (18%) using a combination of treatments. The majority of clinics planned timing of first review for 12-16 weeks (30/35, 86%) and the frequency of review was usually determined by clinical findings (18/24, 75%). There was a wide variation in gestational age at clinic discharge between 24 and 37 weeks. CONCLUSIONS There is variation in the referral criteria, investigations and interventions offered in preterm birth clinics and in the timing and frequency of review. Consistency in practice may improve with the introduction of consensus guidelines and national preterm birth prevention programmes.

They were forced to cope with many changes at different levels of life: personal, professional, social. For many, the soft skills such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, time management, being present, being empathetic or self-regulation were the main resource for effective adaptation. This is the reason why we need to adopt a new education vision, focused on developing soft skills for teachers and students, and finally for society. The aim of the present research was to analyse the respondents' perception of the soft skills which help them cope with the Covid-19 pandemic period. A questionnaire regarding teachers' skills was used. The research sample consists of 359 respondents.

The study aimed to find out about the knowledge, attitudes and preventative practices of COVID-19 among international students in China during the pandemic. Material: and methods : A cross-section survey was conducted among 300 international students from 13 different universities in Hubei province of China between March and April 2020 which relied upon convenience sampling method. Data was collected through an online Microsoft questionnaire. The analysis of data was done by using software IBM SPSS version 23 with p-value of 0.05 which was considered as statistical significance. Descriptive analysis and multi-linear regression analysis were conducted to find association between variables. Results: and discussion : Out of 300 respondents 153 (51%) of the respondents were female students, of which the majority were single, undergraduate students who were doing medicine 163 (54.3%) and engineering-programmes 68 (22.7%). The results indicated that the vast majority of international students had an impressive knowledge on the causes, risks and spread of COVID-19 and that they were no misconception of the pandemic 229 (76%) to 281 (98%) respectively. These students also demonstrated a markedly positive attitude towards the virus and a feeling that they were almost complete safe being in China 264 (84%). Variations were found on Knowledge scores in age group(P<0.01) and majors (P=0.025), attitude scores on major of study (P=0.015) and experience (P<0.01).

The associations of abnormal findings on early and late CUS with neurobehavior at neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge have not been reported. Objective: To examine the associations between early and late CUS findings and infant neurobehavior at NICU discharge. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included infants enrolled in the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants Study between April 2014 and June 2016. Infants born before 30 weeks' gestational age were included. Exclusion criteria were maternal age younger than 18 years, maternal cognitive impairment, maternal inability to read or speak English or Spanish, maternal death, and major congenital anomalies. Overall, 704 infants were enrolled. The study was conducted at 9 university-affiliated NICUs in Providence, Rhode Island; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Kansas City, Missouri; Honolulu, Hawaii; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; and Torrance and Long Beach, California. Data were analyzed from September 2019 to September 2021. Exposures: Early CUS was performed at 3 to 14 days after birth and late CUS at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age or NICU discharge. Abnormal findings were identified by consensus of standardized radiologists' readings. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurobehavioral examination was performed using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS). Results: Among the 704 infants enrolled, 675 had both CUS and NNNS data (135 [20.0%] Black; 368 [54.5%] minority race or ethnicity; 339 [50.2%] White; 376 [55.7%] male; mean [SD] postmenstrual age, 27.0 [1.9] weeks). After covariate adjustment, lower attention (adjusted mean difference, -0.346; 95% CI, -0.609 to -0.083), hypotonicity (mean difference, 0.358; 95% CI, 0.055 to 0.662), and poorer quality of movement (mean difference, -0.344; 95% CI, -0.572 to -0.116) were observed in infants with white matter damage (WMD).

Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of preterm infants, certain early CUS lesions were associated with hypotonicity and lower attention around term-equivalent age. WMD was associated with poor attention, hypotonicity, and poor quality of movement. Infants with these CUS lesions might benefit from targeted interventions to improve neurobehavioral outcomes during their NICU hospitalization.","output":"Association of Abnormal Findings on Neonatal Cranial Ultrasound With Neurobehavior at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Discharge in Infants Born Before 30 Weeks' Gestation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World Health Organization (WHO) declared novel coronavirus outbreak a 'pandemic' on March 11th, 2020.

However, lifelong physical exercise mitigates aging, as observed in endurance-trained middle-aged athletes (EMA). Aim: We compared and associated testosterone, interleukin 10 (IL-10), and body fat in EMA and untrained age-matched individuals (UAM). Methods: Participants were EMA (n=25; 51.489.49 years) and UAM (n=23; 46.09.37 years). Both groups underwent body composition measurements (evaluated by a skinfold protocol) and blood sampling for IL-10 (assessed through ELISA? kit) and testosterone (assessed with Roche Diagnostics? kit, Mannheim, Germany, by chemiluminescence technique in a third-party laboratory). Results: EMA had lower body fat (14.153.82% vs. 23.424.95%; P<0.05), higher testosterone (751.68191.45 ng/dL vs. 493.04175.15 ng/dL; P<0.05), and higher IL-10 (8.001.21 pg/mL vs. 5.891.16 pg/mL; P<0.05) compared to UAM. A significant linear correlation was found between testosterone and IL-10 (r=0.56; P=0.001), whereas significant inverse correlations were observed between body fat and testosterone (r=-0.52; P=0.001) and body fat and IL-10 (r=-0.69; P=0.001). Conclusions: EMA had higher levels of IL-10 and testosterone and lower body fat in comparison with UAM. In addition, higher IL-10 was associated with increased levels of circulating testosterone and lower body fat. Relevance for Patients: The adoption of endurance training as part of a healthy lifestyle may contribute to decreasing age-related testosterone reduction, besides reducing markers of inflammaging, preventing the occurrence of chronic age-related diseases, and thus contributing to healthy aging. For people who already have chronic diseases, physical exercise can shift the immune system toward a more anti-inflammatory profile and, thus, improve their pathological condition. In both cases, physical exercise can help attenuate the decline in testosterone, decrease body fat, and increase anti-inflammatory levels.","output":"Is lifelong endurance training associated with maintaining levels of testosterone, interleukin-10, and body fat in middle-aged males?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The last century has witnessed the emergence of several previously unknown viruses as life-threatening human pathogens.

Research on social capital and COVID-19 has yielded mixed results, with some studies finding it to be protective while others identifying it as a risk factor. We examined the association between social capital and COVID-19 at a finer spatial scale than previous research, and examined changes in the relationship over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: Routine COVID-19 surveillance data from Wales were linked to estimates of social capital at a small area level. Generalised linear mixed effects models predicting COVID-19 case rates across areas using social capital estimates and possible confounding variables were fitted to the data. A moving window version of the analysis explored whether this relationship varied across time. RESULTS: Areas with higher levels of social capital had lower rates of COVID-19 (rate ratio for trust=0.94, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.96; rate ratio for belonging=0.94, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.96). These associations were strongest during periods of lockdown, with evidence that social capital was less protective, and potentially even a risk factor, during periods when restrictions were eased. Trust, but not belonging, remained protective after adjusting for deprivation, population density, ethnicity and proportion population aged over 65 years.

Design/methodology/approach: The research applies an exploratory case study design considering an emerging-market multinational insurance company headquartered in Colombia. Four subsidiaries (El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Colombia) and the Corporate Office (headquarter) served as the research sites. It also adopts an interpretive research approach providing a grounded theory framework linking international knowledge transfer and product innovation. Findings: The empirical findings emphasize the central role played by the enablers (i.e. shared vision, empathy and knowledge sources) in facilitating international knowledge transfer, which, in turn, enhances product innovation. More important, however, is the detailed explanation that the paper provides regarding the enablers microfoundational antecedents in terms of key activities that are performed at the team-level. Research limitations/implications: The grounded theory framework was constructed using data collected in a single firm associated with a particular industry and regional context. The study only considered a single aspect of knowledge management (i.e. knowledge transfer). Other aspects of knowledge management systems, such as knowledge creation and knowledge application, should be used for explaining product innovation in EMNEs more comprehensively. Practical implications: The study suggests a set of enabling conditions and activities that should be adopted by managers of EMNEs to improve international knowledge transfer with the aim of triggering product innovation. This includes the design of strategies for strengthening empathy among geographically dispersed teams by providing opportunities for regular live videoconferences among team members aimed at building close bonds, fostering trust and creating a sense of belonging in which participants get to know each other better and to establish a shared vision and a set of guiding principles and commitments for how the team will work. These suggestions are particularly important today when several multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been forced to rearrange their workplace by replacing face-to-face interactions with virtual work dynamics due to the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: Previous studies have confirmed that international knowledge transfer positively influences MNEs innovative performance. However, no studies have been conducted linking both variables in the context of EMNEs in Latin America in the service sector. The research tries to fill this gap. Besides, the paper introduces empathy as a novel enabler for international knowledge transfer and a moderator able to diminish the negative effect that cultural differences and geographical barriers have on the knowledge transfer process. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Exploring the enablers and microfoundations of international knowledge transfer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pneumonia of COVID-19 illness has often a subtle initial presentation making mandatory the use of biomarkers for evaluation of severity and prediction of final patient disposition. We evaluated the use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS & METHODS: We studied 74 patients with COVID-19. Clinical data were collected, and survival predictors were calculated. Blood was collected within 24 hours after admission (day 1) and on day 7. H2S was measured in sera by monobromobimane derivation (MBB) followed by high performance liquid chromatography and correlated to other markers like procalcitonin (PCT) and C- reactive protein (CRP). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 were also measured in serum. RESULTS: Survivors had significantly higher H2S levels on day 1 and 7 after admission. A cut-off point of 150.44 M could discriminate survivors from non-survivors with 80% sensitivity, 73.4% specificity and negative predictive value 95.9%. Mortality after 28 days was 32% with admission levels lower or equal to 150.44 ̦ and 4.1% with levels above 150.44 ̦ (p: 0.0008). Mortality was significantly greater among patients with a decrease of H2S levels from day 1 to day 7 greater or equal to 36% (p: 0.0005). Serum H2S on day 1 was negatively correlated with IL- 6 and CRP and positively correlated with the absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that H2S is a potential marker for severity and final outcome of pneumonia by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

METHODS We reviewed systematically chest imaging manifestations of laboratory-confirmed severe adenovirus pneumonia in eight immunocompetent adults from April 2012 to April 2014. RESULTS All patients showed abnormal results on initial chest radiograph and CT, with the exception of one normal initial chest radiograph. The abnormalities of the initial chest radiographs were unilateral (n=4) or bilateral (n=3), including consolidation (n=4), dense patchy opacity (n=3), ground glass opacity (GGO) (n=1), and pleural effusion (n=1). The initial CT findings consisted of unilateral (n=5) and bilateral (n=3) abnormalities, including consolidation (n=8), GGO (n=2), pleural effusion (n=3) and small nodules (n=1). Focal consolidation was the predominant finding in six patients whose initial CT scans were examined within one week after illness onset. Follow-up radiologic findings showed rapid development of bilateral consolidation within ten days after illness onset, usually accompanied by adjacent ground-glass opacity and pleural effusion. The parenchymal abnormalities began to absorb around two weeks after illness onset, with no appearances of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS Severe adenovirus CAP in immunocompetent adults mainly appears as focal consolidation followed by rapid progression to bilateral consolidation, usually accompanied by adjacent GGO and pleural effusion, which may resemble bacterial pneumonia.

In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across the classification task and the regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives. Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with 422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods.

In order to ensure nursing students' preparedness for entry into anaesthesia nursing practice, it is necessary to measure whether nursing students have achieved the required competence to practice as anaesthesia care providers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the anaesthesia nursing competence of nursing students and to describe factors related to their anaesthesia nursing competence. This study will provide new knowledge to support the curricula of nursing education and new nurses' practice in anaesthesia care. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey design. METHODS: Data from a sample of Finnish nursing students (n = 205) were collected by using an on-line/paper and pencil survey (the Anaesthesia Nursing Competence Scale, 7 categories) in 2017. The assessment was based on self-assessment and used a Visual Analogue Scale (0-100). Descriptive statistics, a Pearson correlation coefficient, independent sample t-tests and a multivariable regression were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The self-assessed overall competence of graduating nursing students was 59 (range 43-73). Approximately half of the students reached an acceptable level (60&#8804;) and half did not. The highest self-assessed category was collaboration within patient care, and the lowest was knowledge of anaesthesia patient care. The number of credits, anaesthesia courses, and experience of clinical practice in anaesthesia nursing were significantly related to anaesthesia nursing competence. CONCLUSIONS: Competence development in the knowledge of anaesthesia patient care should be considered in general nursing education. Student nurses' competence could be developed by providing more opportunities for theoretical studies and clinical practice in anaesthesia nursing. A specialised post-registration education in anaesthesia nursing might be one solution to overcome the limitations in the competence that general nursing education is not fully able to cover for anaesthesia nursing.","output":"Anaesthesia nursing competence: Self-assessment of nursing students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The regionalization of food systems in order to shorten supply chains and develop local agriculture to feed city regions presents particular challenges for food planning and policy The existing foodshed approaches enable one to assess the theoretical capacity of the food self-sufficiency of a specific region, but they struggle to consider the diversity of existing crops in a way that could be usable to inform decisions and support urban food strategies Most studies are based on the definition of the area required to meet local consumption, obtaining a map represented as an isotropic circle around the city, without considering the site-specific pedoclimatic, geographical, and socioeconomic conditions which are essential for the development of local food supply chains In this study, we propose a first stage to fill this gap by combining the Metropolitan Foodshed and Self-sufficiency Scenario model, which already considers regional yields and specific land use covers, with spatially-explicit data on the cropping patterns, soil and topography We use the available Europe-wide data and apply the methodology in the city region of Avignon (France), initially considering a foodshed with a radius of 30 km Our results show that even though a theoretically-high potential self-sufficiency could be achieved for all of the food commodities consumed (&gt;80%), when the specific pedological conditions of the area are considered, this could be suitable only for domestic plant-based products, whereas an expansion of the initial foodshed to a radius of 100 km was required for animal products to provide &gt;70% self-sufficiency We conclude that it is necessary to shift the analysis from the size assessment to the commodity-groupCspecific spatial configuration of the foodshed based on biophysical and socioeconomic features, and discuss avenues for further research to enable the development of a foodshed assessment as a complex of complementary pieces, i e , the foodshed archipelago","output":"Foodshed, Agricultural Diversification and Self-Sufficiency Assessment: Beyond the Isotropic Circle FoodshedA Case Study from Avignon (France)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND It is unclear whether machine learning methods yield more accurate electronic health record (EHR) prediction models compared with traditional regression methods. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to compare machine learning and traditional regression models for 10-year mortality prediction using EHR data. DESIGN This was a cohort study. SETTING Veterans Affairs (VA) EHR data. PARTICIPANTS Veterans age above 50 with a primary care visit in 2005, divided into separate training and testing cohorts (n= 124,360 each). MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYTIC METHODS The primary outcome was 10-year all-cause mortality. We considered 924 potential predictors across a wide range of EHR data elements including demographics (3), vital signs (9), medication classes (399), disease diagnoses (293), laboratory results (71), and health care utilization (149). We compared discrimination (c-statistics), calibration metrics, and diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) of machine learning and regression models. RESULTS Our cohort mean age (SD) was 68.2 (10.5), 93.9% were male; 39.4% died within 10 years. Models yielded testing cohort c-statistics between 0.827 and 0.837. Utilizing all 924 predictors, the Gradient Boosting model yielded the highest c-statistic [0.837, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.835-0.839]. The full (unselected) logistic regression model had the highest c-statistic of regression models (0.833, 95% CI: 0.830-0.835) but showed evidence of overfitting. The discrimination of the stepwise selection logistic model (101 predictors) was similar (0.832, 95% CI: 0.830-0.834) with minimal overfitting. All models were well-calibrated and had similar diagnostic test characteristics. LIMITATION Our results should be confirmed in non-VA EHRs. CONCLUSION The differences in c-statistic between the best machine learning model (924-predictor Gradient Boosting) and 101-predictor stepwise logistic models for 10-year mortality prediction were modest, suggesting stepwise regression methods continue to be a reasonable method for VA EHR mortality prediction model development.","output":"Comparing Machine Learning to Regression Methods for Mortality Prediction Using Veterans Affairs Electronic Health Record Clinical Data."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is now a global health concern.However, there is no detailed analysis of the factors related to patients improvement.We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, CT images, and treatment of COVID-19 patients from two different cities in China.

Recommendations from national and international health organizations suggest minimizing the use of flexible laryngoscopy as a result. Objective: To review evidence on the risks of aerosolization and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care personnel during endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract. Evidence Review: A comprehensive review of literature was performed on April 19, 2020, using the PubMed/MEDLINE (1966-April 2020), Embase (1975-April 2020), and Web of Science (1900-April 2020) databases. All English-language primary research studies were included if they assessed the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 during procedures in the upper aerodigestive tract. The primary outcome measure was disease transmission among health care workers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for accuracy of reporting. Findings: The queries for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 identified 6 articles for systematic review. No studies included in this review provided data for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during flexible laryngoscopy. A total of 204 of 1264 health care workers (16.1%) had procedure-specific infections of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2. Among those, 53 of 221 (24.0%) were exposed during intubation, 1 of 15 (6.7%) during bronchoscopy, and 1 of 1 (100%) during endoscopy-assisted intubation. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial lack of research precludes formal conclusions about the safety of flexible laryngoscopy and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to health care workers. The use of appropriate precautionary measures and personal protective equipment appears to reduce the risk of transmission. Given the uncertainty in transmission and the known benefits of safety precautions, upper airway endoscopy may be reasonable to perform if precautionary steps are taken.","output":"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission During Flexible Laryngoscopy: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is now identified in almost all countries in the world, with poorer regions being particularly more disadvantaged to efficiently mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.

In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 governmental interventions published up to May 22, 2020, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states.

It presents as a hard fixed nodule on digital rectal examination (DRE), and may cause obstructive urinary symptoms and elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, therefore mimicking prostate cancer (PCa) clinically and biochemically. Radiological features of XGP overlap with those of PCa, and the 2 conditions cannot be distinguished by pelvic multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). 68Ga-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has shown its potential in the initial diagnosis and staging of PCa; however, the imaging characteristics of XGP on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT have yet to be reported. Case Description We report the case of a 56-year-old man who had slowly progressing dysuria for 10 years, which was significantly worse for 1 week, and a PSA level of 49.19 ng/L. Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic lesion in the left periphery of the prostate, which was hypointense with capsular irregularity on axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), hyperintense on the diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps resulting in a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 5. The patient was highly suspected of having high-risk PCa and underwent a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for staging. The PET/CT images showed no PSMA uptake in the involved region. Considering that a small proportion of cases of PCa do not express PSMA, a subsequent targeted biopsy was performed, guided by mpMRI. Histopathological examination showed a large number of foamy macrophages in the neutrophile granulocyte infiltrate, and XGP was finally diagnosed. After treatment with antibiotic levofloxacin, the patient's PSA returned to normal, and his dysuria symptoms had disappeared at the 2-month follow-up. Conclusions Non-uptake of PSMA in a lesion may still provide information for a diagnosis by exclusion or regular follow-up checks in patients that are highly suspected to have PCa in clinic or on mpMRI.","output":"False-positive mpMRI and true-negative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT xanthogranulomatous prostatitis: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer care has had to adapt rapidly given the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) issuing recommendations to postpone nonurgent surgeries.

METHODS: This paper investigated the filtration performance of different FFRs using an experimental setup already employed during several studies on FFRs filtration performance. Its high-resolution measuring devices permit to determine filtration performance according to the normative criteria: the pressure drop and the filtration efficiency. Eight different FFRs have been used: four NIOSH-approved FFRs and four not NIOSH-approved with a 'KN95' shape available during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The data show a high disparity between different FFRs purchased by healthcare establishments, and between those that are NIOSH-approved and those that are not NIOSH-approved. The results confirm that the NIOSH certification offers good protection according to the normative criteria. The 'KN95' types present pressure drops which correspond to the normative value, however their efficiencies are lower than the efficiencies of FFRs certified by NIOSH and lower than 95% at the most penetrate particle size.

Commonest comorbidity was hypertension 87 (50.6%). 117 (68.0%) patients were in more deprived group. Baseline characteristics, admission blood profile and reason for admission were evenly matched in both groups. Outcomes were comparable in both groups: transfer to critical care (27.4% vs 27.3%, p 0.991), intubation (18.8% vs 20.2%, p 0.853), 30-day all-cause mortality (19.7% vs 14.5%, p 0.416) and overall poor outcome (30.8% vs 30.9%, p 0.985). Median time to discharge was 7 days longer (17 vs 10 days, p=0.018) and median time to death was 4.5 days longer in more deprived group (17 vs 12.5 days, p=0.388).

In 1999, the Nipah virus outbreak killed 105 Malaysians, while the SARS outbreak of 2003 claimed only 2 lives. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 100 Malaysian lives. There were two waves of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia. First wave of 22 cases occurred from January 25 to February 15 with no death and full recovery of all cases. The ongoing second wave, which commenced on February 27, presented cases in several clusters, the biggest of which was the Sri Petaling Tabligh cluster with an infection rate of 6.5%, and making up 47% of all cases in Malaysia. Subsequently, other clusters appeared from local mass gatherings and imported cases of Malaysians returning from overseas. Healthcare workers carry high risks of infection due to the daily exposure and management of COVID-19 in the hospitals. However, 70% of them were infected through community transmission and not while handling patients. In vulnerable groups, the incidence of COVID-19 cases was highest among the age group 55 to 64 years. In terms of fatalities, 63% were reported to be aged above 60 years, and 81% had chronic comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. The predominant COVID-19 strain in Malaysia is strain B, which is found exclusively in East Asia. However, strain A, which is mostly found in the USA and Australia, and strain C in Europe were also present. To contain the epidemic, Malaysia implemented a Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning on March 18 in 4 phases over 2 months, ending on May 12. In terms of economic impacts, Malaysia lost RM2.4 billion a day during the MCO period, with an accumulated loss of RM63 billion up to the end of April. Since May 4, Malaysia has relaxed the MCO and opened up its economic sector to relieve its economic burden. Currently, the best approach to achieving herd immunity to COVID-19 is through vaccination rather than by acquiring it naturally. There are at least two candidate vaccines which have reached the final stage of human clinical trials. Malaysia's COVID-19 case fatality rate is lower than what it is globally; this is due to the successful implementation of early preparedness and planning, the public health and hospital system, comprehensive contact tracing, active case detection, and a strict enhanced MCO.","output":"COVID-19 Epidemic in Malaysia: Epidemic Progression, Challenges, and Response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The UK has grand ambitions for testing, but is struggling to get it right There are solutions, reports Clare Wilson","output":"How to get a grip on testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to clarify the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic to optimize patients' and clinicians' safety and safeguard health care capacity. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The COVID-19 pandemic heavily impacts health care systems worldwide. Cancer patients appear to have an increased risk for adverse events when infected by COVID-19, but the inability to receive oncological care seems may be an even larger threat, particularly in case of pancreatic cancer. METHODS An online survey was submitted to all members of seven international pancreatic associations and study groups, investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pancreatic surgery using 21 statements (April, 2020). Consensus was defined as >80% agreement among respondents and moderate agreement as 60% to 80% agreement. RESULTS A total of 337 respondents from 267 centers and 37 countries spanning 5 continents completed the survey. Most respondents were surgeons (n = 302, 89.6%) and working in an academic center (n = 286, 84.9%). The majority of centers (n = 166, 62.2%) performed less pancreatic surgery because of the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the weekly pancreatic resection rate from 3 [interquartile range (IQR) 2-5] to 1 (IQR 0-2) (P < 0.001). Most centers screened for COVID-19 before pancreatic surgery (n = 233, 87.3%). Consensus was reached on 13 statements and 5 statements achieved moderate agreement. CONCLUSIONS This global survey elucidates the role of pancreatic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding patient selection for the surgical and oncological treatment of pancreatic diseases to support clinical decision-making and creating a starting point for further discussion.","output":"Global Survey on Pancreatic Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 is straining healthcare systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate between patients requiring hospitalization and those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool and has not been externally validated. Methods: We followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 model. We evaluated the model on two different target populations: i) 41,381 patients that have SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency room visit and ii) 9,429,285 patients that have influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency room visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0 to 30 days. In total we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the US, Europe, Australia and Asia. Findings: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index was a c-statistic of 0.73 and calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data the model obtained c-statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US and South Korean datasets respectively. The calibration was poor with the model under-estimating risk. When validated on 12 datasets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network the c-statistics ranged between 0.40-0.68. Interpretation: The results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 model is low for influenza cohorts, and even worse amongst COVID-19 patients in the US, Spain and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","output":"Can we trust the prediction model?

Among the various nanoliposomes, cationic dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine and cholesterol (ECL)-based nanoliposomes showed the highest pulmonary cellular delivery in vivo and the lowest cytotoxicity in vitro. The delivery efficiency of fluorescent siRNA in ECL nanoliposomes was 26.2-fold higher than that of naked siRNA in vivo.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this kind of topic has not been studied yet. The research method used a questionnaire to briquette business actors and interviews with the management of the Indonesian Coconut Charcoal Entrepreneurs Association (PERPAKI). Respondents received 24 questions encompassing seven dimensions according to their situation. The results of the questionnaire were then analyzed using descriptive qualitative statistics. The study results show that 29% of business operators experienced contract cancellations, 38% experienced temporary closings, and 59% experienced decreased sales. In addition, 97% of business operators experience supply chain disruption due to scarcity of raw materials;the farmers prefer to sell fresh coconuts for export rather than processing them domestically. Lower domestic prices for Copra caused it as the main derivative product and higher prices for fresh Coconut and Coconut Shell Charcoal (CSC) for export due to increased global market demand. For the mitigation and recovery of briquette companies from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the authors recommend three strategic agendas. In the short term, focus on solving shortages of raw materials and improving the Company's cash flow. In the medium term, focus on pioneering the development of supply chains and the national briquette business ecosystem.

Analysis of 2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-free inference (LFI) approach named amortized neural posterior estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a surrogate posterior $\\\\hat{p}(\\\\theta|x)$ as an observation-parametrized conditional probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors within seconds for any observation within the prior support without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also captures expected posterior degeneracies.

The four main hosts are: avian, swine, human and equine, with occasional transmission to other mammalian species. The host diversity is mirrored in the range of the RT-qPCR assays for IAV detection. Different assays are recommended by the responsible health authorities for generic IAV detection in birds, swine or humans. In order to unify IAV monitoring in different hosts and apply the One Health approach, we developed a single RT-qPCR assay for universal detection of all IAVs of all subtypes, species origin and global distribution. The assay design was centred on a highly conserved region of the IAV matrix protein (MP)-segment identified by a comprehensive analysis of 99,353 sequences. The reaction parameters were effectively optimised with efficiency of 93C97% and LOD(95%) of approximately ten IAV templates per reaction.

In India, on January 31, 2020, the first case of COVID-19 was reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Indian scale of fear related to COVID-19 (ISF-C19) Scale was developed in Hindi and was rated by two raters. Then, it was applied on twenty individuals (ten males and ten females) as a pilot study. The study had been conducted in Eastern India, in the state of Jharkhand. ISF-C19 was completed by 118 participants (females C 75; males C 43), aged 18 years or older from the community, and the subjective well-being was assessed. The psychometric properties of this instrument were investigated. Safety measures (i.e., mask, maintaining distance, gloves, and sanitizers) were taken throughout the data collection period. RESULTS: Findings suggested that this scale has adequate sampling, adequate interitem reliability coefficient, and higher overall scores on the ISF-C19 indicated more severe fear related to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In light of the current scenario of the emerging cases in India, there is an urgent need to develop a scale related to COVID-19 as there is no published Indian standardized scale before this recent outbreak of pandemic.

AIMS: We studied the pattern of spatial association between post-acute care services and acute care facilities and evaluated how geographic variability could influence their use. METHODS: We compiled data on CMS-certified acute care and critical access hospitals and post-acute health care services (nursing homes, home health care services, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, and hospice facilities). We used the colocation quotient (CLQ) to measure the magnitude and direction of association (clustering or segregation) between post-acute care providers and hospitals. This metric allows pairwise comparison of categorical data; a value <1 indicates spatial segregation and a value >1 spatial clustering. Unity marks the lack of spatial dependence (random distribution). RESULTS: With the exception of nursing homes (CLQ 1.26), all other types of post-acute care providers are spatially segregated from rural critical access hospitals. Long-term care facilities ranked first (had the lowest global CLQ, 0.06), hospice facilities ranked last (had the highest global CLQ estimate, 0.54). Instead, post-acute care services either clustered with (inpatient rehabilitation 2.76, long-term care 2.10, nursing homes 1.37) or were only weakly segregated (home health care 0.86) from acute care hospitals. Home health care (1.44), hospice services (1.46), and nursing homes (1.08) spatially clustered with the same category of services. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis and we provided illustrative examples of local variation for the states of MA and IA. CONCLUSION: Post-acute care services are isolated from critical access hospitals, and have a clustering pattern with the same category services and acute care hospitals. Such misdistribution of resources may result in both underuse and a substitution effect on the type of post-acute care between rural and urban areas and undermine public health during increasing demand, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Spatial association patterns between post-acute care services and acute care facilities in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Brain injury progression after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with worsening cerebral inflammation but it is unknown how a concomitant bone fracture (BF) affects this progression. Enoxaparin (ENX) decreases penumbral leukocyte mobilization after TBI and improves neurologic recovery. We hypothesized that a concomitant BF worsens learning/memory recovery weeks after TBI and that ENX improves this recovery. METHODS CD1 male mice underwent controlled cortical impact or sham craniotomy with or without tibial fracture, receiving either daily ENX (0.8 mg/kg) or saline for 14 days after injury. Randomization defined four groups (Sham, TBI only, TBI + Fx, TBI + Fx + ENX, n = 5/each). Body weight loss and neurologic recovery (Garcia Neurologic Test, max score = 18) were assessed each day. Mouse learning (swimming time [s] and total distance [m] to reach the submerged platform Days 14 to 17 after TBI) and memory (swimming time [s] in platform quadrant after platform removed [probe]) was assessed by the Morris water maze. Ly-6G (cerebral neutrophil sequestration) and glial fibrillary acidic protein were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in brain tissue post mortem. Analysis of variance with Tukey's post hoc test determined significance (p < 0.05). RESULTS A concurrent BF worsened Garcia Neurologic Test scores post-TBI Days 2 to 4 (p < 0.01) as compared with TBI only, and ENX reversed this worsening on Day 4 (p < 0.01). Learning was significantly slower (greater swimming time and distance) in TBI + Fx versus TBI only on Day 17 (p < 0.01). This was despite similar swimming velocities in both groups, indicating intact extremity motor function. Memory was similar in isolated TBI and Sham which was significantly better than in TBI + Fx animals (p < 0.05). Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in penumbral cortex were most prevalent in TBI + Fx animals, significantly greater than in Sham (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION A long BF accompanying TBI worsens early neurologic recovery and subsequent learning/memory. Enoxaparin may partially counter this and improve neurologic recovery.","output":"A concomitant bone fracture delays cognitive recovery from traumatic brain injury."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Since October 2020 the second wave of the pandemic has been observed around the world, as pathogen specific herd immunity has not been built yet. Moreover, the current, more contagious pathogen carrying the D614G mutation has become the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2. In this article we present the current state of knowledge on the impact of ACE2 and the reninangiotensin system (RAS) and the innate immune system on different outcomes of COVID-19. Especially, we point out the dual role of the immune system and ACE2 in pathogenesis of the disease. Namely, at the initial stage of the infection anti-viral activity of innate immunity is responsible for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. On the other hand, a dysregulated immune response may cause the detrimental hyperinflammation (cytokine storm) responsible for the severe course of the disease. Concomitantly, we analyse the roles of ACE2 in both facilitation of infection and abrogation of its effects, as the major cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and an important enzyme responsible for tissue protection, respectively.

Consecutive adult patients presenting to the ED of two university hospitals in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, between 01-10-2020 and 31-12-2020, who had a final diagnosis of COVID-19, were retrospectively included. D-dimer and CTPA results were obtained. Of 541 patients with a final diagnosis of COVID-19 presenting to the ED, 25 (4.6%) were excluded because D-dimer was missing, and 71 (13.1%) because they used anticoagulation therapy. Of 445 included patients, 185 (41.6%; 95%CI 37.0-46.3) had a D-dimer &#8805; 1.00 mg/L.

This was because a circulating kidney-derived renin angiotensin system was so similar and well established. But, the pursuit of brain RAS has proven to be correct. In the course of accepting brain RAS, high standards of proof attracted state of the art techniques in all the new developments of biolo1gy. Consequently, brain RAS is a robust concept that has enlightened neuroscience as well as cardiovascular physiology and is a model neuropeptide system. Molecular biology confirmed the components of brain RAS and their location in the brain. Transgenic mice and rats bearing renin and extra copies of angiotensinogen genes revealed the importance of brain RAS. Cre-lox delivery in vectors has enabled pinpoint gene deletion of brain RAS in discrete brain nuclei. The new concept of brain RAS includes ACE-2, Ang1C7, and prorenin and Mas receptors. Angiotensin II (ANG II) generated in the brain by brain renin has many neural effects. It activates behavioral effects by selective activation of ANG II receptor subtypes in different locations. It regulates sympathetic activity and baroreflexes and contributes to neurogenic hypertension. New findings implicate brain RAS in a much wider range of neural effects.

We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with psoriasis receiving biologic therapy, patients' current status at a single center in Turkey. A total of 133 patients (mean age; 44.6  13.5 years) were on maintenance biological treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis during the pandemic. A standardized questionnaire was administered by phone interviews to determine patients' perceptions, attitudes, and adherence to therapy and identify the frequency of COVID-19 infection, psoriasis status, and new comorbidities during the pandemic. All patients had been receiving a biological agent including ustekinumab, etanercept, adalimumab, secukinumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, or certolizumab pegol. Ninety-one patients (68.4%) had at least one comorbid condition, including psoriatic arthritis (35.3%), hypertension (19.5%), diabetes mellitus (16.5%), obesity, coronary artery disease, and dyslipidemia. During the first three months of the pandemic, 52 patients (39%) suspended their biological therapies for short (n=33) or long (n=19) periods without medical advice for reasons of fear, worry, and anxiety. All but one patient restarted their medications as a result of therapeutic counseling. Five patients reported suspicious symptoms, but only one had PCR-confirmed COVID-19.

However, the pandemic is still developing, and new mutations are still emerging. Virus pathogenicity is closely related to the immune status of the host. As innate immunity is the bodys first defense against viruses, understanding the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 on innate immunity is of great significance for determining the target of antiviral intervention. This review summarizes the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 escapes the host immune system, including suppressing innate immune production and blocking adaptive immune priming.

On the other hand, we focused on the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 on innate immunity, including enhancing viral adhesion, increasing the rate of virus invasion, inhibiting the transcription and translation of immune-related mRNA, increasing cellular mRNA degradation, and inhibiting protein transmembrane transport. This review on the underlying mechanism should provide theoretical support for developing future molecular targeted drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

There is evidence that some communities are disproportionately affected. This may result in geographic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization risk that, if identified, could guide control efforts. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level geographic disparities and identify predictors of COVID-19 hospitalization risk in the St. Louis area. Methods: Hospitalization data for COVID-19 and several chronic diseases were obtained from the Missouri Hospital Association. ZCTA-level data on socioeconomic and demographic factors were obtained from the US Census Bureau American Community Survey. Age-adjusted COVID-19 and several chronic disease hospitalization risks were calculated. Geographic disparities in distribution of COVID-19 age-adjusted hospitalization risk, socioeconomic and demographic factors as well as chronic disease risks were investigated using choropleth maps. Predictors of ZCTA-level COVID-19 hospitalization risks were investigated using global negative binomial and local geographically weighted negative binomial models. Results: There were geographic disparities of COVID-19 hospitalization risks. COVID-19 hospitalization risks were significantly higher in ZCTAs with high diabetes hospitalization risks (p<0.0001), high risks of COVID-19 cases (p<0.0001), as well as high percentages of black population (p=0.0416) and populations with some college education (p=0.0005). The coefficients of the first three predictors varied across ZCTAs, implying that the associations between COVID-19 hospitalization risks and these predictors varied by geographic location. This implies that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach may not be appropriate for management and control. Conclusions: There is evidence of geographic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization risks that are driven by differences in socioeconomic, demographic and health-related factors. The impacts of these factors vary by geographical location with some factors being more important predictors in some locales than others. Use of both global and local models leads to a better understanding of the determinants of geographic disparities in health outcomes and utilization of health services. These findings are useful for informing health planning to identify geographic areas likely to have high numbers of individuals needing hospitalization as well as guiding vaccination efforts.","output":"Geographic Disparities and Predictors of COVID-19 Hospitalization Risk in the St. Louis Area, Missouri (USA)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The adenovirus vector vaccines induce humoral and cellular immune responses and have been used to develop vaccines for effective prevention of life-threating viruses, such as Ebola and Coronaviruses.

In the bioreactor, we compared the performances of two perfusion systems, the commercially-available XCell ATF? system and a novel peristaltic pump-driven alternating tangential flow perfusion system (PATFP system) that we developed. During cell cultivation stage, both perfusion systems have comparable performances regarding viable cell concentration and cell viability. At 2 dpi, the PATFP system resulted in an adenovirus titer of 2.1  10(10) IFU/mL and cell-specific virus yield of 2,062 IFU/cell, reaching 75% and 77% of values for XCell ATF? system. This study demonstrates the perfusion process to be superior strategy for adenovirus-based vaccine production compared to the batch-mode strategy (1,467 IFU/cell).

However, few studies have examined whether the profound developmental, social, and economic changes that accompany adolescent motherhood contribute to HIV risk. This study examines the intersection between adolescent motherhood and HIV infection across 10 Eastern and Southern African countries, where over half of all HIV infections occur among adolescent girls. METHODS: To evaluate whether adolescent motherhood is associated with HIV infection, we used Demographic and Health Survey data on girls (15-19 years) with HIV test results (N = 19,932) from Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. We examined unweighted bivariate and multivariable associations between adolescent motherhood and HIV using mixed effects logistic regression models that included a country-level random intercept. We examined heterogeneity in the association by testing country-level random slopes using a likelihood ratio test and used intraclass correlation to measure the proportion of total variance explained at the country level. RESULTS: Nearly one fifth of adolescent girls were mothers (range: 9.80%-38.90%), and the HIV prevalence among all adolescent girls was 3.3% (range: 1.03%-10.07%).

In this Review, we provide the latest insights into the complexity and interplay of the components of the non-canonical reninCangiotensin system, and discuss the function and therapeutic potential of targeting this system to treat cardiovascular disease.","output":"Counter-regulatory reninCangiotensin system in cardiovascular disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Strategic management and production of internal energy in autonomous robots is becoming a research topic with growing importance, especially for platforms that target long-endurance missions, with long-range and duration. It is fundamental for autonomous vehicles to have energy self-generation capability to improve energy autonomy, especially in situations where refueling is not viable, such as an autonomous sailboat in ocean traversing. Hence, the development of energy estimation and management solutions is an important research topic to better optimize the use of available energy supply and generation potential. In this work, we revisit the challenges behind the project design and construction for two fully autonomous sailboats and propose a methodology based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in order to find the best way to manage the supplementary energy generated by solar panels. To verify the approach, we introduce a case study with our two developed sailboats that have planned payload with electric and electronics, and one of them is equipped with an electrical engine that may eventually help with the sailboat propulsion. Our current results show that it is possible to augment the system confidence level for the potential energy that can be harvested from the environment and the remaining energy stored, optimizing the energy usage of autonomous vehicles and improving their energy robustness.","output":"Sustainable Solutions for Sea Monitoring With Robotic Sailboats: N-Boat and F-Boat Twins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines become available to patients with autoimmune diseases and SLE, practitioners will have to inform them about the safety and efficacy of these vaccines.

We found that genetic risk variants (RVs) in the trypanolytic factor apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1), present only in individuals of African ancestry, were associated with increased sepsis incidence and severity. Serum APOL1 levels correlated with sepsis and COVID-19 severity, and single-cell sequencing in human kidneys revealed high expression of APOL1 in endothelial cells. Analysis of mice with endothelial-specific expression of RV APOL1 and in vitro studies demonstrated that RV APOL1 interfered with mitophagy, leading to cytosolic release of mitochondrial DNA and activation of the inflammasome (NLRP3) and the cytosolic nucleotide sensing pathways (STING). Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 and STING protected mice from RV APOL1-induced permeability defects and proinflammatory endothelial changes in sepsis. Our studies identify the inflammasome and STING pathways as potential targets to reduce APOL1-associated health disparities in sepsis and COVID-19.","output":"APOL1 risk variants in individuals of African genetic ancestry drive endothelial cell defects that exacerbate sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays social media platforms such as Twitter provide a great opportunity to understand public opinion of climate change compared to traditional survey methods.

This systematic review examines the literature relating to splatter, droplet settle and aerosol for periodontal procedures and forms part of a wider body of research to understand the risk of contamination in relation to periodontal care procedures relevant to COVID-19. METHODS: A search of the literature was carried out using key terms and MeSH words relating to the review questions. Sources included Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science and LILACS, ClinicalTrials.Gov. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were screened in duplicate and data extraction was carried out using a template. All studies were assessed for methodological quality and sensitivity. Narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS: Fifty studies were included in the review with procedures including ultrasonic scaling (n = 44), air polishing (n = 4), prophylaxis (n = 2) and hand scaling (n = 3). Outcomes included bacterial (colony-forming units e.g. on settle plates) or blood contamination (e.g. visible splatter) and non bacterial, non blood (e.g. chemiluminescence or coloured dyes) contamination. All studies found contamination at all sites although the contamination associated with hand scaling was very low. Contamination was identified in all of the studies even where suction was used at baseline. Higher power settings created greater contamination. Distribution of contamination varied in relation to operator position and was found on the operator, patient and assistant with higher levels around the head of the operator and the mouth and chest of the patient. Settle was identified 30 min after treatments had finished but returned to background levels when measured at or after an hour. The evidence was generally low to medium quality and likely to underestimate contamination. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonic scaling, air polishing and prophylaxis procedures produce contamination (splatter, droplets and aerosol) in the presence of suction, with a small amount of evidence showing droplets taking between 30 min and 1 h to settle. Consideration should be given to infection control, areas of cleaning particularly around the patient and appropriate personal protective equipment, with particular attention to respiratory, facial and body protection for these procedures. In addition, the use of lower power settings should be considered to reduce the amount and spread of contamination.","output":"Dental periodontal procedures: a systematic review of contamination (splatter, droplets and aerosol) in relation to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Congenital heart diseases (CHDs), including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), are genetically complex and poorly understood. Here, a multidisciplinary platform was established to functionally evaluate novel CHD gene candidates, based on whole-genome and iPSC RNA sequencing of a HLHS family-trio. Filtering for rare variants and altered expression in proband iPSCs prioritized 10 candidates. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in healthy human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and in developing Drosophila and zebrafish hearts revealed that LDL receptor-related protein LRP2 is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with hypoplastic heart defects, compared to patents the probands iPSC-CMs exhibited reduced proliferation. Interestingly, rare, predicted-damaging LRP2 variants were enriched in a HLHS cohort; however, understanding their contribution to HLHS requires further investigation. Collectively, we have established a multi-species high-throughput platform to rapidly evaluate candidate genes and their interactions during heart development, which are crucial first steps toward deciphering oligogenic underpinnings of CHDs, including hypoplastic left hearts.","output":"Patient-specific genomics and cross-species functional analysis implicate LRP2 in hypoplastic left heart syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the Wuhan pandemic spread to India, more than lakhs of population were affected with COVID-19 with varying severities.

As orally transmitted viruses, densoviruses, are also challenged by the complexity of the insect gut barriers, more specifically by the chitinous peritrophic matrix, that lines and protects the midgut epithelium; how capsids stick to and cross these barriers to reach their final cell destination where replication goes has been poorly studied in insects. Here, we analyzed the early interaction of the Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) with the midgut barriers of caterpillars from the pest Spodoptera frugiperda. Using combination of imaging, biochemical, proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we examined in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo the early interaction of the capsids with the peritrophic matrix and the consequence of early oral infection on the overall gut function. We show that the JcDV particle rapidly adheres to the peritrophic matrix through interaction with different glycans including chitin and glycoproteins, and that these interactions are necessary for oral infection. Proteomic analyses of JcDV binding proteins of the peritrophic matrix revealed mucins and non-mucins proteins including enzymes already known to act as receptors for several insect pathogens. In addition, we show that JcDV early infection results in an arrest of N-Acetylglucosamine secretion and a disruption in the integrity of the peritrophic matrix, which may help viral particles to pass through. Finally, JcDV early infection induces changes in midgut genes expression favoring an increased metabolism including an increased translational activity. These dysregulations probably participate to the overall dysfunction of the gut barrier in the early steps of viral pathogenesis. A better understanding of early steps of densovirus infection process is crucial to build biocontrol strategies against major insect pests.","output":"Interaction of a Densovirus with Glycans of the Peritrophic Matrix Mediates Oral Infection of the Lepidopteran Pest Spodoptera frugiperda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a systematic literature review and bibliometric analyses of Scopus-indexed documents in social media analytics in health during the CoVid-19 pandemic that used artificial intelligence methodologies.

Earlier studies on message framing in the health sector have often focused on the effectiveness of framing in terms of behaviour change and decision making. Much less attention has been paid to the influence of message framing on the emotional responses of the recipients. This neglected aspect is extremely important particularly at times of crises because health care professionals wish to persuade the public to comply with their health advice without causing unnecessary anxiety. The current study examined the effect of message framing on the affect of Arabic-speaking Saudi nationals and residents of Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 lockdown. The effect of message outcome/severity and the recipients' age/levels of depression and anxiety was also investigated. Materials & methods. A total of 348 participants of three age groups completed the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1996) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al., 1983), and rated the positivity of 48 COVID-19 health messages of different framing along a 6-point Likert scale. Results. The results showed a strong effect of message framing and severity and the recipients' age on the recipients' emotional responses. A limited influence for message outcome was also noted. Conclusions. It is recommended to use gain framed health messages to the public in order to avoid anxiety and maintain their positive affect. This is particularly recommended with younger adults whose affect gets negatively impacted by loss-framed messages quite easily. Loss-framed messages are recommended for in severe situations that have desirable outcomes.","output":"COVID-19 Health Communication: Key Moderators of Message Framing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An acceleration index is proposed as a novel indicator to track the dynamics of the COVID-19 iin real-time. Using French data on confirmed cases and tests for the period following the first lock-down - from May 13, 2020, onwards - our acceleration index shows that the ongoing pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers the fact that the pandemic acceleration has been stronger than national average for the [59 ? 68] and [69 ? 78] age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19 ? 28] age group is the lowest and is about half that of the [69 ? 78], as of October 25. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French dpartements, based on both the acceleration of the pandemic and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs significantly from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France enters a secondlock-down period with indeterminate duration.","output":"Tracking the Dynamics and Allocating Tests for COVID-19 in Real-Time: An Acceleration Index with an Application to French Age Groups and Dpartements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has the potential to impact the health of individuals experiencing food insecurity and reduced food access. A national collaboration examined this impact across the United States, including Utah. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of COVID-19 on perceived food access challenges, barriers, and compensatory strategies among SNAP-eligible Utahns. A 76-item survey was emailed to all SNAP-eligible Utahns (N = 24,763) in July 2020. The USDA's 6-item Food Security Module was used to determine food security prior to and since COVID-19. Additional questions asked about food access and eating/purchasing behaviors. Participants (n = 521) were predominately White (75%) females (77%). Level of agreement for using compensatory food access strategies was summed (score range: 7-42;higher scores reflecting increased use) and assessed for mean differences using ANOVA based on food insecurity classification. Rating scales were used to measure food access challenges and barriers to using nutrition assistance (4-5 item scales) during COVID-19. Spearman correlations examined associations between challenges/barriers and degree of food insecurity. Of participants (n = 358) who were food insecure, 74% were White and 77% were female. Food insecure individuals prior to and since COVID-19 were more likely than food secure participants to use compensatory strategies to ensure food affordability during COVID-19 (mean score = 30 vs 26, respectively;P = 0.002). Degree of food insecurity was associated with barriers to using nutrition assistance, including difficulty traveling to apply/recertify (r = 0.24;P &lt; 0.001) and frequency of experiencing food access challenges during COVID-19 (r = 0.16-0.33;P  0.002). Challenges with food access and barriers to utilizing nutrition assistance during COVID-19 are associated with food insecurity among SNAP-eligible individuals, potentially resulting in reliance upon more compensatory food affordability strategies. Efforts should be taken to minimize these barriers to ensure adequate food quantity and quality among food insecurity individuals. Utah State University Extension.
